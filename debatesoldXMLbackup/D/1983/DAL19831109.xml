Today I see the question on the Order Paper as Question No. 1 to the Taoiseach.  I thought it would be of help to the Taoiseach before going to see the British Prime Minister to have had the matter discussed.  Last week you allowed a motion on the culling of seals.  One might ask which is the more important: the culling of seals or the culling of people?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>When we adjourned this debate yesterday I was talking about the spending of money by this organisation and the accounts of projects which the money was being spent on.  It is interesting to note that in 1980, 80 per cent of Ireland's development loans went to countries with very low capital incomes. By low capital incomes we are talking about £475, that is £400 per annum so it does not take much imagination to realise how difficult it is to survive on that kind of income.  So 80 per cent of the IDA's development loans in 1980 went to countries with a low <i>per capita</i> income as opposed to 34 per cent of the bilateral aid money going into these countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite criticism that may be levelled at these very large, multilateral organisations, the money is going to the countries that need it most.  We have heard that approximately 131 countries are members of IDA, about 22 are Part I members and about 109 are Part II member countries.  About nine of these Part II countries are developing countries themselves but they have now progressed to the stage where they themselves can <Col N="1764" /> become donors to this fund.  All the other countries who are Part II members give small subscriptions to become members in order that they may benefit from raising loans from IDA.</P>
    <P>For example, Bangladesh have paid a very small percentage to become a member of IDA, but in 1983 alone they got accrued credits of approximately £367 million in approved loans for a very wide range of projects.  Bangladesh is a country in which many Irish people are interested, especially through the work of our Concern volunteers.  The kind of projects that were approved for financing in 1983 included agricultural and rural development, the sinking of wells, transportation, education, business management education and training projects.</P>
    <P>Perhaps on the surface these projects may not immediately get approval from the general public because they do not think they are getting to the root cause of the problems people have, but if we do not build up structures and institutions in these least developed countries they will not be able to use the capital and the loans that are being given to help the people ultimately to sustainable development. Telecommunications, public administration, industry, energy efficiency, refining, rehabilitation projects and a wide range of agricultural and rural development to the tune of £100 million has been approved in 1983.  Therefore, we can see that by being members of this organisation, these countries by a very small membership fee, as it were, can draw on these concessionary loans which have a 50-year repayment period.  The emphasis in the IDA in the last few years is very welcome when we see that they are beginning to recognise that the emphasis early on in their life was perhaps not always what was best for the countries.</P>
    <P>At present £30 billion is available and pledged to IDA.  One must question why these vast sums of money do not appear to be improving the least-developed countries because there is no doubt that in the last two or three years the situation of the people in these countries has not improved; if anything the gap is widening between the rich and poor countries.  I <Col N="1765" /> asked yesterday why 80 per cent of the wealth of the world still rests in the hands of 10 per cent of the world population.</P>
    <P>This debate gives us an opportunity to look a little bit more deeply at the thrust of the North-South dialogue.  In the last few years, unfortunately, the North-South dialogue, which is the dialogue between the countries of the developed world and the South, known as the developing or Third World countries, has been changing to an East-West axis, more so in the last few months when we see the East-West axis of all the discussions relating to Nicaragua and the most recent invasion in Grenada.  This is a very serious situation and the main powers must consider it very carefully.  The North-South dialogue received an impetus at a meeting in Mexico in 1980 and global negotiations were to take place to try to set up a new international economic order.  That is the thrust of these discussions, because paying moneys to groups like IDA is not enough.  It is not enough for the big, industrialised countries to write cheques and to think that that discharges their responsibilities to the Third World.</P>
    <P>The proposal for these global negotiations on all issues relating to raw materials, energy, trade, development, money and finance came about at a meeting in Mexico in 1980.  However, nothing much has happened since then.  The developing countries have seen these proposals as a logical progression of the demand for a new international economic order and they had hoped they would be the start of progress aimed at renegotiating these post-war economic settlements.  Unfortunately, I am sure they are very disappointed and disheartened at the lack of progress because I do not think any of the developed countries had their hearts in the agreement to have these global negotiations.  The lengthy series of discussions and negotiations have failed to produce any kind of coherent and integrated philosophy.  Politically, it was felt that perhaps all you had to do was to keep talking, to give an indication that there was some will there.  Talking at the end of the day will not solve the problems nor, unfortunately, will vast sums of <Col N="1766" /> money pumped into various projects because if the will is not there the answers that the least developed countries are looking for will not come.</P>
    <P>When President Reagan assumed office in January 1981 the assumption that dialogue could continue was questioned and he agreed that the Third World development remained a crucial and abiding concern of Western governments. However, the US policy derived from a very different political and economic interpretation of the situation from that accepted by Washington for the two previous administrations.  If one is accused of perhaps dwelling overly on the role that the USA have to play in the new economic order, then it is perhaps a valid criticism that the USA, because of their size and the power they hold, must, of necessity, be the main instigator in discussions and in the change and thrust of development in these least developed countries.</P>
    <P>It is my perception that the Reagan administration sees the North-South dialogue as unreal and a distortion of the East-West dialogue, which they feel is more important.  Naturally, one can accept that they feel threatened by the strength of the East and feel it important to protect their own borders.  If if comes to a situation where the protection of their own borders and the protection of their allies is the only reason behind their getting involved in undeveloped countries, then we are not moving anywhere and the 20 years of development progress will be for naught.  Until the Americans realise the importance of the role they have to play, no progress will be made.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it would be timely at this stage to dwell on the role that a very small country like Ireland has to play.  Recently I met an American ambassador and he said it was easy for a small country like ours to criticise a big power like America and to condemn them for some of the actions they had taken, especially in Latin America, because Ireland's bluff will never be called, to do anything about these countries.  My answer to that ambassador was, perhaps not, we have not the army, the mind, the money to <Col N="1767" /> intervene in these countries, but we have a historic concern going back over many centuries of being an oppressed nation. We have responsibility to speak out about the human rights element, about what these big factors are doing to the less developed countries.  This is where our strength lies.</P>
    <P>Ireland should be commended for the role it has played in the UN and around the world and it must continue to do this. This matter was introduced in a report submitted recently by the German counterpart of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Joint Development Co-operation. The committee system in the German Bundestag is more developed than it is here and every resolution put before the German Parliament is discussed by the committee system.  In the report submitted, Parliamentary Paper 9/1344, the emphasis they wanted to place on human rights was in the area of arms and the arms race.  One passage in that relates to the whole area of super powers.  I quote:</P>
    <P>A decisive factor governing development in the Third World countries in the eighties will also be the extent to which we succeed in creating and maintaining peace world-wide and in limiting the arms build-up.  The industrialised countries must face up to the structural changes in the world economy and show themselves willing, by changing the framework conditions of the world economy, to reduce factors which inhibit development and to co-operate actively in building up an efficient, just and social world economy.</P>
    <P>No doubt an examination of the human rights issue and the economic factors in relation to both developing countries and Germany itself has been a priority purpose to the policy that they have adopted, but I welcome the emphasis that they are now seeking to place on development, and I continue to quote:</P>
    <P>In the development co-operation of the Federal Republic of Germany, one of the main aims of Federal Government <Col N="1768" /> policy should be the non-violation of human rights.  When reaching decisions on development co-operation, the Federal Government should therefore also have regard to the non-violation of human rights as well as to social progress and social justice, in particular respect for minimum social norms and trade-union freedoms in the developing countries.  In development co-operation, preferential support should be given to countries which are endeavouring to build up democratic structures.  Within the framework of its development policy, the Federal Government's supreme goal should be to serve people.  In states where arbitrariness, intimidation and physical threats characterise the relations between the governing and the governed, the only projects, if any, which should be promoted are those which directly benefit the indigent population.</P>
    <P>I give an example of how this kind of policy has heretofore not been enacted by many Governments and agencies. Some years ago a programme in the Philippines was to create a dam which was going to dispossess and displace 100,000 of the poorest people of those countries. Many organisations were helping to fund that project, but one of our own people set out to find out exactly what was going to happen and then a number of countries and organisations, including our ESB, sent people there to see exactly what was happening.  That project was shelved &mdash; not stopped unfortunately &mdash; but a very close watch is being kept on it.</P>
    <P>I quote this example to show that some of these projects appear to be very enlightened and important and very much in line with development, but on closer examination by countries like Ireland the human rights element can be shown up and the projects can be shown, if proceeded with, to be more detrimental to the people in the countries than to abandon them would be.  In this instance people might have got water as a result of this project but they would have been people already in the cities and in order to provide them with clean water 100,000 <Col N="1769" /> of the poorest people there would be dispossessed without any effort to find alternative accommodation and shelter for them.  This is an emphasis that Ireland, because of its size, can place on development policies.</P>
    <P>This Bill gives £2 million to the IDA. The total money available to them is 13 billion dollars, and against that £2 million is a drop in the ocean.  Our commitment it to play a major part in highlighting the emphasis that must go on non-violation of human and civil rights in the projects financed by these loans.  The Reagan administration, therefore, have a major responsibility in the policy they adopt in both security and development.  It is not enough any more to continue to balance economic aid to countries against military aid.  They must look very closely at their military aid.  Small countries like Ireland can take their place at both the diplomatic and political level and make it known to the embassy people that they are aware of the growing concern being voiced about the policies being adopted particularly in Latin America and in more recent times in Grenada and emphasise that the Reagan administration should consider very seriously what they are doing.</P>
    <P>One should be able to say that there have been some positive developments since the beginning of the year.  The Brandt Report refers to the OECD and the cause of interdependence and calls on all nationalities to keep the North-South dialogue open to a large extent. The possibility of getting this dialogue going again is something about which I would have grave doubts, particularly in a recession in all industrialised countries which are concerned with dealing with their own problems.  I add a cautionary note.  It would be easy for us here to forego that commitment.  We have to consider our bilateral programmes.  At the same time we have not much say in multilateral aid.  We are more or less tied into that as a member of the UN and the EEC.  Whether we like it or not, we cannot really get out of that unless we give up our commitments, which will not happen. The danger is that we might well forego or reduce some of our bilateral aid <Col N="1770" /> programmes, which would be a very grave step, even given our present shortage of finance.  That would be an irresponsible action which in the long run would be of no great benefit to our own poor.  It would be a lessening of our commitment to those who are so low down on the poverty scale that their needs are immeasurable.  That the UNCTAD Sixth Meeting did not break down but produced a modest body of work is considered a relative success by our EEC partners in the North-South high level group. There was a danger that nothing would come out of that meeting but as long as these groups keep talking they keep a world perspective.  Until we ensure that world perspective we will not get the development and the evening out of the world's natural resources and wealth.</P>
    <P>All countries, developed and developing, are being forced, because of the present financial and trading realities, to adopt necessary domestic adjustments. The task facing Ireland, a country with a constructive and open-minded approach to the problem of development, is to ensure that the process of adaptation does not give rise to unacceptable burdens, particularly for the least developed countries, but acts to mitigate, to the extent which our influence will permit, the worst side effects of the present world recession.  Bad as may be the effects of the recession here, one cannot imagine the situation in countries whose development is so low that they are continuously in a state of depression.  If this debate does nothing else but set down a marker for the job which our Ministers are doing at the moment, preparing our Estimates and getting ready for our budget, then it is a timely debate.  It is highlighting the need to continue our programmes here, to seek out injustices and not be afraid to speak out even against countries and governments with which we have a good relationship.  We have that responsibility and must have the courage to continue to speak out as heretofore in the fora of the United Nations and the EEC.</P>
    <P>I reiterate my call to the Minister for Finance who attends the annual World Bank meeting to continue to examine <Col N="1771" /> closely the areas where International Development Association money is being spent.  The real purpose of this Bill is to highlight this organisation which is part of the World Bank.  The Minister must continue to monitor and not just rubberstamp the projects on which the loans granted to the least developed countries are spent.  A time will thus come when we will not need legislation such as this because these organisations will eventually become obsolete as loan organisations and will be just supportive groups and the day will come when we will no longer have least developed countries, but developed countries with different types of government all working in close harmony.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be relatively brief.  I congratulate the last speaker on her speech here this morning and on her appointment as Development Aid Committee chairperson.</P>
      <P>Some time ago, we had a meeting with the American Ambassador, Peter Dailey, after which I wrote congratulating him on his openness and frankness and his ability to enter into dialogue with us and treat us, not as a second or third rate nation, but as a first rate nation, as an equal.  I have had considerable difficulties with the Americans because of various aspects of their policy, particularly in Central America and the Philippines. Nonetheless, they are frank, free and open enough to invite us to discuss those differences, to put their points of view and to let us put ours.  That is something from which other nations could learn a lot &mdash; nations not a million miles away from us, either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put on record that people have accused me of being anti-American. However, as Deputy Owen has said, this approach is not anti-American, it is pro the American people.  It is pro the concept of American freedom, the old concept of free speech and liberty.  I want to make that absolutely clear.  The United States, being such a large country, so diverse in its politics, religions and economy, has obviously made major errors in foreign policy.  It is not unfair to <Col N="1772" /> say that many in Europe consider President Reagan as probably one of the most frighteningly reactionary Presidents the United States has ever produced.</P>
    <P>President Carter began a campaign for human rights and developed them so finely and with such dedication that in Central America the 45-year-old most awful dictatorship in Nicaragua fell because he withdrew support.  He also withdrew support from EI Salvador and just before the elections was in the process of vetoing any military support there. Unfortunately, he did not win the election and Reagan took over.  The policy in Central America instantly changed, as it did in South West Africa and Namibia. The position under the Carter regime of government in these areas was very similar to that in Central America.  His campaign for human rights and the long drawn out battle for the independence of Namibia from the awful brutality of the white fascists in South Africa was making progress for the first time.  The South African whites realised that Carter might well not win the election and the indications at the time were that he would not. They put the matter of Namibia on the long finger.  Immediately on President Reagan's accession, he reversed the whole process on human rights development in America but did not reverse the process of new thinking within the American churches, Protestant, Catholic and the missionaries.  That process is embedded in the American people as a result of President Carter.  The American House of Representatives has consistently taken a liberal and sincere approach to finding a real solution to the situation in Namibia and Central America.  Unfortunately, the whole horrible position there is quite easily misrepresented by those who wish to do so.</P>
    <P>In our support for human rights and justice throughout the world, not just in the American dominated sphere, but in the Soviet dominated sphere, we have a campaign for the human rights of Soviet Jews and have sought relief for the Franciscans persecuted in Czechoslovakia &mdash; with some success, I might add, but this is not published.  It is of no consequence really when we succeed in some small <Col N="1773" /> way.  I just want to make that absolutely clear because this is my first opportunity to address this House on the matter of development aid and related topics.</P>
    <P>There is nowhere in the world where there is not some conflict, some difficulty, some problem.  We have the situation not 100 miles away in Northern Ireland where there is difficulty and conflict and so we cannot be the first to pontificate but as a small nation we must take our responsibilities seriously.  Certainly the approach being taken on the issue of development aid by successive Governments has been reasonably good.  In the group of richest nations we are one of the poorest and I do not believe we can go any further or any quicker than the Government are going.  The Department as a whole have done a very good job. There is room for some criticism.  The concentration of development aid in two or three countries is not necessarily a good thing perhaps but I have not enough information at my disposal to say definitely that it is or it is not.</P>
    <P>The Department under successive Ministers have taken the whole issue of development aid very seriously indeed. Yesterday I spoke to a member of the United Nations in Geneva who expressed concern that Ireland was not putting enough money into development aid in the Third World generally.  While I agree, and while I would like to see a great deal more money being spent, as a small nation we are not necessarily in a position to send the kind of money we would like to.  We must adopt a different perspective. We must make our position as a neutral nation felt.  At the United Nations our position must be quite clear on issues such as the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the United States invasion of Grenada.  There is no valid reason for North Americans to be in Grenada any more than there was any valid reason for the USSR to invade Afghanistan.  It is well known that when super powers invade some area they very rarely leave that area and not in my lifetime will Afghanistan be free from the influence of the Soviet Union and not in my lifetime <Col N="1774" /> will Grenada be free from the influence of the United States of America.</P>
    <P>There are many areas throughout the world to which we could encourage voluntary workers to go.  Actually when voluntary workers go overseas we give them very little assistance.  When they return home they are entitled to nothing.  They lose all their increments.  They lose their social welfare entitlements.  They have no transition period at home having worked in Africa, Asia, Central and Latin America. Restoring their entitlements to them would be a small thing.  When they return to Ireland we should provide them with some kind of social assistance until such time as they find work.  That would be a relatively small gesture we could make to these people.</P>
    <P>There is increasing awareness here of the necessity of taking a strong moral position on the whole issue of development aid, human rights and nuclear arms. The centre in Summerhill has developed something particularly interesting in the sense that it is working right in the heart of the most deprived and depressed areas in the country.  It has now opened a Third World centre and is providing a greater comprehension between the people in the most deprived areas of our country by forming a link between them and the people in Africa and Asia and elsewhere throughout the world.  Their work deserves great credit and great encouragement. It would be no harm if the Minister and others acknowledged the kind of work these people are doing.</P>
    <P>The Minister made an excellent speech in Tipperary town.  The peace festival there was a very important one.  It broadened the base of our understanding and gave us an opportunity of travelling into rural Ireland to talk about the issues. They had a tremendous comprehension of what we were doing.  There was no criticism from the audience.  The conference dealt with an important matter of vital interest.  It was a wonderful development. It is not simply Dublin, or Cork, or Galway, or Limerick for that matter which are taking an interest.  It is small groups in rural areas who are taking an interest in development aid and human rights and the whole issue of nuclear arms <Col N="1775" /> and peace.  As I say, it was highly successful and I am glad now to be able to put on the record of the House my congratulations. I hope other small towns throughout the country will follow the example given.</P>
    <P>We live on an island.  If we want to go to mainland Europe or Asia we have to take a boat or a plane and, from that point of view, it is somewhat difficult for us to comprehend what is happening in the world outside.  We are relatively isolated and possibly somewhat introverted. It is possible we may consider our position as one of righteousness but our people have always responded to Concern and Trócaire.  They have responded generously to all the organisations interested in the Third World and I would like to pay tribute here to all those organisations which have heightened awareness among the people, not just in Dublin but throughout the country, of conditions in the Third World.  I hope that process will continue.  I wish it every success.  We are all aware of the appalling situation where each day upwards of 14,000 children die of starvation, malnutrition, disease and pestilence while simultaneously billions of pounds are being spent in developing new arms.</P>
    <P>Is it not reasonable to refer to the insanity of the nuclear arms race which is continuing and besetting Europe more than any other region in the world with Pershing and Cruise missiles and SS 21s, 22s, 23s?  Europe is the focal point.  The last war on American territory was the American Civil War.  In the Soviet Union they had the Napoleonic War and the crucifixion of the First and Second World Wars.  They are paranoid, and very distrustful of the western world, and not without legitimate reason.  We should also be cautious in our approach to them. The fact of the matter is that, rather than pointing their nuclear weapons at each other across Alaska and Siberia, Europe will be the disaster area once again.  The major cities in the East and West&mdash;Washington, New York, Moscow and Leningrad&mdash;will survive.  We will be the victims of the nuclear arms race.  People are <Col N="1776" /> dying daily in their thousands from malnutrition and from starvation while this insanity continues.</P>
    <P>Is there any greater argument for the fact that we should sustain and develop our neutrality so that we can have a real say in the United Nations?  Our voice would be heard in Geneva, in Brussels, in the EEC and in the Council of Europe. Our position is acknowledged.  We are open and honest about our neutrality.  It is an honest neutrality, not a phoney neutrality. When the Americans invaded Grenada we said: &ldquo;Maybe it is right or maybe it is wrong.  They are our friends and we will not do anything about it&rdquo;, but when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan we supported the various sanctions.  Our condemnation of brute force should be general, whether it is brute force in Grenada or Afghanistan. We should take a close look at what we mean by neutrality.</P>
    <P>I do not want to live in any society other than the western society.  I find it an acceptable society.  It is free and open and as good a democratic system as it is possible to find for my needs and the needs of the Irish people.  We have an obligation to make our voice heard more strongly at the United Nations and throughout the world in general, always emphasising the need for justice and peace.</P>
    <P>I do not want to leave the House today without referring to the many Irish women who have made their voices heard in Greenham Common.  Some have been arrested and some have been attacked by the armed forces and the police.  I understand that the British Minister for Defence, Mr. Heseltine, has indicated that some of them may well be shot if they intervene in Greenham Common.  I admire those women.  I encourage them and I hope they will continue to express their distaste for the developments in Europe.</P>
    <P>I want to refer again to Central America. Grenada has been attacked.  Next we may find Nicaragua being attacked.  I want to say this, and I can say it from my heart because I have certain information. If the blockade of Nicaragua is the beginning of the invasion of Nicaragua, it will <Col N="1777" /> not be like Grenada.  In Grenada some of the elements of the invasion appear to have been welcomed.  In a small nation of 110,000 or 120,000 people not surprisingly there were bitter divisions and some people appear to have welcomed the Americans.  They will not be welcomed in Nicaragua.  There will be a holocaust there.  It will not end there.  What is happening in Nicaragua cannot be defeated. It will spread throughout Latin America, and the peace and stability of the region will be in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>Rather than continuing to harass the Government in Nicaragua in the way they are doing, the Americans should do what they did in Europe after the war, that is, provide humanitarian aid.  Marshall Aid prevented the taking over of western Europe by forces which were not friendly to our way of thinking.  What the Americans are doing is a disaster.  It reverses all the efforts President Carter made to restore human rights to the masses of the people in that area.</P>
    <P>I want to pay tribute to the Minister of State for his genuine and sincere commitment to this region.  I want to pay tribute to his staff.  They are committed people and they are doing a very good job.  There is much that we can talk about later on the whole issue of development aid.  I hope the Department will create more awareness of these problems among the Irish people.  In our schools and colleges we should teach the necessity for what we are doing.  We should not just provide slide shows of the wonderful work Ireland is doing, like a General Motors advertising campaign for the Department.  We need a campaign to make people aware of what is happening. With checks and balances the problem of starvation and hunger in the world could be solved.  I was in University College recently and the Third World Aid Society had a few bits of paper to hand out.  I do not blame the Department of Foreign Affairs for that, but I blame the young third level students for not having more than little bits of paper to hand out to students they were trying to recruit into the Third World societies.  I said so to them.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by congratulating the <Col N="1778" /> Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, on the work he is doing.  I hope he will continue to press his senior Minister for more funds, more support and a more enlightened and less subservient attitude to the United States or any other State. Let us act independently as a neutral nation having regard to the awful developments which are taking place in the world today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few words about this Bill which mentions in the explanatory memorandum Part I and Part II Members, Ireland being a Part II Member.  I would like the Minister in his reply to outline the precise difference between Part I and Part II Members because this point is not clear.</P>
      <P>The special contribution that gives rise to this Bill is part of a rescue operation which arises from a change of heart on the part of the American Congress. Action taken by the American Congress, perhaps without recognising that there would be a spin-off action, has resulted in other member states having to pick up a certain amount of slack.  In this regard the Irish contribution of a little over $2 million or.11 of 1 per cent of the total contribution to the funds used by the IDA, is not an enormous contribution but is a recognition of our commitment to the work of the IDA.  If every country was to meet its commitment to the emerging nations the International Development Association are trying to help, the world would be a better place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is realistic to say that future economic problems for this country are not likely to arise so much from an international recession, or wage increases at home, or international war, so much as perhaps flash-points at certain relative points throughout the world, for instance the Suez Canal where certain raw materials and essential goods may be delayed. As well as a commitment to the poorer countries, the emerging states, and as well as an intellectual and humanitarian commitment, we have a certain amount of self-interest in being committed to the objectives of the International Development Association.  We cannot, in isolation, say that we hold what we have and <Col N="1779" /> we are going to ignore the rampant poverty that exists in some of these countries which the IDA are helping to help themselves. The objectives of the IDA are very worthy.  They commit about $3½ billion to help states, some small and some very large, like Brazil and China, to overcome economic difficulties and local difficulties, increase the economic viability of the state, and improve the quality of life for the citizens of that state. They help to create a better life for us by ensuring that there is peace in the world and that poorer states which develop certain necessary commodities are not held back because these commodities are needed in the western world.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the IDA developing. It is now in its 23rd year and there are over 130 member countries.  Not all the countries of the western world who could contribute to the development of the IDA do so.  Some 90 per cent of the association's lending goes to countries with a <i>per capita</i> income of $475 or less and, according to the Minister's speech, interest free loans for 50 years with capital repayments starting after ten years are made to these countries.  That is a very significant contribution and a very significant amount of money for a world organisation to make available for to help the poorer States.</P>
    <P>The IDA is one of three international financial organisations in the World Bank group &mdash; the World Bank itself and the International Finance Corporation, founded in 1956 are the other two.  The World Bank has a very strong reputation dating back to the end of the second world war in developing stability within the economies not just of the western world but of the world generally, and in later years of trying to transfer some of the wealth in the western world to the less well off countries.  That is a very worthy objective, which we, as a smaller state, should seek to develop.  We should try to persuade the new superpowers to take their responsibilities more seriously by contributing to this development.  I understand membership of the association is open to all members of the World Bank, but not all have joined.  Not all <Col N="1780" /> countries are members of the World Bank.  This means a very large number of countries are not taking their responsibilities seriously.  I wonder if through the IDA we could not persuade other countries to look at the good work being done by the International Development Association and persuade them to get involved by making a contribution as well.</P>
    <P>The association, like the bank and the corporation, make money available to help support high priority projects which foster economic developments in the developing world.  The bulk of these projects, over 40 per cent in value terms over the period 1977-82, are in the agricultural and rural development areas and are aimed directly at improving the lot of the poorest sections of the population in the countries involved.  That is the type of objective we should be hoping the EEC would take towards some of the regions in Ireland, particularly having regard to the current debate on the super-levy.  The rural and agricultural problems being faced by the Third World are very extreme but relative to the European situation we can relate to the kind of difficulties these people are facing, albeit at a much different level.</P>
    <P>Basic infrastructure, urbanisation of population, water supply, and industry projects have taken up most of the work of the IDA since its creation.  It cannot be denied that this sort of peaceful involvement of western, mostly nonaligned, countries is a very worthy association which should commend itself to greater commitment.  There is a very worthy association which should commend itself to greater commitment.  There is a long list of borrowing members of the IDA &mdash; Afghanistan, India, Kenya, Yemen Arab Republic, Sudan and Sri Lanka.  None of these countries can be said to be taking the IDA for a ride.  All are greatly in need of assistance.</P>
    <P>According to a World Bank publication <i>IDA in Retrospect:</i></P>
    <P>The international Development Association (IDA) was established over 20 years ago to provide concessional assistance to low income countries. Its origins lay in the recognition <Col N="1781" /> that, for many of the poorest countries, private capital and existing aid arrangements were not adequate.  The World Bank, which has led the multilateral aid effort after World War II could not lend to the poorest countries without damaging its own credit position in international capital markets. Furthermore, the low income countries could ill afford to take on loans carrying high interest rates and short maturities to finance projects with long pay-back periods and earning little or no foreign exchange.  India became a particular problem in the late 1950s, when its ambitious development plans were thwarted by a rising debt burden and growing food shortages.</P>
    <P>It can be seen that the IDA, far from being the wing of any particular political philosophy, is an independent group which has grown out of a certain post World War II necessity.  During its first 22 years the IDA committed $27 billion to finance 1,300 projects in 78 countries. That speaks for itself.</P>
    <P>Some of the projects assisted by the IDA include $100 million to Bangladesh to increase agricultural production, $20 million to Benin for rural development, $35 million, a relatively small amount, to China where more than 440 tonnes of grain and soya beans can now be produced annually as a result.  That relates to what I said earlier about our self-interest in ensuring that the association is properly developed.  We have a type of smug feeling in Ireland that we are part of the western economy.  We are told from time to time that in the terms of GNP and national income we are not doing well compared to our European neighbours.  We should remember that within a decade our country has developed at such a rate that it is hardly recognisable. That does not take into consideration the fact that we have a terrible unemployment problem and that certain people are still suffering.  However, in terms of consumer goods there is no doubt but that we have been riding high for the past ten years.  Relative to some of the countries in the Third World some of our problems are not problems at all. <Col N="1782" /> That does not mean that we should not strive to sort out some of our problems, and unemployment and housing are our most serious.</P>
    <P>However, there are problems which people manufacture and purport to consider as problems but we all know they are not problems at all.  Most of our problems are brought about by greed on the part of us all.  Everybody wants a better shake all the time.  I do not know how we give the lead in sorting this problem out. Some may say that had we not taken our 19 per cent increase last week we would have given a lead but we did not take it for more than two years and nobody followed. I do not see how people would follow now.</P>
    <P>If we were to say that everybody should make a sacrifice right across the board for some good reason, I believe we could remove this national greed and erase some of our problems.  Our problems are not great compared to those of Third World countries and those of other countries in need of economic development. We must continue to strive for a fair distribution of the wealth that exists here and ensure that our resources are used to eliminate the remaining relative poverty that exists in regard to housing and unemployment.</P>
    <P>We take for granted the fact that we are now a part of this economic entity but what of the change that has taken place through the last century?  What of the changes that are constantly taking place? If one looks at a map of Europe for 1862 and one for 1922 one will see the way places like Austria, Ireland and the states of Italy have changed.  Those states have lost their economic independence and power and become a unit competing against France and other countries.  In 1860 that would not have been thought possible.  There has been a change in the boundary between East and West and some countries have become poorer while others have become wealthier.</P>
    <P>We are taking for granted a situation which may not last.  For instance, in South Korea where there is a low wage/high production economy the economy is lifting off.  We should also consider the way Japan has developed in the last 25 years. <Col N="1783" /> It may be that the change will bring an emphasis on developing Asian countries rather than on European economies and that we at some time in the future will find ourselves looking to those countries for assistance.  That will be the case if we do not mark our cards properly, show more restraint and be more pragmatic when dealing with our affairs. Already there is a big movement in Asia and a great economic lift.  We must ask those countries to join us and accept their responsibility to other developing countries seriously so that we do not find ourselves in the future in the position of some of the emerging countries.  Some people think that there is no such thing as going back, that all we can do is go forward and that the more one has the more one can get and develop but that is not necessarily always the case.  If we are not careful we are going to price ourselves out of the market to such an extent that we will have to look to the IDA for assistance rather than being a member of that organisation giving assistance to other countries.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the question of neutrality and of how this relates to our economic contributions to other countries. The word &ldquo;neutral&rdquo; is a very peculiar one.  I believe the late President Kennedy asked if a nation can be neutral between tyranny and liberty or can an individual be neutral between tyranny and liberty and my answer is that one cannot be neutral between tyranny and liberty.  Our problem is identifying who the tyrants are.  Some tyrants stand out but others are not as easily identified.  In making money available through the IDA we must be careful not to fund tyrannical regimes who oppress their people.  We should be selective.  While the IDA is providing money to Uganda I do not see why it should have provided money to an Idi Amin-led Uganda, to prop up a tyrant who would hardly use the funds in the best interests of the people.  We will have to be sure that the money being spent by the association is not propping up tyrants in various parts of the world.  If we cannot be neutral in individual cases, can we be neutral at all? <Col N="1784" /> What are we neutral for?  What are we neutral against?  This is the subject of a question I have tabled and I will pursue the matter when it is reached but I believe that as providers of economic benefits &mdash; in this case more than £2 million &mdash; to other countries we have a right to ensure we are not providing funds to undesirable people.</P>
    <P>Why is it that The Workers' Party do not have a representative in the House for this debate?  For all the legislation that has been introduced and at Question Time daily those Members jump up claiming their party right and the ridiculous Standing Order prevents 70 Members on this side having the same right to contribute as those two Deputies.  Why is it they are not present to discuss the IDA?  Is it because the Soviet Union are not taking their responsibilities to the international communities seriously? What is the reason for their lack of interest in this debate?  Are they interested only in the red emerging states?  It is time we asked questions about this. Where are the so-called friends of the poor who have motions on the Order Paper every day?  The only poor they are interested in are those under the red flag in various parts of the world but there is no interest in the needs of anyone else.</P>
    <P>What is the contribution of the Soviet Union and its satellite states?  Its contribution has been Afghanistan, Poland and Czechoslovakia.  It was the Soviet Union who attempted the first takeover in Grenada, yet everyone has been screaming and calling blue murder about the American-invited invasion of Grenada. What about the first attempt by Marxist extremists, supported by Cuba, to overthrow the regime?  There has not been a mention of that.  If the Americans had shot down 269 innocent people in a jumbo, embassies from Dublin to New Delhi would be burned.  Two standards are applied.</P>
    <P>We must be clear about who are the tyrants.  Where there is tyranny in other democratic states we will have to try to eliminate that tyranny.  However, how can one work with a state that has a wall built round it as in the case of East <Col N="1785" /> Germany to keep in its citizens?  How can one compare that situation with the United States?  A lot of emotional nonsense is spoken on this subject.  It is probably good for getting oneself on chat shows but when considered impartially there is no comparison between the Soviet Union and what it does and the actions of the United States.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the United States on the stand it has taken economically since the Marshall Plan and its general stance in helping democracies.  However, America should not waste its goodwill by throwing its weight around in Central America. All of us who are committed to open democratic States&mdash;there are very few of them in the world but we are one of them&mdash;should tell the United States that we support their general objectives so far as democracy is concerned but we will not have anything to do with their throwing their weight around in Central America. They should be warned they are only playing into the hands of the real tyrants. That is what we should tell the United States, particularly considering all the talk about Nicaragua and Grenada.</P>
    <P>I wish to say a few words about the peace movements and the national bodies who help overseas such as Trócaire, Pax Christi and St. Vincent de Paul, a society who do valuable work at home and also in countries overseas.  Those bodies should be given due recognition. It is not always possible for us to give them funds and in any event I do not think it is a good plan to supplant voluntary work.  We should give a few words of encouragement and thanks to those who work for peace, justice and economic development throughout the world.</P>
    <P>In comparison with under-developed countries we are doing very well but we also have great poverty.  To people who propose certain taxes and oppose other taxes and some who describe themselves as representatives of stake-holders in our society, I ask them to think of the needy at home and abroad who also need help. Many of those needy people do not have their own homes and are lucky if they have a local authority flat.  While we have commitments to the international community <Col N="1786" /> we also have commitments to those at home and in particular to those who have no stake in our society.  There are dreadful housing and unemployment problems in this city and throughout the country and we cannot forget that.  State aid and private funds do not get to the most needy.  There must be planned action so that the better off will be aware of their responsibilities to the less privileged in our community.</P>
    <P>The appointment of Minister of State for Overseas Development was excellent. That may not get much publicity in the national or provincial press but the appointment is an important one.  I hope the Minister of State will develop that office and will try to persuade our friends in the EEC to take a deeper interest in helping emerging states in the Third World.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to the debate for a variety of reasons.  It was during my time as Minister for Finance that the sixth replenishment to the International Development Association was made.  As a consequence of the adjustments that have to be made having regard to the American contribution, this legislation comes before the Dáil today.</P>
      <P>In the first instance I wish to address myself to the general international economic situation and the impact that has on those who benefit most directly by way of the International Development Association, namely, the LDCs&mdash;the least developed countries.  If the developed countries were to think only in selfish terms they would quickly come to the conclusion that the international recovery, signs of which are emerging, will not become a reality and will not be substained unless we can create the capacity in what are called the developing countries to generate economic activity not just for their own advantage but in terms of our selfish interests as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a major shift in the economic world order in the last decade. While that has been occurring, unfortunately there has been one constant element: that the least developed countries have remained the least developed and <Col N="1787" /> the gap between them and the developed countries, the club we joined in 1973, has widened, obviously because of developments in regard to oil supplies and the growth in the economic and political power of the oil suppliers and the dependence of other countries such as us, but particularly the least developed countries, on oil.</P>
    <P>One of the consequences of that major shift in the international economic order has been to render chronic what were acute problems in the least developed countries.  That is why this Bill should be seen not as a continuing contribution on our part to the rights &mdash; that is what they are &mdash; of the least developed countries but as a clear recognition that we will not get balanced world economic development unless we realise that the developing countries have a major contribution to make to that balanced international economic order.</P>
    <P>The international economic depression that we are emerging from &mdash; it may not be so clear in Ireland &mdash; has been a consequence of the growth of the petro-currency countries and of the fiscal decisions of some major developed countries, particularly the US and to a certain extent the UK and others.  They pursue policies that may seem right in their own jurisdictions. The US has a self-contained economy because approximately 80 per cent of its resources are produced in its own internal trade.  The US can talk about fiscal control, of reducing budget deficits, of high interest rates, all of which may be right for them but which have major repercussions for the international economy.</P>
    <P>Some of the decisions recently taken by the developed countries, particularly the US and Britain, have had damaging impacts not just on us but on the developing countries.  The strength of the dollar, in which the oil bills have to be paid, may have posed problems for Ireland but has posed almost disastrous consequences for many of the developing countries, almost all of which depend on oil. The international recession, about which to some extent we can be relatively objective &mdash; things are worse than they were <Col N="1788" /> here, a position that does not all derive from the international recession &mdash; for the developing countries means that the beginning of the process of economic development has been further postponed. The development of their infrastructure, the first vital element, has been injured very considerably and their capacity to educate for the new technological era has been hindered.</P>
    <P>To bring about the new economic world order, which will be the guarantee of world stability in the political as well as the economic sense, we must appreciate that those least developed countries must not always be cast in the role of donees of our charity and we in the role of donors of this charity, because they, too, should be equipped for the technological era.  Therefore we should gear all our programmes to helping them to develop the vast resources they have, particularly the personal resources. Much of what I have been saying must equally apply in respect of our own attempts in Ireland.</P>
    <P>We are talking about the need to make a major impact on the international economic order through the actions of bodies like the International Development Association.  Of course it is important to appreciate that we can contribute to replenishments like this but these replenishments will go only a small bit of the way to cope with the damaging consequences of political or physical decisions taken by major powers.  We are living in an interdependent world and the major countries, particularly in the EEC, have a special responsibility.  When they sit around tables talking about what is right for them in terms of disciplines, authority, controls and regulations, they must realise that some of these decisions can set back by 20 years the beginning of progress in those least developed countries. That has been happening in the last decade particularly.  We may have suffered by the energy crisis but our suffering has been nothing like the recession that has hit those other countries.  Therefore, the gap between us has been growing all the time.</P>
    <P>There are so many agencies and organisations dealing with the problems of the <Col N="1789" /> least developed countries that one of the difficulties is to co-ordinate all of the actions.  In this instance, the World Bank, through the International Development Association, has a major role in the provision of soft loans for the development of infrastructures.  Of course the contributions are never adequate.  Even in difficult times I do not think that our extra contribution of £2 million to be paid over a period of ten years will be adequate. We must look at our marketing strategy in the developed countries.  Ireland has a lot of ground to make up in this matter. We use those countries as suppliers of cheap raw materials but we also use them as major consumers of our industrial products.</P>
    <P>Those countries require agricultural development, but who supplies them with the tools and equipment for that development?  Obviously it is the developed world.  Those countries require development of their tourism, but it is the major tourism agencies of the developed world who benefit.  We look at everything in terms of the percentage we get from the stages of development of the least developed countries, but we are not linked into their problems and sufferings and privations which we become aware of only from time to time.  Their problems always are not represented by lack of food, except in famine conditions, and lack of water in drought conditions.  Their main problem is their lack of dignity and opportunity, imposed by lack of proper housing and infrastructure, but above all a lack of opportunity to be effectively independent.  Most of those countries got independence more peacefully than our experience.  However, they are not effectively independent because they are dependent in every sense on the consequences of our decisions.</P>
    <P>That is why we should not approach this Bill in the belief that we are discharging our obligations.  Through this Bill we are moving in the right direction, but the consequences of other decisions we took are damaging and would not be compensated for by this kind of action.  The Minister spoke of the Lomé Convention and the contribution of the EEC.  I was privileged during the period of our last presidency <Col N="1790" /> of the EEC to renegotiate the Lomé Convention on behalf of the EEC just as the current Taoiseach negotiated the first Lomé Convention on behalf of the EEC.  I believe it is more than likely that Ireland will again have the privilege of renegotiating the third Lomé Convention. I am not saying that just because of the coincidence of timing.  I am saying it because, as I found in our time, we have a special role &mdash; we should never overstate or understate that special role &mdash; in relations between the developed and developing countries, particularly through our participation in the EEC.</P>
    <P>It is no accident that Ireland has been involved in both of these negotiations. Most of these countries, even as they emerge from dependence, can still identify in the attitudes of the former colonial powers a kind of paternalism, a patronising attitude and also an interest in maintaining a level of preference in the markets of their countries.  You are not a colonising power for 50 years or 100 years without establishing links that will still accrue to your advantage after independence. You have people on the ground, you have agencies through which you operate and many of these countries, former colónies of Britain and France, are still linked into the economic and fiscal trading arrangements of the former colonial powers.</P>
    <P>Those people resent the dependence which was forced on them.  They may have a chip on their shoulders and they may seem to be irrational in the way they present their arguments but they are really striving for the culmination of their independence struggle.  That is the reason why they see in Ireland a country which has experienced something of the same thing and a country which has a special obligation to listen to both sides of the case.  I believe we have a special role there, in the EEC particularly, but also at the United Nations, which has been demonstrated more than once.</P>
    <P>This is what underlines our independent foreign policy.  I want to say to those who say that our partners in Europe would like to embrace us into the overriding security group of NATO that it is not in the interest of our partners in Europe to do that.  One of the things that <Col N="1791" /> is of advantage to Europe, because of our participation, is that we are seen to be independent and we are respected for that.  This can be used as a bridge between the gap between the developing and the developed countries and particularly between the western alliance and those outside of it, including ourselves.  We are seen to be independent in everything and we can create a bridge for co-operation and understanding either through the Lomé Convention or any other agency like the one we are discussing this morning. Our independent position enables us to prompt our partners in Europe about their obligations under this and at the same time act as a representative in the western world of the interests of the developing countries.  We are not subject to apprehension on their part when they look at the activities we may have in their countries.</P>
    <P>That poses opportunities and obligations for us.  It poses opportunities because at every stage in our efforts for development co-operation we worked particularly through our personnel.  We did not work by way of transfer of money but through our personnel on the ground. We did this for many reasons.  We did this because we are not too far away from the same stages of early development pains.  We may have to go through this again in many instances in the near future.  We have seen in the forties, the fifties and into the sixties what it is like to build up an infrastructure to try to develop an industrial base from a rural society, which is what many of these states are faced with as well.  We have seen all these problems and because we are so close in terms of experience and in timing we are probably a little better equipped to understand their problems and to advise in relation to a way out of them.  That means we should really have a corps of personnel available to us to maximise the opportunity in the interests of these countries where we are welcome and also in the interests of our young people, fully qualified and educated, who want to make a meaningful contribution at home and if they were given a second <Col N="1792" /> choice I believe most of them would probably choose these countries in which to do so.</P>
    <P>We should not always confine our thinking to what is happening at home in terms of opportunity for our young people.  Our state agencies, whether they be AnCO or the IDA, should start a major promotion of equipping, educating, training and preparing our young people through structures in relation to work they can undertake on the various consultancy and development projects in developing countries.  They are crying out for advice and assistance from countries like ours.  I have only to think of the number of times I met Ministers from all of those countries who have said: &ldquo;Can you send us over somebody who will talk to us about, this, that or the other?&rdquo; But sending over somebody is not the answer to it.  We must have a constant structural link with them through which we can have an Irish volunteer corps, our own latter day fianna, who will be fully equipped and trained.  If we have this we will uplift our young people at a time when they need to be uplifted.  I am just confining myself to this theme and I will not get involved in the internal economic issue at the moment as there will be many other times when I will have something to say on that.  I do not want this to be taken as telling our young people to move out.  It is far from that because I believe there is enormous scope at home.  I am not sure if our agencies are sufficiently equipped to be as effective, productive and cost efficient as they might be.  There is scope here and I believe some of them are looking at this possibility.  If they are it is important that they co-ordinate their efforts, be it the IDA, AnCO or CTT, so that we will not dissipate our efforts or minimise our capacity to provide a well equipped, well trained young population of graduates to help in these development efforts.  There is great potential for them and us there.  If we confine ourselves to the thinking of yesterday in trying to solve the problems of tomorrow I do not think we will do much for people much less do anything for those people in developing countries.  This side of the House <Col N="1793" /> will be pursuing further the role our agencies will have in the development of the co-operative effort of these countries.</P>
    <P>We have been fortunate to emerge since 1973 as a part I contributor.  We have come a long way from the problems that we experienced ourselves.  Our problems are ones of adjusting to the wealth that was generated in this country in a period of unprecedented growth &mdash; from the late fifties to the early seventies. Our problem is one of discipline as a nation but there is also the problem of priorities set by Government.  We wait for details of how we are to develop our resources.  We have potential in terms of people and terms of our resources, whether those resources be fisheries, forestry or any other area of activity.</P>
    <P>However, some other countries that were classified in 1973 as developing countries must now meet their responsibilities. I am not satisfied that they are doing that.  In some instances they are selective in their choice as to the areas to which they give support.  So far their support does not reflect sufficiently the economic power they have won.  I am referring to the oil-producing states in the Gulf.  I cannot find any reference to that aspect in the Minister's speech.  However, while the Gulf States have increased their efforts they have been the main beneficiaries of the dramatic change in the balance of economic order in the world in the past 15 years.  The poor have become poorer but some of the richer countries have also become somewhat poorer.  Those who have changed their classification are the oil-producing countries and they have a special obligation to become more involved in promoting and funding development projects.  My last direct contact with this area led me to believe that their contributions are not nearly sufficiently in line with their capacity to contribute to those who are least developed.  Within the past 15 years those oil-producing states were described as developing countries but they could not be so described now by any stretch of the imagination.</P>
    <P>Another group to which Deputy Mitchell was referring are the totalitarian countries of Eastern Europe.  Most African <Col N="1794" /> countries would acknowledge that they know in which direction to look when they reach the stage of what is called the liberation struggle.  They look east to the Soviet Union and west to her agents in Cuba.  I am not saying that the liberation struggle is not legitimate but in the matter of building on the consequence of that liberation&mdash;the long slow haul to bring these people out of their state of dependence on the rest of us&mdash;one would look a long way before finding any sign of either a Russian or a Cuban presence except in the event of there being a special political reason for such a presence.  It emerges clearly in the awareness of any of these countries, and I speak from discussions I had with them during a period of a number of years, that they have different friends at different stages.  The friends who help them to achieve their liberation by way of arms supplies and so on are not there to help them in the period that follows other than in certain conditions.  That is why it must be acknowledged that the Communist countries, to use a general tag, have shown little or no awareness of their obligations to help support in an objective and detached way the economic development efforts which underpin the political independence.  As we would have discovered here at home, political independence without the economic capacity to maintain it is of very little consequence.  It is through efforts such as our contribution to the International Development Association that we can point out to our partners in the Communist world, particularly the major powers and the Soviet Union especially, that they, too, have obligations in this area and that those obligations do not end with the supply of arms and the competition for spheres of influence.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that everything that happens on the other side, particularly in Latin-America, happens always for the right reasons.  I am not saying that there is not injustice, right-wing oppression and tyranny in many of these countries or that they should not be undermined, but I am saying that we all have equal obligations when liberation has been achieved in a country.  I have had fairly <Col N="1795" /> considerable experience in the international arena and from that experience it is clear to me that the Soviet influence does not extend to helping people to help themselves, independent of the authority of either East or West.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that we have the opportunity of making those comments today just before the renegotiation of the Lomé Convention.  Europe has an obligation in that regard which I hope will be discharged, particularly when an Irishman is President of the EEC.</P>
    <P>As we talk about emerging from the international recession we must look at the causes of that recession and at the decisions taken by the major economies, decisions which can cause recession, and, especially, we must consider the impact such a situation can have on countries such as those we are talking of.  While actions such as the one we are sanctioning today can be of assistance, they can never resolve fully the real problem.  Clearly, we have a special role and obligation; but we have also an opportunity either for our young people to involve themselves in these countries, as they would involve themselves at home, or by way of our diplomacy and our efforts, to bridge the gap between the developed and the less-developed countries of the world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. Bermingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is gratifying that this Bill has received such general and generous support from this House.  A clear message of support is evident from the speeches that have been made in supporting this special contribution which is needed to keep the International Development Association operating on a satisfactory basis.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies expressed the concern that <i>ad hoc</i> measures of this nature should be needed and they stressed the desirability of the association being financially on a sound footing.  The Government share these concerns and are hoping that the normal three-year financing basis can be achieved quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Understandably, debate on the Bill has not focussed narrowly on the activities of the association.  The Minister of State at <Col N="1796" /> the Department of Foreign Affairs and other speakers considered the association's work in the wider context of the massive problems being experienced by the poorest of the developing countries and on the question of the absolute poverty affecting hundreds of millions of people in those countries.  Obviously major efforts on many fronts will be needed to alleviate the position of these countries.  The International Development Association can continue to play a useful part in that area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lenihan referred quite appropriately to the Brandt Report in the context of this Bill.  That report stressed the interdependence between the developed and developing countries.  The association's activity in aiding the poorest of the developing countries is a very concrete expression of their interdependence in action.  I appreciate the emphasis laid by the Deputy on this aspect and support fully his views.  While the proposals of the Brandt Report may have received little attention over the past few years, when the emphasis naturally was on the immediate problems arising from the recession, its analyses and insights are invaluable and no doubt will be influential in the future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Prendergast referred to the International Monetary Fund loans.  Of course, these are completely different from those given by the International Development Association.  The International Monetary Fund provide balance of payments assistance to countries undertaking adjustment programmes.  In many cases those countries would have no alternative but to make economic adjustments even if they did not borrow from the IMF.  This is simply because they would not otherwise be able to obtain the foreign currency they require to pay for their imports.  There are often differences of view expressed as to the appropriateness of the conditions which the IMF attach to their loans.  We have always advocated flexibility on the part of the IMF.  In general it would appear that the IMF do endeavour to take account of circumstances prevailing in the countries which borrow from them. The remit of the International Development <Col N="1797" /> Association, on the other hand, is to help to finance specific investment projects.</P>
    <P>I agree fully with Deputy Owen that the association must keep under review the effectiveness of the loans they make to individual countries.  The association already have standard procedures for reviewing their lending.  That is not to say that these cannot be improved in order to ensure that full value is obtained for the funds expended.</P>
    <P>Deputy G. Mitchell asked the difference between Part I and Part II members of the association.  Part I members comprise the developed countries, including Ireland.  Part II members are the developing countries.  Part I members are expected to contribute to the association's funds on a continuing basis.  Some of the more advanced Part II members also contribute on a voluntary basis. These Part I and Part II members make up the association's food donor groups comprising some 33 countries.  Countries to which the International Development Association lend are drawn from the Part II members, the poorest countries in that category receiving the loans.</P>
    <P>In regard to Deputy O'Kennedy's contribution, I should say that the OPEC countries, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, do take part in a special contribution.  We agree that OPEC countries generally may be able to play a larger part in this respect.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate and compliment them on the quality of their contributions which underline the concern of the House for an effective International Development Association and for wider efforts to help developing countries.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Fennell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The object of the Bill is to provide for the grant by the Revenue Commissioners of a special licence for the sale of intoxicating liquor in the National Concert Hall.  Bar facilities have been available to patrons in the concert hall for some considerable time but doubts have emerged as to whether the grant of the court certificate for the liquor licence held by the concert hall was well founded in law. The Attorney General, accordingly, appealed to the High Court to have the licence quashed.  However, the appeal has been adjourned and this has provided an opportunity to have the matter regularised by way of new legislation.</P>
      <P>By way of further explanation, I would like to sketch the background in a little more detail.  The liquor licensing laws are complex and are contained in statutes going back over very many years.  Since 1902 the number of licensed outlets for drink has been strictly controlled.  New licences can be granted but only when an existing licence is extinguished.  In an urban area, for instance, a new licence can be granted upon proof that there has been an increase of at least 25 per cent in the population of the civil parish since 1901, but an existing licence in the city or town would also have be extinguished.</P>
      <P>Three Dublin theatres have liquor licences under a provision which lays down a special licensing regime for those Dublin theatres which have letters patent granted originally under the Dublin Stage Regulation Act, 1786.  Special liquor licences have been given under various Intoxicating Liquor Acts to places such as the bus station in Áras Mhic Dhiarmada, airports, aircraft, railway stations and greyhound tracks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will agree that a special licence is also justified in the case of the concert hall in view of its unique national position and the Bill now before the <Col N="1799" /> House proposes to ensure that the hall has a liquor licence commensurate with its needs.</P>
    <P>Section 2 is the principal provision of the Bill.  It directs the Revenue Commissioners to grant the licence, on application by the National Concert Hall Company, or its nominee.  A prior court certificate such as is normally required under the licensing code will not be necessary, nor will it be necessary for the concert hall to comply with the general provisions in the licensing code regarding the prior extinction of an existing licence.  The licence will be valid for so long as the concert hall remains in operation at its present location.</P>
    <P>The licence will authorise the sale of liquor to persons attending a function, persons taking part in the function and persons employed at the concert hall. The permitted period during which drink may be sold will range from half an hour before a function until one hour afterwards. While the holding of concerts will be the primary activity of the concert hall, it is proposed that the definition of &ldquo;function&rdquo; should be extended to include conferences.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) of section 2 is a penalty provision and is intended to cover a situation, however unlikely it may be, where drink is sold at the concert hall otherwise than in accordance with the terms of the licence.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) of that section relates to the original licence for the concert hall which was issued in 1981 and which has been renewed annually since then.  Once the Bill is enacted and the special licence is granted, the existing licence will cease to have effect.</P>
    <P>Section 3 excludes the application of certain provisions of the licensing code to the concert hall licence.  Since the normal regime of permitted hours will not apply in relation to the concert hall licence, the application to that licence of provisions relating to exemption orders and occasional licences, or of the provisions relating to prohibited hours, would not be appropriate.  The exclusion of Part III of the 1927 Act means that the provisions in <Col N="1800" /> the code relating to the endorsement and forfeiture of licences will not apply to the concert hall licence.</P>
    <P>I believe that this is a non-controversial measure and that it will commend itself to Deputies on all sides of the House.  If there are any particular aspects on which they would like further clarification, I shall endeavour to deal with those aspects in the course of my concluding remarks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We support this Bill.  The Minister has made quite clear the reasons for the measures which are being included in the Bill, the fact that doubts have emerged as to the legality of the present situation and that the Attorney General has taken action to have the existing licence quashed and that time has been allowed for an appeal in that connection.</P>
      <P>We regard this as a very simple, direct measure, perhaps the kind we should have more often in this House to deal with specific problems immediately rather than waiting to include them in some larger measure which takes a great deal of time to prepare.</P>
      <P>As far as the National Concert Hall is concerned, I congratulate the board, management and staff of the hall in doing an excellent job and in fulfilling the objectives which we had in this House when the concert hall was established.  I understand they are making a modest profit which fits in with the objectives of the Members of this House that it was never the intention that the hall should make substantial profits but that there should be reasonable charges in relation to the quality of entertainment provided and that is what the management have done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was suggested at the time that the National Concert Hall should provide for all kinds of music and song in the best quality available.  It is evident that this has been done.  It is heartening to see such full houses for some of our best entertainers and ballad groups.  There have been tremendous occasions when we have had entertainers like The Dubliners, Clannad.  The Wolfe Tones and The Chieftains.  We have also had international companies, for instance, the <Col N="1801" /> Russian Symphony Orchestra, the BBC Philharmonic, the Liverpool Philharmonic, the Army and Garda Bands and the Ulster Symphony Orchestra.  They are very popular and welcome in Dublin, especially in the National Concert Hall. We have also seen many individuals and soloists of the very highest standing, so it is quite clear that the management of the concert hall have shown initiative in attracting such entertainers.  They have also attracted conferences, conventions and receptions.  It has become a very popular place in which to hold such functions and they are done very well there. In that sense, the National Concert Hall is fitting in with what this House required of it and must be commended for doing so.  It has also, of course, become the home of the RTE Orchestra and I understand they are doing particularly well there in their concerts.</P>
    <P>The National Concert Hall Board are an excellent body, very well managed and deserving of our full support in this House.  Therefore, we have no qualms about making these provisions available to them.  The provisions seem very reasonable in that they provide that for a period of 30 minutes before the commencement of a function and ending one hour after its conclusion the sale of intoxicating liquor at the concert hall for consumption therein for persons attending or taking part in the function and persons employed at the concert hall will be allowed.  We have pleasure in wholeheartedly supporting this Bill.</P>

    <P>What the Minister and Deputy Woods said about the National Concert Hall is very much to be emphasised.  I remember, in the Coalition Government from 1973-77, the controversy which was then raging as to whether the Government should go ahead with the extremely expensive original idea for a John F. Kennedy Hall or whether they should adopt a much more economical alternative even <Col N="1802" /> if, as it then seemed, a rather makeshift one, of converting the old UCD premises at Earlsfort Terrace.  Richie Ryan, who is now rightly coming into his own, impressed on the Government the importance of not throwing away money on a project which, if any recent experience was to be a guide, would undoubtedly by the end have cost three times more than the original quotation.  He advised they should concentrate instead on the somewhat more modest, even if not absolutely perfect, project of converting the old Great Hall in UCD.  I agreed with the financial and economic sense of that decision, but I had some qualms about how the result would turn out visually.</P>
    <P>They have been largely &mdash; although not entirely &mdash; set to rest.  The architects in charge of that conversion did as good a job as could possibly be done in the circumstances. I only regret that the familiar passages and rooms of the old University, of which I was a student 30 years ago, had to be sacrificed in the process.  Of course, they were no great shakes to look at and I do not say that anything has been lost by their disappearance, except that there is much less food for the nostalgia of the college's graduates from the fifties or before then.</P>
    <P>The recent demolition operations at the bottom of Leeson Street and stretching over that very large site which incorporates the old Alexandra College site have opened up a perspective of the old UCD building, now the National Concert Hall, which never existed since the building was put up in the First World War. The only perspective which anyone had of that building was an oblique one from Earlsfort Terrace and it develops a surprising degree of architectural interest to my layman's eye at any rate, when seen face on.  It is a great pity that that site, obviously very valuable, must now be built on so as once more to obscure that view; and I hope that the architects in charge of replacing the demolished buildings will leave even a little alley-way from the Leeson Street side to the Earlsfort Terrace side so that there can be some impression of what the building looks like when seen, as buildings should be seen, <Col N="1803" /> from a distance appropriate and proportionate to their bulk.</P>
    <P>I have seen the facilities of the National Concert Hall several times since it was opened.  They seem to be first class.  I am not in a position to speak with any musical authority.  I am simply an amateur there too, as to the acoustical qualities or the facilities for performers, but I do not think I have heard too many complaints about that, even from those whose judgment I would respect.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to regularise what may seem to the Minister or the Government a quite subordinate part of the concert hall's operations.  However, I think and I am sure many others would agree, that there are some kinds of entertainment &mdash; I do not mean to be facetious &mdash; which are enhanced by the fact that you can have a drink before or after them.  That is something that Myles na gCopaleen, one of the greatest Irishmen ever born, poked fun at, but not seriously, because he saw the point too when he wrote how extraordinary it was that no one seemed able to put up with an evening at the theatre completely sober, that when the interval arrived there was a &ldquo;humiliating exodus for whiskey.&rdquo; Nonetheless, what he said in satiric form is true.  There are a range of aesthetic experiences, of which the theatre is one and a concert is another, which are enhanced for the visitor and made into an evening out in the sense that an evening at the cinema or an evening at some other entertainment never could be, by the fact that one can have a social couple of drinks with friends &mdash; or by oneself if one is a solitary drinker &mdash; before, in the middle of or after the performance.  The legal doubts about the legitimacy of serving drink in the NCH should now be put to rest.</P>
    <P>From something in the Minister's speech for which she is in no way to blame I cannot help observing the extremely nannyish attitude of the Irish State towards the whole subject of buying and selling drink.  Needless to say, it is not because the Irish themselves are in their nature nannyish about that subject.  You yourself, <Col N="1804" /> Sir &mdash; but perhaps it is not in order to make comments about the Chair's personal abstinences &mdash; the Irish as a people are not nannyish but they have allowed nannyish manners to be wished on them, in this as in so many other things, by our neighbours.</P>
    <P>The abuse of alcohol is a terrible curse in this country.  I am not saying, as some people would, that the abuse derives to some extent from the sense of repression inspired by its only-partial-legitimacy, by the fact that you cannot buy a drink between 2.30 p.m. and 3.30 p.m. or during long hours on a Sunday and many pubs close earlier than their patrons would wish because they are obliged to do so by law.  That is an nannyish approach to alcohol that we should have outgrown and we should be willing to form a new attitude towards it starting from scratch.  We should make a zero calculation about the whole problem of licensing the sale of intoxicating liquor. There is room for some form of control and licensing; and the very form most needed is the one which is least visible, namely the control of its sales to minors. That is where there is the greatest abuse and the least effective law.  Aside from that there is the case for looking at the question of licensing from the ground up.</P>
    <P>It is fantastic that the Minister should make a speech here referring to licences for the Dublin theatres and &mdash; note this for scrupulous nannyism &mdash; only for those Dublin theatres which have letters patent granted originally under the Dublin Stage Regulation Act, 1786.  Are we to issue a stamp in commemoration of the bi-centenary of that Act?  Is that why you cannot get a drink in the Gate or Eblana Theatres?  I do not know the reason.  Perhaps I am wrong to mention these theatres by name; I cannot tell the press what to print, but I regret now having mentioned them, because for all I know I may have been doing an unwitting injury or causing annoyance to their proprietors and managers, and I do not want to do that.  If only certain Dublin theatres which conform with regulations laid down in 1786 received special licensing consideration, the whole structure must <Col N="1805" /> be one of the most absurd of all our legislative structures.</P>
    <P>Put that beside what the Minister went on to say especially about licences &mdash; I hope she does not mind me putting it in this way &mdash; she said proudly: &ldquo;Special liquor licences have been given under various Intoxicating Liquor Acts to places such as the bus station in Áras Mhic Dhiarmada.&rdquo;  You must go up two flights of stairs to get a drink if you are at the Eblana and you want a drink.  The last time I was there, one had to walk up the main concourse and push through crowds waiting to go to Navan and Tullamore and go up another flight of stairs to get to the bar &mdash; by which time most of the interval was over &mdash; and then one had to force one's way through the thirsty throng.  The bus station in Áras Mhic Dhiarmada has a bar as have airports, railway stations and greyhound tracks. Are we not a great little people?  We have managed to licence greyhound tracks, but we cannot make sure that one can get a convenient drink in all theatres.  Above all, we have not succeeded in curing the greatest omission of all in this area, the absence of proper liquor licences in ordinary restaurants.  We must be the only country in Europe in which that is so.  The Minister made special mention of airports.  I do not mind making a parenthetic prediction, that the best business done at Knock airport will be in the bar &mdash; providing some 18th or 19th century Act will entitle Monsignor Horan's company to apply for and get a liquor licence.</P>
    <P>The idea that you can get a drink more easily standing out on the windy terrace of a greyhound track than you can in a restaurant&mdash;I mean a drink of beer or spirits&mdash;is fantastic.  I am not the first person who has said that in this House, but it is so seldom that we get an intoxicating Bill here that I must ask your indulgence, Sir to say one or two brief words on this.  In happier days when I was Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism, one of the things I first tried to do&mdash;unfortunately my term of office did not last long enough for me to complete it, as with many other things I had running&mdash;was to put an end to this ludicrous situation which is a severe handicap on <Col N="1806" /> the tourism side.  I felt able to take an interest in this under my tourism hat, and I was urged on by Bord Fáilte and by the Restaurant Owners' Association.  I encountered opposition from the licensed trade.  I do not want to make cheap fun of the licensed trade, far from it. They conduct a legitimate and difficult business, one with responsibility of all kinds, and many of them, despite what the public think, do not make a reasonable income for their efforts.  They must carry a large tax load and pass it onto their customers and expect the customers to smile.  Their apprehension was that the extension of licences to restaurants would rob them of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the apprehension of the ordinary licensed trade. They were afraid that places that did nothing else than sell beefburgers with a handful of chips would now be able to sell beer and spirits.  I shared those apprehensions; but it would not have been beyond the wit of my Department, with goodwill all round and the co-operation of the Department of Justice, to contrive some system whereby what you or I would call a restaurant, as distinct from a hamburger joint or something of that kind&mdash;I do not mean to be belittling by using that expression&mdash;could be licensed.  That is not beyond the wit of man.  We all know it is a handicap to our tourist trade that greyhound tracks, and Knock Airport, can be licensed, but restaurants in the city of Dublin by the dozen can sell only wine and wine derivatives of the non-distilled kind but no beer and no spirits. I urge the Minister of State here&mdash;I do not know the exact frontiers of her responsibility, but if those frontiers enclose the subject of intoxicating liquor licences&mdash;to take up the ball which I was <Col N="1807" /> forced to drop when the Irish people changed the Government at the beginning of 1982, and see whether she can make any progress in bringing greater reason, with an obvious national economic benefit, into this area.  Having said that, I am glad that at least this timely step forward is being taken in regularising the sales of liquor in the National Concert Hall and I wish the National Concert Hall, its company and managers and all those who work in it, as well as those who perform in it, every possible success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, I suppose, ironic to be paying tribute to the National Concert Hall in the context of an intoxicating liquor Bill.  The National Concert Hall has been a success story since its founding in September 1981 and it is important the House realises the measure of success, and quantifies that measure, in its seating capacity over the past year or so.  Of the close on 1,300 seats there has been an average capacity of 60 per cent, which is very, very high, given the economic situation, and an average of some 20 to 22 concerts are held there per month making a total of some 240 per year.  Any law we can pass here which will enable such success to continue is certainly to be applauded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason for the success of the National Concert Hall lies in the fact that it has shown a great degree of flexibility in the type of events the board of management allows to be staged there.  Initially the intention was that it would just stage classical concerts and international artistes of a very high standard.  They rapidly realised, however, that to stay a viable proposition it was necessary to move into the area of exhibitions and conferences and, indeed, even fashion shows.  Be that as it may, the National Concert Hall is now regarded as a forum, a focal point for art and culture generally and, if I might make a suggestion, a suggestion those responsible could use to maximum advantage, the fact is everyone realises&mdash;I say this in the presence of the Minister of State with responsibility for art and culture&mdash;that one facet of our life is under sad neglect at the moment, either <Col N="1808" /> inadvertently or by virtue of the fact that no one quite knows what to do about it. I refer to the decline in our national language. The lamentable figure is only 4 per cent having a knowledge of Irish.  I would appeal to the National Concert Hall to use their good offices to stage more Irish concerts and to hold debates in Irish.  If it becomes the case that a more bilingual approach can be staged to greater success, then let us have it.  It is most important that, having the imprimatur of everyone in the Houses of the Oireachtas, they use that.  Having our full support they in turn could offer some practical programme in promoting the language.</P>
    <P>I would also point out that the example one can take in Dublin in theatre and in concert would be shows staged in the RDS.  Now the audience mix attending classical concerts in the RDS have in the main been a similar mix.  It is very desirable that people should attend these concerts but it has been that singular mix and one could, perhaps, say that classical music is the province of a particular section in our society.  There has been an exclusivity afforded to a section of our society. Given the fact that in recent years we have had some great composers&mdash;to name just one, Seán O'Riada&mdash;it is marvellous to note that the audience mix in the National Concert Hall has been very different from the exclusivity or age grouping found at concerts staged previously at other venues.</P>
    <P>Far from that being the case now very many young people are attending classical concerts in the National Concert Hall. They come from every strata and that augurs well for the future, remembering we will have a society with a great deal more leisure time in which to develop art and culture.  Two years on, the National Concert Hall stands there with a responsibility to the people, and the Minister of State is quite right in what she said. Regrettably the Bill has to be couched in the context of the existing law relating to the sale of alcohol.  I agree in the main with what Deputy Kelly said.  It is regrettable that we as a nation have to be confined to a particular drinking clock which results in a stampede at a particular time. <Col N="1809" /> That is an immature and totally wrong attitude towards alcohol.  Unfortunately, the situation is that the Minister has to work within the framework of existing legislation.  Having said that, I applaud the introduction of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I commend those who manage the National Concert Hall for the way in which they have established themselves.  It has been suggested there may be a cultural elitism on the part of those who attend but that cannot be blamed on those responsible for managing the concert hall.  I do not agree with Deputy G. Brady.  There may well be a better mix of people attending but within some hundred of yards of the National Concert Hall there are many flat complexes the inhabitants of which would not dream of going to the National Concert Hall.  I know that because I represent most of them.  However, the National Concert Hall is not just a concert hall.  It is a national hall and it is going beyond a certain amount of elitism or catering for a certain section of the community.  What has been done actually has been very positive and commendable.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to suggest that perhaps in developing our culture and in providing a national cultural platform the members of the community who have not had the advantages which would lead them to appreciate some facets of our culture should be considered.  Instead of keeping the hall for an élite few, the opportunity should be given to others to enjoy that culture which was previously confined to the bow tie brigade, with their ideas of what our culture is all about.  I have a particular interest in music and the theatre, an amateur interest.  Everyone should have had an opportunity to enjoy the performances which have taken place in the National Concert Hall since its opening, and a thought might be given to expanding the variety of performances there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How national is the concert hall and how Dublin?  Who does it encourage? There are parts of the city, some not far from the concert hall, where because of the lack of facilities and of cultural activities <Col N="1810" /> there is a particularly high crime rate.  There have been areas, particularly in my constituency, where the Garda, until recent action by the residents, could not walk through certain complexes because of the level of crime.  The situation reminds me of the words from the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta <i>The Pirates of Penzance:</i></P>
    <P>When a felon's not engaged in his employment or maturing his felonious little plan, his capacity for innocent enjoyment is just the same as any honest man.</P>
    <P>That excerpt should commend itself to the management of our National Concert Hall.  Every effort should be made to ensure that its entertainment can be enjoyed by a wide variety of people.</P>
    <P>The licence being given by the Minister is a new departure from our licensing laws and is very welcome.  However, should we not extend this licence to other concert halls?  What is so exclusive about the National Concert Hall that people attending there shall have entitlement to drink at certain times while those attending other concert halls and theatres in the city do not have the same right?  There are other concert halls which, as far as I can see, would meet all the criteria of the National Concert Hall, except for an absence of bow ties.  I wonder why the Minister, in introducing this welcome legislation, is not extending it to include other concert halls.</P>

      <P>The intoxicating liquor dimension of this Bill quite rightly belongs to my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, but the cultural and artistic aspects come under my aegis.  It is only right that I should make some minor contribution. I do so to recommend the concert hall to you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and my fellow Deputies as an excellent place to repair to after difficult days of affairs of State or of processing constituency clinics. If I were to remain rigidly and strictly in accordance with the rules of the House, as I saw happen when Deputy Kelly was making his contribution, I <Col N="1811" /> would have to recommend the National Concert Hall on this occasion because of the facility of its bar.  However, that would be very unfair to the hall and to what is taking place there.</P>
      <P>Many have paid tribute to the hall during the course of this debate for the type and variety of presentations there. In no more emphatic way could that be done than simply by recording a number of items on the programme for this month of November 1983.  We have had already the European Community&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The hall has presented already this month the European Community Youth Jazz Orchestra with the RTE Symphony Concert Orchestra; James Galway; the German Bach Soloists; the RTE Concert Orchestra on its own and Courtney Kenny.</P>
      <P>We will have the RTE Symphony Orchestra, and coming on next Saturday and Sunday Stephane Grappelli, one of the great artists in his particular field makes a return visit.  On Monday there will be the USSR Symphony Orchestra. Following that will be the RTE Symphony Orchestra, the Vienna Boys Choir and Charles Lynch with the Cork Youth Orchestra.  There will be our Lady's Choral Society with Bernadette Greevy and Virginia Kerr, and then Dame Janet Baker and Vanya Milanova.  That is only some of what is taking place in the one month of November.  It just happens to be the month in which this legislation is being introduced, but it is typical of the variety of world entertainment offered to us on our doorstep.</P>
      <P>It should also be pointed out that, in-addition to that it is the permanent home of the RTE Symphony and Concert Orchestras and provides facilities for 100 musicians and a permanent studio with full recording facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1812" /> The National Concert Hall was established in 1981 with the principal object of providing a prestige centre, a concert hall for the promotion of concerts and recitals of musical works of artistic, educational and cultural value.  It has very much lived up to all expectations of the people who worked for it at that time.  As Deputy Kelly earlier did, I should also pay tribute to the Minister of the period, Richie Ryan, who was to a great extent responsible for the concert hall.</P>
    <P>It also has had the remarkable success of which we heard mention earlier.  The attendance figures show a 75 per cent seat occupancy despite the recession and the competition and the inevitable minority appeal of some of the programmes there. Indeed, as anyone going there will see, it is one of the few places in Dublin with decent, healthy queues extending up into Earlsfort Terrace &mdash; something like what we were used to seeing in Dublin in the great days of the theatre.</P>
    <P>The standing of the concert hall is undoubtedly such as to warrant the provision of the usual range of refreshments, including alcohol &mdash; as is being discussed here.  In addition to these functions, the hall is also available for hire for conferences, with are a substantial source of revenue.</P>

Is the Minister of State aware that the Cruise missile it is proposed to site at Greenham Common may be moved to other sites at times of tension?  In view of the fact that Northern Ireland is under the jurisdiction of the British Government does the Minister feel there is a risk at a time of tension of these missiles being moved to Northern Ireland?  Would it not be appropriate for the Taoiseach to seek a definite assurance that whatever plans may exist now that no plans exist for future either temporary or permanent siting of these missiles on this island?</P>

Further, is he aware that Deputies who process 300 or 400 cases per week find it most frustrating when they do not even get acknowledgments from certain Departments?

      <P>Aithníonn an Rialtas go bhfuil deacrachtaí ar leith le sárú ag an nGaeilge chun an áit is dual di a bhaint amach agus tá rún daingean againn gach tacaíocht is féidir a thabhairt le húsáid na teanga a chur chun chinn.</P>
      <P>Cad iad na moltaí dearfa atá ag an Aire chun an aidhm sin a luaigh an Taoiseach a bhaint amach?  Agus an cheist eile faoi Bhord na Gaeilge agus plean Bhord na Gaeilge.  Faoin phlean seo deirtear ar leathanach 38, there is the definite target date of October 1983 for the implementation of that particular plan of the Irish Development Committee as an integral and permanent part of the Department's structure and that appropriate authority be given to them.

      <P>Fuair mé iarratas maidir le seirbhís farantóireachta do Thóraigh ach, le go bhféadfaí seirbhís mar sin a chur ar fáil, bheadh áiseanna fóirsteanacha de dhíth i gcuanta ar an oileán agus ar tír mór agus tá an ghné sin den scéal á breithniú.</P>
      <P>Tuigim go bhfuil tairiscint a bhaineann le Tóraigh agus le hoileáin eile dá leithéid sínithe ag Teachtaí ón tír seo i bParlaimint na hEorpa ach nach bhfuil sí curtha i láthair go foirmiúil go fóill.  Breithneofar an tacaíocht is féidir a thabhairt i dtráth cuí.</P>

Ní féidir liomsa a rá an bhfuil na háiseanna oiriúnach faoi láthair nó nach bhfuil.  Mar <Col N="1824" /> adeir me, caithfear survey a dhéanamh agus caithfimid an toradh a fheiceál.

Leanfaidh mé leis an iarracht sin.  Fuaireamar deontas le haghaidh <Col N="1825" /> bóithre san oileán cúpla seachtain ó shin.  Tuigim an tábhacht a bhaineann leis an oileán.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that a city having been set up in Tallaght of 80,000 population, there is no adequate transportation system?  This matter is urgent and requires information from the Minister so that the people there will know what the position is.  Secondly, will the Minister not agree that on the completion of the Howth-Bray line the staff that had been employed there will become redundant, with large-scale unemployment implications if they are not taken up, as logically they should be, to provide a rail link for the city of Tallaght?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>May I tell the Deputy that I am acutely aware of the transport problems of Tallaght and other areas near to it?  In relation to the question of <Col N="1835" /> those working on the Howth-Bray electrification line becoming redundant, I am also aware of that fact.  However, I have to say to the House that the costs of the Howth-Bray electrification are one reason for us to reflect with great care on whether or not proposals for an electrified line from Tallaght are economically viable or possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that because of overcosting or whatever on the Howth-Bray line, 80,000 people in Tallaght are to be left without an adequate transportation system?  Has an application been made to the Government from CIE for approval for this project and, if so, on what date was that application received and when might it be dealt with?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been informed by the Board of CIE that they do not think it timely to continue with the proposals regarding electrification.

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is right but the board of CIE decided it was not timely for them to decide.  I have already stated that I will make the decision having considered all the transport possibilities for the Tallaght area.  It is only fair to point out that the cost of electrification is so enormous that there are many people who now doubt the wisdom of proceeding with that venture.  The servicing of borrowing for that purpose is going to add greatly to CIE's difficulties in the future and also to their deficit.</P>

Have any Government considered the possibility of inquiring whether any interest exists in the private sector, not just in this country but anywhere in the world, in being given a concession to operate under appropriate conditions a rail link, electrical or otherwise, which would join Tallaght, the complex which Deputy Taylor is concerned about, and the rail line which basically runs around the bay?  In other words, even if CIE have not got the money and the State cannot stake them to it, is there any possibility that any private sector interest anywhere in the world would like to come and do it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport if he will outline the financial transactions involving Allied Irish Banks, the Insurance Corporation of Ireland Ltd. and Irish Shipping Ltd.; and if he will make a statement on the position of Irish Shipping Ltd.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is as follows. Irish Shipping Limited have a 75 per cent shareholding in a company named Oceanbank Developments Limited, the remaining 25 per cent shareholding being owned by Allied Irish Banks Limited.</P>
      <P>Oceanbank Developments Limited held 3,469,500 shares in the Insurance Corporation of Ireland.  On 24 August 1983, Allied Irish Banks made an offer to acquire the whole of the issued share capital of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland not already owned by them.  This included the shares held by Oceanbank Developments Limited.  The AIB offer for the shares was: nine AIB shares for every four ICI shares or £3.50 cash for each ICI share.  The Board of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland recommended acceptance of the offer.</P>
      <P>The Board of Oceanbank Developments Limited decided to accept the Allied Irish Banks offer in a combination of shares and cash and the company received £5 million cash and £4.6 million Allied Irish Banks shares in return for their ICI shareholding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, Irish Shipping Limited, after 15 consecutive years of profit, are now experiencing grave financial problems stemming from their deep-sea operations.  In the year ended 31 March 1983 the company incurred a loss of £14 million and the <Col N="1839" /> losses in the current financial year are expected to be even greater.  The company's present serious financial situation is largely attributable to the collapse of the world deep-sea freight market.  The catastrophic decline in freight rates is due essentially to the world economic depression resulting in a substantial excess of capacity over demand and I understand that prospects are poor for any improvements in freight rates in the short-term.</P>
    <P>The serious financial position of Irish Shipping Limited is at present being examined by my Department in consultation with the company and I expect to be making a submission in the matter to the Government in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the interests of Irish Shipping and, consequently, the taxpayers are well protected in the new deal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think so.  It is a reasonably good deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that the House realise the truth of what the Minister said about the tramp business and the colossal cost of it and that half the cost is available for charter fees.  As there is an element of once-off in this deal, is there not a weakening of the Irish Shipping position?  I accept that the share is a continuing thing but there is an element in the cash deal of a once-off.  Would the Minister be afraid that this would be used to defray debts now and that next year such money will not be available to defray debts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a once-off, but it is beneficial.  The 4.6 million AIB shares which Oceanbank now own were valued recently at £7.89 million, so it is a very good deal and will help the balance sheet of Irish Shipping and it will help them in general.</P>

    <Title>Intoxicating Liquor (National Concert Hall) Bill, 1983: Second Stage (Resumed) and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Nealon) Nuala Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Nealon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not detain the House very long.  Before the Adjournment I was making the point that the intoxicating liquor aspect of this Bill belongs to my colleague, the Minister of State, and I was speaking in order to advance the cause of the National Concert Hall for which this licence is being provided.  It would not do to give the impression that we were advocating the value of drink as such, but there are certain times when drink in moderation can complement an evening.  Deputy Kelly drew on the authority of, as he said, <Col N="1901" /> a great Irishman, Myles na gCopalleen, to augment him in making that statement. I can now draw on the authority of Myles na gCopalleen and Deputy Kelly for that idea.  Certainly there are very few places more appropriate than the NCH. The bars are there at the moment.  You can drink in the outer one in the foyer which is dedicated to the memory of John Count McCormack with a permanent display there of memorabilia of this great tenor.  If you prefer to be more discreet and go to the inner foyer you can drink in the John Field Room, dedicated last year on the bicentennial of that great Irish composer.  They are very amenable surroundings.</P>
      <P>The time constraint laid down in the Bill as outlined by the Minister of State, that is 30 minutes before the commencement of a function to one hour after the ending of the function, is a guarantee in all respects.  The NCH is a relatively new centre of which we can all be proud.  The management, the National Concert Hall Company, have done an excellent job, as was pointed out earlier in the debate, not least in the manner in which they have attracted people to that new prestige centre &mdash; 75 per cent occupancy of seats in any such centre is a very notable achievement considering that on occasions very frequently because of its very nature some of the presentations there cater for a minority interest.  The board are to be congratulated on that achievement.</P>
      <P>Another idea that has surfaced to a certain extent is the sponsorship of various events by commercial firms.  I am very keen on this.  The inability to realise their potential through the lack of funds has been a tragedy of many excellent groups and bodies in the artistic field.  By their definition Government funds, particularly at this time, are limited while artistic efforts worthy of support are foundering and the allocation of available resources is extremely difficult.  I am glad that commercial interests are going into sponsorship.  I have seen a number of them recently in the NCH which is an ideal venue for such sponsorship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Concert Hall Company, <Col N="1902" /> their chairman and directors, must be congratulated for their achievements in the relatively short life of this centre.  The hall fulfilled a very badly needed want in the country in beautiful surroundings. The business and commercial acumen of the people running it are to be commended. It is gratifying to see a centre of this nature breaking even or getting as near to that as possible.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, one of the most encouraging sights as far as entertainment in Dublin is concerned is the queues very frequently spilling over into the adjoining streets, reminiscent of what used to be the case at many entertainment centres in Dublin.  I believe that the Intoxicating Liquor (National Concert Hall) Bill will provide, totally legitimately, the necessary licence for the concert hall and will embellish the entertainment presented there.</P>
    <P>Finally, as I said earlier when the Leas-Cheann Comhairle was in the Chair, I recommend to you, Sir, and to all Members of the House to visit there frequently.  I believe that anyone who visits there will have a very satisfactory evening.  I have great pleasure in supporting the Bill.</P>

      <P>In summing up, I thank the Deputies for their remarks on this Bill.  All the speakers have congratulated the board of the NCH on the excellent standard they have maintained in the hall and I would like to be associated with those remarks.  Since its opening the concert hall has proved to be a forum for our own considerable talent in the country here and for visiting groups. As the Minister of State responsible for Arts and Culture has pointed out, a wide range of first-rank performers and companies appear in the hall.  Not only concerts feature there.  There is a widening range of concerts, exhibits and seminars, and I in my women's affairs section will be presenting post-Renaissance prizes there this day week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Woods has pointed out, it <Col N="1903" /> is right and proper that we should have regularising legislation such as this.  I hope that this licence will contribute to the pleasure of patrons of the concert hall.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to Deputy Kelly's contribution, and I have an aside on that. He showed that some men in high places, intentionally or otherwise, perpetuate the use of words like &ldquo;nannyish&rdquo;&ldquo;grannyishness&rdquo;, &ldquo;old-maidishness&rdquo; and &ldquo;old-womanish&rdquo;.  I think they really mean &ldquo;sedate&rdquo; and &ldquo;reserved&rdquo; and I would like men to use those words.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly referred to the desirability of providing for the grant of special liquor licences to theatres generally.  As I remarked in my opening speech, there are three Dublin theatres, namely, the Gaiety, the Abbey and the Olympia, where court certificates are not required as a preliminary to the grant of a liquor licence.  Theatres generally throughout the country can obtain liquor licences only on the same basis as any other premises. The question of granting special licensing facilities to theatres would involve such matters as the range of drink, the hours during which they might be supplied, the limitations, if any, on the number of theatre licences and the question of public health and safety, including of course fire precautions, enforcement problems and the relationship with the licensed trade generally. This is a matter on which I would not make any definitive pronouncement at this stage but I might say there would be many difficulties in the way of such proposals including that of defining, for instance, theatres.  There would be similar difficulties in relation to the licensing of concert halls generally, a matter referred to by Deputy Mitchell.  I have, however, noted the observations made and I will have further consideration given to this question.</P>
    <P>The question of providing for the grant of full liquor licences to restaurants without their having to extinguish existing licences was also raised.  This is being considered in the context of a current review of the licensing code.  This matter is being discussed between the Minister <Col N="1904" /> and interested organisations, including representatives of the vintners and restaurant owners.  If the Government decide any amendments of the licensing code are desirable in this connection their proposals will come before the House in the normal way.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the desirability of reviewing the present regime of permitted hours applying to licensed premises.  I would say this is one of the aspects now being examined in the context of the current review to which I referred.  As I mentioned at the outset, this is a non-controversial Bill designed to regularise the position with regard to a liquor licence for the National Concert Hall.  Again, I thank all the Members who contributed to the debate and I hope the Bill will now be adopted without delay.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take remaining Stages today.</P>
    <P>Bill put through Committee and reported without amendment</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been a fairly regular attender of concert halls.  Lest anyone misinterprets my intervention may I say that as a young man I had the pleasure of rehearsing in such places as the Stag's Head.  I have been associated with drama for a long while.  I attended sessions of Irish Music when that was not fashionable and all the while I was able to do that without having the comfort of intoxicating liquor.  In respect of the National Convert Hall, I would be concerned about under-age drinking.  Indeed, at the moment parents are very concerned about under-age drinking and special precautions should be taken so that parents can be assured that their offspring when they attend the concert hall will have as their main purpose the savouring of the wonderful presentations, and the availability of drink will be relatively insignificant in their minds.  I would hope <Col N="1905" /> the concert hall would not become a free-for-all for drinking.  It is difficult for the Garda to go in and challenge people but it would be no harm if the Minister could give the parents of young people a firm assurance that the requirements of the Bill in respect of under-age drinking will be strictly adhered to.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for his very prompt attention.  I doubt if any of his colleague Ministers have acted as speedly as he has.  I raised a matter on the last occasion the Bill was before the House and he responded by writing me a letter.  I thank him for that. He did bring out the fact that the £2 registration fee to which I referred, and which has been there for some 40 years, was now being increased on average from £150 to £200.  That is a very hefty increase, £2 to £200.  I suppose inflation may be catching up on the registration fee situation.  Would the Minister tell us how many fresh registrations per year would be received in the Department which will now be subject to this £200?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all right.  According to the table on page 7 of the Bill the board will publish or cause to be published at least once in every year the various registers that are affected.  Would the Minister indicate where this publication takes place and if it is available to the general public?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. M. Moynihan Mr. M. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I see.  It would be very useful if Bord Fáilte could have these registers published nationally once a year so that people would realise the number of registered types of accommodation and their location.  If the Minister's funds can stretch that far, perhaps he would consider publishing this register so that the general public and our touring visitors would have ready access to all information on the entire registration system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a final question on section 7 <Col N="1907" /> which concerns part of that table also, a question which I put on the last occasion, concerning the right of people to display a sign outside their premises.  It is now being made unlawful under this section for an operator in the tourist business to show a sign outside his premises unless he is part of that published register. There might be an individual who is not interested in being on the register of Bord Fáilte for reasons best known to himself and not interested in displaying the shamrock sign, which is the readily acknowledged sign to the tourist that this is registered accommodation.  Why he should fail to come outside the scope of this legislation I can understand, but he might very well be summoned under this Act for not participating unwillingly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. M. Moynihan Mr. M. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is referring to the provision regarding the display of a sign.  The words &ldquo;Hotel&rdquo; and &ldquo;guesthouse&rdquo; have been illegal since 1939 unless the premises to which they refer were registered under the Bord Fáilte regulations.  The question of the shamrock display sign does not arise because unless the person is registered with Bord Fáilte the shamrock sign will not be issued.  What is illegal is not the offering of accommodation to tourists, but the use of the words &ldquo;hotel&rdquo; or &ldquo;guesthouse&rdquo; or, under this new legislation, &ldquo;caravan park&rdquo;, &ldquo;camping centre&rdquo; and so forth.  That is the official registered sign of Bord Fáilte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I trust I understand the position now.  Any individual can put up a sign &ldquo;hotel&rdquo; or &ldquo;guesthouse&rdquo; or whatever outside his premises and attract custom and will not be in contravention of this Bill, is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. M. Moynihan Mr. M. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  What will be in breach of the law would be to promote the hotel and publish it as a hotel or guesthouse unless it is registered.  He is not prevented from carrying on accommodation business if he removes the word &ldquo;hotel&rdquo; and puts up &ldquo;accommodation&rdquo; or some other suitable word but he cannot display the word &ldquo;hotel&rdquo; or <Col N="1908" />&ldquo;guesthouse&rdquo; or any of the categories registered in relation to the tourist business, once they are registerable under the Bord Fáilte regulations.

It might well have had effect since the 1939 Act, but it appears to be an undue intrusion on the rights of the individual that he cannot display a sign outside his premises, whether it be hotel, guesthouse or other category, to attract business &mdash; that the very fact of having the word &ldquo;hotel&rdquo; displayed outside his premises, unless he is on the register published by Bord Fáilte, may mean that he is committing an offence.  I find it hard to understand how the Minister could promote such an attitude, as the Minister has under his control a semi-State body which compiles a register on a year to year basis which is readily available to the public.  Everyone would be quite well aware that the particular premises was not on that register, but that should not deprive the individual of the right to carry on an hotel business in the strict interpretation of the word &ldquo;hotel&rdquo;&mdash; a place where one may stay &mdash; without being so registered.  I would have to object to this infringement of civil rights.</P>

      <P>I remind the Deputy that this goes back to the 1939 Act, the first legislation concerning hotels and guesthouses.  That legislation is proposed to be extended to the other developments which have been in operation since then.  What is proposed is merely an extension of that existing legislation to the new developments which are so important to tourism today and for which standards are laid down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be thousands here in breach of these regulations, once they are implemented.  There are thousands carrying on a bed and breakfast business who are not registered or listed in any Bord Fáilte publication.  However, they are attracting to their premises custom in the accommodation sphere.  If the Minister says that they are not entitled to <Col N="1909" /> attract people to such an establishment if they are not on the register, where no such register exists, that is discriminatory against those who have been carrying on a business which has been attracting a large number of tourists over the years. I fail to see the relevance of this.</P>
      <P>As the Leas-Cheann Comhairle knows well himself, in tourist areas every second house has a B &amp; B sign outside it.  Now the Minister is saying that it is illegal to carry on such a business unless they are on the register.  I cannot see how the Minister can hope to apply this section to the tourist scene as we know it now and as it has been developing over the past number of years, with the large increase in ordinary houses providing such accommodation in our tourist areas.  I ask the Minister to consider, if that is the case, amending the 1939 Act so as to provide that people who wish to carry on business but do not wish to be a part of the official Bord Fáilte registers can do so without fear of being brought to court.</P>

      <P>I am glad that the Deputy raised that question.  No legislation is being proposed to outlaw them when such people are not operating in conflict with the legislation.  Unless a person running a bed and breakfast business puts up a sign as a registered guesthouse or hotel, there is no prohibition.  That is the only difference.  There is no prohibition on any person offering any level of accommodation, provided that he does not use the official designation of hotel and guesthouse without having the standards applicable and being registered. There is nothing in any of this legislation prohibiting people from carrying on a bed and breakfast business.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the section is to ensure that guests staying in registered accommodation have easy <Col N="1911" /> access to consumer information relating to the premises in which they are staying. It is the intention that a sign or notice would be displayed in bedrooms and the reception area of registered premises indicating such things as the grade of the premises, information of the safety of property and the rights and obligations of guests.  Appropriate signs to be completed by the registered proprietor where necessary will be supplied by the board to the premises concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not strange that hotels and such places of accommodation are being singled out for special consumer legislation?  Is there an obligation on hotels at present to have any other signs displayed in their premises?

      <P>In relation to the indication of information for the consumer, I am sure the Deputy will agree that, as such facilities are available generally on the continent, it is only right that we should display such information. Section 43 of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1939 already allows Bord Fáilte to insist on the display of charges in respect of rooms, meals or other services provided. Section 8 of the Bill extends Bord Fáilte's powers in this area to ensuring a more comprehensive range of information is made available to guests staying in registered accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Act dealing with hotel proprietors hotels and such places are already bound by law to display signs, particularly about providing services to all comers and the hotel's liability.  They are important signs and hotels must also comply with the Fire Services Act, 1981. Will we now have a big range of duplicate signs for hotels to display?  In my view these matters are covered in earlier Acts and it is superfluous to ask hotels to have these additional displays.  If the Minister insists having these signs displayed in hotel bedrooms and foyers, I take it they will be supplied by Bord Fáilte?  It is one <Col N="1912" /> thing to ask hotels to hang such signs but it is another thing to incorporate in the section that if such signs are not displayed the proprietor will be liable for a fine of £100.  The Minister would have been better advised to have consulted with the Irish Hotels Federation, Bord Fáilte and other interested bodies and tried to reach agreement on a voluntary system.  The hotels, instead of covering their foyers with signs that may not be read by any visitors, should have one sign dealing with all matters under the various Acts. Even at this late stage the Minister should consider having consultations to see if it will be possible to introduce a voluntary arrangement.  Will the Minister approach Bord Fáilte and the Irish Hotels Federation to see if it will be possible to incorporate all statutory obligations on hotels on one sign to be hung in the foyer of hotels?</P>

A hotelier who carries out his duty in accordance with this section and hangs his signs may find that a naughty guest, or the son or daughter of a guest, defaces the sign or takes it away.  If an inspector in visiting the hotel finds that the sign is not displayed will the proprietor be liable for the fine of £100? I do not think that would be in the interest of developing good relations between the tourist organisations and the Minister's office.  Apart from providing the standard sign, will the Minister instruct his inspectors to deal leniently with offenders?  I see a nod from one section of the House but I would like that nod to be repeated by the Minister.  If the Minister gives that indication I will agree to the section.</P>

      <P>This section is concerned with changes in the composition of the board.  It is a reasonably important amendment to the original Act.  I draw the attention of the Minister to subsection (2) where it is stated that where a member of the board is adjudged a bankrupt he cannot hold office.  That is a well-known provision so far as State boards are concerned.  However, I wonder if the remainder of the subsection could have been omitted without dealing a fatal blow to the meaning of the section. The subsection states: ... or makes a composition or arrangement with his creditors. Arrangements are made with creditors every day of the week but that does not mean that the people concerned are adjudged bankrupts.  It appears unnecessary <Col N="1914" /> to me to have a further extension debarring someone from membership of a State board if he suffers imprisonment. There are many people who have gone to jail because they would not pay their licence fee to RTE or pay a fee for a dog licence because the original notification was not in the Irish language.  If a person has a certain point of view and has a sentence passed on him because of his actions to uphold that point of view, it seems rather strange that should debar him automatically from being on a State board.  What the Minister requires could have been stated simply, as happens in other legislation, that if a person is adjudged a bankrupt he can no longer sit on a board.  Could the Minister not have done that in this case without asking for this further extension?</P>

      <P>The section is as it has been since 1939 other than we now propose to delete the words &ldquo;or ceases to be ordinarily resident in Ireland&rdquo;.  This is proposed in order to allow a person to be appointed who is not resident in Ireland, should that occasion arise.  That restriction was not contained in legislation regarding the ESB and other public bodies. Having regard to the importance of tourism and the possibility that there could be some person not resident in Ireland who could make a tremendous contribution to the industry, we propose to remove the restriction that has obtained up to now.  The remainder of the section is the same as other legislation governing appointments to boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty whatever in congratulating the Minister in considering the appointment of non-nationals to the board of Bord Fáilte. Unfortunately the Minister has suggested now that it is only a vague possibility, even though I thought that would be part and parcel of the new structure.  I would like it to be such because I believe there are many well-positioned people in Great Britain, Europe and America who could do invaluable work in attracting more tourists here if they were given a proper standing on a State board such as Bord Fáilte.  I had hoped the Minister would <Col N="1915" /> develop the board to include some subsidiary in America or in Great Britain that would act as a promotional agency to generate greater tourism development. The full potential of tourism has never been realised.  It has been treated as a Cinderella so far as export promotion is concerned.  We have paid lip service to the industry here for years but have done very little.  As I pointed out, £ for £ tourism has brought in more foreign revenue than any other export programme, but still we treat it in a niggardly way by giving it a pittance to help promotional work.</P>
      <P>I had hoped the Minister would break out of the straitjacket by incorporating such a provision to encourage highly thought of senior people in industry and marketing in the US and in Great Britain to become involved with our tourist industry.  I regret the Minister has implied this is only a vague possibility and I ask him to consider actively supporting my point of view.  We appear to be enslaved in the terminology that I often think is framed deliberately to mislead rather than to elucidate so far as legal terms are concerned.  We appear to be enslaved in the terminology of the 1939 Act but now we are in 1983.  I maintain that some parts of section 10 no longer apply at this time. The next time this comes up the Minister will be facing an amendment from me and there will be a vote on it.</P>

      <P>Last week I dealt with the juvenile liaison officer scheme which appears to have been run down or ignored so much that the job of the officers has become impossible.  They are probably the most frustrated group in the Garda at the moment.  If we are to reduce juvenile crime I suggest that juvenile liaison officers should not be involved in any arrests.  Perhaps they could be engaged in crowd control or office work, but because of their delicate work with juveniles I think it is important they would not be involved in arrest procedures.</P>
      <P>Last week I pointed out the need to distinguish between vandalism, juvenile delinquency, petty crime and major crime.  This Bill does not deal with these areas.  It is in these spheres that the juvenile liaison officers, if the force was built up, could play a vital role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred briefly to drug-related crime which has been increasing enormously in recent years.  It is a national scandal that we have delayed so long in dealing with drug addiction.  Statistics are not available to indicate the number of crimes which are being committed by addicts in order to feed their addiction.  With the exception of Coolmine Therapeutic Community, which is voluntary, there are no residential centres other than prisons for drug addicts when they are convicted. <Col N="1917" /> The prisons do not have any facilities for drug addicts and the result is that the prisons themselves are becoming major centres of drug addiction, trafficking and probably drug distribution.  The Bill does not deal with this matter.  This must be tackled strongly, particularly in Dublin and other urban areas.  There is provision in the Bill to increase the jurisdiction of the District Court which will be able to impose consecutive sentences of up to two years.  That will not provide any solution to the drugs problem.  There is urgent need for closed residential centres geared for the treatment of drug offenders.  The crime of drug-pushing should be given the highest priority.</P>
    <P>A large percentage of those involved in crime are under 21 years but we are still operating under the 1908 Children's Act, a piece of Victorian legislation which has been abolished in the UK but has not been replaced here.  Experts in child care and many organisations have been warning Governments here, particularly in the past 15 years, on the growth in juvenile delinquency and the consequent need for modern methods to deal with this problem.  The Kennedy Report in 1970 and the Task Force Report of 1981 made specific recommendations in this regard but we are still awaiting a new Children's Bill.  I would have thought there would have been a provision in this Bill in this respect but it seems to be designed only for the giving of greater powers to the Garda.</P>
    <P>If we are to counteract properly the growth in crime we should be in a position to identify delinquents and delinquency at an earlier stage to try to ensure that young delinquents will not turn into hardened criminals.  This is all a vital part of crime prevention but it is not dealt with here and consequently the Bill will not have the effects on crime hoped for by the Minister and the Garda.  The Bill should contain an overall plan to bring communities, the Garda, the courts and prison officers together in co-operation. It should also lay out a policy to deal with the enormous personal and environmental problems which are a major cause <Col N="1918" /> of the growth in crime, mostly petty, but serious crime as well.</P>
    <P>Earlier I referred to prison overcrowding and the need for consultation and co-operation among the Garda, the courts and the prisons.  In this respect the recent attitude of the Minister has been most unhelpful.  Good industrial relations play a vital part throughout the economy but they are especially important in the prison system.</P>
    <P>Last week I said the Department of Justice are notoriously outmoded and inept.  They adopt very hard line attitudes. A serious breakdown in industrial relations has occurred in the prisons and it is the Minister's job to try to heal rifts and to ensure that industrial relations in the prisons will be put on a good footing so that the prison system will do the job it is designed for.  The Minister should not be making the rift wider, if there is a rift, between management and workers, or governors and officers.  I hope the Minister will begin to mend fences and ensure there will be serious negotiations.  Management can always put the worst possible outlook on industrial action by workers but in an area like this it is the Minister's job to ensure that both sides will negotiate to work out the problems that exist.</P>
    <P>Our entire criminal legislation needs overhauling.  Last week I referred to the various outmoded Acts through which most convictions come &mdash; the Larceny Act, 1916, the Forgery Act, 1913, the Malicious Damage Act, 1861, the Offences Against the Person Act, 1891, the Vagrancy Act, 1824, Dublin Police Act, 1842, and Children's Act, 1908.  All of these pieces of legislation are used every day in our courts and they need a complete overhaul.  It is also necessary to have a review and overhaul of the whole court procedure to get rid of outdated and pompous attitudes, to speed up procedures and cut down our courts' expenditure. This Criminal Justice Bill on its own will be seen only as merely giving stronger powers to the Garda and will not lead to any increase in detection rates or the prevention of crime.</P>

      <P>I, like most Deputies in <Col N="1919" /> the House, welcome this Bill.  I congratulate the Government and the Minister for bringing it before the House at this time. For far too long a concerned and even frightened public have urged stronger powers for the Garda to deal with the level of lawlessness which has reached unacceptable proportions in any society which has pretentions to describing itself as civilised.  The terrifying escalation of offences against person and property, the increase in violent crimes by gun-bearing thugs, the muggings, the housebreakings, car thefts, intimidation of juries and so on have forced numerous Ministers for Justice in different Governments to examine the law with a view to having it strengthened.</P>
      <P>The evolution of crime has to be matched by a parallel evolution in the powers of the Garda.  New types of crime demand responses from the Garda. Above all, the public need protection against ruthless modern criminals.  I feel this Bill tries to meet the needs of the new situation without upsetting the delicate balance which must always exist between the Garda and the public.  I know that the Minister has gone to great pains to achieve this delicate balance and I feel he has succeeded in this Bill.  I believe that the new proposals in this Bill will be approved by the vast majority of the people because the law abiding public for a long time have demanded such action by responsible Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A survey was carried out recently which established that Dubliners on average are likely to be victims of crime relating to property or personal injury at the hands of criminals once every three years.  Every politician who represents an urban area is well aware of this.  One has only to walk around one's constituency to see how this problem affects the people at large.  I could give numerous examples of this but I feel it is generally accepted that in all sections of the community people now live with a certain amount of fear and risk.  It affects all areas of my constituency, the higher income group and the lower income group.  It is sadder when it affects the lower income groups. I know numerous old people who are <Col N="1920" /> terrified living on their own.  The situation has now been reached in Dublin Corporation where old people are afraid to accept accommodation on the ground floor.</P>
    <P>I could tell the House about numerous sad cases but I came across a most tragic one recently.  A young girl who lives less than a stone's throw from this House in an area which I represent, had taken her young child to school.  She lived in one of the corporation flats and when she went back home she found the hall-door broken down and her flat burgled.  All the little treasures which meant so much to her had been taken, most of all her engagement ring.  In view of this and many other cases like it, is it surprising that the reaction of some of the public is that this Bill does not go far enough?  I am pleased about the support the Opposition have given to this Bill.  The Leader of the Opposition was reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 28 October as stating:</P>
    <P>We are certainly in full support of this Bill.  We believe there must be a Bill, not that it will be the whole answer.  As far as we are concerned action is called for on the law and order front.  It is not an exaggeration to say that in some areas law and order has broken down.  The sad situation must be tackled from a number of different directions.  Change in the criminal law is only one of them.  There are many other things that can be done and must be done.  Therefore, I am prepared, and I think the general public are prepared, to sacrifice some precious and cherished liberty in order to tackle this crisis.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased to note that the spokesman for Justice in the Opposition, Deputy Woods, also supported the Bill in principle in his Second Reading speech.</P>
    <P>There are areas in this Bill which will be discussed in more detail on Committee Stage.  I am sure the Minister will have an open mind and will agree to any improvements that will be made in the Bill.  The Bill proposes to give the Garda power to detain for six hours, or longer in certain circumstances, those suspected <Col N="1921" /> of certain crimes.  This power applies to indictable offences, punishable by a term of imprisonment of five years or longer and only where the Garda have power of arrest on warrant.  As I understand it at the moment the Garda have no power to hold a suspect for questioning.  They can only question him if he agrees and if he wishes to go free he is free to do so.  I find it encouraging that the Bill sets out with some clarity the circumstances under which such suspects may be detained. Hitherto it was an area of considerable vagueness which gave rise to allegations of abuse by the Garda.  Now there will be no excuse for gardaí overstepping the mark in their efforts to obtain information from suspects.</P>
    <P>The initial period of six hours must be sanctioned on reasonable grounds by the garda in charge of the station and a further six hours must also be sanctioned by a chief superintendent and he must record that sanction in writing.  A further safeguard is that the person detained must be told that he can consult a solicitor and that his family is also notified about his detention.  I believe the vast majority of the public agree that the powers of detention proposed in the Bill are reasonable and necessary.  The Garda must be given every means necessary to investigate serious crimes and to bring to justice the criminals responsible.  One of the most effective ways of doing this is to give them the power of detaining and questioning those who are reasonably suspected of having committed such crimes.  We have heard that most modern police forces have such power.  I find it hard to believe that under our law the Garda must operate without what most people would consider are powers that are absolutely necessary for the investigation of serious crimes.</P>
    <P>I believe that the period of detention proposed in the Bill is the shortest that would be of any practical use to the Garda in the course of their investigations. I believe that anything less than that would not be of any use at all, especially if we take into account the time which has to be spent going through the usual formalities when the person is brought to the Garda station.  As well as <Col N="1922" /> that, we must also take into account the amount of time spent in consulting a solicitor.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to the suggestion by Deputy Woods that where a six hour period of detention is extended during the daytime on the authority of a chief superintendent that there should be a break between these two periods.  If a break is to be given between two periods of detention the effect will be to make the overall period of detention longer by the lenght of the break.  In addition, the Deputy seems to be taking it for granted that the periods of detention will be used by the Garda only for the purpose of questioning and that there will be nonstop questioning of a person detained for the whole period.  This is not the way I understand the position.  What I am told is that the questioning must not continue longer than a period of four hours without a break for refreshment and rest. These are the present instructions which the Garda operate under.  Presumably these instructions will remain in force and there will be no need to make provision for a break between the two six hour periods.  As well as that, the period of detention may be used for investigation of statements made by suspects or forensic testing of items taken from them by the Garda.  So, there would be long periods in which there would be no questioning at all.</P>
    <P>Another important section of the Bill is section 5, which gives the Garda power to search, photograph and fingerprint suspects and to make forensic tests for firearms, et cetera.  However, these measures can only be carried out under the authority of a superintendent.  These powers will give an opportunity to the Garda to combat serious crime.  Unlike Deputy Mac Giolla I think this is a very important aspect of the Bill and that the power given to the Garda in this section will give them a great opportunity of overcoming the crimes that are being committed in present times.  As the Minister has stated, if the Garda are to have any reasonable prospect of success in dealing with crime they must have these powers.  I can understand that some people will be very sensitive about the <Col N="1923" /> possibility of being fingerprinted, but I am happy that the Minister is taking every possible safeguard in providing in quite explicit terms that the Garda must destroy the records and every copy that exists if the person is not prosecuted or if he is acquitted.  I welcome the suggestion of Deputy Woods that there should be a system of bringing complaints because it must be seen by the public that the Minister's intentions are carried out in full.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the proposals to increase the level of penalties for the unauthorised taking of cars.  The huge increase in offences of this kind in recent times has had the most terrible consequences, not only as regards property destroyed or damaged but more seriously as regards lives lost.  Parents and families of innocent victims killed by criminals of this kind have been subjected to untold misery and distress.  Their grief and sorrow has been exacerbated and insult has been added to injury quite often when they hear that the criminals responsible have committed further offences of this kind while on bail and when prosecuted in the courts get off very lightly.  We owe it to the families and parents of such victims to come down heavily on these criminals and to make very effort to stamp out this type of offence.  The penalties proposed in the Bill will go a long way to help to remove this sort of problem from our community.</P>
    <P>Stealing cars is often the first step in the organisation and carrying out of serious crime such as armed robbery and kidnapping, but it is very often carried out by juveniles in the course of joy riding. It has been suggested by people who are concerned about this problem, and the spokesman for the Opposition has put forward the suggestion in relation to juvenile crime generally, that the parents of young offenders should be made responsible for the offences and damage caused by their children.  I am told that there are provisions to this effect in existing law, in the Childrens Act, 1908, but that they do not seem to have been used by the courts for many years.  Many people would support such an idea but <Col N="1924" /> difficulty might arise if parents are punished for offences they have not committed. A provision on the lines suggested would not be proper to this Bill.  It might be more appropriate for a Bill dealing with children.  I am sure that Deputy Mac Giolla will be pleased to know that such a Bill is being prepared at present.</P>
    <P>It is good to see that something is now being done to get at suppliers of firearms and receivers of stolen property.  Some people have criticised these proposals on the grounds that they might encourage the use of informers in our society.  This is because the proposals protect people who give information from having that information used against them in criminal proceedings.  It is vital if we want to reduce violent crimes to bring to justice persons who make profits by supplying sawn-off shotguns and other equipment to others.  The same is true of those who deal in stolen goods.  It is the duty of anyone who has information to give that information to the Garda.  This duty is more important and must override the principle of the right to remain silent. There could be no apology for the provision in the Bill requiring that such information be given to the Garda.  As regards protection for the person giving information, it is only right and fair that a person who gives information to the Garda should not have that information used against him.</P>
    <P>I welcome the section which requires an accused person to give notice of any alibi he proposes to rely on at his trial. This will end the situation whereby the prosecution may have to answer in court an alibi that they had been unable to check because the accused was under no obligation to tell them.  Courts do not stop trials to let the prosecution investigate a matter.  It may not always be possible to challenge an alibi that appears out of the blue.  If there is advance notice it may have the result of charges being dropped before the trial if the alibi stands up.  The arguments for such a provision are based on commonsense.</P>
    <P>The proposal to introduce majority verdicts will be widely welcomed.  That will help to prevent the very real danger of jurors being threatened or intimidated <Col N="1925" /> by vicious thugs who are prepared to stop at nothing to avoid the punishment their criminal activities deserve.</P>
    <P>I now want to turn to the question of bail.  Every reasonable citizen will welcome the section dealing with the question of bail.  For too long criminals have used the right to bail to commit further crimes.  I am pleased to note also that under the Bill the courts will be required to impose consecutive sentences and I also welcome the provision whereby a new offence is committed where there is failure to comply with the conditions for bail.</P>
    <P>It was surprising to hear Deputy Woods saying that he does not see the need for section 25, which deals with proceedings after arrest.  Most people will agree that if there is any doubt about a provision of the existing criminal law we have an obligation to settle that doubt once and for all.  This is what section 25 is mainly about.  We cannot tolerate a position where criminals who are clearly guilty might get off because of a doubt or loophole in the law.  There is a clear duty to prevent the possibility of such a thing happening.  What is being proposed in the section, we have been told, is to make it perfectly clear that anyone who is charged, whether arrested on a warrant or without a warrant, must be brought as soon as possible before a court.  This is perfectly reasonable and it is only commonsense to provide that someone who is charged late at night need not be brought before the court until the next morning.  The Minister explained that this is existing law as laid down by the courts and it is only right that it should now be on a statutory basis.  It is a bit unfair to have peace commissioners called out of their beds in the middle of the night to deal with someone charged with offences who could just as easily be brought before a court a few hours later. In any event, as the Minister has told us, the accused person will be charged and cannot be questioned by the Garda after that.  It is difficult to see, therefore, what possible problem can arise on this section.</P>
    <P>Section 26 is by far the most important in the Bill.  It empowers the Minister to <Col N="1926" /> make regulations to make recordings by tape or even video of the questioning of suspects.  I am pleased to note that the Government are committed to introducing an appropriate system without any unnecessary delay and the Minister should treat this with the urgency it deserves.  When such a system is introduced it will be a foolproof way of ensuring that citizens in custody are not abused or that the Garda are not maliciously accused of abusing them.</P>
    <P>The Garda at present have no general power to obtain a warrant to search a premises for evidence in relation to serious crimes.  I was surprised that this was not provided for in the Bill.  The Minister explained the difficulties of making such a provision but he suggested for the consideration of this House a provision, very restrictive in its scope, which would allow a Garda superintendent to obtain a warrant on sworn information before a district justice, to search premises only &mdash; and I stress only &mdash; when the district justice was satisfied that there was evidence relating to serious crime, namely, murder, kidnapping, serious offences against the person or rape.  Such a provision under these very strict conditions would be justified.</P>
    <P>The safeguards in the Bill, along with the independent procedure which the Minister intends to set up, deal with complaints against the Garda.  It will give protection to the rights and well-being of persons in Garda custody.  It is clear to any fair-minded person that the Government have given a lot of attention to this aspect of the Bill and they are anxious that the new powers will not operate unfairly against an accused person or interfere with his basic right to a fair trial. As regards the timing of the introduction of the new complaints procedure, the spokesman for the Opposition appears to see something unusual in the fact that proposals were not put forward at the same time as the Bill was published. However, most sensible people agree that it is quite proper that these proposals should not be rushed through simply for the sake of meeting a deadline.  It is essential, whatever form of procedure is introduced, that we get it right the first time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1927" /> A procedure which the public do not accept and which does not have their full confidence would be worse than no procedure. I have been told that in England a complaints procedure was introduced more than 20 years ago but that it was found to be unsatisfactory in practice.  It was widely criticised and changes were made in the procedure, but it still gives rise to much public criticism and now further changes are proposed in the Police and Criminal Evidence Bill which was recently introduced there.  It is important in the light of that experience to see that a procedure set up will be acceptable to the public and the Garda and will stand the test of time.  A procedure produced in a hurry could well prove to be no safeguard.  The Minister is fully justified in his decision to bring forward the proposals for an independent complaints procedure only when all aspects have been fully considered.  Any sensible person would agree with that decision.</P>
    <P>I should like to commend the Minister and the Government for bringing in this much needed Bill.  They may rest assured that the majority of right thinking people will give them full support in their efforts to bring to an end the appalling crime and vandalism which exists today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not be as effusive in my welcome of the Bill as has been suggested by the previous speaker in his valuable contribution to the legislation now before the House.  In anticipation of any criticisms I may bring down upon myself, either in the House or elsewhere, I should like to place on the record that nobody in the House is more supportive of the Garda Síochána than myself.  My contribution, in the light of my support for the Garda and for the institutions of State generally, may be seen to be in ease and in aid of that organisation and of the institutions generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not give an across the board welcome to the Bill.  The Bill in its completeness, as produced by the Minister for Justice, certainly does not meet the criteria that I would request of a Bill as important as this.  It is extremely significant legislation, probably the most significant <Col N="1928" /> which the House will have to consider during the currency of this Dáil. The history of criminal legislation shows that the topic is only rarely the subject of legislative intervention.  There were three previous Bills on criminal law, apart from special enactments dealing with subversive crime, the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, and the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967.  It is likely, therefore, that this proposal, if passed, will affect the administration of criminal justice, and indeed the liberty of the citizen, for a considerable period to come.  It would be improper and wrong if the Bill received anything but the fullest consideration from Deputies.</P>
    <P>The proposals in the Bill cannot be summarised briefly.  It contains a large number of specific innovations, some clearly good, some indifferent or debatable and some which are radically misconceived. I do not doubt that the Bill as a whole is advanced as a genuine contribution to, as Deputy Doyle said, one of the most serious problems affecting us, particularly in the city and county of Dublin &mdash; indeed, all large cities are affected by the growing problem of criminal activity.  It is right that it should be discussed in a non-partisan spirit and I hope that my own contribution will be seen in that light.  The end result of a non-partisan contribution would be the production of the best possible legislation.</P>
    <P>A debate in this House too rarely makes a significant contribution to the framing of legislation, so it is encouraging that on this occasion the Minister has announced in advance his openness to proposals from all sources for the improvement of the Bill.  There are proposals in the Bill which must meet with general approval&mdash;for example, the proposal concerning offences committed by persons who are at the time of the commission of the crime, already on bail in relation to a previous alleged offence is very timely.</P>
    <P>Irish jurisprudence in relation to liberty pending trial is one of the most advanced in the world and our courts, particularly in the well-documented case of the Attorney General <i>v.</i> O'Callaghan <Col N="1929" /> may be said to have given a lead to all common law jurisdictions on the matter of bail.  Bail in ordinary circumstances is a right, not a privilege, and were it otherwise it would be an intolerable injustice to those charged with offences but subsequently acquitted.  In this context it is clearly essential that measures should be taken to discourage those who have little doubt that they will be convicted and sentenced to imprisonment and who therefore feel they may commit further crime with impunity since the sentences will be concurrent rather than consecutive. I believe that the proposal in the Bill will be warmly welcomed by all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>I hope that the proposals in relation to increasing sentences for the unauthorised taking of motor cars will command general support. This offence, particularly in Dublin over week-ends, takes place so regularly that every car owner can expect to be a victim of it at some time and perhaps more than once.  My experience in that regard is that my own car was stolen last Thursday week.  Thanks to the Garda and the assistance of civic-minded people it was returned to me 12 hours later.  No later than last Thursday my car was broken into outside my home.  As Deputy Doyle said, the possibility of citizens in this country being untouched by crime is remote.  That was my experience in the last couple of weeks.  On two occasions I have been touched by the criminal element in our society.</P>
    <P>The proposal in relation to increasing sentences for the unauthorised taking of cars is to be welcomed.  The present state of affairs constitutes a grave threat to individual car owners and it has serious consequences for ordinary social life. Those of us who come into the centre of the city from the safety of suburbia &mdash; though that is becoming less safe &mdash; to, say, the theatre in the evening come out to see lines of cars parked down side lanes with their windscreens broken, as I have seen on two occasions in recent months. That is a sinister development, very much to the detriment of the theatre, cinema and entertainment generally, the development of urban Dublin and the quality <Col N="1930" /> of life.  I ask the Minister, who has indicated a willingness to listen, to consider making statutory provision in the Bill for some of these additional offences.  Pick-pocketing, for example, comes readily to mind.  Handbag-snatching in the centre of Dublin has reached almost epidenic proportions and has caused an appreciable number of people, particularly the elderly, to fear a trip to the O'Connell Street area.  The Minister should consider a statutory deterrent to this type of crime in addition to the statutory deterrent to car stealing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla in his contribution &mdash; valuable by his lights; there was much of it that I did not agree with, although I agreed with some of it and do not take exception to what he said &mdash; raised the question of the administration of justice in the Courts.  The Bill makes a number of proposals in that regard.  Most practitioners would favour the provisions which allow formal uncontrovertible evidence to be &ldquo;read into the record&rdquo; with the consequent saving of time and expense at trials.  It is true that the provision puts an increased burden on those engaged for the defence since they must state whether they require oral evidence and, as a consequence, the opportunity to cross-examine on the evidence so tendered within a specified time.  But this will have proved well worth while if the length of trials, and thus delay in cases coming into the list for trials, can be reduced.</P>
    <P>The section in the Bill proposing majority verdicts in criminal cases is another serious but, in my opinion, welcome departure from present practice and on balance I am prepared to support it.  Practical experience suggests that an 11 to one disagreement is just as likely to occur when the majority favour acquittal as where they favour conviction and a second trial can be an intolerable burden, psychologically as well as financially, on the defendant.  Equally, the rare cases where a single unreasonable and intransigent juror obstructs a conviction which is clearly called for on the evidence will disappear.  However, I hope that where disagreement still results from a trial under the majority system the DPP will give very serious consideration before <Col N="1931" /> ordering a second trial in circumstances in which even a weighted majority of the first jury has been unable to agree.  In such a case consideration of time, expense, probability of success and the anxiety involved for the defendant and other parties suggest that a second trial should be the exception rather than the rule.</P>
    <P>The proposal that the defendant should be obliged to give notice of an alibi seems eminently reasonable.  Since this type of defence is met with comparatively seldom it would not have a great impact on the administration of justice generally.  Furthermore, the provision that in all cases the defending counsel will have the final right of reply is enlightened and reasonable.  It seems only proper that the defendant or his representative should be able to answer everything the prosecution has alleged against him before the case goes to the jury.</P>
    <P>I hope that, having welcomed these proposals, there can be no suggestion that we on this side are opposing for the sake of opposition or opposing every section of the Bill for the sake of doing so.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Having endorsed the sections I have just mentioned, which I believe I conscientiously can, I trust that what I have to say about those provisions about which I have serious reservations will be taken in good part by the Government, within my own party and within the House generally.  I believe the Ceann Comhairle&mdash;it is not fair to involve him &mdash;as an eminent jurist in his day would, if he were not sitting in that Chair, agree with me in what I have to say.  I will not, of course, embarrass him.</P>
    <P>Section 5 proposes a radical alteration in the powers of the District Court which, since the foundation of the State, has been in the nature of things limited to imposing a maximum period of imprisonment of 12 months.  This was reasonable because trial in the District Court was held without a jury in a summary fashion and without previous notice to the accused of evidence to be tendered.  This limitation was reasonable because, under the Constitution, the trial in the District <Col N="1932" /> Court can only take place where the offence is a &ldquo;minor&rdquo; offence.  In the past superior courts have been critical on occasion of district justices for accepting jurisdiction in offences which could not possibly be described as minor.  This not only deprives the accused of the right of trial on indictment and by jury but it deprives the community of the vindication of a proper sentence for a serious offence.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that some case can be made for the extension of the District Court jurisdiction as it has been extended in civil cases.  Unfortunately section 5, as drafted, does not make it clear what precisely is intended and I would ask the Minister of State to bring to the attention of the Minister, when he is responding to this Second Stage debate, the need for clarifying exactly what is intended under this section as drafted.  He should explain &mdash; there is no obligation on him to do so &mdash; the phrase &ldquo;previously sentenced&rdquo;. This leaves it unclear if that phrase extends to a situation where the accused appears, as he not uncommonly does, on four separate summary charges and the District Court, having imposed a sentence on the first charge, is entitled to regard the accused as previously sentenced for the purpose of aggregating the sentences on the remaining charges.  I have no intention of engaging in a purely hypothetical critique of these sections and I hope my remarks will be taken in the spirit in which they are offered.  My position at the moment is that I am helpfully teasing out a section which causes me considerable conscientious concern. If a District Court is constitutionally a court of local and limited jurisdiction any ambiguity is rightly to be interpreted by superior courts as against the extended power.</P>
    <P>The Bill is not without other ambiguities and obscurities of draftsmanship but none, with the exception of an aspect of section 3, of such fundamental effect as section 5.  This section as drafted is not, I appreciate, intended to be devious or misleading; quite the contrary.  I worked in the Department of Justice as a Minister of State and the people there are of the highest integrity.  It cannot be suggested <Col N="1933" /> they are imbued with a deep spirit of liberality.  They are, as I say, people of the highest integrity and I am not charging any wrong-doing to them in the drafting of this Bill.  All I am suggesting is there is ambiguity in section 5 which requires to be clarified and, if the Minister when he comes to reply explains to my satisfaction, if not to the satisfaction of the Opposition spokesman on Justice, so be it.</P>
    <P>I turn now to aspects of the Bill about which I have fundamental reservations, namely, sections 3, 16 and 17, but specifically sections 3 and 16.  Section 17 may be a restatement of section 16 for particular and specific purposes.  Shortly, these sections amount to a revolution in our criminal jurisprudence which would entirely transform the role of the courts in criminal trials.  They seriously undermine certain well-established rights of citizens.  They contain the potential to undermine the role of the Garda by exposing them to an unending series of cases where the verdict will depend upon the word of the garda against that of the citizen rather than on hard evidence.</P>
    <P>It is very noteworthy that the operative part of this revolution is a direct copy of a British proposal&mdash;the eleventh Report of the Criminal Law Revision Committee of 1972, which was decisively rejected in its country of origin.  It is unfortunate that 11 years later it should receive such uncritical acceptance by the Government and the Minister for Justice.  I believe the Minister is willing to listen and, having heard me discourse on this section 16, he will come back to the House and amend this section by totally expurgating it from the Bill.  Within my own party I would certainly be proposing that we in Opposition should oppose section 16 in its entirety.  If that proposal is not accepted, so be it.  That will be parliamentary policy. As of now, I see myself in difficulty on this section.</P>
    <P>Five sections of this Bill provide for a situation in which it would be compulsory for a citizen to speak to the police.  Those sections are section 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18. In sections 14 and 15 the penalty for non-compliance is a prison sentence. Happily, this is mitigated by the provision <Col N="1934" /> that a statement made following a requirement under these sections cannot be used in evidence against the person or his or her spouse.  Section 16 is of general application.  It provides a compulsion by a threat that an inference may be drawn from a failure to mention at the investigatory or charging stage a fact subsequently relied on in the defence.  I am mainly concerned about section 16.  I have a deep concern about its unreality. It is an almost verbatim copy, as I said earlier, of clause (1) of the draft Criminal Evidence Bill published in the interim report of 1972.  It is reasonable to assume that the thinking underlying the present proposal is substantially that set out in that report and to use that committee material to elucidate the proposal.  It may also be significant that the report was rejected in its country of origin, namely Great Britain, and attracted opposition from the Judiciary, the Bar, the Law Society and numerous academics.  It has been replaced as a discussion document by the 1981 Report of the Royal Commission on Criminal Procedure which specifically rejected any change in the right to silence.</P>
    <P>I am suggesting &mdash; and I am not criticising the Department of Justice who are not here to defend themselves&mdash;that this section was not an original thought or plan or approach to the Bill, as I understand it.  Again the Minister can clear the air in that respect.  The thinking behind section 16 is a direct lift from proposals which were suggested in the United Kingdom and rejected there because they were unacceptable to members of the Judiciary, members of the Bar, practitioners generally and, as I have already said, academics.  This is a very serious situation.  We are engaging in that slavish custom of running to the British House of Commons for our own law, but we have the Brehon laws and had our own laws and practices before the common law was forced upon us.  We should be original.  That is what causes part of the concern about the inclusion of section 16 in the Bill as presently drafted.</P>
    <P>There is evidence that the priority given to the right to silence under section 16 reflects, as I say, a misconceived <Col N="1935" /> approach to the problem of crime and even a misconceived approach to the problem of crime detection itself.  There is no evidence that the police are, in fact, hampered to any great degree by the exercise of the right to silence.  The summary of the 1981 Report states at page 7:</P>
    <P>Research has indicated that the right is not used by many suspects.  The vast majority make some sort of statement.</P>
    <P>This view appears to be shared by our own O'Briain Report of 1977 which appears to accept the statement that &ldquo;confessions&rdquo; are the cause of detection of 80 per cent of serious crimes.  Figures of that order are compatible with the experience of practitioners.  Occasionally the case is met of the person who starts to resolve to say nothing and does not deviate from that resolve.  Far more common, indeed far more deserving of research and inquiry, is the case of a person who starts resolved to say nothing but in a remarkably short time in a police station or elsewhere changes his mind completely than the case of the person who starts with an explanation of innocence and in a remarkably short time exchanges this for a confession.  These phenomena are largely unexplained and are statistically of much greater significance than the isolated cases of reliance on the right to silence.</P>
    <P>We must discuss the effect of section 16.  Under that section an inference adverse to an accused person may be drawn from his failure at the pre-trial stage to mention any fact &ldquo;relied on in his defence&rdquo; if the fact is such that he could &ldquo;reasonably have been expected to mention it&rdquo;.  The failure to mention may also be treated as corroboration of any evidence in relation to which the failure is material.  The pre-trial stage in which the failure to mention may take place is broken down into four sub-categories &mdash;(a) on being questioned by a garda endeavouring to ascertain whether an offence has been committed, (b) on being questioned by a garda endeavouring to ascertain by whom an offence has been <Col N="1936" /> committed, (c) on being charged with the offence, or (d) on being informed by a member of the Garda Síochána that he might be prosecuted for that offence.</P>
    <P>It is noteworthy that the provisions of this section apply to every offence once the effect of the section has been explained to the accused in ordinary language. If I may just divert here for a moment, it would need to be explained in ordinary language.  If the section is brought into law, which I hope it will not be, the draftsmen themselves should have another look at it.  Certainly, it is not couched in ordinary language.  I know that it must be explained, or an attempt made to explain it in ordinary language to the accused, but section 16 as presently drafted, apart altogether from what it expresses, is one of the greatest pieces of legislative gobbledegook ever to come before this House.  It represents a lawyer's paradise and a hell-hole for the accused.  If the accused, as he is entitled to do, wishes to defend himself in certain circumstances, he will pick up section 16 of this Bill, then an Act, and try to interpret it.  I believe that at the end of the day he will be committed for insanity.  It is a disgraceful piece of drafting and leaves a great deal to be desired.  That is not a criticism of anything or anybody, because I have never been in the business of criticism, but I am just pointing out the realities.  That is what we are about on this Bill and we must help the House to bring about legislation which is comprehensible and understandable to the so-called lowliest citizen, the ordinary man in the street.</P>
    <P>It is also noteworthy that the four situations in which failure to mention, as I have already indicated, may take place are all stages at which, typically, the accused does not have access to legal advice.  Every accused sent forward for trial has been asked at the end of the preliminary cross-examination in the District Court whether he wishes to say anything and at this stage he has almost invariably had access to legal advice. Also at this stage there is the facility for and an obligation to record verbatim what he said, yet this formal stage is excluded from the section.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1937" /> The section concerns itself with the time of the investigation where there is generally no legal advice, certainly no impartial recording system, when the accused is more than likely to be in custody and without advice.  That flies in the face of everything that we believe in concerning jurisprudence in this country.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, once the effect of this section has been explained or said to have been explained, there is no necessity that the person being questioned need even be a suspect at the time of the questioning to which the alleged failure relates.  In other words, an entirely casual conversation could be sufficient to bring the section into operation.</P>
    <P>It is also noteworthy that the section does not confer any right on the Garda to information in general or to any specific sort of information.  We are here under this section attempting to assist the Garda.  It does the very reverse.  Accordingly, no specific use can be made of it by the Garda at the investigation stage.  It comes into practical effect only in the event of certain things transpiring at a subsequent trial.  It would therefore appear to be directed at increasing the already high conviction rate, rather than the detection of crime which is where improvements should be sought.</P>
    <P>Again, it is noteworthy that the English report from which the inspiration for almost all the wording of section 19 proceeds takes a broad view of the meaning of the phrase &ldquo;relied on in his defence&rdquo;. At paragraph 36 of that report it is stated:</P>
    <P>Usually we think it would be sufficiently clear from the cross-examination of the witnesses for the Prosecution whether a fact is being relied on in this way and then the Prosecution would be able to adduce evidence that the accused did not mention it when interrogated.</P>
    <P>It seems therefore that the section would be available for use even against an accused who does not give evidence. Lord Devlin likened the English proposal put forward by his own contemporaries to an amendment to a civil procedure whereby a defendant on being served <Col N="1938" /> with a writ had to go immediately to the office of the plaintiff's solicitor and there submit to interrogation, without advice, on his defence to the statement of claim which had not yet been delivered.</P>
    <P>In three of the four situations in which the section may be operated, the charge itself, and <i>a fortiori</i> the evidence to be adduced in support of it, is entirely hypothetical. The great majority of people will have no idea what is or is not material to their defence and considerable research and consultation may be necessary before their legal advisers come to a conclusion on this matter.  Many matters raised in cross-examination may be raised in a purely exploratory manner or for the purposes of exclusion.  It would be an intolerable burden on the conduct of a defence if the cross-examiner had to keep in mind, in relation to every topic, the prospect of giving rise to an &ldquo;inference&rdquo; under the section.</P>
    <P>Again, the section seems to assume that the type of matter relied on in defence is sufficiently simple and straightforward to be within the knowledge and understanding of the average person questioned &mdash; we are talking about the ordinary person in the street &mdash; so that there is no reason he should not mention it to the police.  In fact, in an English investigation of 324 jury trials 120 only turned on straight forward physical facts and the rest on more complicated matters such as intention, knowledge, self-defence and so on.  It is simply unreal to expect a suspect to dilate on such a defence without advice.</P>
    <P>It is noteworthy that section 16 goes further than merely encroaching on the right to silence.  It does so in a specific way, by seeking to compel the defendant to reveal his defence.  That is one of the most serious defects of section 16, that the defendant should be requested, urged or compelled to reveal his defence.</P>
    <P>It places emphasis on the extra judicial interrogation and this emphasis will in fact become the dominant element in many criminal trials.  It carries the substantial risk of an individual being convicted, not because there is evidence against him in the traditional sense of the term but because he is ignorant of the <Col N="1939" /> law or too cross-grained or too distrustful of the Garda, or too inarticulate, to have put his defence immediately and without advice, or simply because he has done so but it has not been recorded.  Jeremy Bentham, on the subject of extra judicial interrogations, said two centuries ago:</P>
    <P>The information derived from (them) is necessarily incomplete and fallacious; for how much of what the accused may have said extra-judicially reaches the Judge?  Only so much as the opposing witness is able and willing to recollect; and even in this what security is there for the accuracy of his memory and the veracity of his character?</P>
    <P>The English Criminal Bar Association have listed a large number of reasons, compatible with innocence, whereby a person might abstain from making his defence in the circumstances envisaged by this horror section.  Many of these are self-evident after a little thought, but to them I would add that to disclose one's defence, before the trial has begun and before it is even certain that it will take place at all, to the agent of the adverse party, who may or may not record it and who may even be in a position, if he wishes, to destroy the evidence on which it is based if he knows of it, in all cases calls for an act of faith and in some cases would be extremely unwise.</P>
    <P>Since almost all criminal trials at present contain evidence in relation to what the accused said, or the fact that he did not say anything, it is reasonable to expect that this section would be relevant to almost every case of crime coming before the court.  It seems likely that each effort to apply the section would involve an issue or trial within a trial.  This trial would involve matters of both fact in law and at least 12 such issues could arise. They are:</P>
    <P>(1)  It would be necessary to establish in all cases that there was questioning before a charge either to discover whether a crime had been committed or to discover who had committed it.</P>
    <P>(2)  Alternatively there would have to <Col N="1940" /> be proof of a charge or that the suspect was informed that he might be prosecuted.</P>
    <P>(3)  There would then be an issue as to whether an explanation in ordinary language of the effect of section 16 sub-section 1 had been given.</P>
    <P>(4)  Whether the explanation explained the section correctly and whether the language was in fact ordinary and comprehensible.</P>
    <P>(5)  There would in many cases be an issue as to whether a particular fact was, or was not &ldquo;relied on&rdquo; in the defence.</P>
    <P>(6)  Whether it was a fact which was or was not mentioned by the accused to the police and, if not,</P>
    <P>(7)  Whether it was a fact which could reasonably be expected to have been mentioned.</P>
    <P>(8)  The question of whether any, and if so which, inferences could be &ldquo;proper&rdquo; would arise in every case and in many cases the question of,</P>
    <P>(9)  Whether such inference was capable of corroborating any evidence in the case would also arise.</P>
    <P>(10)  The question of whether there was any evidence in relation to which the failure is material would also arise and a number of general issues would be present in every case such as,</P>
    <P>(11)  Whether the circumstances of the questioning, apart from the section, were such as to make it admissible and (12)  whether the questions and the answers to them had in fact been correctly recorded.</P>
    <P>The above 12 examples are by no means an exhaustive list of the possible issues which might arise in the operation of the section but probably exhausts those likely to be met in daily practice. They are very self evident.  When the Minister comes to explaining the section as drafted, and his philosophy and meaning, will he deal with the points I raised?</P>

      <P>The Chair has been worried for some time about the Deputy's contribution.  The Deputy of course must deal with sections to which he has fundamental objection but Second Stage is not intended to be a Stage when <Col N="1941" /> each section is gone into in detail with a fine comb.

      <P>I agree with the Chair but this section is so fundamental and important that when it comes to Committee Stage I do not believe I will have an opportunity to discourse for as long as I would wish to.  That is why I am putting the Minister on notice.  I accept the point the Chair is making.  The Chair is correct in principle but this Bill is perhaps one of the most important pieces of legislation the House will see in the history of this Dáil.  Section 16 is so fundamental to the change in jurisprudential attitudes &mdash; it proposes to revolutionise certain aspects of our law&mdash;that it must be dealt with in depth.  All I am doing is trying to assist the Minister to prepare a better Bill.</P>

      <P>I sympathise with the Deputy and I know the importance he attaches to the Bill and what may be involved in it, but perhaps the Deputy would be discharging his duty if he put the Minister on notice that in his opinion sections so-and-so amount to so-and-so or involve so-and-so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to mention one final point, and it relates to the constitutionality of the proposal and its compatibility with the present principles of law.  Reservations must be had on the constitutionality of the proposals.  These reservations substantially depend on the view of the privilege against self-incrimination, expressed in the maxim, no one may be compelled to incriminate himself before the law.  It is summed up in the legal phrase, <i>&ldquo;nemo tenetur se ipsum accusare&rdquo;.</i> That is a fundamental legal law that goes to the root of what I am saying in relation to section 16 and this is where the constitutionality aspect may arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Support can be had for this point of view in the case of the State <i>(McCarthy) v. Lennon,</i> (1936) <i>Irish Reports,</i> page 485, which was dealing with a statute amending the Constitution by legislative act as was possible under the then Free <Col N="1942" /> State Government.  In that case one of the majority said:</P>
    <P>That a person accused should be compelled to answer questions which tend to incriminate him, and that the answers given by him under compulsion should be used to obtain his conviction, is undoubtedly contrary to the Common Law of England and the Constitution of a country with ideals such as those of the United States, and was contrary to the Constitution of the Free State as originally adopted.</P>
    <P>The Chair has asked me not to deal in detail&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be unfair to the Deputy or to interfere with his line of argument.  All I am saying is that I do not think our procedure intends that each section should be teased out with a fine comb and in detail but that does not mean that any Deputy is not entitled to put the Minister on notice of what he thinks the section means. When it comes to Committee Stage, within reason &mdash; and reason would be very generous &mdash; the Deputy would be entitled to argue and counter-argue on each section.</P>

      <P>When it is realised that the provisions of section 16 will be operated with the broadened powers of arrest under section 3, the extent of the transformation in our system of criminal justice will be apparent.  When one combines the proposals in section 3 with those in section 16 the revolution is almost complete. Heretofore, apart from arrests under the Special Offences Against the State Act, arrest has merely been a mechanism for securing the attendance of the accused at court.  There was a requirement that the arrested person should be brought before a court as soon as practicable. For the first time in relation to non-subversive offences this Bill proposes the introduction of extra-judicial interrogation in the context of custody. This is revolutionary.  Obviously the Bill was introduced to have it discussed in this democratic Parliament, but sections 3 and 16 must be seen together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1943" /> The sections are likely to undermine the image of the Garda in the eyes of many sectors in the community.  We do not want that.  We want to be seen supporting the Garda Síochána and the institutions of State.  I am glad to see Deputy Shatter in the House.  He and other Deputies must support me in my comments on section 16.  I believe certain members of the Government have reservations about it.  I know how the parliamentary process operates and I do not expect to hear members of the Government coming out in opposition to the section.  They have collective responsibility: they have a discussion on the matter, a vote is taken and they are amenable to that decision.  The majority of the Government have decided on section 16, but surely there are some voices on the backbenches of the Government parties who will support me in what appears to be my lone and lonely opposition to section 16 and section 3.  In the 1970s I opposed a certain Criminal Justice Bill much to my disadvantage and I see myself in the same position almost 14 years later. At least I cannot be accused of being inconsistent.  My opposition to section 16 is not new: rather it is based on a consistent attitude as to what should be contained in our criminal and civil law.</P>
    <P>The section is likely to undermine the image of the Garda in the eyes of many in our society.  Furthermore, experience has shown it is a wasteful and inefficient policing tool.  Most recent figures for the operation of the Offences Against the State Act show there are nine arrests under that Act for every one person charged as a result of such an arrest. These figures call for more explanation. No explanation is generally forthcoming because the Garda, if asked for the reasons for an arrest, will generally and possibly properly claim privilege.  However, when I say &ldquo;possibly&rdquo; there is a question mark in my mind after that word.  It is difficult to see how the increased powers of arrest can be adequately supervised as no details have been forthcoming of the proposed complaints tribunal.  Deputy Doyle in his valuable contribution said the Bill should be <Col N="1944" /> introduced before the complaints tribunal but I do not agree with that.  The reverse should be the case.  I should have thought the Minister had an obligation to bring forward the complaints tribunal and to have that matter and the Bill discussed more or less side by side.  Whatever regulations or legislation may be necessary for the complaints tribunal should be set alongside the proposed Criminal Justice Bill.</P>
    <P>The provision that statements made by suspects may be tape-recorded is wholly nugatory since there is no obligation to tape-record and it is specifically provided that failure to do so will not cause the material obtained to be excluded from evidence.  This Bill is riddled with ambiguities and inconsistencies and the more my colleagues and I study and research it the more its defects become self-evident. As far as I am concerned, there is no ill-will towards officials of the Department of Justice.  I have found them to be decent, good-minded civil servants.  They cannot be accused of liberality, but that is only a small weakness and I do not condemn them for that.  I am not engaging an argument against officials or the Minister.  I am just pointing out the inconsistencies in the Bill in the hope that it will be a better Bill at the end of our discussions.  I offer my views in a spirit of goodwill and in a spirit of reconciliation.</P>
    <P>Experience in the UK jurisdiction would seem to be very acceptable to the Government, the Minister in particular, but experience in that jurisdiction suggests that when tape-recording is mandatory a sudden increase is reported of confessions at scenes of crimes and on the way to police stations.</P>
    <P>This is another serious charge: these provisions of the Bill constitute an extraordinary measure in terms of the extraordinary problem in relation to crime which now exists, and this has been justified by the Minister.  The worst type of legislation this House could be asked to consider is legislation under pressure or which is precipitated by certain circumstances which happen all of a sudden. That is the worst type of legislation.  I agree we have a very serious crime problem, particularly in this city.  I have said <Col N="1945" /> that certain sections of the Bill are to be welcomed, but I hope other sections will not be pursued.  I hope, in other words, that the welcome sections of the Bill are not being used as some sort of cover-up for provisions that change the whole face of our criminal jurisprudence.  I have repeated <i>ad nauseum</i> that section 16 will change the whole complexion of our criminal law.  I say for the second time that its constitutionality must be examined in the most serious way.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been vague&mdash;I do not say vague out of malice, but perhaps vague from lack of depth of thought &mdash; in regard to the safeguards he proposes. He has been silent in regard to the details of the proposed complaints tribunal.  I hope that when he is replying he will give us some details about the type of complaints tribunal he intends to set up.  The lack of information in this regard is simply asking the House to consider the Bill and the complaints tribunal in blinkers.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the Bill arises from an extraordinary situation which we hope will be of fairly short duration.  Therefore, serious consideration should be given to the suggestion that the Bill would be given only two years duration before being reviewed by the House, by regulation. I make that suggestion in all seriousness. There is every possibility that the Government may try to steamroll sections 16, 17, 18, 3 and 5, but if that happens the Minister should undertake, if only in order to lessen the teeth of the Opposition, to have the Bill here for review after two years.  That is not an unreasonable request, though it is unusual because this is an unusual Bill.  I do not wish to engage in hyperbole or extravagant language in my condemnation of section 16.  That is not my form, but I must ask the Minister to be cúramach, to take it easy, to have a look at section 16 and possibly lift that section out of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I have been speaking for more than an hour and I do not want to deprive others of the right to speak.  I will have an opportunity on Committee Stage to tease out the individual sections when they come before us.  I should like to repeat that I will be urging my party to oppose section <Col N="1946" /> 16 in its entirity as it has been drafted because of its revolutionary nature in regard to our jurisprudence.  I will be doing that in the parliamentary party and in the legal sub-committee of the parliamentary party.  I will be doing it inside and outside the House.  If at the end a majority of the parliamentary party and the legal sub-committee want the Bill to remain in its entirety I will be subject to whatever is said at meetings of the two bodies.  I am a complete democrat and will always willingly subject myself to the views of the majority.  There will not be any open revolt from me in relation to certain sections of the Bill.  There will be a quiet revolution throughout the parliamentary democratic process through which the sections I have mentioned, if not opposed, will be amended in the way I have explained.  The views I have expressed are my views entirely and I accept fully responsibility for them.  If there is any suggestion of odium flowing to my parliamentary party from what I have said, I do not want it to happen.  I stand on my own in the views I have expressed, and so be it.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister for having brought it here so soon after assuming office.  I assure Deputy Andrews that his sincere contribution will be noted and considered by the Minister.  The Minister said in his speech here and through the media that he welcomes any reasonable proposals and suggestions and that where possible he would take them into account.</P>
      <P>One can understand the feelings of Deputy Andrews and other leading practitioners. Both Dáil and Seanad are fortunate to have so many legal practitioners among their membership.  It is important that their professional expertise is available to the House in debate but it is equally reasonable to suggest that the views of those not in legal practice, who represent many sections of the community, would be heard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been hearing about criminal justice legislation for a number of years. This Bill is not something which suddenly <Col N="1947" /> sprung out of the back pocket of the Minister for Justice.  In 1979, when I first ran for an election for my party, this was an issue, because since the early seventies, when the relatively tranquil existence of life in the country was shattered in a very dramatic and sensational way with the onset of violence of all kinds motivated mostly by people purporting to have political aspirations, there has been a demand from the public for this Bill.  This Bill has been in the wings when Fianna Fáil were on those benches and Fine Gael were in Opposition.  I believe the conclusion eventually must be that it is very reasonable and acceptable because there cannot be that much division, disagrement or lack of understanding about what is attempted in this Bill. When we look at the various Bills which have gone through this House in 1924, 1951 and the Criminal Procedures Act, 1967, dealing with the criminal justice area we must question if as a society we are being fair to the institutions of this State which are responsible for upholding the law, and the public at large.</P>
    <P>I know a lot of people would question Governments in the years between 1967 and 1983 who have not examined the needs and met the changing situation with legislation.  I believe in this Criminal Justice Bill.  I accept Deputy David Andrews' remarks that there are features in it which may have to be examined and looked at again, but I believe the Bill is long overdue.  In the ideal world a measure like this would not be necessary and I am sure most Deputies would prefer if the Government had not to bring in a Bill like this.  The reality is that the Bill is very necessary if there is to be any real prospect of reducing the incidence of crime. I believe that fact is widely appreciated in the House.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that everybody realises how serious the crime problem has become in some of our cities and towns. The problem in some parts of Dublin is very serious and is damaging the whole fabric of social life.  The Deputies who have spoken so far have mentioned particular incidents they have first-hand <Col N="1948" /> knowledge of.  Anybody involved in the by-election campaign in the city centre at the moment is once again being made aware of the life of the average citizen and they are appealing to legislators to do something about it.  One does not want to sound alarmist, but I believe it has gone beyond that point.  In some areas many people, especially the elderly, are afraid to leave their homes unaccompanied after dark for fear of being robbed, mugged and indecently assaulted.  Parents in those areas are afraid to let their children out of their sight.  Even the short walk from a bus stop to people's homes has become a terrifying ordeal.  This is not only happening in specific areas which could be called deprived areas.  I live in Foxrock and my sister at midday was mugged and knocked to the ground by men who stopped a car, came up behind her and hit her.  So it is not necessarily in deprived areas this is happening. I often feel safer in deprived areas than I do in some middle class areas.</P>
    <P>Vandalism seems to be rife in housing estates and in shopping areas.  People cannot leave their property unattended for even brief periods.  That is not all. Many people do not feel secure anymore even in their homes because of the number of burglaries taking place.  It is a sad reflection on our society that this should happen and that so much violence and mindless destruction of property should be evident all around us.  The picture that I as well as others have painted indicates clearly to me that crime is a most destructive and disruptive force.  It is a denial of the most basic of our rights: the right to be free, the right to be secure in our persons, in our property and in our homes, the right to be left alone.  It is the very antithesis of freedom, the right not to feel fear.  I do not believe therefore that any reasonably minded person could view the Bill as repressive or in any sense infringing our fundamental freedoms.  I believe the contrary is the case.  It is the criminals who are the real oppressors.  It is they who day in and day out deny to ordinary people their basic human rights. It is they who threaten our freedom.  By giving the Garda powers which they need <Col N="1949" /> to detect, apprehend and secure conviction of criminals this Bill is not a measure which curbs freedom but one aimed at restoring it.  This Bill introduces much needed reform in the area of justice.  It does so in a way which I believe is balanced and fair.  I know for certain that my colleague in the Department of Justice and the officials in that Department went to great pains to ensure that this balance was arrived at.  It was not approached in any cavalier way.  I am not suggesting anybody said that.  It was very carefully thought through.  With regard to the powers given to the Garda to detain suspects, I believe the permitted period of detention of six hours initially, followed by a further six hours on the authorisation of a chief superintendent of the Garda, is reasonable.  It is moderate when compared with the period allowed at present in Britain and Northern Ireland for ordinary crime and very much less than the total of 96 hours proposed under the British Government's Police and Criminal Evidence Bill.  As the Minister said when introducing the Bill, the police forces in most democratic countries in Europe are empowered to detain suspects for at least 24 hours on the basis of reasonable suspicion.  I cannot see, therefore, how it could be alleged that to introduce a similar provision here, bearing in mind that it is for a shorter period, could ever be regarded as wrong.  The question many people will be asking is if the permitted period, even allowing for the addition of a period between midnight and 8 a. m. during which there is no questioning, is adequate for very serious offences such as rape or murder.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has introduced reasonable safeguards and that further safeguards are proposed.  I believe it is right that detained persons should be informed of their entitlements and allowed access to a solicitor.  That is especially important for young people and for those who are not very literate, articulate or well informed.  I believe the Garda should resort to arrest and detention only where it is absolutely necessary to do so and never as a matter of routine. There is much to be said for them continuing to get people to co-operate even to <Col N="1950" /> the point where people will go to the station to answer questions on a voluntary basis.  Citizens have a moral obligation to assist the Garda in solving crime. Realistically, of course, that will not happen on a wide scale and arrests will have to be made.</P>
    <P>One frequently hears stories of the physical conditions in Garda stations not being all they might be.  I am not sure how true this is.  I have certainly seen one or two detention areas in some barracks and I would like to think they could be greatly improved.  I do not believe that we can go on tolerating Dickensian conditions in our cells.  If people are to be detained they should be detained in reasonable comfort in good physical conditions. Cells ought to be clean and I hope this is something the Department of Justice will examine and monitor.</P>
    <P>It is not difficult to appreciate the concern people feel about the powers given to the Garda to fingerprint and photograph suspects.  There would be an understandable reaction that ordinary, law abiding citizens could have their privacy invaded in this way by the arbitrary use of such power.  I think, however, that at a closer look the provisions in sections 5 and 6 seem to offer reasonable safeguards. A person cannot be arbitrarily arrested for no good reason and photographed or finger-printed in a station. There must be reasonable suspicion that he or she has committed a serious offence and then the station sergeant or member in charge must be satisfied that his or her detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence.  Even then photographing and finger-printing cannot be carried out as a matter of routine; the authority of a superintendent is required.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the important role that records can play, and fingerprints in particular, in criminal investigation, most people will accept that it is necesesary that the Garda should have these powers. There is provision in the Bill for the destruction of records if people are not prosecuted or if they are acquitted.  The Minister has made it very clear that an extremely serious view will be taken of any failure to honour the obligation <Col N="1951" /> imposed on the Garda under this provision, even amounting to dismissal from the force.  I am satisfied that the safeguards will be effective.</P>
    <P>The Bill addressed itself to the difficult problems of offences committed by persons on bail.  Many people would undoubtedly welcome a general tightening up in relation to the granting of bail. It would certainly be useful if something could be done about making it more difficult for people to get bail, at all events in cases where there is evidence that the people are likely to commit further offences while on bail.  The Minister has made it clear, however, that this is likely to create constitutional difficulties.  In the circumstances what the Bill proposes is about the best option available.  Consecutive sentences ought to be a real deterrent.</P>
    <P>The general welcome that has already been given to the proposal to increase the penalties for unauthorised taking of cars indicates the degree of concern there is about this offence.  I understand that the incidence of car thefts is very high, and increasing all the time, but more serious social problems are being caused as a consequence of this crime.  All too frequently we read of people being killed or injured and it is also not unusual for the young drivers of these cars to be killed also.  Innocent bystanders are killed, high speed car chases cause problems and the ramming of Garda cars is commonplace. There is certainly an urgent need to do something about this offence and the Bill has adopted the proper course.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to understand the concern of those who are opposed to sections of the Bill allowing the courts to draw adverse inferences from the failure or refusal of an accused to account for certain matters.  It seems to be no more than ordinary commonsense that a jury would be inclined to take a poor view of an accused person's failure to account for something that points to his guilt, all the more so in circumstances where the accused attempts to offer an explanation at his trial that he might reasonably have offered to the Garda at an earlier stage. Although it may technically be true that <Col N="1952" /> these provisions amount to modification of the so-called right of silence, the modification is a reasonable one.  We should not attempt to make sacred cows out of this or other principles of our law.  Circumstances today differ very greatly from those obtaining when many of these principles were first developed.  There is no question that criminal trials today are very much fairer to an accused person than was the case in the past.  Each year the taxpayer pays out large sums of money to lawyers to defend accused persons and in many trials no effort is spared to gain acquittals on legal technicalities. Fairness is a very important and necessary principle, but there are limits.</P>
    <P>Criminal law and the procedures of trials should be such as to ensure that if the evidence proves beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty he should be convicted, but not otherwise.  These particular provisions will help to restore balance to the scales which have in recent times been tipped a little too far against the prosecution.  The sections in the Bill dealing with trial procedures contain many necessary and long overdue provisions, virtually all of which, I understand, are already law in England.  Many people will welcome majority verdicts because there has been a number of cases in recent times of jury disagreement resulting in retrials.  When it is borne in mind that, if even one person is got at, intimidated or unreasonably holds out against the others, the jury are forced to record a disagreement, then the necessity for this measure will be appreciated.</P>
    <P>I especially note the provisions in section 28 of the Bill dealing with tape recording of questioning in Garda stations which has been accepted by the Government. I welcome the Minister's announcement concerning the setting up of a committee to examine the question and to report on what needs to be done to introduce it.  I hope that the committee will lose no time in setting about their work and bringing in a report with all possible speed.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the Garda Síochána's perception of this legislation. I cannot speak for all of them but certainly the members that have spoken to <Col N="1953" /> me have not been overjoyed at the contents of the Bill, but it is generally believed that this is a measure specifically tailored to suit the requests of the Garda. There are measures that have to be taken.  We have to recognise that the Garda Síochána are operating in a very violent society at present.  The measures available to them for detention are not adequate and we must look at how we can bridge the gap that has grown over the years between the Garda and the community in which they operate.  In doing so I would like to take the opportunity to pay tribute to Derek Nally, who was so closely involved with the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, because he attempted to bring the working garda up front to be publicly identified, to stand up and answer reasonable criticism and to give an account of the real life of the working garda.  I quote from the <i>Garda News</i> of November 1983 an article by Conor Brady in which he describes the contribution of Derek Nally.  It is relevant because the Garda and their role are very much under question and criticism at the moment.  Mr. Brady said:</P>
    <P>It was Derek Nally's first contribution to Garda-public relationships that he was a real, live member of the force. Up to the mid 1970s he was a sergeant, like any other in the force, responsible for his sub-district, meeting ordinary people with their everyday worries and fears.  Thus, when he went on radio or television he spoke with the voice of authenticity.  The re-assurance thus offered should never be understated. Heretofore, the general public might have believed that the Garda Síochána was comprised entirely of invisible deaf-mutes who had hired one or two men in uniform to stand occasionally in front of television cameras.</P>
    <P>This is the nub of the issue.  The Garda have not made a sufficient effort &mdash; maybe we are all responsible &mdash; to create a good liaison in the community.  I have often wondered whether this could be because many of the Garda recruits come from rural areas outside Dublin and other cities, and when they come to Dublin or <Col N="1954" /> Limerick or Cork they see city people who dress and speak differently and have a lifestyle different from what these recruits are accustomed to.  I have watched how they react.  The young &mdash; or perhaps not so young &mdash; Garda recruit sees young people dressed in trendy gear with long hair and his perception of those persons could be that there is something decidedly strange about them and he does not feel comfortable with them.  An attempt should be made to bridge that gap for the sake of the Garda and of their operation within the community.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I welcome the Bill and I wish the Minister, Deputy Noonan, every success with it.  Most people would prefer that we did not have to introduce such a Bill now.  It reflects badly on our society that it should be necessary; but it is regrettable that it is necessary and, therefore, it is our responsibility as legislators to put it before the House and put it into effect.  The Government have had the courage to bring forward the Bill and they will have the support of law-abiding people for its successful passage through the Oireachtas.  People are reassured by the Minister's statement when the Bill was introduced, to the effect that the Bill will not be put into effect giving increased powers to the Garda until a complaints procedure involving an assessment by an independent person or tribunal has been established.  We are talking about the Garda Síochána, a force of 11,000 men and women.  Everyone will accept that the vast majority of them are men and women of integrity with a high level of public commitment but, like any sector of workers of that magnitude, some are not living up to the image expected of them or that they should live up to.  We accept that Garda recruits do not get a halo when they come out of Templemore.  They are human like any other group, so it is reasonable that there should be an authority or a complaints body.  Perhaps one could extend it to say that a similar complaints body might be necessary for any other sector of workers and professionals, say the medical profession and the legal profession, in whom the public put trust.  I support the measure and I know that the Minister <Col N="1955" /> takes very seriously the intent in that statement.  We only hope that the powers the Bill gives to the Garda will be used wisely and that as a result we will in due course have a safer and happier society in which everybody can live.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill and any right-minded person would do so, given the prevailing situation throughout the country as far as the deterioration of law and order, the rising crime rate and so on are concerned.  As the Minister of State said, this legislation was very much in the pipeline and the previous Government were considering practically every measure that appears before the House. I am not so sure, however, that just presenting more legislation, however well intended it might be, will have the effect on rising crime in the city and throughout the country that is desired.  On the one hand you have the Garda force working very well and efficiently and on the other hand criminals, perpetrators of any sort of crime, violent or otherwise being hounded down, and in between we have a huge population &mdash; if you like a cliché, the silent majority.  There is a fund of goodwill among the community only waiting and only too eager to be involved in any fight against crime.  Rather than just presenting legislation I would like to see involvement of the community in that fight.  Indeed, I raised this matter previously on the Adjournment when the Minister of State herself was present.  The more I see of systems working abroad in that direction, which I have examined, the more I am convinced that this is the right way to pursue the problem.  Unless we have the co-operation rather than just the goodwill of people paying lip-service to legislation going through the House, there is a strong possibility that we will not have the success that we as Members of this House feel the putting down of legislation and very strict and strong measures will bring about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking a comparison between America and here you could indicate straight away that there are proportionally more gardaí in Ireland than there are policemen in America.  The statistics are 1.7 <Col N="1956" /> policemen per 1,000 population on average in America while calculations using the most recent statistics show the strength of the Garda up to the end of 1982 as 3.14 gardaí per 1,000 in Ireland. Those statistics are remarkable.  I am not saying for one moment that we are over-policed &mdash; far from it.  I welcome the on-the-beat patrols which I know are a very strong deterrent to crime on the streets and roads and so on, but the American example shows that there they have engendered an attitude of co-operation within their communities.  This to me is a great fault in our efforts to combat the situation.  I am sure the Minister of State on her trips to America became familiar with the practice of encouraging the public there to see at first hand how the police operate.  It is not unusual for a citizen to ride on a patrol car around the streets of New York.  In that way the citizen is familiarised with the situation. I would like to see something similar enshrined in legislation here.</P>
    <P>I am not criticising the Bill.  I am merely saying it does not go far enough.  There is not enough emphasis placed on involvement by the community.  The Minister had an opportunity here of providing a community watch network.  The drop in crime in American cities has been attributed to active participation by citizens with the police.  In Florida and Detroit the crime rate has actually dropped by 30 per cent.  Unfortunately here we are not bringing the community into active co-operation with the Garda and, unless something along those lines is done, we will never be able to tackle crime as it should be tackled.  If law is not enforced there will be no success in reducing crime.  That is the hard fact.  The only way in which the law can be enforced properly is by a real crackdown.</P>
    <P>People talk about bringing back the birch.  Privately we think about this. Recently someone said to me that the only way in which to maintain law and order was by having a good hanging every so often.  That person has a deep sense of justice but he wanted an example made. I am not one for capital punishment or any measures of that kind but, unless the law is enforced, we will not solve the <Col N="1957" /> problem of crime.  I would love to believe this Bill will bring about a reduction in crime.  We had the example of St. Teresa's Gardens where some people took the law into their own hands.  Many held the people there were right to do what they did.  I do not agree that people should take the law into their own hands but the fact is frustration develops when the law is not enforced and that is where I see a grave danger at the moment.  We are not a law-abiding people.</P>
    <P>In the matter of civilian arrest, I checked with my local superintendent and he said he had had no experience of civilian arrest.  The attitude is more one of being &ldquo;agin the law&rdquo;.  The people do not co-operate.  They turn aside.  That trend must be reversed.  The fight against crime will be successful only when the Garda go out to the people.  The Americans are very sensitive to relations as between the police officer and the citizen. All aspects of police work are open to public examination.  There is no bar.  The public are actually encouraged.  Some educational programme should be introduced designed to bring the Garda back into the community.  When I was a teenager we had frequent visits from local gardaí who would drop in for a chat and in that process probably gather some possibly worthwhile information.  I know the Minister is taking steps to encourage that kind of involvement.  Cars are being hijacked everyday.  The problem is out of control and some drastic action must be taken straight away.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to set up two units in the city of Dublin, one on the north side and one on the south side, with the full co-operation of the public.  It is not that the Minister would be starting from scratch because all the information is available.  He could obtain neighbourhood watch kits which are given out to educate people on how to work in co-operation with the Garda, who lecture in certain areas on how to combat crime within that locality.  I am not anxious that that would happen immediately all over the city but I am anxious that it be done well and thoroughly and that the success speak for itself.  I am quite sure that the Garda could pick a couple of areas in <Col N="1958" /> Dublin where such a scheme would succeed. Garda who come to my home if there is a question of suspected undesirables in the area or burglaries will say straight away that it is very difficult for them to counteract crime of that kind.  It is most frustrating, even with the best will in the world, when Garda say that there is very little that they can do about it but that they will record what they have been told and take some fingerprints.  There is a great feeling among the community that that is as far as it goes, and there is nothing more that can be done about it.</P>
    <P>There is a breakdown in confidence among the public, and this is a communication problem.  The Garda and we, as politicians, are to blame for the fact that confidence is not there that the law is being upheld.  The Minister represents an area where a high level of burglary takes place.  She quoted her own sister as having being mugged, and this also happened to a late district justice.  We can all quote statistics from our clinics.  What are we to do about it?  The measures in this Bill concerning detention and so forth are all very admirable but perhaps my colleague, Deputy David Andrews, would be better qualified to speak as a barrister on particular sections of the Bill which might be contentious.  The main provisions of the Bill deal with detention.  Other provisions give increased powers to the Garda and it will not come into operation until a complaints procedure involving an assessment by an independent person or tribunal has been established.  I am not really sure that this is satisfactory.  This is pushing things aside without facing up to reality.  People can point to me and ask what I propose to do about it.  A very forceful example must be shown by the Garda &mdash; a complete shake-up of the entire situation.  There are so many good men and women working within the Garda force, and yet one reads in the papers about gardaí spending so much time bringing perpetrators of crime before the courts to no avail.  People see cars parked illegally and all sorts of transgressions of the law.  There must be a crackdown now on those who break the law, rather than the production of more legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1959" /> What is to prevent the Minister from getting a community watch system going? The Minister of State referred to the fact that the elderly in our midst are very frightened, that senior citizens are living in fear.  As the Garda in certain areas become more proficient in dealing with criminals and the banks and finance houses more efficient in guarding their premises by bullet-proof glass and so forth, the criminals turn to the more vulnerable sectors of society.  The legislation we need here is legislation which reaches out to that situation but the present legislation is not doing that.  It is giving powers to the Garda without bringing into focus a way in which the problem can be cured.  I doubt very much that bringing in more measures is the answer.  What I am saying can be substantiated by quoting from police reports in which neighbourhood watch schemes are regarded as a logical extension of the police force in certain countries.  They call it community protection.</P>
    <P>There are many examples before me from various countries where this system is working to great effect.  Why should we not do it here?  There is no point in examining the situation.  It has been examined. Many of our senior police officers have gone to the United States, examined the system and reported back.  Why is there reluctance to initiate these schemes? Many feel that it might become a vigilante force or that people will take the law totally into their own hands.  I doubt that very much.  That is &mdash; although I should not use a pun &mdash;&ldquo;a cop-out&rdquo;, but it is begging the issue to approach it in that way.  Many police will say that there is a danger that vigilante groups will be set up.  There is a danger if you do not educate the public, and that is where I see the great danger at the moment.</P>
    <P>Another measure which the Minister could adopt in an effort to combat crime and about which he should set straight away is the establishment by the Department of Justice of a citizens' support bureau.  Here I am getting back to the citizens' support for the Garda and encouraging, educating and co-ordinating the efforts being made by ordinary <Col N="1960" /> citizens in aiding the Garda on an overall basis.  That is most important, because there is a tremendous fund of goodwill among youth clubs and scout groups and a lot of good work being done within the community.  Even in our church-going experience, only of late have many church leaders realised that not to involve the community is a serious failing.  This is the failing which is present among us now.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the citizens' support bureau system organised much the same as is happening within the Department of Health with the health education bureau, to educate the public in the functioning of the Garda force.  Many different means of communication can be used here.  We are living in an age of high technology where on <i>Garda Patrol</i> appeals are made for witnesses to come forward and they never come forward.  The gardaí face a blank wall if they do not get all the people behind them.  Such citizens' support bureaux could initiate programmes through the Department of Justice in schools, colleges and public organisations to make people aware of practical means available in combating crime.  In countries with a less traumatic history than ours, Switzerland, the Benelux countries and Scandinavia, which have a strong law abiding tradition, it is not unusual for citizens to exercise citizens' arrests.  Such cases could be brought for reckless driving, handbag snatching and petty crimes. There is seldom a shortage of reliable witnesses in the countries I mentioned, but I do not think that is the case in Ireland, because there is not the acceptance of the need for involvement by citizens.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to give some consideration to the establishment of such an advice bureau.  It would meet with great co-operation from the public. The residents' associations, youth clubs and sporting organisations would all play their part.  The best example I have seen recently of citizens displaying their energies was the participation by more than 11,000 people in the Dublin City Marathon. Those watching that event must have been impressed.  We must work to bring the masses of people within the law <Col N="1961" /> and not keep them apart from it.  The Minister should consider getting involved in work with local communities.  In Dublin we hear talk of no go areas, and I cannot think of a better place to start the work I suggested than in such areas. The Minister should enter such areas with a large force of gardaí and commence this programme of educating people.  The work of ban gardaí could be extended to the area of community involvement and policing.  Just producing laws will not do enough to solve the problem.  In fact, in many cases it will instil more unjustified fears into the minds of people.  When we are asked at group meetings why the law is not being enforced we find it difficult to come up with an answer.  My response to such questions is that the gardaí are overstretched and cannot cope with the problem of urban crime.  If that is the case it is axiomatic that within a few years the problem will get out of hand.</P>
    <P>This brings us back to the situation where we will have more law, more court cases and more people going to prison, I accept that we must counteract criminals, but we will not be curing the problem by such actions.  That would not represent therapeutic medicine.  Such moves would provide an answer at that time but would not provide the preventive medicine.  The Minister should take practical action now.  The nation in debating this legislation is looking to politicians to protect people.  Dublin is being referred to as the heroin centre of Europe.  It is appalling to think of that.  As a member of Dublin Corporation in 1975 I suggested that something should be done to counteract that problem, but it has all got so remote. It is almost like Parkinson's law.  Unless we introduce fresh ideas based on continental examples we will not succeed.  If Dublin is considered a more violent city than New York and people feel less safe walking here than in the American city then surely we should introduce measures that have proved effective there.  I do not think the provision of legislation will cure this problem.  Those of us who have visited New York and witnessed the police walking about with firearms will realise that their presence is a deterrent.</P>
    <P>We will have to look at the question of <Col N="1962" /> arming the Garda.  I would like to see a debate taking place on that issue.  Many gardaí say they do not wish to be armed because it might lead to shoot-outs with criminals, but the relations of gardaí who were the victims of such activity say that if their husbands had firearms they would not have been killed.  We are living in a changed society from the one we grew up in, and different measures are needed. Our prisons are bursting at the seams. Some people maintain that there is little point telling young children who are involved in petty crime that their actions could lead to them being imprisoned. Many young children are not frightened at that prospect.</P>
    <P>This is not a political issue, and Minister Fennell did not realise that when she remarked that her Government had the courage to introduce this legislation. Courage is not needed to introduce legislation that will combat crime.  To close an eye to the huge amount of good will that exists in parishes is a big mistake. Finger-printing, keeping records and photographing people are all desirable from the point of view of records, but other measures should be adopted.  As the Chair will be aware, coming from a rural constituency, there is a greater awareness of community involvement in rural areas.  People living outside urban centres of population have more civic responsibility to their neighbours.  They tend to keep a watch on what is going on in their locality.  If an elderly woman does not take in her milk from her door it will be noticed and a neighbour will call to see what has happened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. F. O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I gave some figures regarding births at Bantry Hospital.  Out of 823 births for the west Cork area, 191 were in Bantry Hospital and 533 were in Cork city.  That is a clear indication of the position.  It is unfortunate that this debate had to take place because irrespective of the issues involved some people see it as an opportunity to indulge in political points scoring. However, out of the whole unseemly argument perhaps there will be some good, because now that the matter is being discussed the facts will emerge clearly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since this controversy began and despite some efforts to cloud the issue it was clear to me that the only thing that mattered was to provide the best maternity services for the people of west Cork. That is what the debate is about.  It is not about the retention of whatever services were provided in the hospital in the past or the ambitions of some people regarding <Col N="1964" /> future developments in the hospital. The issue was and continues to be that it is accepted that there is a minimum standard of maternity services that we are obliged to provide for all our people.  To say that second best might do some people might be all right when one is attempting to score a political point, but we must be seen to provide the best service for everyone.  We must not think that certain sections of the community should get only a second-class service.</P>
    <P>The location of the services must be such that they will serve the needs of the community.  These needs are well-known and were spelled out in detail in this debate by the Minister.  They are to ensure the best care for mothers and babies.  It is strongly recommended that deliveries take place in units staffed by consultant obstetrician-gynaecologists, with back-up paediatric services.  The people in whose name this motion is tabled will agree that such services are not available in Bantry.  There is an element of risk there.</P>
    <P>If a post is advertised giving the number of births, the question must be asked, will the best consultant apply for the job? The ambitious, highly-trained consultant will want to work in the busy hospital, not necessarily for the sake of remuneration but because he wants to ensure that his expertise is kept up-to-date.  That is something that must be taken into consideration when talking about appointments, particularly in small units. I do not think we would get the best person for the job for the reason I have given.  I understand the arguments advanced by speakers on the other side. I do not say they are arguing merely for the sake of argument.  However, we must consider the medical aspect and the welfare of the patient.  We must ensure that the service we provide is the best.</P>
    <P>A number of allegations and dubious suggestions were made, but the most cynical were made by the Leader of the Opposition and the spokesman on health.  In the face of medical advice they gave commitments in relation to services in Bantry Hospital.  It is unfortunate for the people in the area that this was done without regard to the advisability of the <Col N="1965" /> proposal or the ability to meet the commitments. It is easy to promise that one will keep a certain hospital open, but one must take account of the expert advice that is available.  The people who made the commitment have a lot to answer for.</P>
    <P>The commitments made by Fianna Fáil in relation to maternity services in Bantry Hospital are flying in the face of medical advice.  Such advice should not be disregarded. There have been no counter-arguments from the opposite side of the House.  All that has been pointed out are the circumstances of the west Cork community and the distance people have to travel unless a unit is provided in Bantry Hospital.  I understand that argument, but it does not stand up when put to the test on medical grounds, and that is the only criterion that should be observed, namely, what is best from the medical point of view.  I am aware of these factors &mdash; I am capable of reading maps and measuring distances &mdash; but in all honesty I do not believe that the upper solution, though it may be the easy one, is the provision of a second-rate unit in the Bantry Hospital.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear arguments to the contrary, but until now nothing has been said that would alter the opinion that what we are doing is right and in the best interests of the mothers of west Cork. We have been putting forward the case that this sort of unit in Bantry could not be expected to cater for more than 300 births.  My answer is that if we provide such a second-rate service we can have no doubt that the people concerned will go elsewhere.  Figures indicate clearly that mothers in west Cork will not risk going to a hospital that lacks full maternity services.</P>
    <P>Deputies opposite have been calling for what is nothing more than a botched-up job to keep the unit open. That is only a recipe for gross underutilisation of the proposed Bantry unit.  We should never lose sight of our responsibility to serve the best interests of the people.  We must ensure they will get the best.</P>
    <P>Another factor to be taken into account is the economic one.  I agree that <Col N="1966" /> finance considerations should not be allowed to be the overbearing influence, but the economics of this proposal must be looked at.  We are not all living in fantasy-land, and I hope we all have come to the realisation that when we are spending taxpayers' money we will get for it the best value, the best service.</P>
    <P>That is what our proposals will give. At the moment the health services are costing £1,000 million, or £290 per man, woman and child.  This money does not come from some bottomless pit but from taxation of the working people.  When we look at these figures we must ensure that we will provide good value for that money, in other words the best service that can be made available so that the people providing the money will get a return for it.  Daily we hear people talking about the heavy burden of taxation.  We all admit it is a heavy burden, and that makes the responsibility a heavy one to get value for money.  The sooner the people of the House and the country appreciate this the sooner we will get out of our economic mess.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in saying that the funding of an obstetrics unit in Bantry to cater for 300 births could not be justified on medical grounds.  God forbid that anybody would try to justify it on political grounds, though people are trying to do that.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made it clear here and outside that he will not be dissuaded from the decision he has taken.  Rather than prolonging an obviously futile argument we should be concentrating on the provision of appropriate arrangements to provide a proper service for the parents of west Cork.  When I say &ldquo;proper&rdquo; I mean the best service, that the people can have confidence in, a service that will give them the same consultant services they would have in the best out-patient hospital.  If the people get that kind of service they will be happy, satisfied in the knowledge that those in large urban areas are getting the same standard of service. They will have back-up services, they will have child care at a time when the life of the baby needs the best service.</P>
    <P>This is entirely a matter of informing the public.  We have been making an <Col N="1967" /> over-riding case in favour of the mother and child.  On reflection later I am sure we will ask why was all this heat generated in 1983 when now we are enjoying the best service that could be provided and that the people were entitled to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the proposal to retain the maternity unit in Bantry hospital.  As a representative of south Kerry I have particular interest on behalf of my constituents in preserving the maternity unit in Bantry.  I notice from the records that of the 823 births in the Bantry catchment area in 1982 that 72 of them were from the Kenmare, Kilgarvan, Sneem area of County Kerry.  I believe the proposed removal of the maternity unit from Bantry Hospital is the commencement of the downgrading of that hospital which will ultimately affect thousands of people in the Bantry catchment area including the part of south Kerry I have mentioned.</P>
      <P>Kenmare is only 26 miles from Bantry and is 60 miles from Cork, Lauragh is 25 miles from Bantry and 75 miles from Cork.  Kilgarvan is 25 miles from Bantry and 55 miles from Cork.  Sneem is 41 miles from Bantry and up to 90 miles from Cork.  If the maternity unit in Bantry is to be closed it will impose great hardship on many people in the areas I have mentioned if they have to travel to Cork instead.  I intend to set out the reasons it will cause them great inconvenience and why it will affect these areas socially and economically.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil believe it is necessary to have adequate maternity services available throughout the country even if the deliveries in such units are considerably fewer than the 1,500 per annum recommended by Comhairle na Ospidéal.  I fully subscribe to the view that fundamental to maternity services is pre-natal care and pre-natal clinics.  I see no reason why these cannot be provided in Bantry with a consultant obstetrician there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another prerequisite to the operation of these services is ensuring the safe delivery in emergency under supervision.  This can still be provided in Bantry.  We must ensure that there is immediate post-natal <Col N="1968" /> care and also ensure that the infant is given the best chance of optimum health and normal development.  This can be better done in a more localised institution than one over 100 miles away from the homes of the people concerned.  There are some areas in south Kerry which I have mentioned which are up to 100 miles from Cork.  Even when the new county hospital is opened in Tralee they will be still more than 60 miles away from that hospital.</P>
    <P>We must bear in mind the social and economic situation in those remote areas. Those areas should get special attention and priority from health boards and Government Departments.  We must also bear in mind the condition of the roads, the lack of services, particularly the absence of a good telephone service in those areas.  I am talking about a good telephone service in the greatest number of homes or a good telephone service in the majority of townlands.  We recently had a case outside Sneem where, following a fatal accident, it took two hours before the doctor, nurse and ambulance arrived on the scene.  This was not due to any fault of the medical or professional staff involved but to the lack of telephone facilities, bad roads and proper communication services in that area.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to understand the views of the Government and the Minister in this matter.  How can the Minister be satisfied with having a woman in labour travelling 110 miles from Lauragh in County Kerry or from Ardgroom, Allihies, Eyeries, Castletownbere and the Beara peninsula of west Cork to a Cork hospital?  I represented that area of west Cork from 1969 to 1981 and I knew how conscious they were of the facilities in Bantry Hospital and how they considered themselves lucky to have those facilities.  The people in those remote areas deserve better than asking them to travel to Cork for such services.  We must also remember that the roads in those areas are in very bad condition and that most of the travelling in maternity cases is done at night.  The facts prove that most babies are born at night.  There is a great medical risk to mothers and infants travelling long distances to and from a major maternity <Col N="1969" /> unit.  It is far greater than travelling the much shorter distance to a local hospital with an obstetrician in attendance.</P>
    <P>I have heard on a few occasions people who advocated centralisation of hospital cases, including maternity services, say that the helicopter service would be more readily available from a city based hospital. When we take into account that most of the babies are born at night and that helicopters cannot go out at night for maternity cases the helicopter service is out for those cases.  In areas like south Kerry and parts of west Cork which are mountainous it would not be feasible for helicopters to traverse those areas most of the time.  When one considers the human, social and economic factor in travelling to Cork city from the Bantry, Kenmare, Sneem areas one can see another reason for reopening the maternity unit in Bantry Hospital.</P>
    <P>There is another problem associated with expectant mothers going to Cork.  It is common nowadays for mothers travelling long distances from parts of south Kerry and from west Cork to which I have referred to arrive at the hospital to be told that they were not really in labour, having to book into a guesthouse and told to ring the hospital at a later stage.  I have known a number of cases where expectant mothers stayed for two or three nights in bed and breakfast houses in Cork city awaiting admission to the maternity hospitals in Cork.</P>
    <P>There are other cases in which expectant mothers may have to remain in hospital for a number of weeks prior to delivery. There are immense social implications in this regard such as visits by husbands and other members of the family.  This is another reason why the maternity unit in Bantry Hospital should be kept open.  I understand that the health board never decided that the unit should be closed.  This a very important matter, and it would not be wise for the Minister and the Government to direct the health board to close down this unit even though the Minister and the Government could force the health board to do so by not approving the necessary staff appointments or the necessary finance to run the maternity unit in Bantry. <Col N="1970" /> I ask the Minister not to go against the wishes of the health board in this case.  I appeal to him to re-open the maternity unit in Bantry.</P>
    <P>The remote rural areas which I have mentioned require very special attention for personal, humanitarian and compassionate reasons.  This should apply in respect of any services being operated for the benefit of people from this area.  Economic consultants and Government Departments generally are not inclined to differentiate between the situation in city and large urban areas and that in rural areas, especially remote areas, when they are assessing any proposition regarding viability or the importance of providing a service for a particular purpose. We could not support the application of standards for the setting up of services in city and large urban areas and not have the same standards applied to rural areas.  There is no doubt that special provisions should and must always be made for remote rural areas and, the further away the rural areas are from the cities, the more attention should be paid to the setting up of good services.</P>
    <P>We must bear in mind that transport costs are very high, and they impose a great hardship on people travelling from these areas to and from Cork city.</P>
    <P>We also know that the maternity units attached to the hospitals in Cork are heavily booked and that mothers are retained in some of these hospitals for the minimum period after the birth.  It is necessary for them to go back up to Cork at regular intervals for a short period afterwards for post-natal care and to check on the child's health.  This aspect should also be taken into account.  The Minister should bear in mind that the principal demographic feature of west Cork is the relatively low density of population, and the same applies to the Kenmare-Sneem area of County Kerry. There is a small number of people scattered over a fairly large area.  The implication of this is that it would be quite reasonable to modify certain criteria which might be very valid when applied to areas of greater population density.  I suggest that the Comhairle na nOspidéal criteria of 1,500 births per year as the <Col N="1971" /> minimum recommended number for a viable obstetric unit is a case in point.  I am not suggesting that a unit would be required in Bantry on the same scale as one finds in the cities or indeed in a general hospital in a major town in a large urban area, but the Minister should approach Comhairle na nOspidéal to ascertain what modifications could be made to their normal criteria in order to cater for the special considerations which apply in the case of Bantry arising from the arguments which have been made for the retention of the maternity unit there.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to give very careful consideration to the proposals contained in this motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support strongly the motion for the retention of the maternity unit in Bantry County Hospital.  It is outrageous of the Minister for Health to give a blunt and callous &ldquo;no&rdquo; to the re-opening of this facility on the grounds of economic expediency.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that if he was to make an appointment for the unit the consultant appointed would not take up the job.  Does the Minister realise that over 200,000 people are unemployed, and that for the Minister for Health, a member of the Labour Party, to give as an excuse that the appointee would not take up the job under those circumstances is stretching credibility too far?  It is only a joke.  In the west Cork area the Department of Agriculture and the county committee of agriculture recently appointed a county agricultural officer for west Cork and that person has taken up duty and is residing in Dunmanway in west Cork.  I am glad that the Minister for Agriculture did that and was not of the opinion that the appointee would not take up the appointment or live in west Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other main argument that the Minister put forward for the abandonment of Bantry and the people of west Cork was that expectant mothers from the west Cork area would not use the maternity facilities in the Bantry hospital.  To support his argument the Minister said that only a small percentage of the expectant mothers in the catchment area over the past few years had their babies in the Bantry maternity unit.  This is downright dishonest of the Minister who knows only too well that no consultant obstetrician <Col N="1973" /> was available over the years in Bantry. The argument which Fianna Fáil are putting forward is that when such an appointment is made the local GPs would refer their patients to Bantry and thereby a minimum of 500 to 600 births per annum would take place in the unit.  The expectant mothers of west Cork want their babies to be born in west Cork in a fully staffed maternity unit.  They want continuity of care through pregnancy and certainly during labour and delivery.  They do not want to be bundled into the back of a car or a pick-up truck and expected to travel a difficult and dangerous journey to Cork city over a distance of 100 miles in all kinds of weather just to suit the Minister's economic plans for the area.  The fact that such a large proportion of the families in west Cork are medical card holders makes it incumbent on the Minister to see that the best possible services are made available locally to the people of the area.  I ask the Minister to consider this and also what he said last night, that privately the officials of the Southern Health Board are not in favour of reopening the maternity unit.  I, as a member of the southern health committee, was at their meeting last May when a resolution was adopted requesting the Department of Health and Comhairle na nOspidéal to approve the appointment of an obstetrician-gynaecologist at Bantry General Hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thankful for the opportunity of getting in on this debate. I have an interest by virtue of my association with Comhairle na nOspidéal.  Let me say at the outset that, like my colleagues on this side of the House, I support fully the request to retain the maternity unit in Bantry.  In the Comhairle na nOspidéal document, <i>Development of Hospital Maternity Services,</i> the objectives of health care in relation to maternity services may be summarised as follows: <Col N="1974" /> monitoring and maintaining the health of the mother during pregnancy through regular ante-natal care, ensuring safe delivery under skilled supervision, and ensuring that through skilful attention the infant is given the best chance of optimum health and normal development.</P>
      <P>The people of Bantry, west Cork and south Kerry are asking for no more and no less than that.  I am amazed that the Minister, a Cork man, would allow a situation to exist whereby he is asking the mothers of the west Cork area to travel in excess of 100 miles in some cases to avail of specialised maternity services in Cork city.  It is not quite true to say what the Minister said last night, that this is not a service they have had before now. They have had this service all along.  They may not have had a consultant obstetrician-gynaecologist but they had a maternity facility and service in Bantry. Are we now to deprive them of this facility?</P>
      <P>The Minister may remember three of four months ago that I contributed on a topic in relation to Dundalk hospital&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalOrmonde" hpid="Dr. Ormonde Dr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when I referred to the retiring of the old style county physicians. We were discussing Dundalk then and I suggested that the Department of Health must come up with a policy concerning the replacement of &mdash; I use this term advisedly and in a most complimentary way &mdash; these jacks-of-all-trades, because there is no doubt that the old-time county physicians were exceptional individuals.  They provided three or four services which the present men are not in a position to provide.  There is no doubt that the service they provided was fantastic. That is the situation in Bantry today.  The county physician is no longer fit or able to provide the facility that the people have always had in Bantry. Should the people of Bantry now be deprived because the man is not in a position because of his health to continue with the services that he provided?  I pointed out then to the Minister that this <Col N="1975" /> problem would arise and I said that the Department of Health should come up with a policy in relation to these, that Dundalk was on the mat and Bantry was on its way.  Bantry is with us now and the Minister has the problem.</P>
      <P>In his summing up the Minister probably will refer to my involvement with Comhairle na nOspidéal and to the figures, particularly the comhairle's figures, which state that minimum scale obstetric units should cater for births between 1,500 and 2,000 a year.  However, both the Minister and I know that many hospitals are below this level and are functioning exceptionally well.  These are recommended figures but they have no basis in relation to the human and social aspects, particularly in relation to places like Bantry.  These human and social considerations must override all other considerations particularly in relation to a place like Bantry.</P>

      <P>Is it a fact that the birth statistics for 1976 published by the Minister's Department show that 25 per cent of all our births took place in units providing service for fewer than 1,000 births per year, that no fewer than 78 out of a total of 96 maternity units catered for fewer than 1,000 births per year and 67 of these units catered for births fewer than 500 a year?  Are we now going to close down all these units as we closed down Bantry?  Must they all suffer? Again I appeal to the Minister and to the Department of Health to retain these services which the people of Bantry had for so long and to which they are entitled.</P>

      <P>At the outset I want to say a word of praise for the county physician who provided an excellent service in Bantry County Hospital for the past 22 years since the maternity unit was opened.  Unfortunately, not being in the best of health, he could not continue the job.  I am amazed that for the past 22 years, during the greater part of which a Fianna Fáil Government was in office, no effort was made to provide Bantry Maternity <Col N="1976" /> Hospital with a fully qualified gynaecologist.</P>

      <P>It is a wellknown fact that out of the 823 births that took place in 1982 in the Bantry hospital catchment area only 191 took place in the maternity unit there.  What was the reason?  It was quite obvious.  It was because of the lack of an appointment of a fully qualified gynaecologist-obstetrician.  Nothing more and nothing less.  The fault must be placed on those people who failed to fill that post down through the years.  The GPs in the area referred their patients to Cork to the maternity hospitals there where they could get the services of a fully trained medical and nursing staff. Fianna Fáil failed hopelessly to make the proper appointments all through the last 22 years.  That is a wellknown fact.</P>

      <P>The people of south west Cork were deprived of a gynaecological-obstetrical service and have been so deprived for the past 22 years.  No wonder the GPs were sending their patients to Cork.  No wonder there were only 191 births in Bantry out of 983.  I listened <Col N="1978" /> carefully to Deputy John O'Leary telling us about the effect it had on the Kenmare peninsula.  Now facts are facts, and out of 71 births in the Kenmare-Sneem area in 1982, 16 took place in Bantry hospital and 55 in Cork.  How is it there was a bigger percentage of the Kerry births born in Bantry Hospital?  That is where they should be.  No matter what political talk there is commonsense must prevail.  I know very well that every expectant mother in west Cork will have an obstetrical and gynaecological service she deserves.  That is her choice.  One cannot tie people's hands.</P>
      <P>Now there was a first-class county physician in Bantry down through the years. That was not in accordance with An Comhairle's direction, which was that a maternity unit must have the services of a gynaecologist and obstetrician.  But those services were denied in that area for the past 22 years.  From 1977 to 1979 the Leader of the Opposition was the Minister for Health.  He did nothing to fill the post.  The unit would not now be closed were it not for the fact that the county physician was not allowed to continue. I know the hardships the people in the area are suffering.  Parts of that area are over 100 miles from Cork city.  We have five islands off our coast&mdash;Dursey, Bere, Whiddy, Cape Clear, Long Island and Sherkin as well.  These are all in the Bantry Hospital catchment area.

This is quite clear from the degree of selective and biased publicity over a period of months which clearly indicates the designs of these people.  It is a pity, indeed, that those of us who are genuinely interested in west Cork and in the Bantry area should have our efforts damaged by that type of approach.  Let me say clearly to those who would make a political issue of this, who would attempt to manipulate the people of west Cork, that I know them well enough and long enough.

      <P>The objective of these people in attempting to embarrass the Government and to reduce their support, which has been evident over a number of election campaigns, will not reach fruition. The other aspect which it is important to mention in this connection deals with the politics of promise. There was a deputation to Deputy Charles J. Haughey, presently Leader of the Opposition, who without the slightest hesitation, as I understand it, was able to say that of course they would provide maternity facilities for Bantry hospital. He gaily ignores the fact that when a request was made to the Government on a number of occasions during the time that he was Minister such a request for consultant obstetric and gynaecological <Col N="1984" /> facilities in Bantry was refused.  At that stage when he was in power he could not meet that demand.  Now that he is in opposition, going around the country, whether it is in Cork or Bantry area, he says that there is plenty more money.  He tells the taxpayers that they can cut tax.</P>

      <P>What are Fianna Fáil proposing at this stage?  That is the problem for those of us who are genuinely interested in the Bantry Hospital issue. The Fianna Fáil motion calls on the Government to provide maternity facilities at Bantry Hospital.  The Opposition spokesman on Health drafted that motion carefully because he omitted to ask for fully staffed consultant gynaecological facilities.  There are maternity facilities available in many units but they do not have consultant facilities.  In my home town of Skibbereen maternity facilities are available at the local cottage hospital.  It is clear that in the years ahead, perhaps in 20 years' time, when the Opposition may get an opportunity to form the Government and we have to reach back for this motion, Deputy O'Hanlon wants to have himself covered. He has not included consultant facilities.</P>

I strongly argued the case for a fully staffed consultancy unit in Bantry and presented all the arguments in regard to location and so on.  While I will not be scoring an own goal with the political football created by the Opposition on this issue, I should like to stress that I will continue to argue the case for Bantry Hospital with the Minister.  I will be watching carefully to see if the extra facilities to be provided will be as effective as the Minister and his advisers said they will be.</P>

      <P>Deputies Sheehan and O'Keeffe said that we did not know what we wanted in Bantry.  They may not have been present last night when I asked the Minister to consider the points we raised, to write to the Southern Health Board requesting them to reopen the maternity unit at Bantry Hospital, advertise for a <i>locum</i> obstetrician and ask An Comhairle to recommend the appointment of a permanent obstetrician.  I hope that is clear because when it comes to voting we would like local Deputies to support our motion.  They appear to be anxious to have proper obstetric facilities in Bantry Hospital.  Deputy Sheehan told us that an excellent service had been provided by Dr. McCoy over the years but he went on to tell us that Fianna Fáil should have made alternative arrangements for another service over the last 22 years.  He told us that local women would prefer to go to Cork city to have their babies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe asked if we agree with the service the Minister intends providing but the Minister intends to provide an anti-natal clinic one day a week in Bantry.  If the Deputy considers that an obstetric service, we do not accept it as such.  It is hard to understand how any Deputy would accept such a service.  Deputy Haughey's record in office was good and anywhere there was a need for facilities they were provided. Like Deputy Sheehan, he was satisfied <Col N="1987" /> that Dr. McCoy was providing an excellent service for the people of the area. The Minister of State and Deputy O'Keeffe, said it was unfortunate that the debate was taking place and referred to the issue as a political football.  We are concerned about the health care of the people of west Cork and the health and welfare of the mothers and infants living in the Bantry Hospital catchment area. We did not make any effort to make a political football out of this issue.  In fact, I am informed that the local Fine Gael executive in Bantry supported the reopening of the maternity unit and called for the appointment of an obstetrician.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not accuse that executive of making a political football out of the issue.  The Minister of State referred to the element of risk if we continued an obstetric service in Bantry but there is an element of risk in every hospital. There is an element of risk in Cork and in Dublin.  Last night we referred to the annual report of the Rotonda Hospital in which Professor Henry stated that peri-natal mortality had gone up as a result of overcrowding.  That is an element of risk.  Everything must be balanced and when one balances the risk of being delivered in a unit which is ideal against people having to travel up to 110 miles, I am sure everybody would come down in favour of having a maternity unit closer to the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State asked what type of consultant would they get in Bantry. There are many hospitals in the country where consultants are doing excellent work singlehanded.  Such consultants are appointed by the Local Appointments Commission.  The evidence for the success of that is in Cavan and Clonmel. When an obstetrician was appointed in those towns the number of deliveries in the local hospital rose considerably.  In the case of Cavan the number went up from 500 to more than 1,000 over a period of eight years.  There is no reason to expect that the situation would be any <Col N="1988" /> different at Bantry if a consultant were appointed.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said that Fianna Fáil commitments were going against the best medical advice available.  He was referring to a document from Comhairle na nOspidéal.  That document was a discussion document, not a policy document that must be followed by every Minister although it appears this Government and Minister are committed to following that document.  I wonder what is their opinion of the document produced by An Comhairle three years ago on the paediatric services where it is stated that the ideal number is 5,000 deliveries per annum to have a viable maternity unit.  Has the Minister any ideas on ensuring that there will only be units of 5,000 deliveries in the future?</P>
    <P>Last week in reply to a question he told me there were 51 units with fewer than 1,500 deliveries.  Is it his intention to close them?  There are only 17 with more than 1,500 deliveries and there are only six of those not in the major borough areas. The Minister referred to the Trim and Dungarvan units which have been closed. What is significant there is that in each case the health board supported the closure. In the case of Bantry, the health board have backed the appointment of an obstetrician and the re-opening of an obstetric unit in the general hospital.  At their meeting last Monday it was agreed that the basic requirement to establish a consultant obstetric service would be one consultant, one registrar and one senior house officer.  The nurses, domestic staff and maintenance staff are there already. The aim would be to develop a service within three to five years, aiming at a maximum of 500 births per year.  If at the end of that time the local community were not supporting the service it should be abandoned.  The medical colleague who gave me that information remarked to me that he hoped a reasonable Minister for Health would give sympathetic consideration to such a proposal.  The Minister did not refer to the economics of the case although the Minister of State did but, as can be seen from the report of the last health board meeting, apart from an obstetrician, a registrar and a house <Col N="1989" /> officer the unit and the other staff are there.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil are flexible in their approach to any of these documents. People must be taken into account.  We cannot adopt a doctrinaire philosophy that is not suited to the people.  We must cater for the needs of those whom we represent.  With regard to schools, farms and other sectors, we are back to the policy of &ldquo;small is beautiful&rdquo;.  I have no doubt that will be the case with regard to health care in the future.</P>
    <P>I accept the ideal is to have a baby born in a hospital where there are 1,500 or more deliveries per annum, but when one balances the risk of travelling 60 or 100 miles a maternity service closer at hand is the ideal.  I do not think anybody would say the mother's life is at risk by having the service in Bantry Hospital.  While there may be a risk to the infant because a paediatrician is not available, why cannot we adopt a radical solution as they have in other countries and develop a paediatric flying squad service?  In that case a paediatrician would go from Cork to Bantry in the event of an emergency. We are talking about a small percentage of cases.  We do not know where an emergency will occur, but if one can identify such cases at ante-natal examination they can be sent to a more specialised unit.  In the case of an emergency at or after birth, why not have a paediatric flying squad? That would be much safer and more in the interest of mother and infant than having the mother travel 100 or 60 miles to Cork.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister said:</P>
    <P>I have asked the health board to make arrangements to cope with any maternity emergency that may arise.</P>
    <P>This is the kernel of the problem.  Fianna Fáil believe it is not possible to cope with the emergencies that may arise as a result of having the hospital so far away.  The only way of ensuring that the emergencies will be dealt with is to have a maternity service in the general hospital at Bantry.</P>
    <P>Last night I asked the Minister what is the position of the health board having <Col N="1990" /> regard to their statutory and legal obligation for the births taking place in Bantry at the moment.  Neither the Minister, the Minister of State nor Deputy Sheehan replied to that question.  There have been 19 deliveries there since the unit was closed last February and three have been emergencies.  Last night the Minister told us he attended a Medical Union conference in Kilkenny last Friday.  He said:</P>
    <P>I spoke to many members of the Union from Munster, both consultants and general practitioners.  Not one of them criticised my decision.  They were representative of all political parties. They all said it was a terrible shame that for narrow political purposes politicians in Leinster House were creating this storm.</P>
    <P>Did the Minister in Kilkenny look for a former President of the Medical Union who happens to be the county surgeon in Bantry?  Did he ask him for his opinion on the re-opening of the unit?</P>

      <P>The Southern Health Board have made it clear that they want the unit re-opened.  In a letter to the chairman and each member of the Southern Health Board dated 29 April 1983 from the CEO their views made very clear.  The letter spoke about the catchment <Col N="1991" /> area and the human and medical factors.  The letter stated:</P>
      <P>If it is accepted that patient interest and patient care surpasses all forms of statutory prohibition, then the law and regulations should be tempered to recognise and cater for a humanitarian solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what we are asking the Minister to do.  I appeal to him to reconsider his decision.  What would any Member of <Col N="1992" /> this House think if they lived in southwest Cork or out on one of the peninsulas? Would they like the nearest maternity unit to be in Cork city?  I appeal to the Minister to reverse his decision about Bantry, Monaghan, Dundalk and in any other area where he may contemplate cutting maternity services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I am glad it is the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment who is taking this question, because it is on account of a decision by the Department of the Environment in October that I am raising this matter tonight.</P>
      <P>The Fane flows southwards from Lake Muckno, Castleblaney, to the sea at Blackrock, County Louth.  The Minister for the Environment made an order on 10 October allowing another local authority to extract water from the lake. We had no objection.  We believed our local authority could extract water from the lake, the drainage of the Finn could be carried out and the farmlands of County Monaghan could be drained.  The Minister made things difficult by the imposition of this order.</P>
      <P>I will give the background to this.  The river flows from the lake near Castleblayney which Monaghan County Council, through the European Regional Development Fund, purchased as a leisure centre and amenity area.  It was purchased in 1981 and we believed the drainage could take place, the water-logged land in the area could be made usable and by extracting the water lower down the river Dundalk could be facilitated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many tributaries in the mid Monaghan area north of the lake.  Dundalk Urban Council sought for a number of years a supply of water from that lake. This lake was a major source of supply for water schemes in County Monaghan. The farmers in the area and the people <Col N="1995" /> with fishing rights objected.  The Minister decided to set up a judicial inquiry. Before the inquiry was set up Monaghan County Council were able to get the farmers and the people with fishing rights to withdraw their objections.</P>
    <P>Monaghan County Council put a water order on that lake, but on 10 October the Minister disregarded Monaghan's rights in relation to a lake in their county.  He made a water order to allow Dundalk to extract 8,000,000 gallons of water and he made a compulsory purchase order &mdash; I have a copy of it here &mdash; on about 700 acres of land in that area.  Monaghan County Council engaged architects, Neil Hyde and Partners, who designed a scheme referred to as the Killarney of the north.  It was a scheme which would have given great amenities.  There would have been a golf course, which they are developing at present, they were reconstructing the castle to incorporate meeting places, and there were going to be water sports, boating, bridges between the islands and so on.  However, the Minister has allowed a compulsory purchase order which will destroy the project which Monaghan County Council had commissioned the architects to draw up.  He put a compulsory purchase order on the 20 acres which Monaghan had designated as a park with the amenities which I have outlined.</P>
    <P>There are 18,842 acres affected by the river Fane; 7,500 of them are flooded.  If drainage was carried out there could be increased production on the land.  Up until now, the farmers were hoping that this scheme would be proceeded with, because they were unable to avail of the money provided by the western package as there were not adequate funds.</P>
    <P>On 19 October the Minister was asked a number of questions regarding the compulsory purchase order, whether there was any other source of supply for Dundalk, and about the damage it would do to the amenity in this area.  The farmers in that area provided £30 per acre to a maximum of £500 to fight the case in the courts.  They had asked that the Minister would make an order to give back those <Col N="1996" /> costs to the farming organisations who had fought the case.  The Minister in the course of his reply stated that there were no other sources available.  We could not accept this reply, because we believe if they had collected the water downstream and closer to Dundalk it would have meant less piping, it would be closer to the reservoir and would have been equally beneficial as a supply as to take it from the source and have to raise the levels of the lake.  The Minister also said there would be no hardship to farmers or damage to amenities.  That is not so, there are serious repercussions both to its development as an amenity and to the drainage of farm land.  He said that costs had not been applied for.  I understand they have been applied for since that date, and I hope that that money will be returned to them.</P>
    <P>We have fought for many years to secure funding from the various sources, especially from the Border counties fund and the European Regional Development Fund for drainage, amenities and tourism.  We were told by the Minister for Finance on 21 and 22 June when we had a debate on the subject that there was £2.4 million which had not been taken up.  Here is a scheme which has been scuttled by a decision of the Minister for the Environment who could have preserved the amenities of that area.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank my cousin for allowing me two minutes of his very valuable time in which to deplore the dog in the manager attitude of my friend, Deputy Leonard.  The needs of Dundalk are undeniable.  For 14 successive years we have had rationing throughout the long summer months. This year we had 16 weeks of rationing during which water was not available to a town of 27,000 people.  The Minister made a decision in the best interests of <Col N="1997" /> the largest town because the case of Dundalk could not be denied.  There is ample water in Lough Muckno for County Louth and County Monaghan, and the Deputy's fancy idea for Lough Muckno in the form of a leisure centre is not justified.  Dundalk was in dire need of water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Quinn) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Quinn)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like my obvious family allegiances or the fact that my mother's people come from and still reside in Dundalk to in any way prejudice Deputy Leonard's unique concern for County Monaghan.  I understand the pressures and fears he has, but they are not well founded on the technical and other evidence that we have had.  We talked about this before when I met a deputation from County Monaghan.  In relation to the inquiry, the Minister for the Environment gave a full and careful consideration to all the evidence presented at the public local inquiry and to the report of the person who held that inquiry.  I should also make it clear that he is required by law to base his decisions on this evidence and report and is precluded from taking into account any other considerations.  As far as we are concerned, the evidence is quite clear. The order for the 8 million gallons per day that Monaghan County needs from <Col N="1998" /> Lough Muckno would, on the best available advice, last until the year 2032. There is plenty of water there for everybody. I do not think the question of the drainage for local farmers, which is a very legitimate one, is necessarily inter-connected with this.</P>
      <P>Deputy Leonard also asked about the question of costs.  I respectfully say to Deputy Leonard and to Deputy McGahon that if the two counties had co-operated on this matter in the first instance, the substantial legal costs which were incurred in relation to the inquiry which took place would now be more than ample to cover the costs that were incurred by the farmers who felt they had an interest to protect.  Regrettably, unnecessary concern has been raised about this.  While I understand the concern that Deputy Leonard feels for the people of Monaghan &mdash; and I am not unaware of your concern, a Cheann Comhairle, in this regard &mdash; there is a satisfactory solution, and that solution is rooted in co-operation and mutual trust. It is also the basis for the solution to the Northern problem, but then I am reminded that I am speaking about two Northern counties.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On a number of occasions since my meeting with ICTU on July 15 the Secretary of my Department, in consultation with the Department of Industry and Energy, informed officials of ICTU of the current position in relation to the examination by the IDA of certain proposals for the re-opening of the Clondalkin Paper Mills.  In my meeting with representatives of Congress on 15 July, I had undertaken to have these proposals examined by the IDA and brought to Government as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, this examination led eventually to the conclusion by the IDA that the proposals then under examination were likely to lead to a very substantial loss to State funds.  The IDA is currently having further discussions with the proposers.  An indication of possible interest by another overseas company is also being pursued.  In the meantime, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Industry and Energy and I will be meeting Congress later today to review the situation from the viewpoint of both Government and Congress.</P>

      <P>The Occupational Injuries Fund comprises a current account managed by the Minister for Social Welfare and an investment account managed by the Minister for <Col N="1872" /> Finance.  Moneys standing to the credit of the current account and not required to meet current expenditure are transferred to the investment account of the fund.  Whenever the moneys in the current account are insufficient to meet its liabilities such sums as are necessary to discharge those liabilities are transferred to that account from the investment account.</P>
      <P>As there were no demands in the early years of the fund for repayments to the current account, moneys available for investment were placed in long-dated Government securities, which, at the time, were considered to be the most suitable investment.</P>
      <P>To meet requests to repay moneys to the current account in 1979 it was necessary to sell some of the long-dated stocks. Capital losses arose on these sales because the market price of the stocks had dropped as a result of the rise in interest rates generally.</P>
      <P>The types of securities in which moneys of the fund may be invested are set out in the Social Welfare (Occupational Injuries) Act, 1966.  In practice, investment is confined to Government securities and deposits with the Central Bank.</P>

The qualifying conditions for the benefits concerned are laid down in the Social Welfare Acts and Regulations and there was no change in these statutory conditions in the period.</P>
      <P>The reduction in the number of claims to injury benefit and disablement benefit allowed during 1979 resulted from a reduction in the number of new claims to benefit received and processed in the period.  This was influenced by the postal dispute which lasted for approximately four-and-a-half months.  On the one hand, there was a reduction in the total number of claims received during the year.  In addition, however, the large number of claims received after the strike finished resulted in a temporary lengthening of the time within which claims were decided and the backlog extended into 1980.</P>
      <P>The reduction in the number of weeks in respect of which injury benefit was paid during 1979 as compared with 1978 resulted from the fall in the number of claims to injury benefit allowed during the period.</P>

He appealed against this decision but on 1 June 1983 an appeals officer upheld the assessment of his means and the disallowance of his unemployment assistance claim continued to stand.

      <P>The person concerned appealed against the assessment of means at £13.00 weekly which reduced his rate of unemployment assistance during the period 25 May 1983 to 24 September 1983.  In the light of his contentions in support of his appeal, his case was referred to a social welfare officer for additional inquiries.  The applicant was not available for interview when the investigating officer called to his residence on several occasions and this prolonged the inquiries in the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The investigations were recently completed <Col N="1885" /> and the amount of means assessed against him was reduced to nil.</P>
    <P>He is accordingly entitled to the maximum rate of unemployment assistance payable to him from 25 May 1983 to 24 September, 1983 after which he ceased to sign as unemployed and arrears of unemployment assistance are due to be paid to him.  He has been written to and asked to call to his local office for payment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned reached retirement pension age of 65 on 18 March 1983.  One of the conditions for receipt of retirement pension under the Social Welfare Acts requires him to have had contributions paid in respect of at least 156 weeks of insurable employment from the date of his entry into insurance. He does not satisfy this condition as the Department's records show that of his total of 857 Irish contributions only 93 were paid in respect of insurable employment. The remainder were credited contributions allowed to him during periods of unemployment and incapacity for work.  A similar condition applies in respect of old age contributory pension and therefore neither will he qualify for this latter pension at age 66.</P>
      <P>He also had a record of British employment and in accordance with EEC Regulations on Social Security his Irish and British records have been combined to qualify him for a <i>pro rata</i> rate pension of £37.90 from 24 March 1983, increased to £42.50 from 30 June 1983.  The <i>pro rata</i> rate is calculated on the basis of his total of 857 Irish contributions, paid and credited, in proportion to the combined total of 1,491.  He is also in receipt of a British retirement pension (currently Stg. £32.58 per week) with effect from 24 March 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1886" /> Payment of disability benefit was continued to him at the rate of £52.15 a week up to 29 June 1983 and at the rate of £57.35 a week from 30 June 1983 up to 5 October 1983, based on his combined British and Irish insurance records.  Payment of this benefit should have ceased from 24 March 1983.  The total disability benefit paid to him from 24 March 1983 to 5 October 1983 amounted to £1,533.05.  This overpayment is being partially offset by withholding the amount of retirement pension, £1,338.10, which would otherwise be payable to him for the period 24 March 1983 to 9 November 1983.  The balance of £194.95 will be recovered by deducting £3 a week from his <i>pro rata</i> rate retirement pension.</P>
    <P>A retirement pension book containing orders at the net rate of £39.50 payable from 10 November 1983 is being issued to the designated post office for collection by him and he has been notified accordingly.</P>

      <P>One of the qualifying conditions for receipt of widow's contributory pension is that there must be at least 156 contribution weeks of insurable employment, <Col N="1889" /> for which the appropriate contributions have been paid, between the date of entry into insurance and the date the husband died or reached pension age. The claim of the person concerned was refused because this condition was not satisfied.  According to the records of the Department, her husband had a total of only 36 contributions paid since his entry into insurance in 1941.  The claimant herself has no insurance record.  She is currently in receipt of a non-contributory old age pension at the weekly rate of £39.60 which includes a living alone allowance of £3 per week.  This is the rate of pension applicable to a person with means over £6.00 and up to £8.00 a week.

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East)</i>: The precise arrangements made for policing particular areas are a matter for the Garda authorities. They report that a review of the police needs of the Ramleh area of Milltown, which is part of the Donnybrook Garda sub-district, was carried out in recent weeks, following discussions which took place between an inspector from Donnybrook station and a representative of the local residents association.  The Garda authorities consider that the area is receiving as much Garda attention as practicable at present from both foot and mobile patrols.  In addition, the special crime units based at the Dublin Metropolitan Area Headquarters have been directed to pay attention to the area.</P>
      <P>The Deputy can be assured that the police needs of the Ramleh area will be kept under review by the Garda authorities and will be further considered according as the additional manpower being recruited becomes available for assignment to the various centres.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East)</i>: As explained to the Deputy in my reply to a similar question on 7 July 1983, section 49 applications are usually of a complex nature requiring detailed examination of title, extensive correspondence and the issue of statutory notices to interested parties which usually gives rise to further correspondence. Irrespective of the number of staff assigned to work on section 49 cases, there could not be any question, as a general rule, of their being dealt with within six weeks from date of receipt.</P>
      <P>The number of section 49 applications on hands in the Land Registry at the end of October 1983 was 2,836.  That figure included 1,017 applications in respect of which it was necessary for the Land Registry to raise queries and which cannot be proceeded with until replies to the queries have been received.  It is likely that it will also be necessary to raise queries in respect of many of the other outstanding applications.</P>
      <P>For further details on this matter I refer the Deputy to the reply I gave to a similar Question from him on 7 July, 1983.  (Dáil Official Report, vol. 344 No. 9 column 2127).</P>
