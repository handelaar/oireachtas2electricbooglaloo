      <P>I met the banks myself last week on the whole question of the rescue package.  When one gets down to it it is discovered that basically it is a question of people not filling in forms, a question of the customer not doing his job properly.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>The 50 per cent limit on weekly purchases of beef into intervention has been suspended with effect from 4 July and accordingly the question of allowing a credit for heifer slaughterings does not now arise.  In any event I would point out that when such a credit was allowed some years ago it did not have the desired effect on heifer prices and was discontinued after a few weeks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there is not a percentage limit at present.  Only fore quarters and hind quarters go into intervention but there is no quota for fore quarters or hind quarters; they are a quota in themselves as the Deputy will appreciate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it true that 50 per cent of heifer beef has not been sold into intervention for some time?  Is it true that Irish farmers have been demanding this for the last five or six months and that the beef management committee in Brussels have agreed to allow in such beef?  Is it correct to say that the members of that committee do not understand why the Irish Government have not accepted their allocation of 50 per cent of beef heifer equivalent into intervention for Irish farmers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason behind the exercise was to help the price of heifers. A similar experiment was tried out in 1980 but was discontinued because it did not succeed in raising the price of heifers. What the Deputy is saying in effect is that a factory buying a lot of heifers could inflate its steer quota into intervention. That would be a good idea but when it was tried it did not work.  As a matter of interest I should like to tell the Deputy that the net cost of the Exchequer of the 50 per cent limit was in the region of £3 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no proposals in my Department to do that.  I imagine it is due to the cost factor to the Exchequer also.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned a few moments ago that the cost to the Exchequer was £3 million and I should like to know if it is true that the beef management committee in Brussels approved this move and are awaiting acceptance of that sanction from the Minister? Is the Minister aware of the amount of money lost last year by Irish farmers who raised heifers?  Is the Minister aware that the financial institutions will not finance such farmers to purchase store heifers in 1983 unless something is done to alleviate the depression in the heifer trade?  Is the Minister aware that store heifers are only making between £40 and £42 per cwt. at present?  Is it true that the Government are not prepared to take advantage of the opportunities available to Irish farmers by selling this equivalent of extra heifer been into intervention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>This does not arise at present because there are no quotas.  In fact, heifers are not bought into intervention. The only way to get around this problem would be by allowing a factory <Col N="1321" /> to use some of its kill to boost its steer quota.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State has not given the House a concrete reason why the Minister for Agriculture has not accepted this extra allocation. Will the Minister of State tell the House why?  It will only cost the Exchequer £3 million and we can purchase it here at 9 per cent or at 14 per cent in Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it is ludicrous that the beef management committee in Brussels, the body responsible for regulating the intervention quotas for each member state, have given us this extra allocation but it is not being availed of by us?  Will the Minister of State tell us why we cannot avail of it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>The 50 per cent limit on weekly purchases of beef into intervention has been suspended and there is no question of allowing a credit for heifer slaughtering because there is no 50 per cent embargo.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the alarming figure he has quoted is due to factories under EEC regulations being asked to reconstruct and instal sophisticated and expensive killing lines <Col N="1322" /> in anticipation of increased throughout which did not materialise?  Many of those factories are in difficulty because of the small number of animals on offer.  If they had continued with the small killing lines of a couple of hundred animals per day they would still be in business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may be correct but I should like to assure the House that the Department are doing everything they can to increase cattle numbers and towards this end have in operation a calf premium scheme, a suckler cow premium scheme, calf heifer grants, and the headage scheme in disadvantaged areas. A farmer in those areas can get as much as £169 for an extra heifer in calf while a farmer outside those areas gets £118.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>If we have between 30 per cent and 50 per cent over-capacity for the year, will the Minister agree that that is another example of bad forward planning between the different agencies? What consultation takes place between the IDA who provide grants for the factories, the ICC who provide funds for equipment, and the Department of Agriculture? Judging by those figures it appears that there is a lot of bungling taking place instead of forward planning in the meat processing trade.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 15 together.</P>
      <P>Excluding aid for processing and marketing projects, grants paid under the Programme for Western Development in the years 1981 and 1982 totalled £6.3 million and £17.6 million respectively, of which £3.1 million and £8.7 million are the amounts recoupable from the EEC. For 1983, grants are estimated to be of the order of £19.6 million, with £9.6 million being re-imbursable by the EEC.</P>
      <P>Funds allocated by the EEC Commission for projects related to processing and marketing amounted to £6.4 million in 1981 and £6.2 million in 1982.  It is anticipated that some £5 million to £6 million will be allocated this year.  The corresponding allocation from the Exchequer is about £2 million per year for the three years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that we are not taking more than 50 per cent of the funds available under the western package?  Will he tell us of his plans to ensure that in the next few years we will take up a larger grant than the £30 million which is the current figure?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, this scheme ran into considerable trouble from its introduction because of a staff problem.  This problem arose in the first year of the scheme and it is only since the spring of this year that we have been able to get parts of the scheme off the ground.  This relates to grants for the orientation of production, the 40 per cent grants for buildings, which is available to farmers in the north-west.  Parts of the scheme were very good.  The subsidy for electricity and funding for group water schemes were very desirable but the calf to beef scheme did not take off and is unlikely to do so now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

      <P>Why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>For a very simple reason, namely, that it is not the type of breeding or rearing programme used by western farmers.  They tend to go from <Col N="1331" /> the calf to the store and unfortunately for most of us they sell the store to other areas.  If we were able to get people to buy calves and to rear them to slaughter we might be able to solve some of the problems referred to by Deputy Leonard but as of now that scheme has not been as satisfactory as it might have been.  The land improvement part of the scheme has begun to work well in the past few months.  The matter of roadways to farms has caused particular problems, as Deputy Wilson is aware.  We have made several changes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been asked in the past few weeks to explain the matter. In my view the restriction on entry for applicants at 55 years was prohibitive. I have changed that condition to enable the scheme to come into the same category as the farm modernisation scheme in order to allow more farmers to enter the scheme.  I am also considering other areas as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the orientation of production.  Last week there was considerable hassle in the House with regard to supplementary questions but it transpired from that that 30 applications were approved for 12 counties of which Monaghan had nine. Will the Minister not agree that that scheme was strangled by the Department not because of the method of production in the western counties but because of the qualification regarding the income of £3,500?  The result was that practically nobody qualified to build the necessary sheds.  The allocation in respect of processing is a farce.  In the past five years under FEOGA aid we have been allocated a sum of more than £40 million for food processing but we have only taken up £13 million.  During that time many people in the business were refused grant aid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Part of the trouble with regard to the western package <Col N="1332" /> started the day the scheme was negotiated. We have to accept that certain mistakes were made then.  I would have to agree with the Deputy that it is important to make the scheme more relevant and I am looking at this matter.  With regard to the processing industry, if grants were available through a western package there would have to be a cost-benefit analysis on the project concerned.  It would have to be a properly constituted project before we could get money from any source.  One of the reasons some of the projects in the north-west were not grant-aided under the scheme was that they did not fit the criteria for normal development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state how many calf to beef schemes in the western area have been sanctioned and are going ahead?  Will he assure the House that there are no officers in his Department who are trying to kill this scheme on the basis of a cost-benefit analysis?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave the figures to the House a fortnight ago with regard to the calf to beef scheme.  They are very small.  However, there were extra numbers of inquiries this spring for the scheme and, thus, the figures I have would be somewhat distorted.  However, they would be very small.  The various projects so far as cost-benefit analysis is concerned would have to conform to the same criteria as the IDA apply to any project.  I do not know of any bias by any Department in this matter.</P>

      <P>On a previous occasion I was told that there were 30 approvals in respect of the scheme but the sizeable amount of money allocated for orientation of production will not be taken up. Will the Minister consult with Brussels to see if this could be taken in under some other heading &mdash; for instance, livestock production in the 12 western counties &mdash; so that we will not lose over £20 million in the ten-year period?</P>

      <P>The number of reactor cattle slaughtered in meat factories in 1982 was 41,100 animals comprising 25,995 cows and incalf heifers and 15,105 other cattle.  I am not at liberty to give details of slaughterings at each meat plant as this information relates to the commercial operations of individual companies. Information on factory payments for all reactors is not available to my Department but reactor compensation payments by the Department totalled £5.78 million.</P>
      <P>The present system of disposal of reactor cattle has been in operations since 1976 and allows herd owners to make arrangements, to their own best advantage, for the sale of their infected cattle.  As to the prices paid by factories for reactor animals, these are essentially determined in an open-market situation over which I have no control.  In addition to receiving the value of the reactor animals from the factories, herd owners can of course qualify for generous reactor grants from my Department.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister tell us what criteria are used for the payment of the various grades of reactors killed in factories?  In an earlier reply the Minister said that payment for reactors depends on the local market situation and that the Department have not got control over it. I submit it is the Department who have control over the implementation of the regulations.  Surely, therefore, the Department would have control over factory prices?  Will the Minister accept that because of lack of proper supervision at factories farmers who put in animals not even showing TB lesions, perhaps worth £600, are being paid in the region of £150 or £200?

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport if he is aware of the operations of a travel agency entitled Travel Sales and Services Ltd., and of the concern caused to the public; the action if any he is taking to ensure that the persons who paid for their holidays will be returned safely to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Mr. Donnellan) John F. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Mr. Donnellan)</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with section 8 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1965, the Minister for Transport, in his absolute discretion, may grant or refuse to grant an authorisation to operate an air service.  Where an authorisation is granted, it may contain such provisions and conditions as the Minister thinks appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 20 June, my Department received an application from Aviaco, a Spanish air carrier for an authorisation to operate an inclusive tour charter flight from Dublin to Malaga on 5 July on behalf of Travel Sales and Services, Capel Street, Dublin. On 23 June, the Department indicated by telex to Aviaco that the documentation received by way of the application was incomplete in certain respects.  In particular, the Department sought evidence that the flights were bona fide inclusive tours and that the associated accommodation had been reserved, paid for and confirmed.  Subsequent messages from the Department, which issued on 28, 29, 30 June and 1 July, made it clear that confirmatory evidence detailing numbers of rooms/apartments and period <Col N="1345" /> of reservation was required by telex direct to the Department from each hotel/apartment complex involved.  As an alternatives, the Department indicated that it could accept a written assurance from Aviaco that the airline itself was prepared to accept complete responsibleity and liability for ensuring that the accommodation arrangements were completely satisfactory.</P>
    <P>As the necessary confirmatory evidence was not received by my Department and as the requested assurance from the airline was not forthcoming, the Minister decided on Friday, 1 July, to refuse the application.  In arriving at this decision, he was conscious of problems experienced by holiday-markers who booked in 1981 and 1982 with other travel companies with which the owner of Travel Sales and Services, Mr. Joe Fay, was associated.</P>
    <P>On Monday, 4 July, additional evidence in relation to the accommodation reserved in Spain was furnished to the Department of Transport by Travel Sales and Services.  In addition, a written assurance was furnished by Aviaco that all the accommodation arrangements contracted by the clients of Travel Sales and Services through their Spanish agents were completely satisfactory.  The Minister decided, therefore, last evening to reverse his decision to refuse the Aviaco application and granted an authorisation to the airline to operate a charter flight from Dublin to Malaga this morning (5 July), returning on 17 July.  Approval has been granted in respect of one charter flight only.  An application by the airline for two further flights to Malaga later this month, on behalf of the same company, is at present being examined.</P>
    <P>In deciding to approve the Aviaco flight, the Minister took into account the serious inconvenience which his continued refusal would cause to a large number of holiday-makers due to travel to Malaga from Dublin Airport this morning.</P>
    <P>I should perhaps mention that the authorisation granted to Aviaco contains, <i>inter alia</i>, the following conditions:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1346" /> (i)  Aviaco would be responsible for the return of all passengers to their original point of departure; and</P>
    <P>(ii)  Mr. Fay of Travel Sales and Services would travel out on the charter flight on 5 July and ensure that the accommodation arrangements contracted by the clients of Travel Sales and Services were completely satisfactory.</P>
    <P>I can advise the House that Aviaco have confirmed in writing that they will honour the condition about repatriation of passengers and that Mr. Fay travelled to Spain with his clients this morning.</P>
    <P>I should also perhaps remind the Deputy that a statutory licensing and bonding scheme for the travel trade under the Transport (Tour Operators and Travel Agents) Act, 1982 will come into effect on 1 November next.  The scheme is basically a consumer protection measure necessitated by a number of business failures in the travel trade in recent years which gave rise to a growing amount of public unease.  Pending the introduction of the new scheme, the Irish Travel Agents' Association has a voluntary rescue and protection fund which applies to all holidays booked with members of the association.  Basically, however, it is a matter for each intending holiday maker to make the necessary inquiries to ensure that his/her own interests are protected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the part of his reply I could hear.  I have raised the matter because of concern expressed to me by a number of my constituents during the weekend.  Can the Minister say how it is that the individual he named can continue to give the travel agency business a bad name?  Why was the decision resersed at such short notice, causing concern to those people who had already purchased holidays from this individual?  How can this individual continue to exist legitimately as a travel agent?</P>

From 1 November next <Col N="1347" /> legislation will come into effect to ensure that people of this nature, or anyone who intends to operate a travel agency, will have to come up to the standards required by the Department.  As far as this flight is concerned, going out today and coming back on 17 July, all the guarantees the Department think are necessary have been given by Mr. Fay and Aviaco.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will intervene as a matter of urgency in the dispute that has arisen since yesterday at the Employment Exchange in Cork city where staff have ultimately taken action to highlight their accommodation problems and where payment of benefits is being put in jeopardy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already taken all steps <Col N="1349" /> open to me to end the dispute affecting service in the employment exchange in Cork.  All accommodation for my Department, in common with most other Departments, is provided by the Office of Public Works.  When the numbers of unemployed persons began to increase substantially in Cork the Department immediately requested the Office of Public Works to provide accommodation for an additional employment exchange to pay the unemployed women in a separate exchange in Cork.  My Department was offered accommodation by the Office of Public Works in rooms which were not being used in the Model School in Cork. My Department accepted this accommodation and also approved plans for the fitting out of these rooms for use as an employment exchange for women.  However, before the contractors had gone on to the site to carry out the necessary work there was a change of government in March 1982 and the incoming Government, on representations from the parents committee, decided that the accommodation in the Model School should not be used as an employment exchange and that accommodation for an exchange should be obtained elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsequently my Department located accommodation in a newly renovated building in Washington Street and the Office of Public Works were requested to lease the accommodation for use as an exchange.  As the Deputy is aware, I reached agreement in December 1982 as rapidly as possible.  Tenders were invited in March 1983 and accepted in April 1983, the contract was placed by the Office of Public Works and the sub-contract was placed for mechanical and electrical works in June 1983.  In the meantime my Department received from the Civil and Public Service Staff Association a notice of intent to take industrial action on 7 June by withdrawing labour from the Cork Employment Exchange as from 4 July 1983 if additional staff were not provided in the exchange by that date and if the accommodation in Washington Street was not available for occupation also on that date.  The Office of Public Works took whatever steps necessary to have the accommodation ready for occupation <Col N="1350" /> within the shortest possible time. The office arranged for the contractors to work whatever overtime was necessary to complete the contract work urgently. It had been scheduled for the third week in September and we brought it forward to the first week in September by additional overtime, week-end working and some holiday working as well.  Floor covering and the problem of furniture by the OPW will take a further week and the date of occupation of the new accommodation is therefore firmly fixed for 8 September 1983.</P>
    <P>My Department wrote to the CPSSA on 23 June 1983 after I had sought the ratification of the Government and we allocated additional staff to Cork &mdash; an allocation of eight staff on 20 June, six additional staff on 7 June and one further officer on 4 July, and we confirmed all these measures to Mr. Billy Lynch of the CPSSA.  Notwithstanding these assurances the members of the association went on strike on 4 July and a letter was received from the association that members decided that, unless and until the deadline to move into the accommodation was firmly underwritten and there was no interruption by the OPW or the contractors due to sickness, industrial action or holidays or unless accommodation was provided on a further reserved basis in some other premises in Cork to comply with the date 8 September 1983, then the strike of their members would continue.</P>
    <P>The OPW have informed my Department that there is no other accommodation available in Cork between now and 8 September which could be fitted out and ready for occupation by that date.  I have written to Mr. Lynch, the general secretary of the association, informing him of this and also informing him that the work in progress in Washington street is definitely on target and we have had confirmation from the contractors again for completion by 1 September 1983.  The premises will definitely be ready for occupation by that date.  Accordingly, I hope the staff to whom this information has been repeatedly conveyed and the union to which this information has also been repeatedly conveyed in writing and confirmed <Col N="1351" /> in every possible way by myself and the secretary of the Department of Social Welfare, who are meeting again at six o'clock this evening in Cork, will resume work, as otherwise 3,000 unemployed persons in Cork will not be paid their unemployment benefit and assistance tomorrow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, would the Minister identify the date on which his Department discovered the accommodation in Washington Street?  Furthermore, were the 15 officers to whom he referred assigned to the same premises? If the advice he is giving and the letters he is writing are not successful by tomorrow morning, what help can he offer to those in receipt of benefit in the Cork area as to how they will be paid? Can he give me an undertaking now that there will be no distruption in payment? Would he not intervene and be seen to be doing something in the interests of the unemployed people of Cork?</P>

We had an offer of a premises two years ago in Anglesea Street but unfortunately Cork Corporation moved in before the Office of Public <Col N="1352" /> Works could get a lease on the premises and they took that premises.

      <P>When I came into office in December I was fully aware of the appallingly bad condition of the employment exchange in Cork.  I directed that an immediate lease be signed on the first available premises namely the old Dwyer premises in Washington Street, a magnificient premises which will be outstanding. The Office of Public Works have given enormous co-operation.  Furthermore, I allocated, with the approval of the Government, 15 head of staff on transfer from different Departments in Dublin to Cork.  They have all been down there for several weeks.  The staff in Cork have had 15 additional staff and I hope the staff in Cork are now fully aware of the efforts of this Government, of myself and my colleagues in the Office of Public Works, and that we will have a resumption of work tomorrow morning and that Mr. Billy Lynch, in consultation with his members, will see the wisdom of the assistance we are trying to give, because the position is extremely serious.  There will be 3,000 persons turning up for payment tomorrow, on Thursday and on Friday. We pay out some £600,000 in unemployment benefit and assistance.  That payment should be made by the staff in Cork and hopefully the matter will be <Col N="1353" /> resolved tonight without any further difficulty.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance what action he proposes to take to protect all of the people at present entering Phoenix Park from the dangers of up to 100 horses including mares with foal that entered over the week-end and are a menace to all who use the park.</P>

      <P>Trespassing horses are a continuing problem in the Phoenix Park.  As Deputies are aware this problem is common in parks and public areas throughout the country.  It is the policy of the Commissioners of Public Works to have trespassing animals removed from the park.  Since 15 October 1980 this has been done on 31 occasions. The commissioners will continue to implement this policy.  The dismantling of two gates for the purpose of widening the entrance to permit the entry of plant and machinery in connection with the construction of a section of the greater Dublin sewerage scheme has had no material effect on the number of horses trespassing in the park.</P>

I got unanimous advice that the question was not in order. I considered that question in the light of that advice and ruled it out of order.

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Leader of the Opposition is probably confusing it with is the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (Termination) Bill, 1983.</P>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete paragraph (ii).</P>
      <P>Paragraph (ii) seeks to enable business to continue without any break for Private Members' Business this evening or tomorrow evening.  This was decided on by the Government and Fianna Fáil Party Whips without any reference whatsoever to other Members of the House, Members like myself or Deputy Mac Giolla or the Independent Member.  I consider that to be very high-handed, to say the least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Private Members' Time is the only time available to Members of the Opposition to initiate matters of concern to them. Notwithstanding the fact that we have been unable many times since coming into this House to have any of the Private Members' motions which we tabled taken, the present Fianna Fáil Party, and the Fine Gael and Labour Parties when in Opposition last year, refused ourselves or the Independent Member any of Private Members' Time which should have been made available to us.  I have been in touch personally with both the Government Chief Whip and the Fianna Fáil Party Whip and also, in writing, requesting that some time be allocated to us to discuss one or other of our motions which have been on the Order Paper for some time.  We have approximately ten motions on the Order Paper.  We requested discussion with the Whips to decide what time could be allowed us in <Col N="1542" /> order to have one of those motions moved.</P>
    <P>A further effect of paragraph (ii) of this Allocation of Time motion is that the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (Termination) Bill, 1983 is prevented from being resumed.  It should have been resumed this evening.  Because Private Members' Time is not now being taken this week &mdash; and presumably will not be taken again until the Dáil reassembles some time in October &mdash; we are unable to have any discussion on the Bill which would lead to the termination of ground rents.  I take it that it was that Bill and the statement relating to it to which the Leader of the Opposition referred.  I did not make any statement in relation to the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) (Amendment) Bill.  I received a copy of that Bill only this morning and have not had time to read through it as yet.  In principle I welcome the introduction of a Bill to establish rent tribunals.  However I should like to read through that Bill before commenting on it.</P>
    <P>It is only reasonable to assume that a decision not to have Private Members' Time this week, as agreed between the Whips, could be read as an attempt to avoid having a debate on the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (Termination) Bill, 1983.  The ground rents issue is an important and urgent one.  There are at present more than 30 people facing prison terms because of their objection in principle to the whole issue of ground rents.  For that reason I should have thought it reasonable that some form of debate would be held on it before the House goes into recess for two or three months.  That is not to say that any of the other items on the Order Paper this week are not important &mdash; they are &mdash; but it is unreasonable to expect Members such as ourselves to sit quietly and allow business to proceed without any reference to us, effectively denying us any right to initiate Bills or motions of any kind in the House. A number of other Deputies have complained from time to time that both Deputy Mac Giolla and I have been speaking too much.  That criticism has emerged mainly from Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil backbenchers.  I would argue <Col N="1543" /> that that is as much a fault of their longwinded spokespersons who, when they get in on debates, tend to prevent their own backbenchers from speaking on issues.  It is important from our point of view and that of the Independent Deputy in the House that Private Members' Time be allowed to continue this week</P>

      <P>We take great exception to the removal of Private Members' Time from the Order of Business for this week.  When I moved the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (Termination) Bill, 1983, last week I was given to understand that it would be resumed this week in Private Members' Time in accordance with Standing Orders.  The removal of Private Members' Time from the Order of Business seems to me to be a deliberate attempt to muzzle us and prevent us from resuming that Bill.  Last week a number of Deputies from both sides of the House came to us &mdash; Deputies not just from Dublin but from the country as well &mdash; expressing their support, hoping they would be given an opportunity of supporting our Bill.  I think there is widespread support among all parties in the House for a Bill of this nature.  It is a great disappointment that time has not been allowed at least to have a debate on it when we would have had the required number of Deputies for such a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago the Minister for the Public Service called on the public to work a day for Ireland.  I wonder why the rush to the holidays on the part of this House: could we not work a week for Ireland?  In the motion before the House there is an apparent rush to cram everything into this week to get away by Friday. Surely there is ample time left in the remainder of July?  We would still have four, six or eight weeks remaining for holidays in August and September. Ample time could have been afforded Private Members for discussion of the Bills before the House.  I anticipated that <Col N="1544" /> there would be objection to a Bill such as the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (Termination) Bill, 1983, by property interests.  In this connection the Irish Landowners Convention Limited are very powerful.  I do not know if representations from that area have had any effect on people in this House.  But I can say that the Bill which we were putting before the House is covered absolutely by the terms of the Constitution, in that Article 43&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not forcing anybody to report what I say or do not say. I am anxious to make the point that we did not get an opportunity during this session to move any of the Private Members motions that are on the Order Paper. We have ten on the Order Paper, but we could have many more.  However, there is no indication we would get time to consider them.  If we are given time we will deal with those motions.  Last week we were promised that the Bill dealing with ground rents would be taken in Private Members Time this week.  Now it has been stopped and I am anxious to <Col N="1545" /> know why Private Members Business has been removed from the Order Paper for this week when we will rush off on Friday and close down until nearly Christmas.</P>
      <P>In our amendment we are asking that paragraph (ii), &ldquo;consideration of Government business shall not be interrupted this week at the time fixed for the taking of Private Members Business&rdquo;, be deleted.  I understood that we had been given an assurance that the Bill we moved last week would be taken in Private Members Time this week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Barrett, Dún Laoghaire) Nuala Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Barrett,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Dún Laoghaire</i>): Some misleading statements have been made by Deputies De Rossa and Mac Giolla.  Nobody gave either of them an assurance that the Bill in question would be taken in Private Members Time this week.  The Deputies in question sought to introduce their Private Members Bill last week and were refused by the Government.  The procedure is that in the following week those seeking to move the Bill are given five minutes to state why they should have been allowed to move that Bill and the Minister in question is given five minutes to reply. To state that had there been Private Members Business this week we would have been dealing with their Bill is inaccurate. I did not give any assurance to either Deputy Mac Giolla or De Rossa that if we had Private Members Business this week their Bill would have been taken.  In fact, it is not the business of the Government to order Private Members Business.  Private Members Business belongs to the Opposition and if the Deputies had checked the Order Paper they would have seen that the motion in the name of Deputy Seán McCarthy of Fianna Fáil was scheduled for debate had the Opposition not sought precedence and tabled a different motion.  I should like to correct the statements made by both Deputies in case people outside got the impression that had Private Members Business been taken this week their Bill would have been debated.  It would not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was by agreement, in view of the volume of business we have to get through, with the main Opposition party <Col N="1546" /> that we will not have Private Members Business this week.</P>
    <P>In reply to the remark with regard to a week for Ireland and the time needed for sittings, I should like to say that statements like that are bringing the House into disrepute.  There is a general feeling outside that Deputies are now taking off on three months holidays.  It is time we refuted such allegations.  We are not taking off on holidays of that duration.  On the Order Paper a number of Committees are listed to be established this week, with the co-operation of the Opposition. They are being set up so that they can get off the ground in July and September when the Dáil is not in session and when we do not have to arrange pairings.  The Committees will be able to discuss their terms of reference so that they can act properly.  There is a myth that everything must happen in this Chamber.  A committee system operating effectively can do so outside this Chamber.  Members taking part in those Committees can do a great deal of work instead of listening to a lot of the waffle that goes on in this Chamber.  It is time we stopped giving the public the impression that we are going off on three months holidays.  I will not allow that impression to be given and I defend the right of a TD, like anybody else, to take holidays.</P>
    <P>If any Member checks the record since this Dáil commenced on 14 December last he or she will find that we passed a considerable number of Bills.  We also established a number of Committees and had a number of special debates.  It takes a lot of time to draft Bills and officials such as the parliamentary draftsmen must be given advance notice to prepare legislation for discussion here.  That is another reason why there must be a break during the summer months.  It is important that we should also correct the statement by Deputy Mac Giolla that we are breaking until Christmas.  That is the first I heard of that.</P>

      <P>(<i>Dún Laoghaire</i>): &mdash;&mdash;I should like to put it on record that as far as I am aware the Taoiseach does not have any intention of adjourning the Dáil until near Christmas.  It is recognised by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, and all Members, that there is a need to reform procedure.  As matters stand, the Opposition who table a motion have precedence in Private Members Time.  By agreement on this occasion the party whose motion was next to be taken agreed not to take it this week so as to facilitate the Government in getting business through the House.  There was no collusion on the part of Fianna Fáil and the Government to block The Workers Party Bill on ground rents.  An agreement was worked out between us.  It is worth noting that the Dáil will be sitting until 10.30 p.m. tonight, midnight tomorrow, midnight on Thursday and until 4 p.m. on Friday.  That represents a good week's work.  I hope that when the Committee on Procedure and Privileges have an opportunity of reviewing the procedure of the House a facility outside Government time will be found for Members who may wish to table Private Members motions or have special debates on certain matters.  That is being investigated by the Committee.  We have had discussions on this and we are making efforts to ensure that every Member has his or her say.  There is no attempt on my part as Government Chief Whip to deny The Workers Party their right, irrespective of what we wish to put forward.  I hope that when we return after the Summer Recess we will have procedures whereby individual Members can have their say outside of Government time.  I reject the amendment proposed.</P>

        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> I confirm that.  It was after detailed discussions <Col N="1549" /> with the Opposition Whip to try to get adequate time to discuss those important Bills that I got this agreement.  A Fianna Fáil motion was due to be taken and because of that I should like to put on record our appreciation of their forfeiting their time.  That was done so that legislation such as that dealing with a rents tribunal could be taken.  That Bill was not on the original programme but because of its importance and the hard work put into it by the Department of the Environment, the Minister and Minister of State, the Bill was prepared.  It was in the light of that the Opposition forfeited their Private Members Time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), line 24, after &ldquo;land&rdquo; to add &ldquo;necessary for the proper functioning of the Board&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a technical amendment and I would like to hear from the Minister if he will accept it or why he feels it is not necessary.  I feel it is necessary and that the board should only be involved in acquiring, holding or disposing of land if such is necessary for the proper functioning of the board.  I cannot see what other purpose it would be required for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel this amendment is unnecessary.  The provision in section 2 (1) about the acquisition and the disposal of land is a standard one designed to enable the board to provide itself with premises for office use.  To read into this standard provision a power to become involved in land dealings of a kind which has nothing to do with the functions of the board would be unnecessary and a bit far-reaching.  I do not think it is quite possible.  It is fair to point out that, quite apart from this altogether, the board will not have any resources to permit of land dealings.  Even if it were legally entitled to become involved in this area, it does not have the power to borrow money and its annual programme for expenditure must be submitted to me and the Minister for Finance.  I reject this amendment.  As I have outlined, it is quite unnecessary.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a straightforward amendment to correct a drafting error.  Section 27 (3) appears in section 2 (2) whereas the reference should be to section 21 (3).  In other words, the figure 1 inadvertently <Col N="1553" /> became a 7.  The purpose of the amendment is to correct that error.</P>

      <P>Why does the Minister deem it necessary to repeat the words in this section in view of similar sections in the Schedule to the 1976 Act.  The construction seems extraordinary and points to the unwieldly and disjointed approach to this Bill.  The section merely confirms the existing law.  Why is it necessary to include the words in this section in view of the fact that it seems only to be confirming what is there already in the law? It says in subsection (1): &ldquo;The Board shall continue&rdquo; and in subsection (3) it again says: &ldquo;Judicial notice shall continue&rdquo;.

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is evidence of the hasty way this legislation was put together that it appears the amendments have been listed in the wrong order.  This amendment affects subsequent amendments in my name. There should be one date of commencement for all sections and in view of the peculiar circumstances of this Bill it is important that there be an established date for all sections.  It is quite extraordinary the way the Bill has been worded, giving the Minister power to bring various sections into law as and when he considers fit.  It appears to be a most disjointed way of implementing legislation and in view of the serious concern of <Col N="1554" /> my party with regard to the main provisions in the Bill we would not agree to give the Minister this power.  We consider one date should be appointed for the commencement of all of the sections when the Bill is enacted.  As the future role of existing members and the chairman of An Bord Pleanála is in question, it is a matter of extreme importance.</P>
    <P>I wish to state at the outset that our contributions will be greatly inhibited because of the guillotine motion which has been introduced.  I am conscious that I have not much time to explain in detail any of the amendments in my name.  I know if we dwell too long on the early sections when we reach 10.30 p.m. the guillotine will be put into force and we will not have an opportunity to make any contribution on the later sections.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to reconsider having a commencement date for all of the Bill rather than giving him the power to bring bits and pieces as and when he feels like it.</P>

There are many precedents in this House which allow a Minister latitude to introduce legislation as I am doing now.</P>

      <P>The Minister should not be under any misunderstanding.  Section 10 is crucial because that is the one that deals with the removal from office of the chairman and the members.  The way the Bill is framed it appears that event shall happen at the whim of the Minister and that other sections can be brought into law at different times.  Because there is reference to section 10 in this section I considered it necessary to put down amendment No. 3.  Will the Minister answer the point I made about bringing all sections into operation on one day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 10 provides for the <Col N="1555" /> termination of the appointment of the existing chairman and the ordinary members. Section 2 (4) provides that the existing chairman and ordinary members will continue to hold office subject to the original terms of office but subject to section 10 of the Bill.  This amendment is a consequence of further amendments to section 10 which Deputy Molloy has tabled and I will be opposing them in due course as I am opposing amendment No. 3.  If this amendment were accepted the existing chairman and ordinary members would continue to hold office after the Bill is enacted.  As I pointed out on Second Stage and as will be pointed out on Committee Stage, when we are setting out to restructure the membership of An Bord Pleanála it is desirable that we start <i>ab initio</i>.  That is what will happen in this case.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (4), line 6, after &ldquo;office&rdquo; to add &ldquo;and Articles 6 and 10 of the Schedule to the said Act shall continue to have effect.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Articles 6 and 10 lay down specific provisions whereby the Government or the Minister may remove people from office. We feel that the provisions in the 1976 Act are adequate and that the Minister has been very negligent in his duties in seeking to remove people from office without giving any cause and without using the sections provided for such action in the 1976 Act.  Article No. 6 states:</P>
      <P>Where the chairman of the Board is a person who formerly held judicial office, the Government may remove him from the chairmanship if he has become incapable through ill-health of effectively performing his duties, or if he has committed stated misbehaviour, or if his removal appears to the Government to be necessary for the effective performance by the Board of its functions and in case a chairman of the Board is removed under this Article then the Government shall cause to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas a statement in writing of the reasons for the removal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of ordinary members of the board, under article 10 a similar provision <Col N="1557" /> is made &mdash; in other words, the Minister has power to remove ordinary members who have become incapable through ill health of effectively performing their duties or if they have committed a stated misbehaviour.  In all cases the Minister if he acts under these articles has to lay a statement in writing before the Oireachtas setting out the reasons for the removal.</P>
    <P>I participated in the extensive debate which took place prior to the enactment of the Planning Act, 1976, and it is very surprising some years later to find that sections of that Act which were made law by the Government are being completely ignored.  It is quite extraordinary and exceptional that the Minister has refused to give any reasons whatsoever why the chairman or the members of the board should be removed from office.  My amendment is merely re-enacting the provision which was made by this House in the 1976 Act.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that the Minister is proceeding purely for political, vindictive reasons and was unable to find any grounds of misbehaviour or ill-health on which he could have the chairman and members removed, because those grounds never existed.  Deputy Liam Cosgrave and Deputy Michael Keating said they had no objections to the board continuing in office provided they carried out their duties efficiently and in a proper fashion.  They made it quite clear that they had no knowledge of any impropriety on the part of these board members or chairman.  The Minister, therefore, is circumventing the wishes of the Oireachtas in the 1976 Act in his attempts to remove the members.  He does so by way of the big stick, bringing in a completely new Bill, and it is a step which the Government will greatly regret.</P>
    <P>The naked, political vindictiveness of such action is slowly beginning to dawn on people.  There was an attempt in the early stages of this debate to convey the impression through innuendo and Government propaganda that the judge and the board members were not fit to carry out the duties which were entrusted to them.  It now transpires that not one whit of evidence has been presented <Col N="1558" /> which would justify any complaints made against them.  The opposite has been proved to be the case during this debate, that the dilatoriness on the part of An Bord Pleanála in arriving at planning decisions has been caused by lack of staff. The blame for that can only be laid at the feet of the Minister for the Environment, his staff, the Minister for the Public Service, the Minister for Finance and the Government.  The last people who could be blamed for any dilatoriness in carrying out duties and making decisions on planning appeals were the people who were appointed to do it.  We have shown that in the course of the debate and it is a disgrace that the Government have sought to convey otherwise to the community. The board members are innocent victims, honourable people who accepted their appointments and carried out their duties conscientiously and as properly and efficiently as the Government machine would allow.  The Government, for shameful reasons, sought to discredit the chairman and the members.  In time I am sure they will take action to clear their names, but it is a new aspect of our political life to see a Government attempting to destroy the good character, name and reputation of honourable people.  I urge the Minister to accept my amendment.  There are sufficient grounds in the 1976 Act for any Government to remove people from office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept this amendment.  I have attempted to make it clear in the past couple of days that the primary object of the Bill is to change the system of appointment.  I have been at pains to point that out on numerous occasions.  The termination of existing appointments is a necessary consequence of this process.  I have not and will not make allegations, as the Deputy seems to insist I should, about existing members. I will not discuss any personal histories or the background or qualifications of the individuals who have been appointed by my predecessor.  As I have said on numerous occasions, I am not conducting a witch hunt and I have no intention of embarking on that course now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have at all times stated in the course <Col N="1559" /> of this Bill that because of the institutional changes which have taken place it is important, in order to restore public confidence in the board, to have a new system which can be made effective for the proper disposal of planning appeals and that the system of appointments be changed forthwith.  Obviously it would not be acceptable, when one is setting out to change the system of appointments, that the existing board members should be allowed to retain office.  It is a consequence of this change of the entire structure and constitution of the board that the appointments of existing members must be terminated.  If these appointments were to run their normal course we would not be in a position to reconstitute the board until December 1987.  It is quite reasonable that, where a new structure and system is needed to allay public concern and to increase efficiency, we must set about implementing that new system as soon as possible.  The amendment suggested by the Deputy is totally inconsistent with my basic proposals of reconstituting the board and doing so quickly.  Therefore, I am not in a position to accept the amendment.</P>

As I pointed out to the House, on a number of occasions the volume of the backlog within An Bord Pleanála seemed to increase directly with the increase in the number of board members.  Far more decisions were made when the board consisted of five members.  I am confident that the smaller group, the chairman and five ordinary members, should and I guarantee will be a more effective board than a larger number of people would be.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1560" /> I put it to the Minister that what he is saying is quite nonsensical.  He says that the members of the board sit and adjudicate finally on the findings of the inspectors.  It would be far more suitable if he were to add to the number of inspectors in the field and so expedite the processing of applications.  Once he gets this Bill through will he appoint more inspectors and, hey presto, have a more efficacious board?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I have sanctioned the appointment of four additional inspectors since I came into office.  Secondly, I dispute the conclusion arrived at by the Deputy that my suggestion before the House is completely nonsensical.  As I see it, the larger board obviously took far more time than a smaller board would, and the figures I made available to this House last week substantiate that fact. Also the number of inspectors did not increase over the past three years.  I cannot understand my predecessors in the Fianna Fáil Party in the Department of the Environment.  If the concern was there, why did they continue to appoint additional board members if they believed that the problem was at inspectorate level, that the money would have been far better spent had they appointed more inspectors rather than adding to the board members which, to take Deputy O'Rourke's theory, would not be of any additional assistance in the processing of the decisions?</P>

      <P>I have reservations about the dismissal of the board.  One must be very careful about it.  The power of decision-making must be retained in Government Departments.  I had some doubts about the appointment of An Bord Pleanála in the first instance, but they have proved necessary to some extent.  We are dealing with vast amounts of money and it is important to have a board who are and are seen to be totally impartial in the decisions they make.  The saving grace of the section under discussion is that the appointments that were made were wrong and, while casting no aspersion whatsoever on the persons so appointed, the appointment of members by an outgoing Government cannot and should not be condoned.  In Ireland Governments are changing and from what we have seen recently it seems that we will continue to have changes of Government and a strong Opposition likely to take over sometimes.  If we do our job well during our term of office, then in four-and-a-half years' time we will be returned to office and if we do not do our job well the people will decide how to treat us.  Therefore, we should be <Col N="1562" /> trying to ensure that we retain in this House the decision-making process in the Minister.</P>

It is necessary that we tread carefully in handing over powers to bodies who are not representative of the whole people of Ireland as distinct from particular interest groups.</P>
      <P>As I said in this House in regard to other business recently, I am not in favour of the appointment of very large boards.  I would like to see smaller boards appointed and the members selected very carefully.  The Minister is right to reduce the number on this board from nine to five.  That is a step in the right direction. Also I understand that the members of the board did not go down the country to investigate any appeal at first hand. Inspectors were sent to do that work and the board members were attached to offices, stayed in their offices and did their work there.  The inspectors did the work at first hand.</P>

Public money is involved and it is good to see the numbers on the board reduced.</P>

      <P>The question has been raised regarding the appalling delays that are taking place in An Bord Pleanála and whether that is the responsibility of the members of the board or due to lack of or inadequacy of inspectors.  We have no way of knowing that with any degree of <Col N="1563" /> accuracy.  However, the members of the board carry responsibility for that board just as the board of directors of any company do.  We do not know what their personal workload was or the division of labour as between the members of the board and the inspectors.  Indeed, that was one of the major criticisms that I always found of the operation of the board, and that format aroused a degree of public suspicion.  There is a suspicion in the public mind that for the most part the decisions were not made by the members of the board at all but by the inspectors and that the inspectors would go and inspect or do the interviews or whatever and submit a report to the board, and one or more members of the board &mdash; we do not know exactly &mdash; would perhaps rubber-stamp the decision of the inspector. Possibly there is public suspicion again.  We do not know and we have no way of knowing.  Some board members might have overruled the inspectors' decisions or recommendations without any personal knowledge of their merits or demerits.</P>

      <P>We had the ridiculous situation in the operation of the board, particularly in the context of oral hearings, that the inspector would sit in the manner of a judge, would hear evidence from both sides, and yet the people who were given the job of making the decisions never came face to face with the parties or heard the evidence.  Yet they were the ones who were given the responsibility of making the decisions.  Therefore, there should be a major rethink on other aspects of the board apart from their composition.  I suggest that when oral evidence is given the person who <Col N="1564" /> takes it should be the person to make the decisions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps part-time inspectors are at work, but surely the Minister should tell the House clearly that it is not a matter of the board simply picking the inspectors.  I presume the appointments of these inspectors, architects or engineers, would come through the Appointments Commission.  The board are tied to the Department's apron strings more closely now than ever and there will be much closer liaison between the two sides.  Deputy Taylor's contribution was a classical example of double think.  He spoke of the board members overriding decisions of the inspectors. Which way does he want it?  His speech was full of suggestions and innuendos. All this stinks with that kind of thing.  We heard about people talking of restoring public confidence.  It needs to be restored after all that has been said about the board.  The campaign began around Christmas with inspired leaks from sources close to the Government in regard to the alleged operations of the <Col N="1565" /> board.  As one involved in the process before it came to the House and who might return again to the process, I do not care anything about the composition of the board but the sooner they begin to get their decisions out the better.  The Minister said that the board were unable to come to quick decisions because of their size.  That is plain bunkum and the Minister knows it.  It is about time somebody spelled out what happens and how decisions are arrived at and we might know where we are.  I request the Minister to accept this amendment, which does not call for any extraordinary change.  We should forget the nonsense and the innuendo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite happy to stick to the terms of the Bill.  I have no intention of indulging in bunkum, as the Deputy terms it.  I can give the facts as I found them in regard to An Bord Pleanála.  In 1980 there was a five-member board making decisions at the rate of 262 per month.  In 1981 membership was increased to seven and output dropped to 248 per month.  In 1982, with between seven and nine members, output fell to 215 per month and in the month of January the board were averaging 180 decisions per month.  I am totally mystified why the board was increased and not the inspectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">

      <P>How many had you?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of inspectors did not change at all.  Now I did not interrupt the Deputy and I would like the same courtesy from him.  The number of inspectors from 1980 to 1983 did not increase by even one.  Right throughout that period the only thing that increased was the number of board members. Deputy Molloy has now brought in the whole question of public confidence in regard to appointments to appeals boards.  The very nature of the appointments and the manner in which they were made certainly left a great deal to be desired from the point of view of public confidence.  The sole criterion was membership of a political party.  I have been at a loss in the course of the contributions <Col N="1566" /> from the other side to understand the reluctance of the Fianna Fáil party to remove from the realm of politics the whole operation of An Bord Pleanála.  I have been at a loss to understand why they have been creating such a fuss over the past number of days remembering that they themselves when in Opposition had an entirely different approach.  At column 66 of the Official Report of 13 March 1974 Deputy R.P. Burke had this to say:</P>
      <P>I have said that the board should comprise a Chairman and not less than four and possibly six members.  If the Minister decides to increase membership to a maximum of six, I suggest that such bodies as the Confederation of Irish Industry, the Congress of Trade Unions, the Builders Federation or some similar bodies would be asked by the Minister to appoint nominees to the board.  In particular, I mention the Confederation of Irish Industry and perhaps An Taisce or some similar organisation.  I have gone a long way to implement the very things highlighted in the course of the Fianna Fáil contributions in 1974.  In fact, I have gone 100 per cent of the way to meet these suggestions and improve once and for all appointments to An Bord Pleanála.  It is different from any other board and the effect of its decisions can have very serious consequences on the lives of ordinary people.  We are appointing members in a full-time capacity, not like other bodies which meet once a month or even less.  This body will be full time and, as Deputy Molloy rightly pointed out in 1974, the members must have appropriate qualifications for the job, a job which can have serious and long lasting effects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste does not explain, of course, that the Coalition Government at that time did not accept the reasoned amendments from this side of the House.  They did not accept that the people the Minister would appoint should hold certain qualifications and be deemed to be suitable to act on An Bord Pleanála.  Our amendment was rejected <Col N="1567" /> by your colleague, Deputy Tully, who was then Minister, and by the Coalition Government and it is a bit much to have the Tánaiste now seeking to argue points we made to support what he is doing.  We had no objection in the wide world then, just as we have no objection now, to people being appointed to the board who hold some form of qualification which will enable them to bring expertise to decision-making at board level.  We never said everybody had to be a planner or an engineer.  We argued it would be appropriate that some members should have these qualifications and our suggestions were rejected by the Coalition Government.</P>
      <P>But that is not what is at issue here. What is at issue are the provisions of the 1976 Act which gave you all authority to fire the members of the board.  They could be fired if they were guilty of some misbehaviour and you could show in writing they had not carried out the duties for which they had been appointed.  We are arguing against your Bill because you have refused to do as you were required under the 1976 Act.  If you make a political decision to fire all these people you can only do it under the law of the land by setting out in writing the reasons why you wish to do so and you must show they have committed some act of misbehaviour or because of age or illness were incapable and incompetent to carry out their duties and functions.  You have not been able to prove that.  You know you cannot prove that.  You know it is not for reasons of inefficiency or because they have acted in an improper manner.  The only reason you want to fire the board is because they were appointed when the previous Government were in office and you cannot be surprised that Deputies on this side would stand up here, if the members appointed legitimately carry out their duties conscientiously, to defend the character and good name of these people and demand of you to show your reasons and your grounds for firing them, which is what you are doing under this Bill.  Why have you funked it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Through the Chair, why has the Tánaiste not used the provisions of the 1976 Act to fire these people if he thought it proper they should be fired? Of course, if he did so he would have to put in writing his reasons, and there are no reasons other than mean, underhand political reasons.  That has to be brought home.  It is time we nailed the lie propagated by the Tánaiste in public statements, which he has repeated here and which he has failed up to now to substantiate. He has alleged that the members of the board have been responsible for unnecessary delays in making planning decisions and because of that they must be fired.  Let us get to the bottom of this now once and for all.</P>
      <P>Would the Tánaiste indicate to me what he did not indicate to Deputy Taylor, who said we did not know the board were responsible for the delays, a Deputy in the Tánaiste's own party, who attended Labour Party meetings in this House and debated and discussed this Planning Bill and whether it should be brought forward.  The grounds publicly given by the Tánaiste were consistently that the board were responsible for delays.  It is very surprising therefore that a Deputy of his party should state here that he does not know whether the board are responsible for the delays or not.  All he had to do was to ask the Tánaiste who was stating that they were.  He should ask the Tánaiste to tell him why they were alleging they were responsible for these delays.  Deputy Taylor said we had no way of knowing.  Of course that is not true.  There is only one person who has statutory ways of finding out.  There is provision in the 1976 Act for the Minister to require the board to supply him with information and he has the power to issue directives to the board.  Has he done any of these things?  It has emerged that the Tánaiste did not even seek a meeting with the chairman and the members of this board to put his great concern to them. That places a very big question mark over the Tánaiste's reasons and his credibility in this whole area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1569" /> Would the Tánaiste tell us now what is the average length of time that it takes for the board to decide a planning appeal?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>On average it would be in the region of nine months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not in sixth class. There are certain procedures which are followed before an appeal is considered by An Bord Pleanála.  A person makes an appeal to the board in writing.  That appeal is received by the administrative staff who set about preparing an appeal file on that case.  The administrative staff of An Bord Pleanála are the Minister's own staff.  An Bord Pleanála only control one member of their staff, so the 70 or so people employed by the board are all members of the Minister's civil service. The appeal comes in and they prepare the appeal file.  To prepare it they require the views of the local authority against whom the appeal is being made.  Letters are sent out to the local authority informing them that an appeal has been received.  They are asked to submit certain documents &mdash; maps, statements of policy, reasons for and against the proposal. Other legal checks have also to be made to ensure that the documents are correct and properly put together.</P>
      <P>When that section of the Bord Pleanála staff have completed this work &mdash; and I am told it takes approximately four months &mdash; it is then allocated by the administrative staff to a planning inspector. Neither the chairman nor the board members are, at this stage even aware that an appeal has come in unless some very exceptional legal question has arisen.  It is then handed to the planning inspector.  The average length of time it takes for the planning inspector to dispose of cases has been six months.  When the planning inspector has completed his report after six months and the four months that went before that, it is then allocated to the board members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how the Tánaiste expects the House and the country to understand his arguments when he does not wish to give any of the details which are involved and about which he is critical.  The file <Col N="1570" /> then goes upstairs to the chairman and the board members.  That file, I understand from a former member, is distributed among the members of the board at random by a junior official of the administrative staff.  A board member has no knowledge in advance of which file will land on his desk.  The member then studies the inspector's report, the maps, the arguments for and against the proposal, the appeal letter and all the letters in support of it and all the arguments against it.  Then he goes to his board meeting and he presents the case to the other board members.  The other members have no knowledge of this appeal until this time. The case is presented by the individual board member who has received this file at random from this junior official.  He reads the inspector's report, he makes his own comments on the case and a general discussion takes place following which a decision is made.</P>
    <P>On average the length of time it takes for the board to make those decisions is one week, I am told.  I am inviting the Minister to contradict me.  Maybe he will say it is two weeks or three weeks.  Even if the Minister says it takes the board members four weeks I am sure no fairminded person will accuse the board of being responsible for delays.  The information I have is that it is only taking the board members one week to make these decisions.  That is expeditious.  The former member of the board who kindly gave me this information is either giving me false, inaccurate, misleading information or he is not.  I can accept that in working out averages one could be a week or two out.  The Minister has informed the House that it takes the board nine months.  I am challenging him to answer my question directly.  From the time the board members receive the planning appeal file ready for a decision, how long does it take for them to decide that appeal?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Molloy has very well expounded a lot of what I had to say, particularly in relation to the inspector's report.  There is a question mark over the quality of the decisions made if when the inspector finally gets his report <Col N="1571" /> in and the files are distributed by an official of the Minister's Department to members of the board, one member of the board looks at a case and then goes to a board meeting and the decision is made.  There is a lot to be wary about in that method.  If we accept what Deputy Molloy says, that the decision is made in one week, it would be a major area of concern.  I suggest to the Minister that when the inspector produces his report the applicant should receive a copy of that report before it goes to the board for decision.  That might delay the proceedings by a further week.  The problem is not in the first nine months' delay which according to the Deputy is not the board's responsibility, but the delay which occurs in the last week when it is presented to the board.  That would give a period of one week in which the applicant would have an opportunity to make a case if he felt that what the inspector had produced was not fair.  The applicant's submission could go to the board with the inspector's report and then the board could consider the inspector's report and a final submission from the applicant before a decision was made; otherwise there is a danger of innuendo&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Molloy has spoken at length both in the House and elsewhere regarding the procedures of the board and the factors which give rise to delays.  The Deputy said that the board had no control over these matters. Because the board is full-time they must be regarded as having responsibility to see that action is taken to eliminate delays and to modify procedures and deploy staff as they see necessary.  The Deputy suggested that the members of the board wait for files to come to them. <Col N="1573" /> This board are appointed to run the appeals process and if the picture painted by Deputy Molloy were true it would be an indictment of the board on the manner in which they conduct their business.</P>
      <P>The Deputy outlined how up to a year's delay could arise in processing an appeal. The Deputy is misleading the House.  The Deputy said that an average delay by local authorities in supplying information was three months.  However, the figures supplied to me by the board show that at the end of April there were approximately 3,600 appeals before the board. The documentation from local authorities was outstanding on 400 of these cases.  This shows that the average delay on the receipt of local authority documents could be nothing like three months.  The Deputy also alleged that files were with the board for an average of six weeks.  The board's figures at the end of April showed that only 8 per cent of the appeals were with the inspectorate for longer than six months.  The Deputy should accept the information given by the board.</P>
      <P>I refute the suggestion that the board are in a position or ever were in a position to deal with appeals on a weekly basis.  If they were in a position to deal with appeals within a week there would be no difficulties.  The latest information available is that at the end of May there were 471 files with the board.  They could not deal with those in a week.  I question if they could be dealt with within two months.  I question Deputy Molloy's contention that the board had been at any time able to deal with an appeal in a matter of one week.</P>

      <P>It is extraordinary that the Tánaiste has admitted to the Dáil that he never at any stage established how long the board members took to deal with a planning file and to make a decision on it.  The Minister should be ashamed of himself for having made allegations against this board of being dilatory, of being responsible for delays in disposing of planning decisions and stating that for that reason the construction industry were concerned at the effect it was having on employment &mdash; that the board members were responsible for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real cause of the problem goes much deeper.  The administrative and planning inspectorate staff of An Bord Pleanála are members of the Minister's civil service.  The Minister said here that he would dispute why the board had not made arrangements to have appeals decided more expeditiously.  Has the Minister carried out any study of what has been happening?  For example, is he aware that all of the administrative staff except for one gentleman, the chief executive officer &mdash; and I do not know what <Col N="1575" /> function really he performs &mdash; are members of the Minister's staff on secondment for six or seven years?  Is that correct, that they are the Minister's members who are running this board?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>A very whispered agreement with what I am saying.  Why then did the Minister make an allegation that this board, the chairman and members had full control over their staff and that if they were dissatisfied with the manner in which appeals were being dealt with, the chairman and members could take measures to improve matters?  The facts of the matter are that they could not, first of all, because they did not control the staff.  Secondly, the staff available to them were all civil servants.  There was an embargo on recruitment in the public service.  I have said this to the Minister previously: I am not accusing him personally for the fact that this board were not given extra staff over the years.  He was not the Minister for the Environment then and I could not make that type of accusation against him.  But it is he who is making an allegation against the board members that they were responsible for the delays.  Is the Minister aware of go-slows among the staff of An Bord Pleanála &mdash; the Minister's staff, not the staff of the chairman and members who have never been allowed to control them?  Why have the civil servants wished to retain such a strong grip on the whole planning process in this country?  Why was there such a brouhaha when a member of the Minister's staff was not appointed to be a member of An Bord Pleanála?  That was when the mud hit the fan, when all the allegations began to emanate around the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has given very little information to the House or the country on which he could hope to substantiate his arguments.  I think he feels that the less information he gives about the way in which the board have been operating the longer the false impression will continue, that the propaganda against these board members will sink home and that <Col N="1576" /> people will believe badly of them.  We have a duty here to defend honest, honourable people.  If there was something amiss about appointing people to a State board after an election date when a Government had lost an election, then the accusation should be made in that direction: that nobody should be appointed to a State board by a Government that had lost an election.  Then all Governments in this State since its foundation will be found to have been guilty in this respect.  There is no point in making that a Fianna Fáil sin.</P>
    <P>We will remember the time, a Cheann Comhairle, when a former colleague of yours, a Deputy from Monaghan, after losing his seat very conveniently won a seat for a Coalition Government in a by-election in County Monaghan.  But when it came to the general election there was not room for him and he lost his seat. Then, very conveniently, the Coalition Government, who had lost the election, appointed him as a member of the Land Commission, a semi-judicial post.  Former Deputy Toal is a commissioner in the Land Commission to this day.  That was a political appointment.  We never sought to have his membership of the Land Commission terminated because we happened to come into Government a few days later.  We allowed that appointment to stand, as we did several to the Judiciary.  We have seen eminent political figures who spoke from where I am now standing on behalf of the Fine Gael Party for years and who contested Presidential elections on their behalf. When they failed they were given very lucrative judicial appointments by Coalition Governments.  The Minister and the Government are seeking to introduce a whole new principle here.  If they are, let them say so and not use false grounds for abolishing a board carrying out their duties.</P>
    <P>The point we want to drive home here on this section, arising out of the fact that the Minister himself has raised it, is the one about delays.  Sufficient has been said about that.  The Minister has gone public on radio, television, in newspaper interviews and here in the House in his official script, and in all the statements he has <Col N="1577" /> issued to the papers, in an endeavour to condition the country to the decision to fire the planning board &mdash; in all of those he alleged serious dilatoriness on the part of the board in carrying out their duties, maintaining that they had been responsible for the delays.  Today it is established that the Minister cannot inform the House the average length of time it took board members to decide planning appeals during the year 1982.  If the Minister was concerned about the delays, if he felt that the board had been responsible for them, if there was any validity in his argument, that could be based on knowledge only.  He has not got the knowledge.  Therefore the rest of his argument falls.  It is most surprising to hear the Minister make those false allegations.</P>
    <P>We have explained to the House the position about planning inspectors, or lack of them, and that because of that the backlog developed.  Whatever may have been the reasons &mdash; embargoes in the public service, or whatever &mdash; there were not sufficient staff to deal with the number of appeals coming in.  I said in my contribution last week that successive Ministers for the Environment since An Bord Pleanála was established and the civil servants in the Departments &mdash; and the Minister must carry the buck for all of them &mdash; carry some responsibility in regard to such delays.  But the way to deal with it was not to fire a board who are not responsible for the delays, who are not guilty.  The amendment I have down here highlights the fact that in the 1976 Act there was provision laid down under which anybody who did not perform his functions on the board could have been dispensed with under certain measures to be adopted by this House.  If the reasons were legitimate the Minister could have proceeded in that way.  But because his reasons are illegitimate and false, he has sought to create a smokescreen of innuendo and bring in a completely new Bill, asking all of the Deputies who stand behind him to support it.  As it has sunk in more we have heard some of them express their doubts.  Deputy L.T. Cosgrave was the first, Deputy Keating the second and we have just had it now from <Col N="1578" /> Deputy Enright.  I know there are decent people on the opposite side of the House who think that this action is absolutely despicable, that there is no justification whatsoever for it other than the false allegations made.  It is very hard to expect that we would willingly and easily accept it.  Therefore I am pressing my amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make that point at the outset.  It is most important that it goes out from this House that we are talking about something that will have further repercussions on other boards. We are talking about appeals lodged and delays in making decisions on them.  We all know that appeal files are distributed by the administrative staff to board members when they are ready for decision.  I should like to know where the delay occurs.  Does it occur with the administrative staff before appeals are passed on to the board?  The board does not have any control over files.  I do not know any members of the board and I do not have any interest in them.  The Minister should not be smiling because I am telling the truth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious that representations I make to the board should get through as quickly as possible.  In order to establish a case against the members of the existing board the Minister should tell us where the delays occur.  An inherent <Col N="1579" /> part of any delay in the appeals system is the necessity to protect the interests of all parties to the appeal by giving them an opportunity to comment on the grounds of appeal by other parties.  That is vital.  The principle of natural justice is that each party must be heard.  That is the function of the board but leading up to that there is the work of the administrative staff.  Has the Minister investigated that end of the work, which is his responsibility?</P>
      <P>The Minister must establish a case for the removal of the board.  There is no point in any Member saying that this would remove the board from the political arena because we will prove later that there will be an involvement by the Minister. In that event we are still talking about the political arena of An Bord Pleanála.  In the interests of the members of the board, people I do not know anything about, the Minister should establish his reasons for removing them or otherwise it will reflect on the Minister and the Government and will have repercussions later in regard to other State boards.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not a prerequisite of the previous board that they should forego any private work they might be engaged in heretofore but in future it will be an absolute requirement that the people who become members of An Bord Pleanála take it up on a full-time and one-job-only basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is typical of the type of answering technique the Minister has adopted.  When he is asked a question he answers with something else.  The Minister was asked by Deputy Walsh to outline the procedure of the existing board. He was asked if they work on a full-time basis.  My information is that they work <Col N="1580" /> on a full-time basis, they work the normal nine to five office hours and, as Members are aware, when one is dealing with that type of work it often runs later than that because extra work is spent on files at home.  The board members work a minimum of five days per week.</P>
      <P>The Minister's reply is part of the innuendo and his style of answering, avoiding the question but creating a different impression.  The Minister in saying that the new board will work full-time is implying that the existing members in some way have been lax in carrying out their duties.  It is wrong to imply that about the existing board members.  Is it not true that the existing board sit the full hours five days per week and that there is no question of this being a part-time job?</P>

    <P>We are anxious that the Bill when passed be implemented <i>in toto</i>.  We should decide on a day to bring all the provisions into force.  The Bill includes many sections which can be introduced piecemeal. Why should the Bill contain provisions that can be implemented separately with the Minister being in a position to press buttons to bring in different sections. Either he is going to implement the Bill <i>in toto</i> or not at all.  It seems highly irregular to include sections which depend on commencement.  There is no indication about the procedure for commencement. Who decides the commencement date? I am anxious to emphasise the need to enact the Bill <i>in toto,</i> if and when it is ever to be implemented.  We are opposed to the Bill in its entirety.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the amendment.  I dispute Deputy Molloy's contention that this procedure is highly irregular.  It is common in the enactment of legislation to allow such powers to fall upon the Minister.  The section states that on and from the commencement of the section the board shall consist of a chairman and five other members.  Under section 26 individual sections may be brought into operation by commencement order made by the Minister.  I cannot accept the amendment, which would delay the commencement of the provisions of the Bill.  As I am committed to having a new board structure to enhance public confidence in the system and increase efficiency, we must set about implementing the provisions of the Bill as quickly as possible.  It is important that the latitude provided in these sections can be availed of.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The section provides that the board shall consist of a chairman and five ordinary members, and Members of the Deputy's party have pointed out that a small board would be preferable to a large one like we have.  I feel the number of full-time members provided will certainly be capable of dealing with the existing volume of appeals as they come on stream.  I have pointed out already to the Deputy that with the later sections in the Bill which are technical sections &mdash; in fairness to the Deputy and most Deputies in the House they accept as being desirable and necessary for the day-to-day processing of appeals &mdash; and the technical changes which this Bill will be making in the planning laws and the restructuring of the board for a smaller unit, in which decisions should be made much faster than under the present system.  This will meet the requirement which we are setting out to achieve in the Bill.</P>

The Minister has, basically, no confidence in the chairman and the members of the board when he brings this Bill into the Dáil, but he expects this board to continue for the next five or six months and to deal with planning throughout the country.  The Minister is firing all the members of that board.  That is a very irresponsible act by the Minister.  He is bringing before this House a dismissal notice in advance to the most capable and competent people who have been in An Bord Pleanála for a number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has not clearly stated why he has no confidence in the personnel of <Col N="1583" /> An Bord Pleanála.  This will result in massive claims against the Minister's Department by the present membership of An Bord Pleanála.  This money will have to be paid by the taxpayers.  One newspaper said last Sunday that the claims could reach £1¼ million.  Look at the number of jobs which could be created with that type of money?  My council could do a great lot with £1¼ million in providing better roads, building more houses and providing better services for the hardpressed people of my constituency. This Bill is the most irresponsible and wasteful Bill which has ever been brought before the House.  It is disgusting to think that it is two Labour Ministers who are regarded as socialists who are responsible for this.</P>

      <P>It could cost £1¼ million to compensate the responsible members of An Bord Pleanála.  What do the 200,000 unemployed people think of that?  What do the people throughout the country think of spending £1¼ million to compensate the members of a board who are carrying out their work in a responsible manner?  In the next six months the Minister expects the chairman and the members of An Bord Pleanála to carry out the work of planning throughout the country although he says he has no respect for them.  He had not even the courtesy to meet them.  He did not think it worth his while bringing them into his office and discussing the matter with him.

If I was chairman or one of the members of An Bord Pleanála what interest would I have in carrying out planning if the Minister for the Environment and his Minister of State publicly announced they had no regard for the members of that board? The Minister should appeal to the members of An Bord Pleanála and he should <Col N="1585" /> apologise to them for bringing forward a Bill and bringing their reputations down. He should then ask them to carry on their work for the next six months until this Bill comes into operation.  This Bill should be rejected by the House.

      <P>I have one direct question to put to the Minister for the Environment. During the Second Stage and again today we have been talking about numbers. If the Minister admits that he does not question the industry, competence, ability or the wholetime dedication of the present members of An Bord Pleanála to their work how does he hope to have discharged with greater ability by five the work that it takes nine to do at the moment?  If they satisfy all his other requirements then he has the key to the success of the nation, if he can get five to do more efficiently under the exact same conditions, albeit their association with Fianna Fáil what nine other members can do.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will have heard on the monitor, I pointed out that when the board consisted of five members, with the same number in the inspectorate as there was when the board consisted of nine members, the volume of work done was more satisfactory by the five people than by the nine people.  That makes the case for having a board consisting of five people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>When does logic and truth come into it?  It is quite clear that the number of members serving in An Bord Pleanála has very little to do with the time that it takes the board to make a decision.  We are not arguing against having a chairman and five members.  If I recall correctly, when the original Bill was published in 1973 the Minister proposed a chairman and three members. We argued that three might not be enough in view of illness or absence when the board could find itself without a quorum and the then Minister, Mr. Tully, subsequently increased the number to a maximum of ten.  We are not arguing that there is need for nine members; in fact, there are only seven members on the board at the moment and in respect of three members their term of office will expire in June 1984.  We argue it would be preferable for the Minister to allow the members to complete their legitimate appointments and if he considers there is no need for that number it could be reduced by three after next June.  It is false for the Minister to argue that by reducing the number he will increase the output.  There was no relationship whatever between the number of members on the board in previous years and the output. I stated clearly that the output was largely dependent on the work of the planning inspectors, that when the number of planning inspectors was not increased the output was not increased. We even had the former chairman of the board, Mr. Justice Pringle, going public <Col N="1587" /> to deny the statements the Minister was making, but the Minister chose to disregard the denial of the former chairman. The Minister has continued here to use false information in support of his argument because he knows he is on weak ground.</P>
      <P>In reply to a Deputy on this side of the House &mdash; I think it was Deputy Leyden &mdash; I heard the Minister say he was never asked by board members to meet with them.  When he was appointed to his office the Minister assumed responsibility for the Office of Minister for the Environment. That included his responsibilities under the Planning Acts.  Under section 6 of the 1976 Act the Minister has a clear responsibility.  Section 6 (1) states:</P>
      <P>The Minister shall from time to time give to the board such general directives as to policy in relation to planning and development as he considers necessary.</P>
      <P>If the Minister was concerned about delays in dealing with planning appeals, surely he had a responsibility to contact the board and to give a directive to them as to policy in this matter?  From my information he made no such contact. Section 9 of the same Act states:</P>
      <P>The board shall supply the Minister with such information relating to the performance of its functions as he shall, from time to time, request.</P>
      <P>Did the Minister ever request information from the board in regard to delays in dealing with planning appeals?</P>

      <P>At various times all Deputies have expressed their concern about the backlog in An Bord Pleanála.  As working politicians we have been approached by people who have had documents lodged with the board and who <Col N="1588" /> were awaiting decisions.  It would be remiss of any Deputy not to speak out or try to effect a change in procedure to speed up the process.  Since I took up office in the Department of the Environment I have engaged in correspondence with the chairman and members of An Bord Pleanála with a view to assisting them in the difficulties that existed in the board at the time that I took up office. Contrary to what Deputy Molloy said earlier about the staff being on a go-slow, I have found that with regard to reducing the bottleneck that existed and getting quicker decisions made, I received the utmost co-operation from the staff who were deployed to the board.</P>

      <P>I wish to put it on the record of this House that I have got the utmost co-operation from the staff working with the appeals board in terms of working overtime and being available to do the work that was necessary.  There has been very selective use of the statement of Mr. Justice Pringle.  With regard to a reduction in the number of board members, it is worth remembering that he said a reduction was a very good thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad there seems to be general agreement about the reduction of the number to five.  However, I am at a loss to understand why in the past this wisdom from the Fianna Fáil benches <Col N="1589" /> was not imparted to the then Minister who, instead of seeking to remedy the problem, increased the numbers of the board.  From what has been agreed in this House, obviously that was not going to make any impression on the backlog accumulating for the board.  It is regrettable that my predecessor did not direct himself to increase an inspectorate which was one of the first things I did on taking office.  Obviously these matters take a certain amount of time.</P>
      <P>We cannot get away from the fact that the responsibility is ultimately with the board for the conduct of the business of the appeals process.  It is their responsibility, from the chairman to each board member, to take what steps are necessary and to make any changes necessary for an efficient appeals procedure.  Only time will tell with regard to the effective working of the new board but I am confident that they will deal with the backlog in a reasonable length of time.  I have to reject Deputy Leyden's suggestion that it will be six months.  I see no reason why the new appeals board will not be in office within three months of this legislation being passed by this House.  I think Deputy Leyden was quoting from a misprint in some paper of Saturday, 2 July, because the article does not bear any relationship to the heading.  With the changes envisaged in this legislation and with a new start to the board, I am confident that there will be significant progress on the backlog within a short period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he is unaware of any go slow by the staff of An Bord Pleanála.  He qualified that by saying that &ldquo;during his time he had full co-operation from the staff&rdquo; etc.  Is the Minister not aware of some work practices which have been established within the technical and administrative staff of An Bord Pleanála, particularly in regard to the planning inspectors?  These are not trade union agreements.  They are practices which have built up and which are tantamount to a go slow, whereby the output per planning inspector is accepted to be at a certain level and inspectors are discouraged by their colleagues to be over dúthrachtach in their responsibilities. The number of planning appeal files which inspectors are expected to prepare on a weekly basis has become fairly well established.  They discourage each other from exceeding this number which acts as a brake on the number of files coming to the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This practice has developed over the years and the go slow to which I am referring is not of recent origin.  However I took it that the Minister in examining the operations of the board would have acquainted himself with the procedures and happenings in previous times, because his allegation concerns the output of the board last year.  He started his criticism of them shortly after he took up <Col N="1591" /> office, so he must be referring to the work of the board prior to his coming into Government.  If the Minister says he is not aware that these work practices exist and not aware that there was ever a go slow he should make himself so aware, because it is well known among people who have served on the board in the past that this difficulty existed and affected the number of appeals coming to them and, therefore, restricted the number of appeals they could decide.</P>
    <P>Ignorance is easily claimed, but responsibility lies with the Minister to make himself acquainted with the facts. There may be a reluctance on the part of civil servants to disclose this type of information to the Minister; and the only point of view which I can express, from my position as Opposition spokesman, is that of people who acted on the board in the past whom I have had to approach to obtain information.  I never held office during the lifetime of An Bord Pleanála and I do not have information as to their workings.  I attributed the information I have to a former member and the Minister knows that.  It is based on the evidence of somebody who has practical experience and who has suffered the frustrations of acting on this board and who has seen how the civil service operate. These are people who have been appointed from the private sector, and that is a mixture which is to be encouraged. All parties favour participation at Government level on boards by people who are not directly employed in the public service.  There is a very long record of valuable service to the nation by people who have made themselves available to act in the interests of the State at different levels.  I want to make it clear that I am not making any false allegations: I am conveying the practical experience of people who have served on this board in the past and who have suffered under the difficulties which have been put in their way.</P>
    <P>It is essential that all the staff serving on An Bord Pleanála should be immediately appointed as full-time staff members of the board.  That was the wish of this House when it passed the 1976 Act. <Col N="1592" /> In order to assist in the transition period, staff were seconded from the planning appeals section in the Department of the Environment.  It was never the intention that they would continue to serve permanently in secondment.  The section which we have just re-enacted and which I queried says that the board shall continue to be a body corporate with perpetual succession.  A body corporate means a separate, independent autonomous body empowered by this and other Acts to employ its own staff.  They have never been allowed to do that, which has been the cause of many of the frustrations which the public experience in dealing with this board.  The wishes of this House that we would have an independent, autonomous body dealing with planning appeals and acting expeditiously were never implemented.  We have had a board appointed whose members were appointed by the Minister and the Government, but the administration to serve them has continued under the wing of the civil service in the Department of the Environment.  All sorts of complications and obstacles arise because of the continuation of that arrangement and it should not be allowed to continue any longer.</P>
    <P>The Minister should give an assurance to this House that An Bord Pleanála will be fully established in their own right, with their own staff separately from the Department, and that the umbilical cord will be cut once and for all, because that has been the cause of all the difficulties, innuendo and blame which has been very cleverly and skilfully placed on the shoulders of the members and the chairman. It has been put there by people who are responsible for what is happening.  Successive Ministers for the Environment carry a responsibility for this and I do not absolve any member from this side of the House who held that office.  If there is massive public concern, successive Ministers and administrative heads in the civil service carry responsibility in this matter. It is not just or good for the public service to blame people who are not responsible. If this debate establishes that clearly, it will have done some good and shown that there is justice on some side of the House. <Col N="1593" /> There is no justice in continuing to place the blame where it does not lie.  The transitional arrangements should not have been allowed to continue, but they were and have been the cause of this dissatisfaction and ineffectiveness of the chairman and members.</P>
    <P>There is no more frustrating position than to be chairman or a member of a board when you have no control over the people who are supposed to be your employees.  They maintained their boss was in the Custom House and it was not possible for the chairman or the members to initiate any moves which would have increased the staff by way of planning inspectors or administrative staff.  They did not have the power to employ them. The Minister should make that clear to the House.  Blame has been put in the wrong place.  Shame on this House and shame on a Government who would seek to do so.  If the Minister is not aware of the practices which have developed and of the delays which were taking place at a level other than board level, then he himself is guilty of being negligent in the carrying out of his duties and responsibilities because he should have made it his business to establish these matters which are fairly well known.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister surprises me with his confidence that this new board will be able to expedite appeals.  I wonder if he is being misled by some vested interests within the administration side of the board and only when the new board are constituted will this vested interest surface and we will all know.  A terrible injustice is being done to the board and to the operations and work of the board. I may be wrong, but I believe that there is some vested interest and that the Minister is being misled into believing that in giving this guarantee to reduce the numbers on the board we will make sure that we will be able to expedite planning appeals.  I hope I am wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will confine my comments on the section to getting the background to the legislation as far as I can. Accordingly I am putting questions and I hope that the Minister will not take it, <Col N="1594" /> if the question appears to be a one-marker, two-marker, three-marker or four-marker, that I have any motive other than ascertaining my entitlements here.  There is now an enlightened approach to the worker and employer and the same conditions apply all round. The members of this board are all workers.  In respect of the enlightened approach we have to these contracts, expressed, assumed or implied, the Minister has told us that in connection with the members he proposes to dismiss he corresponded with them, not directly connected with their duties but expressing his concern for the delays in planning appeals.  I ask him whether, in respect of his proposals to dismiss and sack them, he has given to them the normal basic requirements that are given, required and expected and have been provided for by our Governments in respect of what to do or what is required of the master before he presumes to dismiss the employee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point relates to Deputy Molloy's contribution and his questioning as to the work, whether there was a work-to-rule or any possible go slow by the inspectorate.  While it might be quite acceptable and normal that over a period of time there would be an obvious, regular, steady volume of work coming out from the inspectorate, I am satisfied from my inquiries that the inspectorate are producing the maximum possible amount of reports.  That view was substantiated by Mr. Justice Pringle when he said that the inspectors could not do any more than they were doing and that he was quite satisfied that they were doing everything they possibly could in terms of their output.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find myself in 100 per cent agreement with Deputy Molloy as to what is desirable when he said that An Bord Pleanála should be an autonomous, independent board.  The 1976 Act empowers the board to employ their own staff who would not be civil servants.  I certainly do not have to take the blame &mdash; and I am sure Deputy Molloy in fairness would not attribute it in my direction &mdash; for the fact that the arrangement which was originally <Col N="1595" /> meant to be an interim arrangement, the assignment of staff from the Department of the Environment, has taken far longer than is satisfactory or desirable.  With that in mind it is desirable to establish an autonomous and independent board.  It is important, vital, that this board more than any other board in the country be an autonomous, independent body beyond suspicion and beyond reproof.  I started out in that direction when I authorised the board to appoint the board to appoint the four extra members of the inspectorate.  I could have sought to employ extra inspectors within the Department and assign them to An Bord Pleanála.  I did not want to do that because I wanted the board to employ their own members and their own inspectorate.  I gave the guarantee and commitment to Deputy Molloy that I would take all steps necessary to achieve as soon as possible with the minimum of delay, if delays are necessary, that the board should become, as it was originally sought to establish them, the independent autonomous body to which the Deputy refers.</P>

The Deputy hopes that he is wrong and I am sure that time will bear out the fact that his suggestion is unfounded and incorrect.</P>
      <P>In relation to Deputy Tunney's suggestion as to my actions in terms of the dismissal of members of the board, I point out that it is not a question of master and employer or any Government or body dismissing the members.  We are here by statute providing for the cesser of the constitution of the board as they were and their reconstitution.  There have been a fair number of suggestions from the Opposition that my actions are either unconstitutional or not legally valid but I am satisfied that this Bill is within my entitlements as Minister for the Environment within the provisions of the Constitution and I stand over what is intended.</P>

      <P>The Minister seems to think that there is no difficulty in bringing this Bill before the House.  It will be passed by the House due to the voting strength which he has, but it must go to the Seanad and be passed by the Seanad. It may have to come back to the Dáil in the autumn if the Seanad agree to an amendment.  The Minister cannot anticipate the situation or the outcome, even <Col N="1597" /> though he is a barrister.  If the Minister were a practising barrister he would have a good knowledge of the possibility of a constitutional case being taken by the chairman and members of the board.  It is a possibility the Minister should have considered carefully before he decided to drop the guillotine and chop off their heads.</P>
      <P>In relation to the operations of the board, I should like you to tell the House if you delegated the powers of the board, or their authority, to either of your Ministers of State, particularly Deputy Quinn.

Up to the time I was elected I was concerned with planning but I resigned the position.  Due to delays in dealing with planning appeals, would the Minister indicate if he informed An Bord Pleanála that he had resigned his position in the firm?  This is relevant because it has a bearing on the old position.  Did the Minister inform An Bord Pleanála that in relation to appeals going through the board from his firm, that he had resigned from that firm?

For the record &mdash; it is already on record &mdash; the day after I was appointed as Minister of State I wrote to both the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach informing them of my decision to resign forthwith as a director of the firm of which I was a member and that as soon as it was practicably possible and legal I would divest myself of all pecuniary interests <Col N="1599" /> involved.

      <P>In page 4, subsection (1) (a), line 11, after &ldquo;be&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and not later than four months from the date on which the said appeals, references or other matters were lodged with the Board&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The primary stated aims of the Bill are to change the system of appointment of the chairman and the board and to speed up planning appeals.  However, section 4 leaves it wide open for the board to take as long as may be to deal with any application. There is nothing in the section to indicate that the board will be able to or be required to deal more expeditiously with applications.  For that reason I am proposing that the words &ldquo;not later than four months&rdquo; etc. be inserted in the Bill. Our aim in putting the amendment down is to tighten things up and to ensure that the stated purpose will be complied with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Glenn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section of the Bill in which I am most interested as a city councillor.  Like most of my colleagues in Dublin Corporation I am aware of the frustration being caused to the construction industry because of the inordinate delays in planning appeals and the disastrous effects they have in Dublin city.  For instance, a building may be half demolished and on either side properties may be deteriorating while the planning appeal is going on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When introducing the Bill the Minister expressed awareness of the cause of delays in planning appeals and that this <Col N="1600" /> required immediate attention.  I compliment him on the prompt manner in which he has set about correcting the situation. It is not my wish to impugn the members of the board.  I would be less than honest, however, if I did not say I shared the public concern and contempt at the manner in which at least four members of the present board were appointed by the Minister of the day.  In order that this Bill would be seen to correct an unsatisfactory situation I would suggest that the Minister should consider incorporating in the Bill a time limit within which appeals must be determined.  It should be possible to determine an appeal within three months where no oral hearing is required and within six months where an oral hearing is agreed and ordered.</P>
    <P>I would also ask the Minister to embody in the Bill a requirement that applicants receive a copy of the inspector's report and that an explanation of the board's grounds for their decision where an appeal is not granted would be automatically supplied.  This is essential to restore the confidence of the people in the workings of the board.  This is contingent on the board employing adequate qualified staff.  Such staff must be made available in order to expedite appeals.  It is my wish that once and for all the suspicion which has always surrounded planning applications be removed.  If the Minister can succeed in doing that he will be doing all of us a service, the Members of this House, the members of Dublin Corporation planning department and, most important of all, the electorate.  It is essential that the growing young population have respect for this House and the institutions of the State and that respect must be restored.  I am pleased to note that the board will be autonomous and free from interference from whomsoever may take over Government at any time in the future.  Like Caeser's wife, it is essential that the board be above suspicion. In that way we will regain the confidence of the people in relation to planning and An Bord Pleanala.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the amendment in that it seeks to do something <Col N="1601" /> about the interminable delays.  Four months is not an unreasonable period.  I would, however, be worried about the dangers that might ensue as a result of an amendment such as this because it could lead to bad decisions and bad planning. If the pressure experienced by the board in the past were to continue in the future and the board were not able to reach decisions, those decisions would have to go through by default.  At the primary stage of planning it is acceptable enough to have a time limit although, fairly often, because of the fact that there is a big backlog there is an inclination to rush through decisions.  In fact, this was done recently because of possible changes in legislation.  Applications were rushed through without due consideration.  At the appeal stage the real decision is made and that is it.  There will be no right of appeal so we shall have to rely on another method to speed things up.  I think that is what the Minister is trying to do in that he will be able to interfere to the extent of having the workings of the board examined.  The Bill does not specify how exactly he will do that and, though I sympathise with the possible effect that might have in certain cases of delays, it would result in bad planning and bad decisions not being made.  I would, therefore, be in disagreement with the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree with the general wish but not the specifics in this amendment that there should be some obligation on An Bord Pleanála to make decisions within a specified time. Amendment No. 64 seeks to place some kind of obligation on the board to deal with appeals expeditiously within a stated period.  It might not always be possible to deal with an appeal within four months. Local authorities are obliged to make decisions within two months but there are ways in which they can extend the period by requesting further information and so on.  That seems to operate fairly satisfactorily.  Many people because they are ignorant of how An Bord Pleanála works and the reasons for the delays have been critical of the board and they have suggested a time limit.  That may not be <Col N="1602" /> practicable.  The only way in which appeals can be dealt with more speedily is by providing adequate staff.  The Minister has sanctioned the appointment of four extra inspectors.  That will not bring about any substantial improvement.  The number of inspectors should be doubled. The number at the moment, 15 or 16, is completely inadequate.  Appeals could be decided in half the time if the number of inspectors were doubled.  I stand over that statement and I think the Minister will find it very hard to challenge it.  That is the real problem and it is a problem that has not been dealt with up to now.</P>
      <P>There should be some obligation on the board to act expeditiously but they cannot do that unless they have an adequate staff.  Passing an amendment that they must decide in four months will not solve the problem.  We support the thrust of the amendment and the principle but it is useless unless there is a firm commitment from the Minister to allow the chairman to employ more staff in whatever numbers are required.  If the Minister for Finance or the Minister for the Public Service places an embargo on employment and the staff of the board are regarded as part of the public service no increase in staff will be allowed and therefore no improvement in the number of decisions.  Judging by the report the cost of the board is not excessive considering its importance in regard to development and employment.  The board plays a very important role in determining the amount of work available on construction sites.</P>
      <P>With all the fuss the Minister is making and the rush to disband this board one might get the impression that all planning decisions are made by An Bord Pleanála. In fact only about 20 per cent of planning decisions are appealed and are decided by the board.  The other 80 per cent of decisions are made at local authority level.  I am not sure whether I have the exact figure.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us.  Many important decisions are made at local authority level and there is no concern being expressed here as to the quality of those decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whenever anybody has to make a decision it involves a person expressing <Col N="1603" /> some of his own opinion in the matter. With experience one's judgment improves, one's knowledge of one's subject improves and the quality of one's decision making improves.  At all times it has to be a subjective thing and each individual who contributes to the decision has his input.  One planning inspector may recommend refusal where another would recommend granting permission. I have seen that time and again. No two people will arrive at exactly the same decision in regard to every application. Somebody must find the consensus of the common will for the common good and someone has to make a final decision.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we are seeking perfection but does anybody in this House think we will achieve a situation where decisions will meet everybody's point of view.  That is not humanly possible.  We need good quality planning decisions based on knowledge, experience and commitment. The delays that have been taking place have had a serious effect on the construction industry.  I expressed concern about that shortly after coming into this new Dáil before I was appointed spokesman in this area.  I have been critical of delays that have taken place but I have never sought to put the blame in the wrong place as the Minister is doing.  The roundabout way in which he is seeking to do something about it is a shame and a disgrace.</P>
    <P>I agree with the general wish of this amendment but we will not be supporting it because it is too restrictive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>Delays cause quite a lot of frustration but I would be very cautious about rushing appeals through because sometimes when appeals are delayed it is to ensure justice, to ensure that everybody who is involved is consulted.  The Minister should try to find a way of expediting the finalisation of appeals.  It would be far better if we had some kind of statement from the Minister as to how appeals could be expedited instead of talking about the abolition of the board. Section 4 (b) reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1604" /> The board shall conduct, at such intervals as it thinks fit or the Minister directs, reviews of its organisation and of the systems and procedures used by it in relation to appeals, references and other matters with which it is concerned.</P>
    <P>Who are in the best position to review the practices and procedures of planning appeals?  Surely it is the existing board, the people with experience, who know exactly why appeals are held up and how things could be changed to expedite matters. Unfortunately I do not think the board were consulted at any time as to how they would formulate new plans and practices so as to expedite planning decisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister could aspire to a target of, say, four months and aim to have all appeals finalised within that period.  One method of doing that would be to measure the performance of the Department, and I agree with Deputy Molloy that the appeals board should have its own staff and they should be removed from the Department of the Environment.  By examining the workload and the efficiency of the appeals board staff he could aim for a target of four months.  It would help the public if it was declared that the board were going to try to get appeals through in four months.  The number of appeals that went over that period should be announced in public.  When they do go over that period extra staff should be brought in to clear the backlog.  I know that at primary level the fact that there is a period of two months specified has a tremendous effect.  A company might have a lot of money borrowed from the bank depending on the appeal and if it goes on for nine months it can be very costly.  If they knew it would be approximately three or four months it would be a great help to the banks and everybody else.</P>

      <P>Since we are speaking about a time span I would refer to a matter which could more appropriately be referred to under section 16, although by the time we reach that section we will <Col N="1605" /> not have time to discuss it.  I wish the Minister to put a time limit on the vexatious type of appeal.  I refer to an appeal made against planning permission for, say, a bathroom or a kitchenette just because of a neighbourly unhappiness between persons.  On several occasions I have come across mischievous appeals lodged only because of a falling out with a neighbour.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the overall question of time there is consensus, in that we would all like to see decisions being dealt with expeditiously.  However we must take into account the existing backlog of 3,500 cases.  It would be impractical in view of that backlog to put in a time limit now.  When we have reduced the backlog to an acceptable working level &mdash; say in about 15 to 18 months &mdash; I could again look at the question of a time limit.  There are difficult types of cases and constraints in relation to the amount of information which must be taken in.  The suggestion of four months sounds reasonable in the context of the two months being allotted to the local authority.  When the backlog is reduced there is authority in this section for me to consult with the board as to what they would see as being a reasonable amount of time.  We want to be in a situation where the public will be able to estimate the amount of time a planning decision will take.  It is clear that at the moment that there is total uncertainty as to the amount of time a planning decision can take.  This places the building industry and the private individual in great difficulties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>My purpose in putting down the amendment was so that we could have a debate on this aspect.  While I can see the practical difficulty in providing <Col N="1606" /> for a fixed time, I had hoped that the Minister would come up with some alternative. The Minister has indicated that he is well disposed towards having a time limit.  What will the Minister do in 15 or 18 months' time?  What powers does the Minister have under this Bill to fix a time limit on appeals from that date on?  I am not aware of any power in this Bill to enable the Minister to require An Bord Pleanála to complete their work within a specified time.  There have been arguments and counter-arguments about the reasons for the delays.  On the one hand people say that the board deals with appeals within a week and other people claim that it takes longer.  But if there is a fixed time within which the board must complete their work that would be an incentive to get all the other elements working well.</P>
      <P>We have further amendments down on this Bill which would make it obligatory on the appellant to submit the correct information so that there would be no delays from that end.  If our amendments are accepted the board can dismiss an appeal in which insufficient information is provided by the appellant.  Apart from the board there are other agencies involved.  If one agency falls down it can cause delays, but there must be some time limit within which the board must give their decision.  I accept that there are difficulties and a backlog of cases but the Minister should give us something more substantial than just that he will look at it again in 15 months time.  The construction industry is depending on an efficient planning system.  If it is possible for local planning authorities to deal with planning applications within two months, then it is not unreasonable to expect the board to deal with planning applications within four months.</P>

In the appeals regulations I am empowered under the 1976 Act to make regulations in relation to the conduct of appeals or under section 4 of this Bill I can issue a directive.  It is justifiable to say that because of the backlog it is impractical to make a final decision during the course of this discussion.</P>

      <P>In page 4, between lines 28 and 29, to insert a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  Where the Minister gives a directive under subsection (1), the following provisions shall apply&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  as soon as may be the Minister shall cause a copy of the directive to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas,</P>

      <P>(c)  the Minister shall cause a copy of the directive to be sent to each planning authority and to the Board.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a new subsection being proposed. It is standard that such directive be given and it is based on the provisions of section 7 of the 1982 Act.  I maintain that a similar provision should be contained in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of the amendment would seem to be to require directives under section 4 (1) (c) to be published in the same way as general policy directives are required to be published under the provisions of the 1982 Act.  I would point out that there is a major difference in that general policy directives are matters to which regard must be had in dealing with particular applications and appeals and it is right that the public should have full knowledge of them.  What are involved in this section are merely systems, procedures and organisational matters.  If, as a result of a review under that section a need was identified for major changes which would be of public concern the proper way to give effect to these would be by way of amendment of the appeals regulations made under section 20 of the 1976 Act. It is clear from subsection (4) that directives are not meant to override or supersede such regulations.  I might add also that directives under section 4 (1) would relate normally only to matters which, while they may be important from the point of view of efficiency would not of themselves be of real public concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1609" /> For that reason I do not accept that such directives should be published in the manner proposed.  Obviously they would be referred to by the board in their annual report and that way the public would be informed of them.  Therefore there is no effort being made to keep the knowledge or information from the public.  Also, if any directive were to relate to a matter of real public concern it would have to be made and published as a statutory instrument under the provisions of the Statutory Instruments Act 1947, as was done in the case of the shopping directive, with which we are all familiar under the 1982 Act.</P>

      <P>The late Mr. Justice Walsh who was chairman of An Bord Pleanála at the time of his death wrote some very learned papers on the operation of the Planning Acts in this country.  In one such &ldquo;Planning and Development Law&rdquo; he made reference to this type of provision in the Planning Acts where he said:</P>
      <P>A Planning Authority may grant permission or approval subject to conditions. Sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the Planning Act 1963 sets out a list of conditions which may be imposed but this list is expressly stated to be without prejudice to the generality of the preceding sub-section which confers a general right to impose conditions. There is, however, a clear ambiguity and the precise interpretation of Section 26 (1) and (2) has yet to be determined.</P>
      <P>He poses the question:</P>
      <P>Can only section 26 (2) conditions be imposed, or can other undefined in the Act be formulated under section 26 (1)?</P>
      <P>He states further:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1610" /> The question is confused rather than clarified by the insertion of the words &ldquo;without prejudice to the generality of that subsection&rdquo; which appear in sub-section (2) and relate to the earlier subsection.</P>

      <P>I would have the greatest respect for anything written by the late Mr. Justice Walsh in relation to planning law in this country.  He was recognised as one of the foremost members of his profession in relation to planning matters. In fairness to Deputy Molloy I should say he is just slightly off the mark in that I accept the criticism made by Mr. Justice Walsh as to the inclusion of the expression &ldquo;without prejudice to the generality&rdquo;. That form of draftsmanship may need to be clarified and I think the Justice was making that point.</P>
      <P>But, in relation to section 4 which we are now discussing, a statement in the section purports that I would not be in a position to make any directive which would override any part of the Bill or any regulation which would be made thereunder. I can only concur with the Deputy and with the late Justice Walsh that, in the wider context, that expression &ldquo;without prejudice to the generality&rdquo; should be avoided because of any confusion it might create.  But I do not think he would draw the same conclusions in relation to its inclusion in this section.</P>

      <P>That is the very distinction I am trying to draw between what the Justice was pointing out.  He was criticising the inclusion of the expression &ldquo;with-our prejudice to the generality&rdquo; which may have been over-used whereas, in this section &mdash; by virtue of the fact that we are not employing that terminology &mdash; I, or any future Minister for the Environment, would be confined to the situation in which no directive can be given under this section which would purport to override any other section or any regulations made thereunder.</P>

      <P>I accept what the Minister says about that.  But may I ask him why he includes subsection (4) (b) (ii) which reads:</P>
      <P>the provisions of any other enactment, order, regulation or other instrument thereunder which so relates.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister why it was considered necessary to have a separate subparagraph when one compares this to the provision in subsection (3) (b) which states, &ldquo;or by any other enactment...&rdquo;. It seems superfluous to include it again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>They are basically different subsections.  The main concern in regard to subsection (4) (b) (ii) was to relate to an appeals procedure in regard to the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977.  The purpose behind the inclusion there was to ensure that specific provisions in that Act, or the Housing Act, 1969, are not overridden in the interest of expeditious processing.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 9, in the name of Deputy Molloy, relates to this section.  Do I take it that the Deputy wishes that amendment be taken on its own?  It has been suggested to me &mdash; I am not pushing this &mdash; that amendments Nos. 9, 10 and 11 are related <Col N="1612" /> and might be taken together but voted on separately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree to take amendments Nos. 9 and 10 together.  I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 5, lines 6 and 7, to delete paragraph (c) and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) the Chairman of the General Council of County Councils,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We are opposed to the whole principle of the Bill in regard to changing the personnel of An Bord Pleanála in this fashion. The section is important because under it a chairman will be appointed.  That appointment is to be carried out through the process described in the section: a selection committee will be established by the Minister consisting of certain people and it will examine applicants for the post of chairman and make recommendations to the Government.  The selection committee will recommend three names.  The Government will consider them and are entitled to appoint any of the three.  If the Government do not like any of the three they can instruct the selection committee to re-advertise the positions and interview new people before recommending a further three names.  If the Government are not satisfied with the second set of names they are not obliged to appoint any of them and can require the committee to go through the procedure again.  That process can continue indefinitely.  It is farcical to think that such a device is being used to convey the impression that the Government are not going to make the appointment of chairman.  The fact is that the chairman under existing legislation is appointed by the Government and when the Bill becomes law the chairman will also be appointed by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies opposite spoke about changes in the system of appointment and the Minister told the House that the Bill provided for a change in the method of appointment of the chairman of the board.  That is not true.  The Bill does not provide for any change in the system, which is the same as existed in the past. <Col N="1613" /> The Government of the day will decide on the chairman of the board.  That point has not been put across by the Minister or any Member of the Government side. They have fluffed over this.  Last week I was on a radio programme with a Government backbencher and after I had congratulated him on his appointment as Lord Mayor of Dublin he told me that the Government would appoint a committee to select the chairman and members of the board.  Government Deputies are not <i>au fait</i> with the provisions of the Bill and that Deputy was incorrect.  He was under the impression that the committee the Minister is establishing will appoint the members of the board, but that is not so.</P>
    <P>I will repeat what will happen so that it sinks home.  The Minister is finding a device to give the impression that a new system of appointment is being introduced, but that is not so.  It seems farcical to involve so many people in this charade of interviewing people and making recommendations when there is not any obligation on the Government to accept any of the recommendations.  The existing position will obtain in the future also. We have to argue from two points of view.  We are vehemently opposed to this procedure.  Our opposition to the principle in the Bill of firing a board without due cause is a fundamental one and, in the course of the debate, we gave notice that any person who accepts an appointment under section 5, if the Government make an appointment under it, will find that the section will be rescinded if an when we are returned to Government. That is a firm commitment by our party.</P>
    <P>Having stated our opposition to the process of establishing a selection committee and the making of an appointment to the chairmanship of the board, we accept that because of the Government's voting strength our decision to oppose this is not likely to succeed.  We do not have sufficient votes in the House to block the Government's moves.  Therefore, we must argue on the basis of trying to improve what the Government are proposing as the law of the land.  If we are to have this ridiculous committee we must look at the personnel to be <Col N="1614" /> appointed to it.  The Government propose to appoint the President of the High Court, the Secretary of the Department of the Environment, the chief engineering adviser of the Department of the Environment, the chairman of the Council of An Taisce &mdash; the National Trust for Ireland &mdash; the President of the Construction Industry Federation and the President of the Executive Council of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  The people who hold those offices are worthy persons and we do not seek to denigrate their characters or ability in any way.  We may question their motivation in certain instances later, but we must query why the Department of the Environment have two representatives on the selection committee. We cannot see any great need for the Minister to have two officials on that committee.  Surely it would be adequate to have the Secretary representing the administrative side of the Department. We cannot see any justification for including the chief engineering adviser of the Department.  That official may have special qualifications in the area of planning and in that case the Secretary should stand aside.  We object to two representatives of the Department on the selection committee.</P>
    <P>We also object to having the chairman of the Council of An Taisce on the selection committee.  There is provision in section 7 to establish groups to make recommendations to the Minister on who should be appointed to the board and there is room for an organisation such as An Taisce there.  We do not believe An Taisce should have a place equal to the other people listed in the section.  We have no objection to the President of the Construction Industry Federation and the President of the Executive Council of ICTU because it will mean that both sides of industry will be represented.  That is suitable and proper if we are to have a selection committee.  However, there is a glaring omission from the list.  It indicates to this side of the House the attitude of the Minister to elected representatives. We have already debated The Local Government (Financial Provisions) Bill whereby the role of elected county councillors was downgraded in a <Col N="1615" /> very fundamental way and a new role given to the county manager to impose taxation at local authority level without having to obtain the sanction of the elected members of the council, the representatives of the people.  We decried that move by the Minister to downgrade the elected local authority members, the county council members and corporation members.</P>
    <P>We question why the Minister has not thought fit to give representation on this selection committee to elected representatives who have a statutory role to play in planning.  In the 1963 Act the making of a development plan is a reserved function of elected county councillors and corporation members.  All the planning process and all the decisions arrived at have to take into account the objectives laid out in each county development plan.  These are adopted by the elected local councillors.  We feel the omission of elected councillors from this selection committee is a slight on the important statutory role which public representatives at local authority level play in the planning process.  We propose in our amendment that the double representation of the Department be changed and that the Secretary should be allowed to represent the Minister and the Department, that the chief engineer and adviser should be removed and replaced by the chairman of the General Council of County Councils.  We propose that the chairman of the board of An Taisce should be deleted and replaced by the chairman of the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am amazed that the Minister made this serious omission and failed to give due recognition to local elected councillors in the important role they play in the whole planning process.  It seems to indicate the objective of the Government to remove the county councillors completely from the planning process.  They have no role to play in the selection committee and we have been told that the role of elected representatives is to be removed altogether from this whole planning process.  That is the trend of the decision-making by the Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1616" /> We see great danger in that and we see it leading on to greater chaos and unrest. Planning was, possibly, one of the greatest restrictions placed on the people in relation to any Bill brought before the House.  The 1963 Act affected every development that took place in the country since then and has had an effect in some way on every man, woman and child in the country.  The ready acceptance of this new discipline in the years since then has been largely due to the fact that these development plans are adopted at local level by local elected representatives, people who are known to the community affected, people who are available to the community affected and people who will listen to the difficulties when they arise.  They have performed a very important function in getting general acceptance of the planning process throughout the country.  That has been one of the major achievements of local councillors in the years since the Planning Act was adopted.</P>
    <P>That is our attitude in relation to these two amendments.  We feel the Minister has made a serious omission.  We have put down an amendment to allow him to correct the situation.  We appeal to him to give recognition in his selection committee to the role of the elected councillor. In doing so we will accept whoever the general council appoint as their chairman and whoever the municipal authorities appoint as their chairman.</P>

      <P>I regret the background to this legislation.  Unfortunately, it is because of outrageous behaviour by a member of the previous Administration that this Bill has come before us.  Nobody can justify what happened then.  That is the reason this section dealing with the appointment of members and the appointment of the chairman has been put into the Bill.  Even the most balanced, impartial observer would say that the appointment of political aides or members of political parties purely on that basis to a planning board is an outrageous act.  That is what happened, and there is no point in putting a tooth in it.  That is the reason this Bill is necessary.  In doing this, politicians are their own worst enemies because we are removing from ourselves time and time again all the input we can make to responsible local government planning by appearing to abuse powers.  We have, first of all, questions hanging over ministerial decisions, then we appoint An Bord Pleanála and questions hang over that.  The background to this section is outrageous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have very strong reservations about the role the Minister is taking here and I want to express them.  I know the Minister and the Minister of State are doing a very good job in the Department of the Environment and that they have great enthusiasm for their jobs.  As a matter of principle, I oppose this approach by the Government generally.  If it was any other Minister and any other Department I would be expressing this view as well. I believe very strongly in a strong Parliament and in a strong Government.  I do not believe that a Government elected by a Parliament should in turn elect or appoint another body or a committee and that they should, in turn, appoint somebody else.  The buck has to stop somewhere, and this whole approach of making the elected representatives give up powers to civil servants and outside nominees in my view is something we have to <Col N="1618" /> guard against.  I have very strong reservations about this.</P>
    <P>There is a suspicion that there has been political abuse in the past or impropriety in relation to appointments. The way to deal with that is to set up machinery so that Parliament can satisfy itself as to the propriety of the people exercising the powers we are giving them by an Act of Parliament. I do not believe the way to do it is to go along looking at a committee.  I have very strong objections to the way powers are being taken away from local government representatives and county councillors.  I also object very strongly to the way powers are constantly being taken away from elected people.  I believe we should be doing the reverse of what this section in principle does.  This section is giving more power and more influence to the permanent head of the civil service in that Department, to other people in the civil service and to nominees of people who are not elected by anybody. That is a serious error which is not just made in the Department of the Environment but is being made in every section of Government day in and day out and this Parliament has put up with it.  It is not good enough to say that it happened under this Government: it also happened when Fianna Fáil were in Government. However, backbenchers have not got the gumption to say we are having no more of this nonsense, that parliament has a function in the matter and that we will not tolerate it happening any more.  Last year when Mrs. Thatcher appointed someone whom she chose as head of a financial agency in Britain&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am trying to say that in other areas prime ministers take decisions and they decide what should happen but in this country the Government and Parliament are not doing the job they were given.  I recent sections like this being put into Bills, presumably by civil servants.  I resent sections being put into Bills making it an offence for people in statutory bodies to communicate information to outsiders, including Deputies or the Minister, if they consider there is an impropriety going on in a board.  This happened in another board where an official supplied information to the Minister without the consent of the chief executive of the board and was suspended for so doing.</P>
      <P>I am sorry to have to say this.  I was not consulted about this Bill and I did not expect to be consulted because of the way these Bills must necessarily be brought in.  However, I feel obliged to put my views on the record of the House, as I have done from time to time since I became a Member of this House.  I ask the Minister to take cognisance of what I have said.  Why should permanent civil servants or people who are not elected and who have no mandate be given powers of this nature?  I resent the idea that everyone is trustworthy except members of parliament.  I do not think this section will do anything for the institution of parliament.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a source of great pleasure to me &mdash; although I hope it will not be a source of embarrassment to Deputy Mitchell &mdash; to say that I agree entirely with what he has said.  It is entirely in line with what I said on Second Stage.  Our amendment does no more than recognise that there are those who, in accordance with the democracy we practice, are elected by the people.  I am <Col N="1620" /> surprised that any Minister or Minister of State, presuming to represent the traditions of the Labour Party, would put before this House legislation that excludes the rightful place of those elected by the people, who are answerable to and who may be dismissed by the people.  Our amendment seeks to recover that position.</P>
      <P>What is proposed in the Bill is as much on the road to the subversion of this House as anything that might happen outside in a more tyrannical or violent fashion and I am sure that on reflection the Minister will appreciate that.  Why should he delegate his power, his rights and his responsibility to anyone else?  He is careful to establish that ultimately he may do this and he is giving the whole matter a veneer of being non-political. We should be proud of the political aspect.  I am proud of being a Member of this House and I am proud of my colleagues. I might disagree with the approach of earlier speakers in attributing misdemeanours to Members opposite. I served with Deputy Quinn in the Dublin Corporation.  We were aware that professionally he was entitled to have an interest, which he declared, but his presence or absence at committee meetings did not influence one way or another any member of the planning committee.  Yet, here we are signalling to the nation that politicians are not fit to carry on that good work.  It is an acknowledgement by this House that the people who voted for urban councillors, county councillors and Members of Dáil Éireann are not to have their rights.  We are saying to them we are not capable of discharging our responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Personally I do not want to see any selection committee.  In respect of planning matters, to whom is the President of the High Court responsible?  In a speech the Minister stated that this procedure applies more or less to the appointment of the Director of Public Prosecutions. Where is the analogy between that and matters of politics, of planning and issues relating to the environment, where we have elected people dealing with such matters every day?  The Minister has available to him in his own party and <Col N="1621" /> elsewhere people with expertise in planning and development that, in my opinion, is far greater than can be supplied by the President of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  I do not know the man but I am sure he is an expert in industrial relations matter.  However, I do not know if he has any qualification with regard to planning, development or the environment. I would say the same of the President of the Construction Industry Federation. What does he know of planning? The chairman of the General Council of County Councils&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not want to take issue with the Chair but in deference to my establishing that the chairman of the General Council of County Councils because he represents elected people is more entitled to representation here than some non-elected people, with the indulgence of the Chair I was referring to others who are nominated, to strengthen my argument that the amendment should be accepted.  If I have strayed too far I will take the advice of the Chair and restrain myself.  An Taisce are a great organisation &mdash; I have friends in it &mdash; but they do not enjoy any mandate from the people.  I do not see why we should reject a proposition that comes before this House specifically now contrasting the <Col N="1622" /> rights of the chairman of An Taisce with those of the chairman of the General Council of County Councils.</P>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa and Deputy Skelly have yet to enjoy the great office of county councillor but I hope they will accept that the issue at stake here is fundamental to the whole situation.  Do they, as elected Members, reject the right of this House to nominate the chairman of the General Council of County Councils on a selection board as against the chairman of An Taisce?  If they want to be at ease with themselves there is only one answer, whatever embarrassment they might feel regarding the Minister. Deputy Gay Mitchell and other Deputies have spoken here of the unease they feel and of their position being somewhat eroded.  This is an opportunity for them to assert the rights and responsibilities of elected people.  The chairman of An Taisce &mdash; perhaps it is a chairwoman &mdash; has expertise and knowledge but is that knowledge superior to that of the local representatives in every constituency who themselves are the planning authorities? That is the question that Deputies, especially those who are members of local authorities, must put to themselves before they vote.</P>
      <P>I am expressing a consistency that has not been manifested by the Minister or his Minister of State.  In the latest proposal to amend the Constitution I heard Deputy Quinn assert here for nearly an hour his rejection of the right of anybody even to suggest that we should bring in legislation of that nature.  He talked about SPUC and other pro-life groups and, to the point of being insulting, he challenged their right to presume to do anything here to push, direct or to take from elected representatives their right and responsibility.  He said that legislation was unwanted and unnecessary. Now in respect of legislation which we all agree is vital he says that public representatives should not appoint people who have no mandate from the public.  If that is what the parties on the other side of the House want let them have it but it will haunt them later on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from this section <Col N="1623" /> that the committee referred to will select the chairman and the Government will then appoint him.  A number of contentious issues are raised in the selection of bodies put before us and there may even be a flaw in it because I can see where there will be a conflict of interests. I know we are discussing sections 9 and 10 but in broad reference to the Construction Industry Federation and perhaps An Taisce, the former represent builders only.  They do not represent planners or other people with expertise as Deputy Tunney said.  There is a problem in relation to the people who are going to select the chairman.  We need an experienced person to act as chairman of this board. However, I am puzzled at the omission from this committee of anybody associated with architecture.  I thought they would have had the president of the RIAI or somebody like that because it is the only profession which, as well as being involved with design and planning, also takes the social aspects of their designs into consideration.  Many of the good things we see around us have had a large input by that august body.  As far as I remember, from my university days, it is one of the most learned faculties and demands discipline.  By right this body should be represented in the selection of a chairman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with the composition of this committee.  I do not know how much thought has gone into it but if someone were selecting a chairman in a high technology company or in the oil industry the person interviewing and selecting would have to know what was needed.  Deputy Tunney spoke respectfully about different associations represented on this committee but I do not see where the expertise will come in selecting such a vital person as the chairman of An Bord Pleanála.  I know the ordinary members will be selected from different professions and maybe it is intended to bring in an architect at that level but I cannot see how we can omit a member of that profession from representation when selecting the chairman because he would have an eye to future planning all around <Col N="1624" /> the country.  In this century I do not think architects will be remembered kindly for many things that have been done.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa has invited us to discuss amendment No. 11 but I must refer to the section.  The Construction Industry Federation does not come under amendments Nos. 9 or 10 but it should be mentioned.  There was a point of view expressed that members of An Taisce would try to block planning applications whereas the Construction Industry Federation might be trying to push decisions. If that were the case they would neutralise each other.  Then you would be left with the president of the ICTU.</P>

      <P>It is a passing reference because I will not say two sentences on it, but if it is the president of the ICTU people will expect that anything associated with work or providing work in the construction industry should be pushed. That would immediately cause an imbalance, and the people left who would really have influence in selecting the chairman would be the chief engineering adviser for the Department of the Environment &mdash; who Deputy Molloy suggested should be replaced by the chairman of the General Council of County Councils &mdash; the Secretary of the Department and the President of the High Court.  I cannot see that these are the proper people to choose a chairman of the Planning Board, a vital appointment. I ask the Minister to reconsider this section and at least to include a member of the architectural profession who would have a better right and be better qualified to interview and assess the type of person who should be chairman of this board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Molloy mentioned An Taisce and he seemed to be worried about them. I do not think that they would necessarily set out to block applications but they would be interested at all times in good planning, and that would be no bad thing for this city or for the country.  Someone capable, having eyes to see what should <Col N="1625" /> be done in the area of planning, would be a great help in this regard.</P>
    <P>This section of the Bill is very important and it should not be left as it is.  I do not know whether I am permitted to mention the other replacement that Deputy Molloy was talking about.  I do not think that the chairman of the General Council of County Councils, with all due respect to him, would be suitable for the same reasons that the gentlemen I have mentioned are not suitable.  The position is close to being a political appointment in that the appointee will be very strongly representative of one of the major parties, and that would render him ineligible, given that the objective here is to separate the planning appeal board and make them independent.  I ask the Minister to bear in mind that this committee will select a chairman and we need someone on this committee who will be imaginative and sympathetic in regard to planning, who will be knowledgeable in the area of planning and engineering and who will know the needs and requirements over all.</P>
    <P>In passing I must say that An Taisce recently produced a document which took three years to compile.  It concerns future planning and preservation of the city of Dublin and it is an excellent document. I cannot see that that organisation can do anything other than help us in improving our surroundings.</P>
    <P>Again I ask the Minister to reconsider this section and to allow a member of the architectural profession in at this stage and possibly exclude some of the other people.  I do not think it necessary for either the CII or the ICTU to be represented. It is wrong to depend entirely on the President of the High Court.  I do not see his function here apart from the fact that he is a person of upright character and of high standing in the community. We are left then with the Secretary of the Department who is, with all due respect to him, a civil servant, making these appointments.  The whole section falls down in that area.</P>

      <P>I will address myself to section 5 and our amendments Nos. 9 and 10 which deal with the substitution <Col N="1626" /> of the chairperson of the General Council of County Councils and the chairman of the Association of the Municipal Authorities of Ireland for the chief engineering adviser of the Department of the Environment and the chairperson of the Council of An Taisce.</P>
      <P>The general idea of a committee reminds me of a giant sieve through which people may or may not slip at the will of somebody who will oversee the slipping of people through it.  That is the most down-to-earth explanation I can put upon it.  The will of the person who will let people through the sieve is behind all this.  It is really political pressure dressed up in an attractive frock or coat or whatever one likes to call it.</P>
      <P>Regarding the amendments, I was very privileged to be present in Mullingar recently when the Minister went there to address the General Council of County Councils.  The chairman of that body is a very esteemed member of his own party. I do not wish to name him here.  It is very obnoxious that the Minister would not think that the chairperson of the General Council of County Councils, a person appointed by the people at county council level and later a Member of the Seanad, infinitely better qualified&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am addressing myself to you, a Cheann Comhairle, not like other speakers.  Encouragement is always good.  Great stress has been laid in this House on democracy, and throughout the land there is a general reappraisal of political people and representatives. I speak as one who has come up through the system from an urban council to a county council to the Seanad and to the Dáil.  Despite allegations that I am here because of the name I bore, I have reached this stage because I put myself before the electorate each time and was elected.  There is a general perception of elected people to which we are not contributing here today when we are denigrating the role of representatives. <Col N="1627" /> By not agreeing to our amendment and by passing the section that the Minister has put in front of us with his provision for a very classy election board, we are running down the role of the elected person, the person who has sat at county council meetings, be it the person who is at present the incumbent of that office or otherwise.  The office rotates from year to year so that there is no need to worry that it will always be in the hands of one person or one party.  There are always changes at local and national level.</P>
      <P>The chairperson of the General Council of County Councils or the chairperson of the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland will have sat at urban council tables and county council tables perhaps for years on end.  He or she will have contributed to county or town development plans, will have served on county councils or corporations, will have experience of environmental matters and will know what he or she is talking about.  What right has any lobby &mdash; I must here pay tribute to the esteemed people of An Taisce &mdash; to replace such people with such undenied experience?  Such lobbies have never stood on doorsteps or put themselves before the people, and they never will do it.  However, they are now to be the people who will select members of this board.</P>
      <P>I have noticed that many people on the other side, if not by voice by their facial expressions, have shown that they agree with what we are saying in this matter.  I do not want to denigrate the chief engineering adviser or the chairman of An Taisce, but they are not people who are accountable to the electorate.  They do not have to go before the people.  We have to do that every five years; we have to account to the people for what we have done in the previous five years and what we intend to do in the next five years.  I must tell the Minister what he will be doing when he rejects our amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I said earlier I had some reservations in regard to the proposed change these amendments would bring about.  I have tremendous respect for the Minister for the Environment.  I have the utmost trust in him and the greatest respect possible for the way he is carrying out his duties and the way in which he will make appointments.  I would have the same respect for future Ministers for the Environment.  I have learned from experience during the years I have been here to respect the powers and functions to be performed by Ministers.  Now, however, we are to have a committee and an authority set up and I view this with very serious reservations and if this continues to arise I will be making stronger gestures.</P>
      <P>Where possible it is necessary that power should be retained by those elected by the people, who are shrewd and smart in their own way and who very rarely make wrong decisions.  Of course there is a strong possibility that the people who will be on this selection committee will possess honesty and integrity, but there is also the possibility that those whom they select to the board will bring to the board the organisations' viewpoint. That may be good for planning but I doubt it and I am worried about it.</P>
      <P>I respect all the people who will be doing this work.  The President of the High Court is one of the finest judges Ireland has known and the Secretary of the Department is a fine person, but this may not be the best way to do things. Perhaps the Ceann Comhairle would be the best person to appoint a chairman.  In Britain, with all its failings, they have the planning decisions in the hands of the Secretary of State whose decisions shall be final.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we are changing all that.  We are to have a board not directly appointed by the Government.  My view at this late stage is that because this is to be a <Col N="1629" /> quasi-judicial body it will have to be above reproach.  We are meddling with the present situation.  I strongly suggest politicians should have some say in this. I have always respected the viewpoints of the electorate.  If we are going to change and if we are to have a chairman appointed by somebody from outside the Government I would prefer to see the matter left completely in the hands of the Judiciary.  The situation in regard to the backlog has been very bad over the last 18 months or so.</P>

It would improve the system because it would streamline it.  There may be some people who would object to the Judiciary but I certainly would take it completely out of the hands of public representatives and give it into the hands of the Judiciary.  That would improve the system.  Some might object to removing powers out of the hands of elected representatives. I have spoken on this before, long before this Bill was introduced. I am on record in regard to taking powers from the people.  This is a tremendously important matter and I am glad to have my views recorded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>These are amendments to the section which sets up the committee to appoint the chairman, the replacement for the eminent member of the Judiciary whom the Tánaiste has decided to fire.  It is not possible in a limited debate like this to deal as adequately as one would like with these amendments.  Our non-acceptance of the Bill has been stressed repeatedly but not until to-night have the backbenches on that side of the House realised how right our arguments have been.  I have listened to many speakers.  I have just heard Deputy Enright, an experienced Member <Col N="1630" /> express grave reservations about what the Tánaiste is doing.  I appeal to the Tánaiste to accept these amendments.  I appeal to him as leader of a party which has paid lipservice to democracy for so long.  The choice is very clear.  You accept as chairman of the General Council of County Councils, himself an elected person, or do you appoint some technocrat or bureaucrat, admirable though he may be.  We are conceding rights here to the Chairman of the General Council and the Chairman of the municipal authorities, elected by the people in the first instance and, secondly, municipal authority nominees or county council nominees.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste is doing this House a great disservice.  I claim more experience than Deputy Skelly has on the political side of the fence and I believe no group has given such committed and dedicated service and devoted so much time to local affairs as have members of local authorities. We should never forget that.  If a small number do not measure up to the vast majority, that applies to any group. The two amendments go in some small way towards improving what is a very bad situation, a situation which is unacceptable to Deputy Enright, a very experienced Member of this House.  The Tánaiste should withdraw the section or accept the amendments.</P>

      <P>I want to make this quite clear because allegations were made that certain backbenchers did not support the Tánaiste.  What he is doing in this section is correct and proper and backbenchers support him fully.  I said originally planning should be outside of parliament.  When it was in the control of politicians it was grossly abused.  There is a difference between the Labour Party's point of view on planning and the view of the other two conservative parties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments seek to amend the committee which would select nominees to elect a chairperson for An Bord Pleanála who would subsequently be appointed by the Government. I am not entirely satisfied with this procedure.  I would prefer to see a body similar to the Civil Service Commission having responsibility for the appointment to this particular office.  However, having gone for a select committee based on interested groups, I have no objection at all to the addition of the chairperson of the General Council of County Councils or municipal authorities but I cannot see the value in deleting the chief engineering advisers of the Department or the chairman of the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider that amendment No. 11 should also be discussed in relation to numbers 9 and 10.  We feel that if you go for interest groups you should go for as wide a representation as possible.  For that reason I would not be willing to support the amendment as put down by Fianna Fáil.  I have no objection to the inclusion of the two persons they mention in the amendment but I do not see the value of deleting (c) and (d).  In discussing this section of the Bill we must bear in mind that this Bill is attempting to eliminate any suggestion of party political considerations in the appointment of a chairman and providing that a chairman should not be appointed by the Minister or by the Government on the basis of that person's political allegiance.  It is also important that such an independent body <Col N="1632" /> would ensure that a person would not be denied appointment to a position because of his or her allegiance.  Most people who are in the professions have fairly strong political views and it would be improper for them to be either appointed because of their political allegiance or denied appointment because of it.  That is why I support the movement towards establishing an independent body to select a chairperson and to select An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not an easy matter to devise an ideal system of an appeal procedure on planning matters.  What the section attempts to do is to provide an appeals board of people who would determine these matters so far as is possible divorced from the political arena.  It is right and proper that an attempt should be made to achieve that objective.  There is no reason that I can think of why the planning process, which should be objective, should be bound up in any way with political pressures to which we as politicans are subject at all times.  We are under pressure from developers, from would-be developers, from conservation groups, from resident groups, tenant groups and so on.  All those pressure groups have points to make.  Nonetheless the question of planning and development is subject to objective tests and should be within the arena of people who have an expertise in town and country planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Enright when he suggests that perhaps the Judiciary would be an appropriate body of people to determine planning appeals.  I do not think they would wish that themselves. I do not think they would see themselves as having a sufficient degree of expertise to enable them to make value judgments on planning matters.  The people who are appointed to the planning appeals board and on whom very important and crucial responsibilities will rest should in all cases be people who are well qualified for the task imposed upon them. The people who find themselves on other appeals boards are supposed to have that expertise.  The appeals commissioners of income tax for example are people who are skilled in tax laws.  The people who <Col N="1633" /> are on the employment appeals tribunal have an expertise in matters of employment both from the employers' side and from the employees' side.  By the same token I would regard it as important that the people on this board should be there by reason of their expertise in planning matters.</P>
    <P>The attempt of this section is to try to achieve that.  The attempt of the proposed amendment is to try to introduce some degree of political influence into the appointments, albeit a slight one and albeit at one remove.  That would appear to be the object of the exercise in putting down this series of amendments.  I do not know why the Fianna Fáil Party are determined to hinder the matter to quite this extent, why they are reluctant to let even the vestiges of control of the planning process slip away from political hands.  There is no reason whatever in logic or in commonsense, why the public representatives, either local or national, should have a major input into the determination of those people.  It would be desirable that they should be completely divorced from politics having regard to the fact that the function they exercise is a judicial function and they have to make a determination in their decisions between conflicting interests.  Quite obviously it would be essential that acting as judges they should be completely independent of pressure from people who would have put them into the position they now occupy.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should not look a gift horse in the mouth.  We seem to have forgotten what was intended in the 1976 Act.  Deputy Molloy and others will recall the debates we had in the preparation of that Act.  There was serious concern that what we were setting out to do was to remove planning from the political arena.  Deputies Molloy, Burke, Haughey and Timmins of the Fianna Fáil Party were at pains to point out that they had serious reservations that the 1976 Act was not going far enough.  In the course of this Bill I have tried to explain that we have gone much further than the 1976 Act, despite the reservations of Deputy Tunney and others about politicians divesting themselves of powers they might have in the area of planning.  In the course of Deputy Burke's contribution at columns 64 and 65 of the Official Report on 13 March 1974 he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Molloy has suggested that under the present Bill the members <Col N="1637" /> could be chosen from the supporters of any party who happened to be in Government at the particular time. This is wrong situation.  The Minister should have set down specific qualifications necessary for appointment to the board and the appointments should be made by the Civil Service Commissioners. The idea of the board is to remove any suspicions from the minds of the public and therefore great care should be taken in the appointment of members.</P>
    <P>Deputy Timmins in the course of the same debate at column 207 said:</P>
    <P>When making appointments to the board I hope the Minister will go outside the sphere of political influence and patronage and seek the highest qualified people.  Perhaps he would consult some of the foremost legal and planning experts to ensure that those appointed are fully qualified for their task.</P>
    <P>These sentiments and others which I quoted from the debates of 1974 highlight the effort I am now making to remove the area of planning from the sphere of political influence and patronage.  If I chose I could at this point add three additional members to the board but that is not in the interests of the independence of the planning board.  While certain Deputies have reservations about various heads of bodies who have been selected, we could have a much longer list; but we must draw the line somewhere.  Deputy Skelly was surprised that the Institute of Architects was not included.  If we included the architects we would have to include planners and engineers, all of whom have separate institutions representing their interests.  What we have set out to do in looking for an independent advisory board, despite Deputy O'Rourke's belief that this is a sieve of some description, is to form an independent board.  The people nominated will form a very wide body who will not be influenced by political directions irrespective of which Minister might be in office.  This is the idea.  The Fianna Fáil Party should accept that what they <Col N="1638" /> believed the Minister for Local Government was doing during the 1976 Act is what I am doing.  It is reasonable to accept that any legislation passed through this House can after a period be reviewed and improved upon.  Time will bear me out in that the legislation now before the House, in regard to the independence of the board, the role of the planners and of the final appellant body, will be strengthened by the terms of this Act.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the Fianna Fáil Party could accept the principle involved.  Certainly I as a politician want to be removed from the actual planning process.  I have not at any time during this debate made any disparaging remarks about the role of urban councillors, county councillors or the role they have played over the years in the planning process.  The principle is in everybody's interest.  Every working politician must acknowledge the various pressures, as outlined by Deputy Taylor in his contribution, that will be put on elected representatives.  Particularly in the case of appeals, the decision and the basis for the decision should be an objective one.  It should not be made in the context of what political party one belongs to or what influence one may have with political parties.  To advance the argument that a politician should retain control over the planning process can be made only in the context of one having access to those who control the political process.  There are many people in this country who do not approach or never have wanted to approach politicians. They and their rights should be protected under any legislation seeking to set up an independent, autonomous body to control the final decision-making process in the field of planning.</P>
    <P>I think I can say with confidence that time will bear out that the Bill we are now enacting and the method of selecting the chairman of the planning board will show that it is removed from the political sphere, and that should be welcomed.  It is of value to note that councillors in the past have made and will continue to make their development plans for their respective areas.  I do not think any remarks of mine will ever be seen to want to take that from them.  They have played a role <Col N="1639" /> in their local areas in a very constructive manner.  Indeed, as has been maintained from the Opposition benches, they have the local knowledge and know best what to seek to have included in their development plans.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Opposition if they would accept my proposal to accept their amendment and I would reject the others.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

      <P>Time can never justify the Government's decision to dismiss members of a board who held an appointment under an Act of the Oireachtas and against whom no valid criticism has been levelled.  Time can never justify that decision.  No matter what the Minister seeks to say about removing politics from planning and ensuring that elected representatives do not control the planning board, in making those kinds of statements he is seeking to convey that it is the wish of this party that we should control the decisions taken by the planning board.  That is not so.  We fully support the establishment of an independent, autonomous planning appeals board.  We have done so from the start. That is not what is at issue here.  We are not seeking, as a political party, to have elected representatives controlling decisions of the planning appeals board.  The Minister should not seek to convey a falsehood of that kind.  We support the establishment of an independent, autonomous appeals board and have done so from the moment the Bill was proposed.</P>

      <P>If the history of the appeals board was properly set before the House one would see that the idea of having an independent board emanated originally from Kevin Boland when he was Minister for Local Government.  In the time during which I was Minister for Local Government I did quite an amount of preparatory work on a Bill to establish an independent planning appeals board; I had the heads of the Bill before the then Government.  Several long discussions <Col N="1640" /> had taken place at Government and ministerial level.  It was not something that was happening way down in the Department which would take years to surface.</P>
      <P>Therefore the Minister need not seek to convey that he is introducing a whole new principle here, that in future planning appeals will be dealt with by an independent board, as if that was not the wish of all of his predecessors.  Indeed, in the contribution my party made to the debate on the 1976 Act we made it quite clear that was the wish of our party. That remains the wish of our party.  The board was eventually established under an Act passed by this House after long discussion, with some of our amendments having been accepted and some others not.  But once that Bill was enacted we claim it is very wrong and defies the principle of all the established traditions in this House and of public life in this country that a board that had acted legitimately and conscientiously should be fired from their positions.  Under the Act which established that board there was provision made under which they could be fired.  But the Minister is not moving against them under those provisions.  He is moving in a completely different direction which does not oblige him to give any reasons for their removal.  There is nothing of which this board can be accused except false allegations and innuendo levelled against them to which the Minister himself has subscribed time and again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot see any reason for the Minister having two people on the board.  We are pleased that he has accepted that contention and has now removed one of them, the Secretary of the Department. We cannot see any reason for having the chairman of the council of An Taisce.  We propose that he be replaced by the chairman of the General Council of County Councils and the chairman of the Association of Municipal Authorities.  The Minister has indicated that he is prepared to accept amendment No. 9, but is not prepared to accept No. 10, which seems to me to be very strange.  I would suggest that he accept both amendments because the principle enshrined in No. 9 applies equally in the case of No. 10, that the <Col N="1641" /> people represented by the chairman of the Association of Municipal Authorities, the elected representatives, have a statutory role to play in planning.  They have a reserved function to prepare and adopt development plans, an equal role to that of the chairman of the General Council of County Councils.  Therefore the Minister cannot blame us commenting on the coincidence that the present chairman of the General Council of County Councils is a member of the Labour Party, Mr. Tim McAuliffe.  The Minister has agreed that he should become a member of the selection committee but he will not agree now to the chairman of the Association of Municipal Authorities.  We cannot see any logic in that.  Rather we contend that the Minister is displaying his kind of thinking.  I should say that when I put down the amendment I was not aware who was the chairman of either of those two bodies.  I still do not know who is the chairman of the Association of Municipal Authorities.  But I have discovered anyway that Mr. McAuliffe, a Labour Party member is chairman of the General Council of County Councils.  Therefore the Minister is accepting my amendment in regard to the position he holds but is not accepting it in regard to the position of the chairman of the Association of Municipal Authorities.</P>

      <P>I do not know who they are.  But I cannot understand why the Minister accepts one and not the other. I have been a vice-president of the Association of Municipal Authorities.  I have never been on the General Council of County Councils.  Both of them represent what I consider to be very important organisations.  They both have an equal statutory role in preparing development plans and in the other powers which they hold as elected representatives under the Planning Acts in regard to planning. Would the Minister tell us why he is refusing the chairman of the Association of Municipal Authorities?  What is the special role of the chairman of the council <Col N="1642" /> of An Taisce?  What particular importance does that individual have?  Is that person being proposed here because he would not have any political affiliations? Is that what the Minister is saying, that that name was put down there for that reason?  It is well known that the position is otherwise.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to understand the Minister's logic in suggesting that the chairman of the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland should not be a member of the selection committee while accepting the amendment in regard to the General Council of County Councils.  I ask the Minister to accept amendment No. 10.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite honestly I do not know who that person is but I assume it is somebody who is not directly involved in politics.  In accepting the amendment in relation to the chairperson of the General Council of County Councils I have gone <Col N="1643" /> a long way towards having the balance which the Opposition seem to think such a person would have on the selection committee.  I am not prepared to go any further than that.  The chairperson of the Council of An Taisce is a fit person for the post if one looks at the record of that body in terms of conservation and work done down the years on a voluntary basis. While some people may not always agree with their suggestions and the remarks they make in terms of conservation, I believe the chairperson of that body is a responsible individual who would be in a position to ensure that the person or persons recommended are suitable for the post of chairman of the board.</P>

      <P>Is fearr rith maith na droch sheasamh.  I welcome the manner is which the Minister accepted our case for the inclusion of a democrat on the committee of selection, the Chairman of the General Council of County Councils. What is at issue now is whether the chairperson of the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland would be better qualified than the chairperson of An Taisce.  I do not know who that person is and I do not care but the principle I am concerned with is the downgrading of the politician.  If the Minister was to accept the chairperson of the Association of Municipal Authorities as a politician, it would still be three to two.  The unfortunate politicians with all their dangers and sins would still be in a minority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take slight issue with Deputy Taylor in regard to this.  I do not know that the legal profession, or any other profession, is devoid of human frailties.  There is no perfect person fit to adjudicate on anything. Even the great legalists and jurists at times bring their personal imperfections into their decisions.  It is wrong to have this castigation of politicians who often are open to greater temptations that anybody else.  To have an acceptance by a politician that they are unfit persons to carry out this responsible work is downgrading and that is the point I take issue with.  I have respect for Members of all parties.  At times we will send the occasional cannon across but I have <Col N="1644" /> respect for democracy, and the people who elect us.  I am glad the Minister of State corrected any misinterpretation that might be put on Deputy Taylor's contribution, because the development of what he said was that he would do away with all planning authorities.  He said they were not fit to deal with anything connected with this great legal business of planning.  That is not so.  This is not a legal matter.  Planning refers to the lay person who will be affected by what happens in the environment.</P>

      <P>We are entitled to misinterpret but I am sure the Deputy will accept that we do it in all good faith.  The Minister says he is including this provision to satisfy public opinion and their fears of politicians but I do not accept that.  If the Minister accepts our amendment the selection committee will have only two politicians against three others. Nobody can contend that the politicians, however bad they are supposed to be, if they are in a majority will be in a position to do any harm.  That is what they are being accused of.</P>

We are pleased the Minister has accepted the principle we argued in regard to county councils and we will continue that argument in favour of the other half of local authority representatives, municipal authorities.  I do not accept that the Chairperson of An Taisce &mdash; a Mrs. <Col N="1645" /> O'Connor, I understand &mdash; has a greater entitlement to be a member of the selection committee than the chairman of the Association of Municipal Authorities. The latter is elected by representatives of every borough council, urban council and town commissioners.  We have outlined the role of local authorities in having planning accepted, a new discipline introduced in the sixties which involved many restraints.  A lot of the success of planning was due to the involvement of local authorities.  I cannot understand why the Minister believes that the chairperson of An Taisce is better qualified to represent the views of our people than a person who represents hundreds of local representatives.</P>

      <P>If one reads the newspapers one will see that there is a lot of An Taisce politics going on.  Deputy Quinn would know a lot more about that than the Minister because he moves in that circle.  An Taisce is representative of a upper middle class and upper class section of the community.  I am not aware of any great participation by the ordinary people of the country in the Taisce committees throughout the land.  The approach which they seem to take in a general way towards planning applications is very much concerned with the preservation of Ireland as she is today.  I see a lot of their involvement in planning decisions in local authorities and in making appeals as anti-development and having an adverse effect on a lot of the poorer families who have been seeking to have themselves housed.  There is evidence of that in the type of cases they have been interested in.  They have not shown any great interest in dealing with the real social problems caused by planning nor have they shown any great concern for the people who are mostly affected.</P>
      <P>We have a person here who up to recently was chairman of An Taisce who was involved in a controversy over an unauthorised development which he carried out in my constituency.  That was the subject of a debate at a meeting of Galway County Council on 28 April 1980. The person who was formerly the chairperson of An Taisce actually proceeded with a change of use of a structure without the permission of the local authority and was involved in controversy at that time because of it.  There did not seem to be any great respect shown to the county development plan or to the provisions of the Planning Act whereby if a development was claimed as being exempt the proper procedures should have been followed and the local authority approached before the change took place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A lot of the people in An Taisce have very close associations with the Fine Gael Party and a lot of the blue rinse brigade are involved.  It is a nice way to involve yourself and there are a lot of social <Col N="1647" /> occasions.  In a lot of cases it is deemed to be far removed from the hard reality which a lot of the people have to contend with in struggling to make a living.  You do not see many of them attending the meetings of An Taisce.  Some of the well-established Fine Gael Deputies have very close links with some of the people I am referring to.</P>
    <P>We cannot for the life of us see why the Minister should expect the House to agree that this particular vested interest group should have a special part to play as distinct from allowing the Chairman of the Municipal Authorities.  It is the Minister's decision.  He has not been very generous in accepting amendments from us up to now.  There has only been a very small acceptance and we ask him to accept the other part of the principle which is enshrined in amendment No. 9, the same principle enshrined in amendment No. 10.  I ask the Minister to accept this and we can move on.</P>

If you were to bring in my institute, the Institute of Architects in Ireland, in order to balance that you would have to bring in the Institute of Engineers, the planners and various other diverse groups, who have a technical training, for representation in that area.  Instead of having a large body we are using the representative of a technical profession in the person of the chief engineering adviser.  The Minister has accepted the spirit of what the Fianna Fáil Party were proposing in relation to the Chairman of the General Council of County Councils.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy, on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, asked for clarification why An Taisce should be there and in the course of his speech he made an attack on them, which every member of An Taisce will be interested to read in the newspapers.  I do not wish to delay the House unduly at this stage.  I am attempting to give the thinking behind why this body should be represented and why, as a consequence, in order to keep the representative groups comparatively compact and small &mdash; it is an advisory group &mdash; that we are not prepared to accept the other part of the recommendation, which is amendment No. 10.</P>

      <P>As I said most development plans for local urban areas are subsidiary plans to the main county development plan.  The framework within which they work and within which they have to operate is substantially dominated by the county road plan, the county water services, sanitary services and the rest.  30 per cent of the population of every urban authority throughout the country physically attached to the urban town area are now located, on average, in the county council area outside the functions of the urban areas themselves. The sense of what is being proposed by Fianna Fáil in amendment No. 9 has been fully and adequately taken on board.  To attempt to substitute An Taisce for the municipal authorities is to take away from An Taisce their important contribution to the advisory process as a major voluntary environmental organisation.  In addition, it is simply duplicating what we will get in the person of the Chairman of the General Council of County Councils.</P>

      <P>This section deals with the replacement of the chairman of An Bord Pleanála and it sets up this elaborate machinery just to make selections.  The selections &mdash; three names, not in any order of preference or priority &mdash; will be sent to the Minister and he will make his selection.  If he likes one of the three names he may appoint that person as chairman but if he does not like any of the names he sends them back to the selection committee, tells them to readvertise, to interview people and make a further recommendation.  For the second time the Government will consider the three names and if they do not like those people they will tell the Minister to inform the selection committee to go through the whole procedure again.  In due course another three names will be put before the Government.  Where will <Col N="1651" /> the process end?  What is the need for this elaborate machinery of selection?  There is no need for it.  The whole purpose is to create the impression that a major change is involved here which should be accepted on that basis and that the former board have done dreadful things and must be fired as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>On this occasion we are firing the chairman. Will the Minister tell us what misdemeanour Mr. Justice Murnaghan has committed?  Are the Government alleging that this eminent Judge of the High Court has not performed his duties since his appointment as chairman in a proper and correct way and in compliance with the terms of his appointment?  Has Mr. Justice Murnaghan misconducted himself in his role as chairman?  Has he been dilatory in dealing with planning appeals? Has he committed any sin?  Deputy Taylor and Deputy Enright, both of whom are in the legal profession, have extolled the virtues of judges.  If Deputy Enright had his way the selection committee would be comprised of Judges &mdash; a beautiful sight.  These people would make selections to the Government but the Government might reject them.  At any rate, Deputy Enright had great faith in the judges, as has the entire community. We recognise their special position in the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debates to which the Minister referred took place in 1974 and 1975: it was not in 1976 because the then Minister, Mr. Tully, delayed as long as he could before he brought the Bill into operation and continued to decide planning appeals himself.  At that time the extent of the operations of An Taisce was minimal.  They have extended their role and their participation into many other areas and any comments I have made have been based on my experience of their work since then.  I regret to see the trend of the recommendations An Taisce have been making and the type of cases in which they are interested.  It involves a special, select area of planning and they only show concern in that area.  There is no indication they are concerned about the broad general planning process as it affects every citizen.  Many of their personnel <Col N="1652" /> live in very exclusive areas where high density would not be allowed.  Their approach to many matters is &ldquo;we hold what we have&rdquo; and their attitude is to attempt to keep the countryside as it is. Their approach seems to be anti-growth and anti-development which is necessary if people are to find employment.  It is to strike a happy medium and a proper balance and to reconcile all the conflicting attitudes, approaches and needs that the planning processes were designed.  No one will come forward with the perfect decision.  It has to be a combination of points of view, expertise, knowledge and experience and what will be accepted by the majority as good planning.  We seek best quality planning in all areas.</P>
    <P>Why then is Mr. Justice Murnaghan being fired from his post?  I have never met the man.  I do not know if I have ever seen him: perhaps I am glad that I did not have to see him in court.  To me he has acted with the highest integrity and with great expertise.  He has been very careful about the way he has approached the task given to him when he was appointed chairman of the board and no valid reason has been given as to why he is to be fired from his post.  If the Minister and the Government are casting some aspersions on him, surely they have a duty to state their case, to prove the guilt and to justify their actions?</P>
    <P>All of this fuss is a smokescreen to enable the Government to fire people solely and simply because it happens, as a coincidence, that they were appointed when Fianna Fáil were in government. For three of them their term of office will expire in 12 months time.  I said today that if the Minister wants to reduce the number that will happen at that time.  If he wants to appoint new people to the board he has the opportunity now if he wishes to enlarge the membership.  Certainly he will have an opportunity next June when there will be three further vacancies.  However, that is too long for the Minister to wait.  He has been sharpening his knife because of the personnel and the timing of their appointments.  We have gone into all of that today.  We have shown that that practice has been operated by all outgoing Governments.  That <Col N="1653" /> cannot be the crime in this case because previous Governments committed the same crime and there has not been any move to fire other distinguished people who hold public office on boards and who got their appointments after a Government were defeated in a general election and before they went out of office.  That cannot be the reason.</P>
    <P>Since this debate started the Government have come forward with the Bill dealing with rent tribunals.  In that Bill the Minister is given full authority to appoint each member of the tribunal. There is no limitation on the number of appointments he may make or the type of people he may appoint.  Therefore, this principle will not be applied to all future legislation.  The first piece of legislation which appeared after the Bill before the House has the Government reverting to the system where the Minister makes the appointments without seeking the advice of selection committees. The Minister will make an arbitrary decision as to the people he wishes to have on the tribunal.  We do not object to that.  It is the position that has obtained up to now and one we think should be continued.  During the course of the debate in 1974 and 1975 we said that the Minister in making appointments should seek to have certain professional expertise represented on the board but none of our amendments was accepted.</P>
    <P>There is nothing behind this present proposal other than the political vindictiveness of the Government.  I ask the Minister of State to inform the House of the misdemeanour of which Mr. Justice Murnaghan is guilty that he now has to suffer the indignity which the Government are inflicting on him.  He must be the first member of the Judiciary who has been fired from a State board since the foundation of the State.</P>

      <P>It is tempting to fall into the trap of saying that the members of this nominating committee were themselves to be members of An Bord Pleanála and that they were to make decisions on planning matters.  As we know, such is not the case and they are no more than a nominating body.  The <Col N="1654" /> question was asked why An Taisce should have an interest in the nominating body. The reason for that obviously is that the matter which is their special concern &mdash; preservation of the environment &mdash; is a factor in the planning process and who would deny that that is very important? It is not by any means the only factor in the planning process.  As I said earlier, that involves a pull and a balance between development and construction on the one hand and preservation of the environment on the other.  The development and construction end is taken care of on this committee.  The President of the Construction Industry Federation is to be a member of this committee and no doubt that person, whoever it may be, will apply his or her mind very carefully to ensure that the development end of the planning process is taken care of. What would the input of a representative of An Taisce be on that committee? When intending candidates for the position of chairman come forward to be interviewed there would be somebody there who would ask the applicant his or her views on the role of preservation of the environment in the planning process to ensure that that factor would be brought to the attention of the committee in making their nomination and to direct the committee's attention to that important factor.  There has to be a balance between the two pulls that are always in planning.</P>
      <P>If construction has to be represented so too must the preservation element.  I was interested to note that one of the criticisms which Deputy Molloy raised about An Taisce as a preservation body was the fact that they were pervaded or highly influenced by the Fine Gael Party. I would have thought from many earlier comments that that would have been a plus factor having regard to his party's interest in having a political involvement in the nominating committee.  Why then does he raise their political involvement if it is meant as a criticism?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but the kernel of my objection is that they are not elected representatives as members of the municipal authorities are.  That is the case we argued in regard to members of the county council.  In my evaluation of professions I give a superior rating to those who are selected by the people. Right through this section we see this effort to downgrade politicians.  Deputy Taylor has been talking about horses for courses and that people who know their business should be selected.  Who knows more about planning than politicians, whether to their advantage or disadvantage? In this section it is embodied that the only person who cannot be a chairman is a politician.  If a politician decided tomorrow to opt out of this House and indicated he would be prepared to swap his job he could not do so as the Minister specifies that he could not be a member of a local authority or of this assembly. This is a continuation of cheap downgrading of politicians and yielding to a minority lobby outside who are trying to smear us.  The section even goes so far as to say, in its effort to disassociate itself from politicians, that if a person elected as chairman of this board with a salary equal to that of a High Court judge &mdash; Deputy Taylor might be able to give an indication of what that salary is but I imagine it in the region of £30,000 per annum &mdash; offered himself or was nominated for Membership of the Seanad or of Dáil Éireann, he would automatically have to relinquish his position as chairman. Who could think that anyone enjoying that position earning £30,000 per annum would want to change with a Member of this House?  If he had any sense he would not.  It is another example of being ashamed of ourselves.  That is why we brought in these two nauseating provisions to this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Taylor and other Deputies would argue that in respect of a committee <Col N="1656" /> consisting of five people the municipal authorities, who are already involved, committed to and familiar with this legislation, are not entitled to be on a committee that would nominate the chairman.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Tunney's last contribution enables me to clarify the points in relation to what is perhaps a misconception of the proper and essential relationship that politicians have to the planning process and which they will continue to have when this legislation goes through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The making of a development plan is a decision about the allocation of scarce environmental resources.  Any such decision in a democratic society should ultimately be controlled by politicians deciding what areas are developed, what is retained for amenities and what is preserved or redeveloped. The development plan is a reserved function of the planning process. There is elaborate machinery for consultation, for public exhibition and for input from interest groups of all kinds. But at the end of the day it is the councillors at local level, whether in urban or county council areas who make the development plan.  That is properly a political process.  It will remain so and will be consolidated as far as this Administration are concerned.  Once that plan is made, individual applications for development or change of use are submitted to the local authority within the framework of the ground rules established by that development plan.  Everybody in this House knows, because we are essentially a peasant people &mdash; two or three generations from small farmers in the main &mdash; that it is the political and cultural tradition that wealth was made either by buying or selling land, by marrying it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Many other provisions in the legislation, including an amendment moved by Deputy De Rossa <Col N="1658" /> about having a fixed time limit in which planning decisions will come from An Bord Pleanála, which it is hoped will be in about 15 months, will enable the board to be fully operational.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I draw the point to the Deputy's attention because he raised the question of High Court judges.  One of the structural changes embodied in this legislation is that it will be no longer necessary that the chairman of An Bord Pleanála must be a High Court judge. When this proposal was originally put in in 1974 &mdash; I was properly corrected by Deputy Molloy in relation to the time of that debate&mdash;Deputy Haughey suggested, and I quote from the Official Report of 26 November 1974, column 78, volume 276, regarding the requirement that a High Court judge should be chairman of the board:</P>
      <P>If I remember correctly the age limit for judges is pretty high; I think it is 72 years for a Supreme Court judge and 70 years for a High Court judge.  I do not wish to cast any aspersions on their competence after they retire but I should not like to think that as a matter of practice we would appoint a retired judge.</P>
      <P>At column 134, in relation to the quality of the work, he said:</P>
      <P>The only word I can use in this connection is that it is an executive type of job.  All the extra-curricular work judges have been asked to do was more or less an extension of their own judicial work.  They presided over some commission, or some board of inquiry, or something of that nature. Here they will be dealing with commercial considerations.  It is an executive type job.  It will be the same executive type of job as the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister was doing before.  It is totally different from the ordinary judicial functions which a judge carries out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To conclude the point, Deputy Molloy <Col N="1659" /> himself prophesied in 1974 that there would be difficulty in getting from the panel of judges available retired people who were suitable for the job in question. Indeed, the very experience of the Fianna Fáil Administration has borne out the prophetic words of Deputy Molloy when he was last in Opposition in 1974.  For that reason, among others, we are proposing to restructure the board in the manner set out and are therefore not prepared to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (2), between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following paragraphs:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(g)  the Chairperson of the Association of Combined Residents Associations,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(h)  the President of the National <Col N="1660" /> Association of Tenants Organisations.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that this amendment was not taken with amendments Nos. 9 and 10.  It is on the same section and I do not suppose the debate on it will be very long.  There is not much time left in any case.  I agree with a great deal of what Deputy Molloy said in regard to this section, that while it appeared to be doing what the Minister suggested &mdash; taking the matter out of the hands of the Minister and the politicians &mdash; the whole section is putting it back again into the hands of the Minister.  With regard to the various people suggested as representative of the type of people involved in planning, we feel that there are two areas of people who are constantly, every day, involved in planning and objections and so on in regard to their areas.  I refer to the Association of Combined Residents Associations and the National Association of Tenants Organisations.  One Fianna Fáil Deputy &mdash; I think it was Deputy Tunney &mdash; said that politicians were being downgraded and that every effort is being made to achieve that.</P>
    <P>An Bord Pleanála themselves have already downgraded politicians.  I will quote from a letter dated 24 June 1983 which I received from An Bord Pleanála. As a representative of Dublin Corporation I had written to them about an application that was before them from my area.  They told me that under Article 22 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) (Fees and Amendment) Regulations, 1983, there is provision for the payment of a fee of £10 in cases where submissions or observations on a planning appeal are being considered by the board.  The letter states: &ldquo;It is considered that the contents of your letter come within the scope of Article 22 and are, therefore, liable for the payment of a £10 fee&rdquo;.  That is downgrading politicians and also councillors of local authorities who are talking about what is happening in their local authority and the decisions their local authority have made. They are being downgraded to the same level as An Taisce, ACRA, NATO or any other group involved in the planning <Col N="1661" /> area.  The letter stated also: &ldquo;As the fee is not submitted with your letter your observations on the appeal cannot be taken into consideration by the board and your letter is returned herewith&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I simply wrote a letter asking An Bord Pleanála to uphold a decision of Dublin Corporation and gave the reasons why Dublin Corporation felt it should be upheld and I am told that I must pay a fee the same as everybody else.  Every councillor, every member of a municipal authority &mdash; who according to Deputy Tunney is supposed to have tremendous planning powers and interest in planning &mdash; and every Deputy is downgraded to the same level as any other citizen.  I do not know whether that is good or bad but certainly it is not encouraging Deputies or councillors to do what they feel should be their job in regard to the planning of their area and getting An Bord Pleanála to make the type of decisions which they think should be made in that area.</P>
    <P>We agree entirely with the Minister that there is a need for a restructuring of the board and, therefore, we support the Bill because it is restructuring the board into a better form.  Under this section, with other sections which we will not be able to take later in regard to the ordinary members of the board to whom the same provisions apply, the Minister still retains the control of who will eventually be appointed chairperson, great control as to who will be appointed ordinary members also and ensuring under this section that the various bodies will have to put forward somebody whom he is prepared to appoint, as has been pointed out already by Deputies, otherwise he will keep them putting forward people until he gets somebody he likes.  Later in the same section he is saying in fact that after all our work here today and all our decision on who can appoint the chairperson of the board, after all the Deputies debating it and the Minister agreeing or not agreeing, accepting some amendments and not accepting others, the Minister may amend or revoke subsection (2) which we are discussing now.  He can change it all.  I do not see the point in a long debate.</P>

      <P>After all the discussion as to who should be on the committee, the Minister can strike them off. Far from restructuring the board to give it greater credibility, the Bill is not doing what it purports to do, and particularly this section is not doing it.  The selection committee would submit names to the Minister and he should accept their decision. Unlike Franco, who used to send three names of prospective cardinals to the Pope and the Pope had to select one of them, here the Minister is assuming more power than the Pope had over General Franco.  This makes nonsense of the selection procedure.</P>
      <P>We are simply asking that the chairperson of the Association of Combined Residents Associations and the president of the National Association of Tenants Organisations should be on the selection committee which would put forward names to the Minister, which later he could either accept or reject.</P>

The two associations would be a very important counter balance to those already accepted.  It is clear that these organisations should be brought in because there is a great need to balance the influence which An Taisce would have on the selection committee because with these two bodies the consumer, the householder, would be represented.  They are the people who have to live with planning decisions and they should have some influence on the selection of a chairperson.</P>
      <P>I would not go as far as Deputy Molloy in relation to An Taisce but they adopt some strange positions sometimes in relation to development.  I would have a broader view of development and therefore I think the tenants representatives should be on this committee to ensure that the consumer would have some say.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputies De Rossa and Mac Giolla, obviously many groups could make a case for selection on the committee.  The Workers' Party would like to have the selection committee make the nominations, and Fianna Fáil would prefer to see the Minister retain the right.  I have come down the middle of the road.  I have accepted four amendments, one of which provides representation for the chairman of the General Council of County Councils, a representative body who provide a cross-section, who will come up with a nomination for the position of chairman which we can stand over.  The committee will be broadly based and reasonably representative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part of the discussion this evening suggested that because one or other group were not represented the nominations would obviously not reflect some section of society; but it is fair to say, looking at the list of the nominating bodies, that they will come up with candidates acceptable across a broad spectrum.  There have been suggestions that we could produce candidates for selection who would be more representative of the nominating bodies.  I will look at that, but we must draw the line somewhere and I still think, despite the reservations expressed in my presence and absence, despite comments on the merits or the demerits of An Taisce, they have a role to play, and <Col N="1664" /> though politicians might not always agree with them, they should be on the nominating body.  I am not prepared to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 5, lines 35 to 52, to delete subsection (6).</P>
      <P>We have tabled this amendment because we believe the section gives to the Minister the power to change the whole face of the committee upon which we have just spent the last hour or more deciding. There is not really much point in spending time here trying to improve the proposed committee and the organisations which should be represented, and then giving the Minister the power to change the committee completely without having to bring in any amendment.  There is provision for him to bring an order before the House and have it discussed here but it should not be necessary for us to discuss this section and then hand over the power to the Minister to change the section by order.  That is why we have tabled this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is really extraordinary and these two amendments highlight the fact that the Minister, having stated he was going to select people to make recommendations regarding the appointment of a chairman and, having debated that for an hour, we move on to the next part of section 5 and under subsection (6) we find that all the provisions we have been debating and all the amendments can all be changed by a stroke of the Minister's pen.  We are writing this into legislation.  We are debating the people who should be represented on this committee and we have been fulfilling our duty in examining all this as closely as possible.  But if the Minister does not like the way these people are performing he can by order amend the whole of subsection (2).  That is the subsection under which the committee is established. It is quite extraordinary the Minister should ask the House for this kind <Col N="1665" /> of legislation because my interpretation is that the Minister can repeal under subsection (6) (a) all of subsection (2) and, if that is so, it is contrary to the Interpretation Act, 1937.  Will the Minister inform the House if it is in fact contrary to the Interpretation Act, 1937?</P>
      <P>The same argument applies to my amendment to delete paragraph (d) because the whole intent of paragraph (a) is to give the Minister power by order to change all of the persons mentioned in subsection (2) who have the right to act on this select committee.  If that is the position then the Minister is making a farce of this debate and a farce of Parliament. This again is hasty and unnecessary legislation.  It is a further indication that the Minister is hell bent on political action.  It is vindictiveness on his part.  He has no concern really for the improvement of the planning process.  He has denied the Opposition and Dáil Éireann the opportunity to debate in depth on Committee Stage all the proposals in the Bill.  The Minister has confined the debate by way of a guillotine motion, a very exceptional step to be taken by any Government.  I have been here quite a few years and the guillotine has been applied on only a very few occasions.  The Minister's party must take a great deal of the responsibility for the majority of the guillotine motions I have seen introduced. This is one and there was a previous one also.  There is no justification for a guillotine motion on this Bill.  In the discussion I had with the Tánaiste prior to the Taoiseach's decision to proceed by way of guillotine, there was no intention on the Tánaiste's part to have a guillotine motion.  That was clearly indicated to me.</P>

      <P>The Tánaiste had a discussion here and he inquired what our attitude would be to this Bill and I said we would have to take a stand against the Bill because of a new principle the Tánaiste was seeking to establish here. That discussion took place at the close of the Local Government (Miscellaneous) Bill.  I pointed out there were many provisions <Col N="1666" /> which would require lengthy debate and we should not be expected at the end of the Dáil term to have a debate on an important measure like this.  We were entitled to have time to go through the Bill, make our position clear and make our contribution to improving the Planning Acts.  It is not often the House gets an opportunity to debate planning and, when it does, it should not be denied the opportunity of reviewing all the existing legislation on planning.  We have been denied the opportunity of extending this discussion into areas of this Bill, some of which have merit.  Apart from the vindictive provisions, there are reasonable proposals with some of which we agree and some of which we would propose to improve by way of amendment.  There are proposed improvements in the amendments tabled in my name.</P>
      <P>How can an Opposition party be expected to debate an important Bill like this in such a short time?  On the last occasion we had a planning Bill the Committee Stage lasted 11 days.  I do not say we would require 11 days on this but there is no excuse for the Government coming at the end of the term after the House had agreed to rise on 8 July, no excuse for the Government and the Tánaiste to introduce a Bill which the latter knew would be controversial, a Bill containing proposals which would have to be opposed by any Opposition Party worth its salt.  The Government decided to introduce the guillotine and this party had no option other than to express whatever opposition it could in the strongest way possible.  That is what has introduced heat into this debate.  Had the Tánaiste proceeded with the agreement he made with me after that debate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There was no written <Col N="1667" /> agreement but surely two people can decide when they have arrived at a mutual conclusion.  The Minister did not seek to convey to me that he was proceeding with the Bill irrespective.  He knew there was opposition and he forced us into the position we are in now.  He persisted with the guillotine motion and here we have a subsection which, in fact, nullifies all the provisions we have been debating here.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Regional Technical College in Wexford.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Chair sincerely for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment and I am aware that many requests were made to raise other matters. I am anxious to make a case for the establishment of a regional technical college in Wexford.  To prove my case it is important to review the history and development of regional technical colleges.  In 1966 a steering committee on technical education was established to advise the Minister on the needs for technical education at third level.  As a result of that eight colleges were established around the country and in 1970 one was erected in Waterford and another in Carlow. So great was the demand for places at those colleges that major extensions were provided in later years.  It is interesting to note that with the big participation of County Wexford students at those RTCs, extensions were granted to <Col N="1671" /> Waterford in 1977 and Carlow in 1981.  In the Waterford college, although provision for an extension for 500 extra places was approved, the demand for places in the 1980-81 session was so great that the board of management considered renting classroom accommodation in the local military barracks, conditions which were totally unsuitable for students, were opposed by the local students union but were necessary to cater for the uncontrollable growth in demand for enrolment.</P>
      <P>In 1971 the HEA was established to advise the Minister in terms of a continuous review and monitoring of the needs and numbers for third-level technical education and to make recommendations to the Minister.  I am anxious to stress that because of the comments I shall make later on the findings of Dr. Clancy of UCD.  It is also important to give a factual analysis of the situation.  I should like to outline to the House details of a report carried out by the South East Regional Development Organisation in 1980.  In terms of population that report shows that County Wexford, with 26 per cent of the population of that region, had the largest population of all counties.  In 1971 it had a population of 86,000, in 1979 it was 96,000 and the projected figure for 1986 is 105,900.  That means that County Wexford will have 26.34 per cent of the population of the south east region. Waterford, where there is a regional technical college, has 24 per cent of the population, while for Carlow the projected population is 10 per cent.  How is it that Carlow can get a regional technical college with 10 per cent of the population of the region, while Wexford, with 26 per cent of the population, does not have one?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to consider the numbers in education.  The number of students sitting for the leaving certificate between 1970 and 1980, trebled, resulting in 8,000 being in post-primary education in County Wexford.  It is also projected that with a 20 per cent participation rate in third-level education we would need 230 places per year for County Wexford students alone.  That shows the overwhelming <Col N="1672" /> need for a third-level institution in County Wexford to cater for this phenomenal growth.</P>
    <P>If we look at industrial expansion, the need for industrial development and how a regional technical college would benefit we see that there are startling unemployment figures.  We have 17 per cent, over 6,000 people unemployed.  In 1977 the figure was 3,698 so we can see there is a tremendous increase.  When we look at the net figure for industrial manufacturing employment we see that there was a net loss between 1977 and 1983.  There are very few areas which can show such depressing figures.</P>
    <P>If we again compare Carlow, Waterford and Wexford in terms of unemployment, where Carlow has an RTC, 10.9 per cent of the working population are employed in manufacturing industry. The figure for Waterford is 10.4 per cent but in Wexford, down at the bottom of the table again, without an RTC, the figure is 5.1 per cent.  To put that in simple terms, 1 per cent extra of an industrial base would mean 1,000 jobs.  It can be seen we have not had much industrial development.  This can be directly attributed to the fact that we have not had the type of attraction to come to Wexford in terms of industrial development and investment because we have not had the ancillary back-up.  It is not because the land was not provided.  Land banks were provided.  In Enniscorthy 45 acres were provided plus the Edermine site, 45 acres in Wexford, and there has been a substantial investment in services and in land.  That could not be given as the reason for such a low industrial base. When we look at the reality of industrial development we are only competing for light, open-type industry, which can be located anywhere.</P>
    <P>If we had an RTC we could attract an electronics industry, pharmaceutical industries, health care industries and many other types that are related to a high technology need.  It has been well established by now that industrialists are looking for a skilled work force and mature school leavers with an advanced educational background.  We cannot provide this in Wexford without a regional <Col N="1673" /> technical college.  It is also of significance that since July 1979 there has not been one large foreign-based industry established in County Wexford.  The figures, in terms of industrial development, speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>It is important that people have the opportunity to seek a livelihood in their own county and in their own region. When we look at the need for adult and community education we see that in 1981 3,244 people enrolled for part-time adult education courses under the town and County Wexford VECs.  The type of courses provided here cannot cater for the needs of the redundant person's professionally orientated courses for jobs.  There is no doubt, in relation to accommodation, that in the south east we can cater for the back-up ancillary services needed for the establishment of an RTC on the basis that we are a tourist county and we will not have any problem with accommodation.  There is no particular preference in relation to the site. Wexford, Enniscorthy, New Ross or Gorey would be extremely suitable as far as the county is concerned.</P>
    <P>I wish to return briefly to Dr. Patrick Clancy, a lecturer in sociology in UCD. A survey called Participation in Higher Education, a national survey by Dr. Clancy said that the growth in RTCs and technical education was phenomenal. When we look at a subdivision of the participation of third level education we see that 50 per cent were in RTCs compared with 40 per cent in universities. The White Paper of December 1980 envisaged that by 1990 there would be 51,000 full-time third level educational posts.  We have already reached 42,000 and this has been grossly underestimated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a good White Paper and worth reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  In terms of participation the strongest ingredient as to why participation levels would be low is the distance to a regional technical college. The reality is that the highest participation was in the counties of Carlow, Galway, Kerry, Waterford, Louth and Donegal where they have colleges.  In <Col N="1674" /> County Wexford it was well below the normal level at 17.6 per cent, the national average being 20 per cent and Carlow having 29 per cent.</P>
      <P>The best way to increase participation in any county is to establish a regional technical college.  As a compromise we would be prepared to accept a technical college where people could do a two-year certificate and diploma course instead of a degree course.  The establishment of an RTC in County Wexford would satisfy the enormous growth in the number of students, increase participation of the students in third level education and help them find employment, increase the very low industrial base through high technology and industrial development and correct the situation whereby Wexford has lost out in regionalisation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Minister for Education (Mrs. Hussey) Gemma Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to compliment Deputy Yates on his very well presented case and on his obvious dedication to the needs of his county, particularly the young people of his county.  On 17 November 1981 the County Wexford and town of Wexford Vocational Education Committees submitted to the then Minister for Education a document entitled Case for the Establishment of a Technical College in the Wexford Region.  This showed that of the five counties in the south-east region, Carlow, Kilkenny, Tipperary, South-Riding, Waterford and Wexford, Wexford had the biggest share of population, 96,000 or 26 per cent.  It also showed that in 1980 there were 1,027 leaving certificate candidates from post-primary schools in the county.  The document pointed out that using the participation rates indicated by the 1978 Sheehan study on future enrolments in third level education, 11 per cent of an age cohort would attend third level education resulting in a need for 120 student places to cater for Wexford students each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A decision on the application was deferred at the time pending receipt of a report which was commissioned by the Higher Education Authority on participation in higher education.  This report, known as the Clancy Report, which was referred to extensively by Deputy Yates, <Col N="1675" /> was published in September 1982.  This showed, among a great many other interesting data, that in the ranking of counties by rates of admission to higher education, Wexford is 18th by reference to participation in all higher education and is 11th by reference to participation in the technological sector.  The average rate of participation in the technological sector for the country as a whole is shown to be 10 per cent and County Wexford at 10.9 per cent is well above the average, which obviously is a very good sign for the employment prospects of its young people.</P>
    <P>The interesting thing is that it is in participation in university education that County Wexford is below average, fifth from the bottom.  A population figure of 100,000 would, on the basis of the case made by the Wexford VECs, produce a regional technical college of about 300 students.  Even allowing that the total enrolment might go as high as 400 this would be a very small college in third level terms.  In the course of a discussion with a deputation from Wexford on 26 January 1982, my colleague, the Minister for the Public Service, Deputy John Boland, who was then Minister for Education, <Col N="1676" /> invited the deputation to submit data in support of their contention that when an institution has reached a certain size it is no more expensive to produce another than to further extend the first. This data has not to date been submitted to my Department.  I appreciate that it is difficult data to produce but the fact remains that the offer was made and that the data have not arrived.</P>
    <P>On the more general plane my Department have before them at the moment proposals for third level projects all over Ireland costing well in excess of £200 million.  In the context of the current economic situation, it will be necessary to examine all proposals involving future financial commitments.  The Government are at present studying the needs of the situation in relation to third level educational facilities and, as part of that study, we will have to establish priorities as far as possible between competing claims. The case made for a regional technical college in Wexford will have to be considered in that context and I am not at present in a position to give any commitment in relation to it.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 114 and 115 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the number of firearms certificates held by residents in the state is 170,721. The certificates are in respect of 134,091 shotguns, 36,618 rifles and 12 other weapons.</P>
      <P>The Garda have no statistics of the number of gun clubs or associations in the country.  Pursuant to section 2 (4) (d) of the Firearms Act, 1925, (as inserted by section 15 of the Firearms Act, 1964) a rifle or other gun club may be granted an authorisation, the effect of which is to exempt a member of the club from the need to possess a firearm certificate for the use of a firearm while engaged as a member of the club in a competition or target practice at a range or other place authorised under the section.  There are no statistics available of the number of authorisations that have been granted or of the number of members of clubs who possess firearm certificates entitling them to use firearms otherwise than in accordance with such authorisations.</P>
      <P>As I stated in reply to Question No. 803 of 31 May 1983, the procedures for the issue of firearms certificates are being reviewed at present.</P>

This request was conveyed to the Chilean Representative to the UN in New York on 16 March when our Ambassador also particularly stressed the strong public feeling in Ireland on this issue.  Despite our representations, Fathers Forde and MacGillicuddy were nevertheless expelled by the Chilean authorities.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am aware Colonel Cassanova assumed office on 18 April of this year.  Both before and since that date, I have followed with concern the continuing conflict within El Salvador and the serious human rights situation there.  One aspect of the conflict which causes particular concern is the suffering which is being experienced by innocent civilians and the large scale displacements of population within El Salvador.</P>
      <P>As I started in the Dáil on 26 April, the Government's policy in relation to Central America in essence has three main objectives:</P>
      <P>&mdash;first, the furtherance of respect for human rights;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1365" />&mdash;second, the promotion of essential social and economic reforms;</P>
    <P>&mdash;third, support for the creation of the necessary political and diplomatic basis for a peaceful settlement to conflict and tension in the area.</P>
    <P>These objectives apply with particular force to the situation in El Salvador.</P>
    <P>It is our view, as I stated to the Dáil on 26 April, that negotiations should be held between the representatives of both sides engaged in the conflict in El Salvador. Such negotiations should aim at achieving a peaceful political solution to the conflict in that country and make way for the holding of genuinely free elections in which all political parties could participate.</P>
    <P>In so far as action by the ten member states of the European Community is concerned, I wish to inform the Deputy that the situation in Central America was discussed at the recent Stuttgart meeting of the European Council, and that an important statement on Central America was issued as part of the conclusions of the European Council.  Ireland actively sought the issuing of such a statement and participated fully in its preparation. The statement reads as follows:</P>
    <P>The Heads of State and Government confirmed their close interests in developments in Central America.  They are deeply concerned at the economic and social conditions in many parts of the region, at the tensions which these create and at the widespread misery and bloodshed.</P>
    <P>They are convinced that the problems of Central America cannot be solved by military means, but only by a political solution springing from the region itself and respecting the principles of non-interference and inviolability of frontiers.  They, therefore, fully support the current initiative of the Contadora Group.  They underlined the need for the establishment of democratic conditions and for the strict observance of human rights throughout the region.</P>
    <P>They are ready to continue contributing to the further development in the <Col N="1366" /> area, in order to promote progress towards stability.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Deputy may wish to be aware, as recently announced by the Minister of State at my Department, that the Government has allocated grants totalling £40,000 from the Disaster Relief Fund to Central America in view of its rapidly growing refugee problem.  This amount is intended to assist displaced persons in El Salvador; and Salvadorean and other refugees in various Central American countries.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Payments of extra-statutory redundancy moneys were made to some occupants of company dwellings somewhat later than to the general body of redundant workers, as it was necessary to have discussions on the question of vacation, <Col N="1367" /> purchase or signature of caretakers agreements with the occupants.  I am satisfied that these discussions were carried out with full consideration for the circumstances of the occupants by the receiver, whose duty it is to realise the assets of the mine property.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that there is no intention of arbitrarily depriving exemployees of the mine of their accommodation and, in fact, the opportunity is being afforded to them to purchase the accommodation at a fair and reasonable price.</P>

      <P>At present there are three registered importers of EEC vehicles who import the fully built up vehicles for which they are registered without restriction.  Two of the firms are still assembling and have maintained their 1965 levels of assembly and employment.  One of the firms has met fully the requirements for diversification and consequently continues to enjoy facilities for importation of built up vehicles, for which it is registered, without restriction.</P>
      <P>Five registered importers of EEC vehicles have ceased assembly of such vehicles.  Four of these firms have failed to provide alternatives to assembly which would fully meet the requirements for diversification and consequently their imports of fully built up vehicles are restricted.  Negotiations with the fifth firm have not yet been concluded.  Discussions are also taking place with one of the four firms, which has failed to meet requirements under a previous arrangement.</P>
      <P>Two registered importer/assemblers of non-EEC vehicles are continuing assembly but not at the required level under the scheme.  Negotiations are, however, taking place with both firms and proposals for alternatives to assembly have been submitted and are being examined.</P>

      <P>With the growth of the electronic industry in Ireland in the seventies, it became necessary, in advance of the establishment of Irish national standards, to find an interim solution so as to ensure access for Irish products to other countries. To this end negotiations were initiated by the IIRS in 1979 with the US Department of Defence (which in the United States is the body that sets these standards), with a view to the adoption of common technical specifications and certification procedures.</P>
      <P>The negotiations extended over some years and on 8 June 1981, shortly before the general election of that year, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, acting on behalf of the then Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism, circulated a draft memorandum to Departments proposing that Government approval be given for the continuation of the negotiation of this technical agreement.  This memorandum was approved by the subsequent Government on 1 December 1981 and the agreement was signed by the IIRS on 8 March, 1983.</P>
      <P>The agreement is of an administrative and technical character and does not involve any defence or military commitments.</P>

      <P>Notwithstanding the reduced period of annual training I have decided that the gratuity payable to qualified members of the Reserve Defence Force who complete the maximum permissible period in 1983 will be at the full rates and not at the reduced rates which would normally apply in respect of attendance for training for the shorter period.</P>

    <P>* Preliminary estimate.</P>
    <P>The data are taken from a monthly bulletin relating to statistics of registered unemployment which is published by the Statistical Office of the European Communities. A &ldquo;Technical Note&rdquo; to the publication indicates that differing national legislation and administrative procedures result in the data being suitable only for the analysis of trends and not for intercountry comparisons of absolute levels of unemployment.  Problems of comparability are particularly acute in the case of the unemployment figures for Greece.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the claims made by the Green Peace Organisation regarding <Col N="1379" /> discharges of radioactive waste into the Irish Sea from the nuclear reprocessing plant at Windscale in Cumbria.  The organisation have recently outlined their views on this matter to the Minister of State at my Department.  Basically, the organisation have claimed that the discharges have led to radioactive pollution of fisheries in the Irish Sea.  I understand from the Windscale plant and that these statutory body responsible for advising the Government on these matters, that small quantities of plutonium are included in the low level liquid effluents discharged to the north-east Irish Sea from the windscale plant and that these discharges are required to conform with the various safety standards laid down by the relevant international bodies.  I am further informed by the Nuclear Energy Board that the radiological significance of the plutonium concentrations in fish caught in the Irish Sea is negligible.</P>
      <P>Preliminary discussions have taken place about the possibility of concluding a formal Inter-Governmental Agreement between Ireland and the United Kingdom on the question of exchange of information about nuclear installations generally and the possibility of discharges from them.  When the Paris Convention which deals with marine discharges from land based sources has been formally ratified, our position on the question of nuclear waste discharges from such sources will be reviewed with a view to initiating discussions with the United Kingdom authorities in accordance with the terms of the Convention.</P>

In addition to the testing requirement there is a statutory obligation on vehicle owners to maintain vehicles in a roadworthy condition at all times.  Enforcement action to ensure compliance with these requirements is primarily a matter for the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to say what the effects of using Whitegate as a storage depot would be until such a policy, if contemplated, was specifically detailed and costed.  There would be a number of policy options, such as, for example, whether or not to mothball the refining hardware which would have a significant impact on employment levels and costs. Certainly there would be a reduction in staff employed both in the refinery itself and in ancillary services.  The effect on security of oil supplies, apart from the loss of flexibility in not having an active refinery, would also depend on the volume and type of oil stored.  The capital or financing requirement of having all the <Col N="1410" /> refinery tankage full with oil products would be of the order of $70 million or an financing charge of the order of $9 million per annum.  The operating cost would be up to $2 million per annum in addition to this.</P>

      <P>The detailed objectives of the Irish National Petroleum Corporation Limited are set out in the corporation's memorandum of association available in the Companies Registration Office.  The working objectives are contained in the recent annual reports of the corporation which are available in the Library of the House.  I am, however, arranging to circulate a copy of the latter in the Official Report.  It will be noted that these objectives embrace a function on the lines specified in the Deputies' question.</P>
      <P>The scope of the corporation's original functions was very substantially changed when, following Government decisions in 1982 to acquire the Whitegate refinery, the corporation was entrusted with the operation of the refinery.</P>
      <P>While the success of a body like the INPC should be assessed against the totality of its approved objectives, I regard the impact of the corporation's activities on the efficiency and competitiveness of the oil industry here as a crucial aspect.  This is a matter which must weigh very significantly in the Government's review of future policy on the corporation and its operations.</P>
      <P>The Deputies will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me, at this stage, to express views other than as an input to consideration of the matter by the Government in due course.</P>
      <P>Objectives of the Corporation</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>1.  To provide for the supply of a significant part of the oil requirements of the Irish market on terms which are as <Col N="1412" /> secure as possible in duration and continuity and in accordance with policies approved by the Minister for Industry and Energy.</P>
    <P>2.  To operate within the Irish oil industry and market in a manner which will promote orderly development, bearing in mind objective No. 1 above, the national situation and other commercial interests involved.</P>
    <P>3.  To develop and maintain an economic operation which contributes to the efficiency of the oil industry in Ireland.</P>
    <P>4.  To carry out duties as designated by the Minister for Industry and Energy in relation to the development of indigenous hydrocarbon resources, including functions arising from the State's participation rights provided for in petroleum exploration licences.</P>
    <P>5.  To afford professional advice and assistance and to undertake specific functions and operations on behalf of the Minister for Industry and Energy in relation to the provision, transportation, refining and storage of petroleum and to all oil industry matters.</P>
    <P>6.  To maintain a continuous review of international supply trends and keep the Minister for Industry and Energy advised of important developments.</P>
    <P>7.  To promote the use and development of Irish natural resources and to promote an enhanced trading value for Irish exports where possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1981 the Electricity Supply Board entered into a contract with the Irish National Petroleum Corporation for the supply in 1982 of 250,000 tonnes of heavy fuel oil representing about one-third of the board's fuel oil requirements in 1982.  Between January and April <Col N="1413" /> 1982, 81,000 tonnes were sold and delivered to the board under an agreed contract at an average price of $206.7 per tonne.  In August 1982 the Government decided that the board should purchase by the end of the year the balance of the contracted quantity, that is, 169,000 tonnes, at a crude-related price of $195 per tonne.  The board received delivery of 20,000 tonnes of this quantity.  With the changed situation in the fuel oil market and in agreement with the Department, the board and the corporation arranged that the latter would sell 140,000 tonnes on behalf of the former on the open market and the board would pay the corporation the difference between the sales price and the crude-related price.  This difference averaged $20.3 per tonne.  Because of the existence of premia related to suitability of the material for further processing and low sulphur content this arrangement was beneficial both to the corporation and the board.</P>
      <P>The price of the board's other supplies of heavy fuel oil in the year averaged $169 per tonne.  The extra cost to the board of the purchases from the corporation amounted to about £4.8 million.  It must be stated that in 1982 the corporation's contracted crude oil supplies were uncompetitive when compared to other crude oil prices.  As a result of major changes in the INPC's procurement arrangements made earlier this year, the corresponding figure in 1983 is expected to show a significant improvement.</P>
      <P>The extra cost of the price of electricity as a result of the board's purchases from the corporation in 1982 would be equivalent to just under one per cent of the price of electricity.</P>

      <P>From the levels of radiation which might reasonably be expected in this country, the mere fact of staying indoors, in itself, provides a significant protection and this protection factor can be very substantially increased by carrying out simple protective measures.

      <P>The Civil Defence Organisation, in which the vast majority of personnel are volunteers, has an aggregate strength in the region of 40,000 but the active strength is probably about half that number.

      <P>I am satisfied regarding the arrangements in force in relation to the two aspects mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The land acquisition policy of my Department is related to the ultimate objective of planting 10,000 hectares per annum.  It is recognised, however, that this objective cannot be attained until the reserve of plantable land has been built up to support an annual planting programme of that level.  In the short-term a lower target of 7,500 hectares has been adopted as the most practical policy subject to the availability of funds.  Therefore, my Department are endeavouring to acquire each year an area of land suitable for afforestation to support the latter programme, any short-fall being met as far as possible by reafforestation of clear-felled land.</P>
      <P>As regards the prices paid for land purchased for forestry, these are calculated on a cost-revenue basis in which the timber-bearing potential of the land is the primary factor.  Accordingly, lands of higher yield potential will command a higher price.  Secondary factors such as likely development costs, including roading, drainage and fencing, are also taken into account in determining land-values.</P>
      <P>As a general principle, my Department do not purchase land suitable for agricultural purposes, and to this end it obtains arability reports in all marginal cases. The exclusion of arable land is a further factor in controlling the maximum price which may be paid for forestry land.</P>

      <P>The reply to the question is as follows: (a) It is understood that operations will commence within the next few months; (b) Employment projections at full production envisage up to 200 in the mill and a further 250 in timber harvesting and haulage; (c) Initially, the plant will utilise some 200,000 m³ of pulpwood/sawmill <Col N="1428" /> residues per annum, increasing to 400,000 m³ at full production. It is anticipated that exports of such material will reduce more or less in line with intake by the mill; (d) The product, known as medium density fibreboard, is a reconstituted wood panel produced from wood reduced to fibre-type strands which are then recombined, formed into mats and pressed.  It is a quality board used principally in the manufacture of furniture.</P>

      <P>So far as my Department are aware, a number of unlicensed rebroadcasting systems operate in Counties Donegal, Galway, Mayo, Roscommon, Sligo, Tipperary and Waterford.  Such systems are liable to seizure and the operators are liable to prosecution.</P>
      <P>The negotiations of copyright agreements with broadcasting authorities is a matter for those who wish to use the broadcast signals.  My Department's examination of the matter indicates that any such negotiations would be complex and time consuming.</P>

    <P>¹ The cost of the married, working wife, single and widowed allowances is included in (a).  The working wife allowance was abolished with effect from 6 April 1980.</P>
    <P>² The drop in the cost of child allowance from the year 1982-83 was caused by the reduction in the standard child allowance from £195 for 1981-82 to £100 for 1982-83.</P>
    <P>³ The housekeeper allowance was abolished with effect from 6 April 1982.</P>
    <P>4 Presumably the allowance referred to at item (j) is the Employee (PAYE) allowance.  This is costed under item (f) in the table.</P>
    <P>5 The relief costed under item (n) is the exemption provided (up to certain limits) for interest arising from deposits with the Post Office and Trustee Savings Banks and certain specified commercial banks.</P>
    <P>6 The cost of stock relief is available by calendar year only.  The figure shown for 1979-80 is for the year 1979 and so on.</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners state that the most up-to-date drug identification equipment available has been issued to customs staff at ports, airports and at land frontier crossings.  Increasing numbers of customs officers have been receiving specialised drug training at the Customs and Excise Training Centre and training officers have visited various stations on an on-going basis to instruct local staff.  Two specialist officers have recently been assigned to liaison duties with Garda Authorities and for the development of information and intelligence and to co-ordinate joint actions on both a national and international basis.  The effectiveness of these measures will be kept under constant review.</P>
      <P>Customs officers have powers of arrest for drug smuggling under the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876.  However, in practice persons detected by customs are normally handed over to the Garda who institute proceedings under the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, in addition to a retirement pension, the taxpayer is also in receipt of a social welfare old age pension. Both pensions are chargeable to income tax.  In accordance with practice, the taxpayer's tax-free allowances are set off, in the first instance, against the social welfare pension to enable it to be paid without deduction of income tax.  The balance of the allowances are made available against the retirement pension.</P>
      <P>On the basis of information supplied to the inspector of taxes, when the taxpayer called to the tax office recently, an amended certificate of tax-free allowances for the current year was issued to the taxpayer on 29 June 1983.</P>
      <P>Any tax overdeducted from the retirement pension since 6 April 1983 is refundable by the taxpayer's former employer on operation of that certificate.</P>

      <P>The question of the purchase of Coole Hospital for use as a health care institution is a matter in the first instance for the Midland Health Board.</P>
      <P>Since the closure of Coole Hospital in 1981 considerable thought has been given by both the Midland and North Eastern Health Boards in conjunction with my Department to devising a scheme whereby the hospital could be used for the provision of health services.  However, no realistic proposal has emerged. This is not surprising since both the location and structure of the complex stand in the way of its being used for health purposes.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances it is not my intention to purchase the hospital at Coole for use as a health care institution.</P>

      <P>The person in question is awaiting fixed appliance orthodontic treatment.  This treatment is carried out by orthodontists in private practice on behalf of the health boards and in normal circumstances treatment of the case in question would now be in progress.  However, the Department of Health have been endeavouring <Col N="1463" /> for the past two years to get agreement with the private orthodontists on a scale of charges for the treatment and in the absence of agreement the issue of authorisations to proceed with treatments was suspended.  The Department have recently put proposals for a fee scale to the orthodontists.  If the orthodontists agree to these proposals then the Department will be in a position to recommence the issue of authorisations to health boards to proceed with fixed appliance cases.</P>
      <P>Applications will be invited soon for a new full-time post of consultant orthodontist for the Western Health Board. The filling of this post should greatly reduce the waiting period for orthodontic treatment in the area.</P>

      <P>An applicant for unemployment benefit is not considered to be unemployed if he receives remuneration at a rate in excess of £2.00 daily from a subsidary occupation such as farming. The limit of £2.00 daily may only be exceeded when the applicant has record of at least 78 paid contributions in the three years prior to his claim.</P>
      <P>The person concerned does not satisfy the condition of having 78 contributions paid during the three years prior to his current claim.  His case was referred to a social welfare officer to investigate the value of his holding and inquiries are still being made in the matter.  When these inquiries are completed the income will be assessed and his entitlement to unemployment benefit determined accordingly.</P>
      <P>He was invited to claim unemployment assistance pending the outcome of his unemployment benefit application but declined to do so.  He is understood to have returned to work on 2 June 1983.</P>

      <P>No payments have been made in respect of the child in question since Friday 8 April 1983 because of the fact that she attained the age of 18 years on 3 April 1983.  Up to 8 April 1983 her grand-father was paid an increase in his pension in respect of her but this could not be paid after she attained 18 years regardless of whether or not she was in full-time education.</P>
      <P>Following her grand-father's death a widow's contributory pension was awarded to her grand-mother at the maximum personal over 66 years rate of £36.95 per week with effect from 10 June 1983.  A child increase can be paid on a widow's pension in respect of a qualified child who is aged between 18 and 21 and in full-time education by day.  The grand-mother of the child would therefore be entitled to an increase in pension in respect of her.</P>
      <P>She is aware of her possible entitlement to an increase in respect of the child and a form on which to claim the increase has been sent to her.  She has been advised that this form should be completed and returned when the child resumes full-time education after the holiday period.  Her entitlement to an increase in respect of the child will then be considered and if in order will be back-dated to 10 June 1983.</P>

      <P>Following the receipt of the maximum entitlement of 390 days unemployment benefit on 26 June 1982 the person concerned applied for unemployment assistance on 27 June 1982.  His application was authorised at the weekly rate of £16.50 being the appropriate maximum weekly rate in his case of £26.00 less means £9.50 derived from the value of board and lodgings in his parents home.  He appealed against the amount of means assessed against him.  The appeals officer whose decision is final determined his weekly means at £9.50 from 27 June 1982, £7.50 from 29 September 1982 and £9.45 from 14 January 1983.</P>
      <P>His weekly rate of unemployment assistance was accordingly increased to £18.50 (£26.00 less means £7.50) from 29 September 1982 reduced to £16.55 (£26.00 less means £9.45) from 14 January 1983 and increased to £19.45 (£28.90 less means £9.45) from 29 June 1983.

      <P>Following a review of her circumstances the rate of widow's non-contributory pension paid to the person concerned with effect from 11 June 1982 was reduced to £27.15 per week.  This was the rate of pension payable to her as a widow over 66 years of age with no qualified child whose weekly means exceeded £14.00 but did not exceed £16.00; it included a living alone allowance of £2.70 per week.  The claimant's means derived from a holding and capital were assessed at £15.74 per week.  She appealed against the decision reducing her pension but her appeal was disallowed by an appeals officer.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 19 April 1983 to 21 April 1983 after which date he was certified fit to resume work.  Disability benefit is not payable for the first three days of any period of incapacity for work unless a person has had another claim in respect of incapacity for work or unemployment not more than three days previously. Consequently, the claimant was not entitled to payment of benefit.  He subsequently submitted medical evidence to the effect that he did not resume work until 17 May 1983 and a cheque for <Col N="1488" /> the arrears of disability benefit payable on his claim was issued to him.</P>
      <P>In addition a cheque for the amount of pay-related benefit payable from 12 May 1983 to 16 May 1983 was issued to the claimant on 1 July 1983.</P>

An applicant for unemployment benefit with a subsidiary occupation such as farming is not considered to be unemployed if the rate of remuneration from that employment exceeds £2.00 daily.

      <P>Inquiries were necessary to ascertain the amount of the average net weekly earnings of the person concerned as well as the amount of his reckonable earnings during the relevant income tax period 6 April 1981 to 5 April 1982.

However, the weekly flat-rate of unemployment benefit payable to him is £75.00 weekly increased to £82.50 from 30 June 1983 when the rates of flat-rate unemployment benefit were increased. Accordingly the rate of pay-related benefit due to him was limited to £16.29 weekly from 13 April 1983 reducing to £8.79 from 30 June 1983.  Arrears of pay-related benefit issued to him last week.  Further combined payments at £91.29 representing flat-rate unemployment benefit £82.50 weekly and pay-related benefit £8.79 will be made as they become due.</P>

Pay-related benefit was also issued from 2 May 1983, the nineteenth day of incapacity, at the weekly rate of £15.53.</P>
      <P>She subsequently made a claim in respect of a child dependant and the appropriate increase has now been awarded with effect from 11 April 1983.
