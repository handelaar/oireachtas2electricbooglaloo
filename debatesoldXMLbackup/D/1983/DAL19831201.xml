      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 6 and 5.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Tánaiste, through you, Sir, if the House can expect any statement or any information whatever today on the meeting which took place yesterday in Brussels between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland?  I ask because on a television programme last night the Minister for Foreign Affairs indicated that he was disappointed that the question asked yesterday by Deputy Gerry Collins was not allowed so that he could have dealt with in and also because there is a great deal of irresponsible speculation in the newspapers on what exactly the meeting was about, based, I believe, on inspired leaks from the Northern Ireland Office?</P>

      <P>The Chair cannot be influenced by the disappointment of a member of the Government that a certain matter has not been allowed or was ruled out of order.  The Chair is bound by and must proceed according to Standing Orders and precedents.  If the Chair were to do otherwise and allowed someone to give an answer whenever he so wished and disallowed it in other circumstances, the Chair would simply lose <Col N="864" /> control.  The Chair ruled yesterday, and he is now ruling again, that this matter does not properly arise on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course one accepts your authority in this matter but it seems extraordinary that an unprecedented event happened in which there is great public interest and enormous media speculation, that the Minister indicates he would like to tell the House about the matter but that we are prevented from hearing him.  Could the Tánaiste find some way today of giving us information about this extraordinary meeting that took place because, quite frankly, we do not accept the explanations that are being floated with regard to it.  A meeting of that sort has implications for work on which we are all engaged in another area. Taking all these things into account, would the Tánaiste be of assistance to the House sometime today on this matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair wants to make this clear.  It appears sometimes from reports on what is said that the Chair would not allow this or that.  The Chair is operating Standing Orders and the Chair also feels that he should state that while complaints are made in the House regularly about this and that not being permitted, no efforts seem to be made at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges even to complain about this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Tánaiste that either he or the Minister concerned would avail of the procedure of a statement in the House with regard to this matter.</P>

      <P>I suggest that since this Dáil first assembled, there have been numerous occasions on which matters have been arranged through the Whips.  As a matter of fact the Whips seem to get on very well and perhaps this <Col N="865" /> matter should be pursued in an orderly way through them.</P>

      <P>Two weeks ago in this House we were told by the Government that a deal had been completed in relation to Clondalkin Paper Mills, that negotiations were going on and would continue to 30 November with a UK company which may or may not alter the situation.  It is now 1 December and would the Tánaiste tell the House, in fairness to the workers in the Clondalkin area, what the position is, if the arrangement with the UK company has been advanced and finalised or whether it is the Canadian company with whom final arrangements are being made?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair regrets he had to rule again that that does not arise on the Order of Business.  It is not reasonable that this should be raised day after day when the Chair has made it clear that, under procedures, I cannot allow it.  We could have a two hours debate on this if it was allowed to develop.</P>

The scheme has been postponed on a number of occasions but in the last statement issued on the matter, that was on 21 July, it was promised for December.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>During the course of the discussion on the Private Members' Bill last evening, you will recall that the Minister agreed to withdraw his amendment and suggested that, if the Opposition would agree, a special committee of the House would be established to consider the matters contained in the Bill.  Can the Tánaiste indicate now when this special committee will be established and also whether advice obtained from the Attorney General will be made available to the committee.  I am sure the Tánaiste will accept that it is imperative that the committee meet immediately in view of the fact that the cases in question are continuing to be heard in the District Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes to fix the total number of Members of the Dáil, to revise the constituencies for the election of Members to the Dáil and to prescribe the number of Members to be returned for each constituency.</P>
      <P>In considering the background to the Bill it is necessary to refer to the provisions of Article 16.2 of the Constitution, in particular to the requirements that</P>
      <P>(a)  the ratio between the number of Members to be elected at any time for each constituency and the population of each constituency as ascertained at the last preceding census, shall, so far as it is practicable, be the same through the country, and</P>
      <P>(b)  the Oireachtas shall revise the constituencies at least once in every twelve years with due regard to changes in distribution of the population.</P>
      <P>Twenty-two years ago the constitutional provisions relating to the revision of constituencies came before the High Court and the Supreme Court in two well-known actions.  In these cases, however, the courts did not lay down what variation from the national average population per Deputy would be regarded as permissible in the formation of constituencies nor did they rule on the question of whether a revision of constituencies must take place whenever a census discloses substantial changes in the pattern of population distribution since the preceding census.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House is aware, the constituencies <Col N="872" /> were last revised in 1980 on the basis of the population as ascertained at the census taken in April 1979.  A further census was taken in April 1981 and disclosed some considerable shifts in population, particularly within the greater Dublin area.  The Government considered it appropriate to put a revision of constituencies in train and, for this purpose, appointed an independent commission. The terms of reference given to the commission were the same as those given to the commission which drew up the 1980 proposals, with the additional guideline that, in view of the short time which had elapsed since the last review of constituencies, they should take account of the desirability of effecting the minimum changes.</P>
    <P>In their report, which was laid before both Houses, the commission recommended that there should be no change in the overall membership of the Dáil or in the allocation of seats to individual constituencies.  They recommended that there should be no change in the definition of the constituencies apart from the transfer of an area with a population of 10,830 from Dublin South-West to Dublin South-Central and of an area with a population of 5,783 from Dublin West to Dublin Central.  This Bill proposes to implement the commission's recommendations in full.</P>
    <P>In this regard, there are two points in particular that I would wish to make. First, the obligation to revise the constituencies is placed by the Constitution on the Oireachtas.  The power of decision rests with the Oireachtas: the commission are advisory only.  Secondly, it will be noted that while only four constituencies are affected by the changes, all constituencies are defined anew in the schedule. This is to ensure that the Bill gives effect to a revision of constituencies within the meaning of Article 16.2 of the Constitution, which relates to constituencies generally.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be interested to note that, in the scheme now before the House, the percentage variations in the population-Deputy ratio range from +6.68 per cent in Louth to -7.89 per cent in Mayo East.  This compares with <Col N="873" /> variations in the previous revision ranging from +6.28 per cent in Carlow-Kilkenny to -6.42 per cent in Mayo East. Deputies will find a discussion of population-Deputy ratios in chapters 6, 7 and 8 of the commission's report.  As I have already indicated, the courts did not set limits beyond which variations from the national average population-Deputy ratio would not be permissible.</P>
    <P>Deputies have already received copies of the commission's report and maps have been deposited in the Oireachtas Library indicating the changes proposed in the constituencies of Dublin South-West, Dublin South-Central, Dublin West and Dublin Central.  I do not think it is necessary for me at this stage to comment further in relation to any of the individual constituencies.</P>
    <P>I would like, on behalf of the Government, to express appreciation of the manner in which the commission have done their job and to place on the record of the House our thanks to the members of the commission, Mr. Justice Walsh of the Supreme Court, Mr. Turpin, Secretary of my Department and the Clerk of the Dáil, Mr. Rayel.  I am sure that the House will wish to be associated with this expression of appreciation.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party accept the recommendations of the Dáil Constituency Commission as contained in their report and we accept that they have been faithful to the terms of reference given to them by the Government. We see no need to delay this House in considering the Bill which is merely giving legislative effect to the recommendations of the commission.  Individual Deputies may have differing views as to where the boundaries might be drawn in each constituency.  I am not sure that that is really the concern of the Dáil this morning at this stage in view of the fact that both sides of the House accepted the terms of reference as such and the commission have been faithful to those terms of reference in the proposals which they have brought forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the fact that this revision has taken place so soon after the previous <Col N="874" /> revision I suppose it was reasonable of the Government to include the new terms of reference which I quote as the Minister stated them:</P>
    <P>in view of the short time which had elapsed since the last review of constituencies,...the desirability of effecting the minimum changes.</P>
    <P>That was a very severe restriction on the members of the commission and I accept that that played a very big part in the decisions which they made finally.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party I would like to join with the Minister in thanking the members of the commission &mdash; Mr. Justice Walsh, Mr. Turpin and Mr. Rayel &mdash; for their excellent work and I will, if I may, add our thanks to the secretary of that commission, Mr. Sexton, who I know would have done the bulk of the work in preparing the documentation and has given very great service in this area of electoral law over the years.</P>

      <P>I warn the Government against any attempt to deny the people the opportunity of expressing their democratic will in regard to the membership of local authorities by deciding to postpone the local elections.  There are precedents for postponements.  There were very good grounds on one occasion in which I was involved in 1972.  I am not sure whether the grounds were as valid in 1973 when Deputy Tully, then Coalition Minister, postponed them.  The people are entitled to express their view on the membership of these local authorities, <Col N="875" /> and we feel that it is important that those elections would take place, that they would not be postponed.  There are absolutely no valid reasons being promoted by this Government to justify any postponement at this stage.  I want to state in regard to previous postponements&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I accept that and we will avail of that opportunity if the Government attempt to deny the people their right to change the membership of the local authorities in 1984.  I think it would be seen as an act of political cowardice on the part of this Government if they were to attempt to postpone the elections. The only reason such a decision would be made would be that they fear the wrath of the electorate.  Any other excuse brought forward would have no credibility with the public.</P>
      <P>As I have said, it is not our intention on this side of the House to delay this Bill very long.  In accepting the commission's recommendations we recognise that the Bill is merely implementing those recommendations and giving them legislative effect.  We support the Bill in the form in which it has been brought forward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a few points about the total membership of the Dáil which the commission considered itself obliged by the guidelines given to it to recommend should be left at the existing number of 166 Deputies.  The total membership of the Dáil cannot be more than <Col N="876" /> one per 20,000 of the population or fewer than one per 30,000 of the population under Article 16 of the Constitution.  On the basis of the present population those two limits would have justified a House with a membership as large as 172 &mdash; six more than the number we have already &mdash; but at the other end of the scale it would have justified a House as small as 115 Deputies.</P>
      <P>There are problems in heading towards the smaller number, and I shall say a word about that later.  We are near the upper limit at the moment, and probably the commission would have considered itself not only entitled but obliged to avail of the upper limit and give us an extra six Deputies in addition to the number we have already, because of our tradition during the years of adhering as closely as possible to the upper limit.  If one considers the total membership of the Dáil during the years one will see it has always adhered as closely as possible to the upper limit of one per 20,000 population.</P>
      <P>In 1948, 1951, 1954 and 1957 Dála were returned with 146 Members.  The population dropped somewhat in the late 1950s and in 1961 and 1965 Dála returned on the basis of the 1960 Electoral (Amendment) Act had only 144 Members. When I first stood for the Dáil in 1969 there were 148 Members and now we have an extra 16.  We might now have 172 Members had we stuck to the existing practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The existing practice can be defended. If one were to say that for reasons of economy we should have stuck to the other limit and had as few Deputies as possible &mdash; we could have 115 Members without changing a line in the Constitution &mdash; we would run into a problem that Mr. Lynch when Taoiseach adverted to when replying to a question on a radio or television interview.  It was put to him that there were too many Deputies, that a relatively small number contribute to debates on legislation, which is what they are there for, and we heard the usual insulting, and I suppose not wholly inaccurate, references to what popular opinion supposes Deputies to do until, of course, a member of the public requires the services of a Deputy and then there <Col N="877" /> is no limit to what he is expected to do.</P>
    <P>Mr. Lynch's reply, which was a good one, was that while it would be economical from the point of view of finance to reduce the number of Deputies to 110 &mdash; as it might have been in those day &mdash; there was a problem.  If the Government and the Opposition are reasonably evenly balanced and the Government are supported by only a narrow majority in the House, as is usually the case here, with a Dáil of 110 Deputies one would have to suppose that only 55 or 57 would support the Government and from that number the Taoiseach would have to find a Cabinet of competent Ministers.  Mr. Lynch expressed this view in the form habitual to him &mdash; fairly gentle, even if it was not unexceptionable in other respects.  He said a certain minimum was needed &mdash; and he thought 55 was too small &mdash; from which one could draw to provide a Front Bench of Ministers and a few second row Parliamentary Secretaries. Mr. Lynch put it tactfully that a number of one's supporters would perhaps be unsuitable or not available for office.  That is a serious point and I agree with it.  A Taoiseach needs a certain number in order to give him a range of choice.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies in this and other parliaments have no special ambition for office themselves.  They do not enter politics with office in mind.  They are quite happy and proud to spend their public careers as back bench Deputies working for their constituents and contributing as best they can on subjects where they feel they have something to offer.  The point made by Mr. Lynch was fair enough, but I think it has been met and satisfied.  He was speaking at a time when the Dáil had 148 Deputies, where the Government had an overall majority in the House and where they had more than 70 Deputies behind them.  A Deputy could be elected Taoiseach if 70 Deputies supported him. Let us give a certain margin for a particularly unlucky election where many talented people might lose their seats, or not run again, and put the figure at 75. That would posit a Dáil of 150 or perhaps 152 or 153 Members.</P>
    <P>I have stated that the point made by Mr. Lynch was valid, but it has been met; <Col N="878" /> and when we go beyond that point we are being extravagant.  I think 166 is a shade too many.  I think this goes back to our side of the House; I think it was when Mr. Tully was Minister for Local Government that he put forward a Bill which raised the number.  However, if he did, he was only doing what every other Minister had done before when producing such a Bill, namely, adhering to the upper limit.</P>
    <P>As the population grows and as the upper limit implies a larger membership of the House we get further away from the valid justification which Mr. Lynch offered for a House of a certain minimum size.  We do not necessarily want a House with the maximum number.  The point is often made by people who write to the newspapers because it has suddenly dawned on them that, if other European countries were represented on the same ratio as we are, the Parliaments of the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Italy would have assemblies of approximately 2,500 Deputies each.  To put it another way, the constituency I have the honour to represent is about the same size as a German constituency or a British urban constituency.  Whereas I have four valued colleagues, not all of my own persuasion, in that constituency, if I were a Deputy in Germany or Britain I would be there on my own.  That will give an idea of the difference in range between the various countries.</P>
    <P>We should tell the next commission there is no need for them to stick to what was formerly the position, to adhere strictly to the 20,000 guideline.  Perhaps we should say we have 166 Deputies and we do not need any more.  Even though the population may grow &mdash; I hope it will grow and that there will be jobs there for them &mdash; I think there is no alternative now, and we have reached a workable position in which the problem is not now visible.  I am speaking now about Deputies who are junior to me on both sides of the House.  I can see Deputies of various political persuasions who are sitting on the back benches but are perfectly well qualified for office.  It does not seem to me that there is a large number of backbenchers junior to me here who are <Col N="879" /> unfit or unavailable for office.  On the contrary.  In my own party certainly there seems to be a large number well fit for office and quite anxious to work and I feel the same is true of the other side as well.  I would like to try to initiate a mood in the House which would lead us to accept that the House is now big enough and, even if the population does grow by another couple of hundred thousand, we should not enlarge it any further.</P>
    <P>The reason I say that is because we enjoy a very low level of public esteem at the moment.  The reasons for that are partly irrational, partly related to political decisions that were mistaken and partly related to behaviour which comes across to the people through the Press. The Press have a duty not to be unreasonable, and I accept that, and they have a duty to present what happens here.  I do not mean in a way that should be laughable, though I do not fault them for that on occasion.  But there comes a point where a certain mood can overtake all of us and it overtakes the Press as well and they get into the laugh mood irrespective of the context.  Very often it has to be admitted we give them the opportunity of feeding on that disposition and, if it does not so much raise a laugh, it is trying to present the House as a sort of merry-go-round or farcical Punch and Judy show, which the House frequently becomes.  All we have to do is look at the Order of Business here every day.  I accept that we in Opposition may have been just as bad at times, but I honestly do not think we were except on very rare occasions.  What is occurring here now on every sitting day is becoming the rule.  I am not making any special point about this.</P>

      <P>I do not think I was one of the worst.  At any rate I think what passes now for a serious enunciation on daily business here has become farcical and the Press are well entitled to make it a Punch and Judy Show and, if I were a member of the public sitting up there in the Public Gallery, that is exactly what I would <Col N="880" /> make of it.  Between that and paying ourselves increases which, however objectively justified they may be, the public do not perceive like that when they hear us appealing to them not to be seeking increases which keep pace with inflation and when they find the kind of political tomfoolery that went on here in regard to the abortion referendum&mdash;parties that should be working together trying to outdo one another with the people's money&mdash;naturally they form a low opinion of the political process.  That is the reason why we should be looking seriously not just at public relations but seriously trying to show the people we do not need to be extravagant and we do not need to be as indulgent to ourselves and that we are willing to apply economies. The first thing we should do formally as a housekeeping exercise irrespective of party allegiance is decide there are enough seats here now and there is no serious excuse for enlarging the House even if the population passes the 4 million mark or the 4.5 million mark.  Even then we will have a House which can be very thoroughly representive by European standards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would like to associate myself with the expressions of appreciation for the work that has been done by the commission.  The reason there is very little contention with the recommendations is because the effect on the constitutencies concerned will be very marginal and no Deputy in the four constitutencies will feel in any way challenged or threatened by the recommendations. The commission was established to allay the fears of the public in regard to an alleged tendency to gerrymander. However, because of the way in which the commission was given its terms of reference by the Government of the day, I believe an alternative method of giving such terms of reference should be established. They should be given by the House rather than by the Government. That would ensure protection from the charge of gerrymandering.  The Oireachtas has responsibility for establishing the constitutencies, deciding what shape they ought to be and how many seats ought to <Col N="881" /> be in each constitutency.  There are gaps in the present procedure even though it is an advance on previous methods but these gaps leave themselves open to the belief amongst the public that all may not be done fairly.</P>
      <P>The question of the temptation which appears to be about at the moment to avoid, if possible, going before the electorate in 1984 should be resisted by the Government.  Regardless of the reasons which may be put forward this will be seen by the electorate as the fear of losing seats and that can only add to the very strong feeling among the people that politicians generally are not very relevant to the problems of the community at large. There are various reasons put forward, the strongest at the moment being that reform is required in the area of local government.  That is a need that has been there for some considerable time.  The need to assure the electorate that the Government are not prepared to avoid an election is stronger than the need for reform at this time.  There is nothing to prevent the Government initiating reforms at the same time as holding an election next year.</P>
      <P>If this Government or any other Government for that matter&mdash;previous Administrations have postponed local government elections for various reasons &mdash;adopts this trend the question must be asked at what point should it stop.  Will a stage be reached in five years' time or ten years' time when a Government decides a general election should be postponed?</P>

I think I should make the point that, regardless of how honourable the present <Col N="882" /> Government are or future Governments may be, the facts are that the public at large see politicians in general in a different light.  If elections are postponed, for whatever reason, there is a risk of damaging even further the credibility of this House and the democratic process.  I am concerned that this should not happen and I would urge the Minister to think seriously before taking such a step.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the commission on the speedy manner in which they dealt with this subject.  This appears to be a fair and equitable way of revising constituency boundaries and gets us away from the kind of charges to which other speakers have referred.  Deputy Kelly dealt at some length with the total membership of the Dáil and the public perception of how we behave in this House, whether people believe we are doing what we should be doing and giving good value for money or whether we are wasting time and money.</P>
      <P>I will advert briefly to the shifts in population which have necessitated boundary revisions.  During the past 25 years there has been a considerable shift in population from rural areas, particularly the west and north west, to the capital city and its environs.  If revisions had not taken place to accommodate that population we would have been seriously in breach of the Constitution.  I can foresee a time when because of the sparse population in rural areas Deputies representing them will find themselves at full stretch, working extremely hard in trying to make themselves as available to their constituents as do their colleagues in the newer urban areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Comparisons have been made with other parliaments and the numbers they would need if the same population ratio were applied.  I mean no disrespect to the members of other parliaments but I do not think their representatives give the same high standard of service as do the Members of this House.  While I have not been very long a Member of this House, I have been a public representative in another capacity for some years.  From <Col N="883" /> my experience I have formed the belief that no population in Europe get the same degree of service from their elected representatives as our population.  Many of us travel throughout our constituencies week after week attending clinics and meeting the people who need to have recourse to a public representative.  If we were not making ourselves available in that way those unfortunate people might have to travel up to 50 miles to see their public representative.  That would not happen in the large towns and cities but it would happen in rural constituencies.</P>
    <P>Unless and until some remedy is found for the problems we have to deal with &mdash; perhaps the Ombudsman will be able to deal with those matters in future &mdash; we require at least the numbers we have in this House at present.  A reduction in numbers without revisions would mean that we would have to work harder. While the public may not always think so, we work extremely hard and the average Deputy is committed to his job for seven days a week, 18 hours a day, almost 365 days a year.  Even on Christmas Day I have had to go out and do something on behalf of a constituent in need.  There is no sense in the public complaining that we are not doing our duty.  We do an extremely difficult job under very difficult circumstances and we get a great deal of criticism and very little recognition, except at the polls, and sometimes we do not get it there.</P>
    <P>Listening to the Order of Business this morning and every other morning, the media may see us in a particular light. Perhaps our standard of behaviour is not as high as it might be.  As I travel from meeting to meeting at night I listen to radio broadcasts from the House of Commons and I believe our standard of behaviour here is at least as high as in that parliament and probably compares very favourably with many others.  We do a reasonably good job and the fact that the public do not necessarily think so is a matter for themselves.  They should compare us with others.  Sometimes we deviate from the subject and perhaps I am one of the offenders from time to time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="884" /> The question of multi-seat constituencies has often been discussed.  I would love to be the only Deputy in my constituency but under the single seat system I might not be here.  As a politician and dealing with people in the course of my business I have always been suspicious of small groups.  To get a democratic decision I would far prefer to go into an arena where there was a large representative group of people and feel I had the viewpoint of a broad spectrum rather than going to a meeting with a small group.  I have often found that when one deals with a small group of people, whether they are representatives of a residents association or community council, there is a great danger of not getting the true feedback of what the people they purport to represent want.  It is possible that democracy does not work well that way. I am not making a case for an increase in the membership of the Dáil, but we should remember that the more representative we are the greater the opportunity of achieving true democracy.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the single seat constituency issue in another context.  It would be possible to operate such a system with the present membership of the Dáil but in the final analysis under such a system the public would not get as good a service as they are getting now.  Competition is the life of trade in any business and under the single seat constituency system there would not be the same degree of competition.  It is possible that we would not have so many politicans throwing themselves on the public as at present but there is no doubt that constituents would not get the same attention. If a decision is taken to change the system in the future I hope those matters are taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>I should like to commend the commission for producing their report so speedily. I hope that in the next few years the public will recognise that politicians do not put themselves on pedestals.  They are elected to public office to do a job but they are not supermen or superwomen. Politicians are human beings elected to represent in Parliament the ordinary everyday views of their constituents and they have the same fears, liabilities and <Col N="885" /> financial worries as other people.  They are entitled to be treated with a little bit of respect just as any worker deserves recognition for his or her efforts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to commend the commission on the speed with which they produced their report.  The brief given to the commission, to make the minimum distrubances possible in constituencies, was a good one.  I should like to call attention to the increase in population in rural Ireland which was dealt with by the commission.  This change is welcome. Hitherto the problem that came to the attention of the Minister in charge was connected with an increasing urban population and decreasing rural one.  For that reason it is a great pleasure for the House, and benefit for the country, to know that the rural population is increasing. Our constituencies will have to be looked at more often because of that change.</P>
      <P>A number of constituencies should be considered for three-seaters.  I instance my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan where the population is increasing in both counties.  Cavan and Monaghan could revert to single constituencies with three seats each.  I should like to endorse the remarks of Deputy Durkan who said how important it was to be able to keep in contact with constituents.  The worst possible construction is sometimes put on this by commentators.  My experience has been that whatever documentation comes before the House in regard to social matters, agriculture or the construction industry &mdash; they are three main concerns of the people I met &mdash; it is what affects constituents that is important rather than the documentation.  By making contact with constituents Members have an added dimension when debating affairs in the House.  I reject the criticism that is often made of this type of activity. It is not confined to Ireland, although the service given by representatives here is better than the service given in most other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I took possession of a room here which had been occupied by our spokesman on the Environment I found a photograph and I had to investigate the background <Col N="886" /> of it.  The photograph showed that Deputy in conversation with a consitituent from one of the islands off the west coast.  The picture was taken by a Scandinavian who was making a film in the area and his caption for it was indicative of what he thought of the exercise of keeping in touch with constituents. The photographer described it as a unique exercise in democracy, and that is precisely what it is.  The feedback from constituents is important.  Admittedly, the fact that a number of people represent one constituency makes for exaggeration. I do not know if it would be better to have single-seat constituencies or if we would tend to get lazy if that system was adopted.  I made some inquiries about the New Zealand and UK systems some years ago.  In the case of the UK I asked a Tory MP what would happen if he received a letter from a citizen who did not belong to his constituency but belonged to one represented by a Labour MP.  That MP informed me that he would send such a letter to the MP for the area although he did not belong to the same political party.  I do not know if that obtains under the present leader of the Tory Party but it has obtained for many years.  That MP also assured me that a Labour MP would do the same thing. Future commission should be asked to look carefully at the areas which are almost self sufficient for a three-seater such as Cavan and Monaghan.  The minimum of change has been advocated by the commission and that is a correct practice considering that we had a census in 1981.  It should be remembered that Fianna Fáil were responsible for carrying out the census in 1979.</P>

Reference has been made to the constituency scene in general, particularly in relation to representation and whether it should be on a multi-seat or <Col N="887" /> single-seat basis.  Listening to the advice of constituents across the national scene it appears that their perception is that there are too many TDs representing them at national level.  There are reasons put forward to justify that claim.  As Deputy Kelly pointed out this morning, our numbers were increased from 144 some years ago to 166 without a significant increase in population to so justify. Sometimes I feel there has been an extension of the old system under which various Ministers for Local Government had tremendous powers in examining constituencies, re-arranging them, changing them, even gerrymandering them, which was the main claim.  Had the Minister for the Environment of the day been doing this work now, had he set out to rearrange constituency boundaries then I am certain there would be far more Deputies in this Chamber now and a greater level of input in matters affecting them and their respective constituencies.</P>
      <P>At least the appointment of an independent commission took the heat out of the matter.  They have done a reasonably good job even though I feel in time it will lead to instability of Government.  This is particularly true of the multi-seat arrangement.  There is such growing cynicism about the level of input and general work of the politician that people see themselves agitating for minority representation which in the long term is bad for the country and for all of us.</P>
      <P>There has been reference also to the postponement of local government elections. A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, while you might contend that this does not relate to this Bill, nonetheless I should like to make this point&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Purely in passing.  Arising from the tactics of politicians over the years &mdash; and this applies to the level of their input with regard to legislation initiated and put through this House &mdash; we have now reached a stage at which local government has been reduced to a talking shop; its representatives no longer have <Col N="888" /> any power.  The time has come to set up a commission to examine the whole system of local government, to ascertain how it could be rendered more meaningful and appropriate to the needs of our people.  We cannot delay such an assessment because it must be remembered that local government constitutes real government in which there is real participation by local communities.  I suggest to the Minister for the Environment present that he consider setting up such a commission with appropriate terms of reference to report within, say, the next year and a half to two years and then let us hold meaningful local government elections.  I see no point in proceeding with local government elections unless there is seen to be real power in the authorities to be elected.  Their financial autonomy has been taken from them by legislation passed through this House and, without such financial autonomy, they have no power.</P>

      <P>Deputy Molloy knows full well, as a former Minister for Local Government who performed adequately in that capacity, that there is need for reform and restructuring in this area.  It is up to all politicians on both sides of the House to act responsibly in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to constituency redivision and the number of Deputies representing the people, I do not think population should be the sole criterion in establishing the number of representatives.  Representing people of an urban constituency&mdash;where the mass of people are closer together&mdash;is much easier than endeavouring to serve and represent a rural constituency.  With due respect to Deputies who represent rural constituencies I would hate to think that the people of west, south-east, south-west or wherever, where in some counties there tends to be a dwindling population, would see themselves losing representation because their population was declining.  We and all future commissions should bear that fact in mind.  I hope the system of independent commissions will continue.  But <Col N="889" /> perhaps their terms of reference should be debated in this House rather than being decided by any individual Minister for the Environment or by the Cabinet of the day.</P>
    <P>For future reference it might not be a bad idea to consider the single seat transferable vote, which was mooted way back in the late fifties or some time in the sixties.  It was known as the Norton amendment but was rejected by the Government of the day.  As we move into a period of economic instability and the difficulties experienced by Governments endeavouring to reshape and change what has been part and parcel of a scene, we are also moving into a period of greater instability of government.  Perhaps the single rather than the multi-seat would be preferable in this respect because there is a real element of messengerism with regard to public representatives' duties.</P>
    <P>I am a new Deputy in this House.  I am beginning to realise that the amount of time one has to spend on the nitty-gritty of constituency work prevents one from properly informing oneself on legislation. Neither does it permit us to have the input we would like to have in legislation passing through this House.  The single seat transferable vote situation might not necessarily achieve that goal.  Nonetheless it would afford a Deputy an opportunity of dealing with constituency work, knowing that there were not two or three others endeavouring to deal with the same problem.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  At least I hope I shall have the opportunity of facing another general election in four years' time in a constituency that will be unchanged.  I am not making any predictions as to whether or not I shall be successful but I should prefer to fight my seat on that basis rather than in a reformed constituency.</P>

      <P>Basically this Bill is a rubber-stamping exercise apart from one minor change in respect of proposals for the various constituencies throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now have a stable Government with a working majority in this House.  However, <Col N="890" /> we might cast our minds back for a moment to the situation which arose both in June 1981, after that general election and again after the 1982 February general election when this country was left in the most unsatisfactory position of having no clear party or parties who could form a majority Government in their own right. At those times we had the spectacle of the various leaders, in order to try and form a Government, seeking the support of various other Members of the House who were either aligned to smaller parties or were not aligned to any party.  This is something to be avoided as far as possible at any time in the future.  The situation that arose on both those occasions did not do this country any good and its results are still felt by the public and by the politicians.  The instability which arose at that time is only now beginning to be overcome.</P>
    <P>With respect to the individuals who seemingly held the balance of power, they were able to get for their constituencies and possibly for themselves and others, benefits which they were undoubtedly entitled to seek.  However, the elections at those times did not produce the best for the electorate or for the country.  When the people were voting I do not think they were recording their preference for a situation in which they did not know how long the Government would be able to carry on.</P>
    <P>During a general election the people must have confidence that the Government whom they will elect will be able to carry on for a substantial period.  I do not think any man or woman in the country wants to throw the nation back into an election once every six or eight months, with all Deputies running around their constituencies trying to ensure that they will get re-elected.</P>
    <P>My one reservation about the Bill is that I do not know whether it will avoid a recurrence of that situation.  Everyone is entitled to go forward for election and to be elected, but I hope we can avoid the situation that arose on those two occasions.  On those occasions people did not vote for an unstable period of government, particularly when it is so necessary that a Government would have <Col N="891" /> a clear working majority to be able to carry their policies through.  One may not agree with all the actions of a Government or with all the legislation they introduce and get enacted, but we do not need to have too frequent elections.  We do not want to have a situation when we have our people wondering if the Government will get through a division that night with the possibility of the nation being thrown back into another general election.  What happened on the two occassion I have been speaking about caused damage to the country at a time when firm, stable government was needed.  We were left with the position that neither of the major groupings in the House could command a majority.  A Government should be able to govern for a specified term and not be at the mercy of people who may change overnight like the wind.  Such a situation is to be deplored.</P>
    <P>In regard to multi-seat constituencies, Deputies, particularly those from rural Ireland, have the onerous task of driving for miles and miles at weekends to meet their constituents and to provide clinics. People may be more concerned because they have not received something they are entitled to than with what is happening in this House.  The reforms the Minister has in hand will mean that instead of people having to go to TDs to try to get what they are entitled to, instead of the needless telephone calls and letter writing, the system will be improved. When people apply for what they are entitled to it will come to them automatically and Deputies will be able to devote more time to consideration of legislation and to the sorting out of other difficulties.  Five Deputies in a multi-seat constituency at the moment may write to the Department about a particular case and delays occur.  I must say that from the Coalition point of view my constituency can be regarded as No. 1 in the country and I hope it will remain like that.  The Minister should bear in mind that we should be given some kind of assurance that in future we will not be left in an unstable political position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the second occasion on which a Bill to revise Dáil constituencies has been based on the recommendations of an independent commission.  It could be said to mark the final break with the previous system when preparation of a scheme of constituencies rested with a Government Minister.  While that system prevailed, debates on constituency revision Bills were marked by a certain rancour and bitterness and by charges of gerrymandering and malpractices. Whether these charges were justified in every case is, to a great extent, immaterial. What should concern us is that these debates were disedifying and tended to damage the standing of this Assembly in the eyes of the people.  I think we can rejoice in the fact that all this is now part of history and that we are tackling the delicate job of constituency revision in a more sensible and dignified manner.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference given to the commission are identical with those given to the commission which advised on the constituencies in 1980, with the addition of a guideline that, in view of the short time since the last revision, they should take account of the desirability of effecting minimum changes.  I think it would be generally agreed that this guideline is a very appropriate one.</P>
      <P>I was glad to hear Deputy Wilson welcoming the increase in the rural population. I fully agree with him because for years there was a sad decline in that population. I am sure Deputy Molloy will agree that we were all concerned about that decline and that we welcome the increase in the rural population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Continuity of representation is an important one in a democratic system.  It is proper that an elected representative at the end of his term of office, should be required to give an account of his stewardship to the people who originally elected him.  We may all have our own views as to what other conditions might have been included and how the existing guidelines might be strengthened or varied. It seems to me that present guidelines have achieved a high level of acceptance and, above all they have stood up to the test.  The constituencies recommended in 1980 have given fair representation <Col N="893" /> to the various strands of opinion and, despite misgivings expressed in certain quarters, have enabled Governments to be elected and to function.</P>
    <P>In my opening statement, I drew attention to the fact that in this revision the percentage variation from the national average of population per Deputy, the &ldquo;tolerance&rdquo; as it has been called, is somewhat wider than in recent revisions.  The commission discuss this aspect in chapter 4 of their report.  They point out that no tolerance level has been laid down by the courts and they quote from the Supreme Court decision in 1961 which indicated that the test of constitutionality must be whether &ldquo;failure to maintain the ratio between the number of Members for each constituency and the population of each constituency involves such a divergence as to make it clear that the Oireachas has not carried out the intention of the relevant sub-clause.&rdquo; I doubt if anybody could maintain that the intentions of the Constitution are not being given effect to in the present instance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly mentioned that Deputy Tully raised the membership to the present figure of 166.  This is not correct.  Membership was not raised to 166 until the 1980 revision brought in by the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Barrett. Deputy Tully's Bill fixed 148 to be the maximum allowed.  There seems to be an acceptance in the terms of the total membership of the House that its present numbers are adequate to represent the people and that we could even accept a higher tolerance level to maintain the numbers at their present figures.</P>
    <P>Deputy Durkan mentioned that Deputies are much maligned and that there does not seem to be an appreciation of the work and hours which public representatives put in serving their constituents, contributing and preparing for debates in this House.  I agree with the Deputy, and the people must know at this stage and they have their own methods of ensuring that Deputies work hard on their behalf.  I do not know any public representative in this House who would be re-elected unless he was able to account for his stewardship at election <Col N="894" /> time and can stand before the people on the basis of his record.  The Welsh have an expression: never forget from whence you came.  If you do that in politics the people will allow you very quickly to forget from where you came.  There is a serious responsibility on all politicians to work on behalf of their constituents and in this House.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies mentioned the desirability of having single member constituencies with a single transferable vote system.  I wish to remind them that our Constitution requires that no constituency shall have less than three seats and the House will recall that on two previous occasions, when there was an attempt to change this provision, it was rejected by the people in referenda.  I do not think there is any evidence that there is a majority in favour of this move at present and my party feel it would not be a desirable step.</P>
    <P>Certain references have been made within the rules laid down by the Ceann Comhairle at the opening of this debate to the question of local elections.  I am conscious of a need for reorganisation of the local government system so that local authorities will be able to respond more fully to the challenges presented by the social and economic changes of recent decades.  This reform of the existing system is desirable, especially in Dublin, where the development of the city and surrounding areas has taken place without corresponding development in local government structures.  My aim is to identify ways of increasing efficiency in the provision of public services and encouraging a degree of public participation in local government.  I am having the various options for reorganisation examined at present and I can assure the House that there will be no avoidable delay in bringing forward proposals in this area. In reply to Deputy Dowling, who suggested a commission on local government reform, the time is long overdue for action rather than commissions or inquiries because I have all the evidence needed in Green and White Papers on local government reform in the Custom House.  All the research has been done in relation to what is necessary.</P>

      <P>Yes, and what did the Deputy do about it in all those years?  On the overall membership of the Dáil, the population as ascertained at the 1981 Census would justify a Dáil membership of up to 172 Deputies.  In setting up the commission, the Government considered that the total figure should be set at a somewhat lower level and specified 168 as the maximum number the Commission could recommend.  In fact, the commission recommended 166 which is the same as the existing number.  At previous revision the Oireachtas tended to go for the maximum number permitted by the Constitution. This approach was understandable in a situation of declining population but a rather different attitude would now be appropriate in the light of a substantial and continuing increase in population.  In this we must aim at the golden mean and keep a reasonable limit on the total number of Deputies while ensuring that the number is sufficient to provide an effective Government and Opposition.  On the Government side there must be a wide choice of talent to fill posts of Ministers and Ministers of State with an adequate reserve on the backbenches; on the other side, the numbers on the front and back benches must be sufficient to provide effective opposition.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in my opening remarks, this Bill constitutes a revision of constituencies within the meaning of Article 16.2 of the Constitution and is intended to fulfil the constitutional obligation on the Oireachtas to revise the constituencies at least once in every 12 years.  By means of the Bill the Oireachtas is being asked not just to accept the changes proposed but to approve the entire scheme of constituencies.  The view of this side of the House is that we should accept in full the recommendations of the Commission and I recommend accordingly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1973 or 1974, when I was Fianna Fáil front bench spokesman on Local Government, I participated in a very acrimonious debate on a very blatant attempt being proposed to gerrymander the constituencies in the form of a Bill which was brought forward by the Coalition Government at that time.  I took very strong exception to the gerrymandering on the part of the Coalition Government and took steps to ensure that my party would adopt as a very firm policy a proposal that any revision of constituencies which might be required during the term of any future Fianna Fáil Government would be done by an independent electoral commission.  I am very pleased that when my party succeeded in getting back into Government they implemented that commitment and the revisions which have taken place since then have been carried out by an independent electoral commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The adoption of that policy by Fianna Fáil at that time has resulted in this Bill passing through the House without the acrimonious debate which we had on that occasion to ensure that the blatant gerrymandering which was being attempted by the Government was being exposed.  We had to go to great lengths to ensure that the country's attention was drawn to the measures which the Government were proposing.  Subsequent events showed that the attempt was far too blatant and far too deliberate, so much so that the electorate revolted against that Government. There was a massive swing against them which decimated them in the subsequent election.  Now that we have established that these decisions, sensitive though they may be to sitting Deputies, are to be undertaken by a group other than the Government of the day, Fianna Fáil can claim to have made a major contribution to developments in this <Col N="897" /> area.  We accept the recommendations of this commission, recognising that their terms of reference imposed a rigid inhibition on them in regard to whatever proposals they might make.</P>
    <P>I express my thanks to the commission for the work they have done but in future revisions, the terms of reference should be such as to ensure that results will not bring about a situation where five-seat constituencies are comprised of very large rural areas.  The composition of any future commission must include people with experience of rural Ireland, of the work of a rural Deputy and of the almost unbearable burden imposed on a Deputy in a five-seat rural constituency.  There are now seven five-seat constituencies and these are largely in rural areas where Deputies in order to be faithful to their constituents must travel up to 150 miles at times.  In my own constituency a return journey quite often involves travelling 160 miles because some parts of the constituency are up to 80 miles from my house.  This is very difficult especially in a constituency which contains so many inhabited islands.</P>
    <P>I am not making any special plea in my own case but I am merely emphasising one aspect to which future commissions should give serious consideration.  I am not attaching any blame to the commission when I point to that serious flaw in the overall strategy.  They acted within the terms of reference laid down for them but it is impractical to expect a Deputy to provide adequate service in a constituency which stretches for up to 100 miles apart in different areas.  Any future commission must have regard to the difficulties encountered by a rural Deputy in a large constituency.  They must have regard to the amount of time available to a Deputy who has to attend this House for three days out of seven, who must travel a long journey to be here and who, shortly after his long journey home, must set out on other long journeys in order to service his vast constituency.  We are accepting the proposals of the commission on this occasion but whoever is laying down the terms of reference for any future commission must ensure that they <Col N="898" /> are not forced to make recommendations that include five-seat constituencies in large, thinly-populated rural areas. Fianna Fáil have succeeded in removing the whole area of constituency revision from acrimony and heated debate.  We may have arrived at the stage where we may consider a more broadly-based commission for the next occasion on which we are asking people to consider these matters and to make recommendations to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is entitled to make his remarks in relation to the difficulties experienced by Deputies in five-seat constituencies, particularly in rural areas, but I would remind him that the terms of references suggest that larger-seat constituencies should be in urban areas so far as possible.  In fact most of the five-seaters are in city areas apart for a certain number of the natural five-seaters, one of which obviously would be County Kildare.  Galway as a city has a large population but I take the Deputy's point.</P>
      <P>I accept that we have a wise and mature system now in relation to the revision of Dáil constituencies.  Any system, political or otherwise, needs to be subject to checks and balances, irrespective of what party are in power.  This ensures that fair play is maintained at all times and that changes are made not for party political gain but in the best interest of representation on behalf of the people.</P>
      <P>I was hoping that acrimony would be absent from this debate.  We have moved on from the type of debate that was known in the sixties and seventies.  We will allow the people to judge the development of the electoral system.  I do not think Deputy Molloy's predecessors were actually saints in regard to the revision of constituencies.  If there is any accusation to be made against any predecessor of mine from the Coalition side in so far as gerrymandering is concerned, I can only say that he would have found the files well read and thumbed through by his predecessors.  I must refute the Deputy's suggestion that Fianna Fáil saw the light after attempted gerrymandering by Coalition Ministers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I had been remarking on the fact that in the past ten years we have had a doubling of the level of serious crime.  The response we have put forward as a community has been broadly to expand the crime-fighting industry.  In the past ten years, which is a relatively short time, the number of gardaí has increased from just over 8,000 to 11,500.  That represents about one garda for every 80 families.  It is a level of policing that is extremely high by international standards.  The corresponding figures that I have been able to get refer to Britain where the density to policing is about 50 per cent less than is the case here.  Equally, there has been a massive increase in the number of prison officers in that time &mdash; an increase from 400 to 1,600.  This brings us to a situation of having at least a one-to-one ratio as between prison officers and prisoners. Likewise, there has been a significant increase in the level of staffing of the Department of Justice &mdash; from 200 to almost 700.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we consider that expansion in the crime-fighting industry and realise that we have not succeeded in containing <Col N="900" /> the growth of crime, there is a natural tendency on the part of the public to take the easy response of saying that what is wrong is that the powers of the various persons involved on the crime-fighting industry are not adequate and, equally, to say that there is a need for longer prison sentences and for more manpower to fight crime.</P>
    <P>We must step back and not rush headlong along that road of throwing more State resources and manpower towards solving the problem of crime in that narrow fashion.  This whole structure is designed to help the community to come to terms with the problem of extreme anti-social behaviour.  The tendency to compartmentalise that problem, to push it away from the community in general and make it the business of the prison officers, probation officers and the Garda is not healthy.  It is a wrong response to a problem that has deeper sources and deserves from the community in general more effort than simply putting it aside for treatment by specialist forces.  The tendency of the public to react in that way to the growth of crime and to push it towards the Garda and expand the forces of law enforcement has been consolidated by the growing aloofness from the public of the persons involved in fighting crime.  No doubt that is a result of the Garda moving into cars and using sophisticated equipment, but it has in some cases been welcomed by persons involved in fighting crime.  The courts almost pride themselves on their distance from the community generally, and that is not healthy.</P>
    <P>One reason why are we have evolved a narrowly-based response to crime comes out in a statement that I read in the recently published discussion paper on community policing from the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors.  The statement says that there is almost a total absence of any statistical information which provides a relationship between an analysis of crime and community needs and problems.  It says that the annual crime reports provide only a very rough guideline to the overall extent of crime reported to the Garda.  There is no attempt to analyse the figures into when <Col N="901" /> and where crime was committed in the cities; neither do the reports attempt to provide any answer to questions such as: how does the nature of the environment affect the location of crime?  Does the positioning of amenities in the cities dictate where crime occurs?  Does the amenity create the stimuli or the increased criminal opportunity around it?  In other words, why and by whom is crime being committed?  Statistical data at present does not provide answers.  Therefore, it is obvious that the first step for the Garda is to set about compiling this information. The lack of that sort of information to which the Garda themselves refer contributes greatly to the narrow way in which we respond to crime and to dealing with the problem.</P>
    <P>I welcome what I believe are the flickerings of a new response to the problem of crime from the Garda and from the Department of Justice.  Very sincerely I welcome the attempt by the present Minister for Justice to bring in an alternative to prison sentencing.  The sheer cost of keeping a person for a year in prison is one reason for that.  The all-in cost, not just the cost of maintenance, can be reckoned at about £30,000 per year.  That is a massive amount of money and on those very narrow economic grounds there is adequate reason for looking for alternatives to prison.  That is why we must welcome the move to introduce community service orders and to bring in the possibility of community service instead of imprisonment for suitable offenders.  However, some people have responded to that initiative by pointing to the difficulties involved and asking who will oversee it, again betraying a tendency to want to package this alternative approach to crime and push it from the community.</P>
    <P>We must consider different ways of dealing with criminal offenders.  I would like to see the Minister for Justice when dealing with the possibility of community service orders inviting youth organisations, who only this week have shown their commitment to improving the plight of youth, to see whether they can facilitate young offenders and get them <Col N="902" /> involved in useful work and services.  The Minister must go further along the path of alternatives to prison.  In my constituency there is an ordinary house on an ordinary street where people who are referred from the courts are taken in and given a good environment in which to live.  They are not held there under force but are given the opportunity to become involved in training and various activities. Such a response from community groups should be welcomed and backed by funding from Government.  It is not just a simple call for more money.  We can afford to put more money in that direction when we realise the cost of the alternative of prision.  The Minister should pilot other alternatives.  In Britain the idea of week-end military type training for young offenders has been tried. Maybe that is not a correct response but it is worth looking at and perhaps it could be piloted here in a small way.</P>
    <P>It is heartening to see the way in which the Garda organisation and the prison service are being examined.  There is no doubt that there are widespread public misgivings about the training, recruitment and organisation of the Garda as being the best possible to handle the growth of crime.  Deputy Harney spoke in this debate about the deficiencies that appear to be present in the training of the Garda to match them to the tasks that they face.  Apart from improving the organisation and management of the Garda and perhaps looking at the possibility of recruiting for specialist purposes people who have specialist training, it is important that at last there is recognition within the Garda that the growth away from the community that has occurred over the years has been unwelcome.  It is the community who are in the front line in dealing with crime.  They are first and foremost affected.  We must give the community some effective way of containing the problem.</P>
    <P>I welcome the initiative taken by the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors in publishing their views on a scheme for community policing.  The idea is good, but I am worried about some of the changes in the way the police are organised which might pass as community <Col N="903" /> policing.  In particular I feel that a garda at every street corner who would during the course of the year call on the various houses in the street is not the essence of community policing.  It seems much more like a recipe for saturation policing and further growth in police numbers.  The essential feature of community policing is to get the community involved at neighbourhood level.</P>
    <P>I would take some small issue with the emphasis of the report of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors on community policing.  It seems to emphasise involvement at a very high level in the community, namely at local authority and health board level.  The need is rather to push it down to the man in the street and to involve him in an active way in being aware of crime, of what can be done and how to deal with offenders. With those small reservations, I welcome the attention the association are giving to the matter of bringing the community into the job of policing.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, in this Bill we are dealing with only a small part of the overall problem of dealing with crime.  To draw an analogy from the health area, we are probably dealing with the procedure of surgery which, while it is important, is only a very small part of health care.  In the same way, the provisions being considered today are only the surgery end of dealing with the problem of crime.  I do not intend to devote my speech to lamenting what other things might be done on another day.  I know this Minister is committed to finding better responses to the problem of crime.</P>
    <P>There are many features of the Bill which I welcome.  The provisions with regard to sentencing and the procedures in court are worthy of support.  The idea of sentencing for crimes committed while on bail is welcome.  The provision to make it an offence to skip bail without reasonable explanation, to increase the sentence for use of firearms and the provisions regarding majority verdicts in the courts are to be welcomed.  The Bill has responded to the growing problem, particularly in Dublin, of the unauthorised taking of motor vehicles.  The offence <Col N="904" /> is being made a more serious one and the Garda will be given new powers of detention in relation to such offences. For many years the taking of a vehicle was considered a minor crime because one could not prove the people responsible meant to permanently deprive the owner of the vehicle.  This was an unfortunate anomaly and the public could not understand it.  The persons who took the cars were a serious danger to the community when engaged in joy-riding.  The change here is welcome.  In the area of trial procedures the need to present an alibi will have to be notified to the courts in advance.  The accused person will no longer be able to make a statement in court unless he is willing to go on oath and be open to cross-examination.  This is a sensible change.  In many of the areas the changes proposed are more remarkable for the need to enact them than for their novelty.  Most people would have thought many of the changes were already in our laws.  It is probably a testimony to the length of time since there has been a proper re-examination of the criminal justice system that we have had to enact the changes at this stage.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with the area where I believe there will be some contention, namely, the new powers relating to detention and relating to inference from silence of a person in detention.  The aim of the proposals is to raise the probability of detection and of conviction.  They are at the heart of the Bill.  Obviously we recognise they are only part of what is involved in fighting crime but it is important that we make the possibility of detection by the Garda more likely.</P>
    <P>With regard to inference, as I understand it, the change here permits inference to be drawn only if the judge so directs from the silence of a person taken into the Garda station where subsequently explanations were offered in his defence.  In other words, there is the protection there that the person has to rely on explanations in his defence later on because he did not afford them at an early stage when interrogated by the Garda.  I understood from the Minister's speech that already there is the power to draw an inference from silence.  The Minister <Col N="905" /> said: &ldquo;An inference can be drawn from silence in the face of something said in his presence about the conduct in respect of which he is charged.&rdquo;  I do not know the legal interpretation of the word &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; but, as a layman, I would have interpreted it to mean that if reasonable questions were put to the accused about his movements and about incriminating evidence found in his possession he would be obliged to provide an answer or else some inferences could be drawn.</P>
    <P>I can accept the strengthening of this provision as envisaged in sections 17 and 18 to make him account for marks or for his presence in a certain place.  However, as I understand it, section 16 envisages that replies will be required to any questions regardless of whether they refer to circumstantial evidence if those questions are put by the Garda.  It seems to me we are taking a large step from merely asking an accused person to account for circumstantial evidence to almost requiring him to present his entire case for the defence. To require such a change may be going too far in that area.  I should like some restrictions on that section.</P>
    <P>The Minister pointed out that the protection involved to prevent abuse of section 16 is that the trial judge will decide when inference is proper so that there will not be an uncontrolled possibility for the court to draw inferences from the silence of the accused.  However, I am rather worried about this total reliance on the trial judge because presumably he is there only to interpret what the law says.  Unless we tighten up the law it would be open for the prosecution at least to argue before a court that all kinds of inferences could be drawn from the silence of a person in custody.  It is up to legislators to tie down what is a proper case for inference rather than to leave it entirely to the discretion of the judge.</P>
    <P>The Minister also pointed out that there is protection in the fact that the accused will have been warned.  I agree that gives some protection.  However, while those protections may extend to 99 per cent of the cases, it is up to the legislators to try to provide a water-tight law with as little as possible reliance on discretion and as little as possible cause <Col N="906" /> for error to be made.  In principle, I feel the full case for the defence should not require to be presented at the interrogation stage.  I am all the more worried about that since at that stage there will not be a guarantee that the person in detention will have spoken with a solicitor. We are putting a serious onus upon the person in detention to be well informed of his legal rights.</P>
    <P>The changes involved in section 15 will have much less effect in bringing people to justice, certainly in the case of the godfathers whom we are trying to get at with the powers envisaged here.  Rather, the powers envisaged here will have the greatest impact on the least articulate and they are not the most serious menace. Because of their lack of knowledge and expertise they may be confused into thinking silence is their best defence or they may be trying to protect others while they themselves are in detention in a very unfamiliar setting.  Are the extra powers given really necessary to get after the godfathers?  Should we not go for a much more restricted onus on persons to answer questions?  Likewise, the right to draw inferences should be restricted, meeting persons in a particular place, certain marks on clothing, the possession of certain property, the carrying of weapons and so on.  That would go a long way to allaying fears about any encroachment on the rights of vulnerable and inarticulate people.</P>
    <P>On the question of detention, a very novel change is envisaged.  If we are going to be serious about the detection of crime, detention must be available in the case of serious offences.  The Garda should not be asked to engage in a proper investigation of crime if they cannot detain people in pursuit of their inquiries. Coupled with a certain restricted onus on persons in detention to answer questions, the right to search a person, or property, or house, or car should be given to the Garda.  Here I would like to quote from the O'Brian Report published some years ago: &ldquo;We believe that most people who go to Garda stations to assist police in their inquiries do so under the misapprehension that they have no other choice than to do so&rdquo;.  This practice has been <Col N="907" /> condoned and has as a result become an established law.  What we are doing here is not so much introducing a new practice in investigation to regularise something that is already going on and, far from encroaching on peoples' rights, we may be depriving the vulnerable and inarticulate of rights of which they are not aware and have not been receiving.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to see this as something new.  It is probably introducing some measure of regulation and control of a practice that has been going on.  It is probably true to say that only the more shrewd criminals know their rights and are able to avoid being detained against their wishes.  The objections to detention are twofold.  One reason for detention was to compel attendance at court.  We have now breached that principle.  The case was also made that there is an inviolable right to silence on the part of persons being detained.  I do not believe it is acceptable that in support of principles like this, we should reach the situation, to which the Minister referred, in which information given voluntarily can become inadmissable in court.  That would be ridiculous.  It is equally ridiculous to suggest that a suspect must be granted the right to leave the Garda station and be informed of his right to do so.  That is a foolish provision if we are serious about giving the investigation of crime serious consideration.  The right to silence and the right not to be deprived of liberty are not absolute and there is a duty on all of us to assist and co-operate with the Garda in the reasonable pursuit of their investigation into crime.  Detention and the answering of certain questions are reasonable methods of helping investigation in our present difficult circumstances.</P>
    <P>In passing, we must recognise that some people when detained might be in a state in which they could not be questioned at all.  They might be under the influence of alcohol or drugs.  From that point of view I welcome the possibility of interrupting the period of detention.  In principle I support the idea of detention but we must ensure it is used only where it is justified as otherwise there might be <Col N="908" /> a danger of encroaching on peoples' rights.  The Minister referred to the double check to ensure that the Garda are acting reasonably in pursuit of their investigation into serious crime.  That is to be decided by the individual garda and the officer in charge of the station.  There will be a limit of six hours' detention no matter how many crimes are being investigated. The third protection is that the accused be informed of his right to have reasonable access to a solicitor and, fourthly, a document on his rights will be presented to the person being detained and, if necessary, explained to him.</P>
    <P>I accept there is a fair degree of protection built into the Bill but I am not entirely satisifed.  It is our duty as legislators not to tie down the Garda in pursuit of their investigations when a person is being detained.  There must, of course, be a reasonable ground for detention and the criteria should be spelled out clearly in the Bill.  What is reasonable should be clearly stated and not left vague as it now is.</P>
    <P>Equally, the Bill should be amended to impose upon the Garda, both the detaining garda and the officer in charge, the duty to write down the offence in which the person is believed to be involved and also the reasonable grounds for bringing in that person.  I do not believe that any complaints procedure can operate properly unless we have such a written account of why a person was brought in during the course of an investigation. Not only are these changes needed to restrict the use of that right but also so that there will be a proper record if complaints subsequently arise.</P>
    <P>I share some public concern that there is not a schedule of serious offences published in the Bill where the power of detention may be used.  It has been pointed out that some quite minor offences could fall into the category of offences having a maximum five-year penalty. An aggravated version of a certain offence might carry a maximum penalty of five years and the Garda might detain a person for a much more minor offence on these grounds.  There is a possible danger of a much more widespread use of this detention power than the Dáil <Col N="909" /> would like to give to the Garda.  The inclusion of a schedule of serious offences would be a more sensible way to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister said there would not be a possibility of rolling one six-hour period into another in relation to different offences in which a person was believed to be involved.  He also said, however, that a person could be detained if he were believed to be involved in another serious offence.  I do not know how to square those two points.  It is unthinkable that a garda would not be able to take in a person for a new serious offence in which he was involved.  The only way to ensure that there is not abuse is to insist that the Garda write down the offence for which they are holding a person and the grounds on which the person was brought in. Later complaints could then be properly investigated with some documentary evidence.</P>
    <P>Another area in relation to which I have some reservations stems directly from points made in the Ó Briain Report. The report states quite clearly that in some cases the Garda have not always cautioned a person of his rights.  Equally it was pointed out that the Garda have in some cases been less than wholehearted in their co-operation in granting access to a solicitor.  Ó Briain points out that 80 per cent of crimes are being solved by confessions and this indicates a reluctance by the Garda to get evidence by other methods.  The fact that Ó Briain has highlighted the improper application of protections which are supposed to exist already is a worrying feature.  We must view with some misgivings the indications in the Ó Briain Report that these procedures are not being followed rigorously.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that an amended document of rights will be handed to a detained person and explained if necessary, but this should be built into the Act and made a statutory requirement.  Where inference is drawn from silence there is a statutory requirement, but it should also be required statutorily that anyone detained should be presented with a statement of rights.</P>
    <P>I am sympathetic towards Ó Briain's recommendations on the question of <Col N="910" /> detention.  He suggested that a custodial guardian should be assigned from among the Gardaí in the station where the person is detained who would be given the explicit job of protecting the rights of the person being detained and would have the power to record anything that was done or any reason he had to believe that a person was not getting his proper rights. He would record this in a log book kept in the station.  Those ideas seem very reasonable and ought to be considered. Ó Briain also suggested that a central agency should be set up so that the whereabouts of any person detained would be available to members of the family or a lawyer.  That is a sensible idea which should be enshrined in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Another point worthy of consideration is that a person should be questioned only if he has had access to a legal adviser or, if not, where he consents to be questioned. These are sensible protections which do not appear to be in this Bill. Perhaps the Minister would say in his reply whether these matters could be dealt with by some other means, such as ministerial order.  I would prefer to see provisions made in the Bill, if possible.</P>
    <P>Ó Briain also called for the appointment of a panel of duty solicitors who would be present at questioning.  I sympathise with the Minister in not giving the right to a panel of duty solicitors to attend as observers at an interrogation.  That would probably go too far and undermine the whole usefulness of interrogation. However, the right to consult with a solicitor should be more firmly enshrined and some question should be raised in the Minister's mind as to whether the Garda are co-operating wholeheartedly in this matter.  Action should be taken to ensure that in future there is more wholehearted co-operation, if the findings of Judge O Briain are accurate.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been criticised in public for failing to give the Minister the authority to lay down the conditions under which a person would be questioned when in detention.  If that is the case&mdash;I am no legal expert&mdash;those conditions should be laid down.  The Minister should be able to lay before the House an order specifying <Col N="911" /> the way in which a person detained should be dealt with while in custody.  In the future if it is found that unforeseen abuses are creeping into the detention procedures the Minister should be able to bring before the House proposals to change the way people are being dealt with without amending the Bill.  I imagine such a power could be built into section 26 which gives the Minister the right to order tape recording.  He should be able to order wider changes if he deems them necessary.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  There are many valuable provisions in it but I would like the Minister to tighten up on the two novel and contentious powers being introduced.  He should tighten up on when it is reasonable to detain a person and for what offences.  There should be more explicit protection there and a clearer statement in the Bill as to what is deemed reasonable.  In the case of inference from silence there should be a tighter statement in the Bill of when inference can properly be drawn.  I would like this confined to inference being drawn from the person's silence if he is asked questions which are backed by circumstantial evidence such as his presence at the scene of the crime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is long overdue particulary when it is considered that its main provisions were almost ready for publication before the last Government left office.  I appreciate that a Bill like this will have far-reaching effects and because of that it is necessary that all aspects of it receive careful examination before being presented to the House.  I welcome the Bill and I believe its provisions will help to remove a number of weaknesses in the present system, weaknesses which have been exploited by law-breakers to the detriment of society and our citizens.  As was expected, the publication of the Bill led to a big number of objections and reservations from interested groups.  We should not have been surprised when criticism was voiced, particularly the critcism by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties. In the course of their objections that council indicated that they shared <Col N="912" /> the public concern at the disturbing levels of crime in our towns and cities but they went on to say that the strategy proposed in the Bill was illusory and dangerous. Their statement was contradictory.  On the one hand the council expressed serious concern at the escalating rate of violence, like many other interested groups, but on the other hand they criticised the provisions in the Bill which seek to deal with that problem.  We have had many statements in the House about the escalation in crime throughout the country. A little more thought and consideration for our citizens as they go about their daily lives should have been given by the council.</P>
      <P>I accept that some well-meaning people are concerned about some of the measures in the legislation.  They have expressed concern about what they see as a curtailment of civil liberties and an intrusion on the rights of individuals in so far as the Bill proposes to give many additional powers to the Garda before an arrest is made.  We would all like to live in a world where the freedom of the individual is not infringed upon, where a person would have the right to remain silent in the face of questioning by the Garda and that such a right would not remotely suggest that the individual had any involvement in any offence under investigation.  Unfortunately, we do not live in such a society and our experience in recent years bears that out.  It is a sad commentary that the Garda must be given these additional powers to fight the law breakers, a fight which the Garda have been losing for some time because of the absence of such powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effectiveness of the law depends on the ability to enforce it.  Some of the protections the existing system give an offender make enforcement virtually impossible in many cases.  As a Deputy representing a Dublin constituency &mdash; my colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Birmingham will agree with this view &mdash; I am only too well aware of the serious problems that face our community because of the rise in crimes of violence, vandalism, theft and the drug scourge. Drugs have become a major problem in all parts of the country but particularly in <Col N="913" /> Dublin.  There are too many no-go areas in Dublin where the Garda dare not enter because of the danger of coming under constant and fierce physical attack.  It is no longer considered safe for citizens to walk around our cities at a leisurely pace. That right of citizens should be protected. It is no longer possible to park one's car with any feeling of security in the city or suburban areas.</P>
    <P>In the course of his report on crime for 1982 the Garda Commissioner pointed out that the number of indictable offences recorded in Dublin was 59.2 per cent of the total number of crimes throughout the country.  The overall detection rate in 1982 was only 33.6 per cent or a little more than 3 per cent lower than 1981. During that same period more than 3,000 motor cars were stolen and a number of tragedies occurred, including death, when innocent people were hit by stolen cars which were driven by young people. We must consider those facts when considering the provisions of the Bill.  Some of the measures proposed could have been a little tougher.  I am aware that Members who make such statements are labelled as hardliners but I do not accept that.  A person who commits an offence should be punished and citizens should be able to go about their daily lives without fear of attack or damage to their property.  I am sure the House has the support of the vast majority of our people.  They want to see tough measures adopted and strong action taken by the Government to deal with the huge increase in crime.  Our people want to see action taken that will ensure greater safety and give them a feeling of greater security in their homes at night and during the day.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that the provisions of this Bill will not be brought into force until a complaints procedure, involving an assessment by an independent personal tribunal, has been established. I hope it will not be too long before such a decision is taken, whether by way of legislation or otherwise.  We all want action as far as law and order is concerned.</P>
    <P>Like many other Deputies &mdash; since the publication of this Bill &mdash; I have received <Col N="914" /> many submissions from interested groups, all of which, with the exception of that from the Association of Garda Sergeants amd Inspectors, have been critical of its provisions to some extent.  Many of them have been highly critical.  I should like to refer to one of the submissions in this category emanating from a number of eminent priests and nuns working in the Dublin area.  I have no doubt whatever that their reservations were expressed in all sincerity and their apprehension about the provisions of the Bill's challenge to the freedom of the individual quite sincere. I must also say to those good priests and nuns that we must also consider, with apprehension, the safety of the individual, of the ordinary citizen, who unfortunately has and is being threatened day in day out.</P>
    <P>There are also in our community substantial numbers of people who will abuse the rights of freedom bestowed on them to get their own way by stealing, vandalism or whatever.  I have always had the highest of respect for our Garda force. We can all be rightly proud of their contribution as law enforcers.  However, I do not dispute that probably there are a small number of men in the force whose standards may be somewhat lower than the acceptable norm.  Certainly it would be most unfortunate if such standards were put into practice in implementing some of the provisions of this Bill. Obviously such would lead to increased resentment of the Garda and have a counter-productive effect.  Therefore there is an onerous responsibility on the Garda Commissioner and his senior officers to ensure that this type of situation will not arise and to insist that the highest standards only will apply so far as all members of the force are concerned.  It has taken many years for the public to condition their minds to giving the co-operation they should to our Garda in enforcing our laws.  It is now generally accepted that the public do support our Garda to a large extent.  It would be a tragedy if a situation were to arise in the future &mdash; in the context of the increased powers being given the Garda &mdash; that might damage that support and co-operation <Col N="915" /> obtaining between the public and Garda.</P>
    <P>In the course of this debate I was most alarmed and concerned to hear Deputy Niall Andrews cite an experience in his constituency in the House, when he gave a very specific example and report on a certain case.  I sincerely hope the Commissioner will have that case investigated without delay.  Such a complaint is of a very serious nature, has been made in this House and received wide publicity. It is very necessary that, having investigated that complaint, the Commissioner should make his findings public.  That is necessary in order to be fair not alone to Deputy Niall Andrews but also to the Garda, because it is experiences such as these that spoil and destroy the image of law enforcement officers.</P>
    <P>I might say to the critics of some of the provisions of this Bill that whilst everybody has a right to feel concern about the possibility of abuse of those provisions it is also right that such provisions be provided in order to give greater security to various communities.  It is well known that in many flat complex areas of this city &mdash; where many of those people who criticised the provisions of the Bill work &mdash; local people are terrified by minority groups operating there.  Stolen cars are brought into such areas and burned night after night.  Of course the godfathers of crime are also very evident by their presence in such areas.</P>
    <P>I cannot see how the provisions will have any very serious effect on anybody except the wrongdoer, and it is to such people that these provisions are rightly directed.  With a Bill of this nature and size it is inevitable that considerable time will be spent on Committee Stage going into the various sections in greater detail. In this respect there are some sections to which I should like to refer briefly.  For example, section 5 restricts the powers of the Garda to search a person except where there is reasonable cause to expect that he or she may have concealed on their person a controlled drug or explosive substance.  I believe this restriction should not apply especially where a garda takes in a suspect, with reasonable suspicion <Col N="916" /> of an offence having been committed, such offender perhaps having some small items such as jewellery, cash, cheques or whatever hidden in their clothing.  In many cases one of the largest problems confronting the Garda is the absence of any real power to search for evidence.  We know a warrant can be obtained in respect of stolen property. But it is in the initial stages of investigation that searches for stolen goods are necessary.  In this respect the Minister should have extended the powers of section 5 to a greater degree to cover this aspect.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the increased penalty for the unauthorised taking of motor vehicles.  Almost 3,000 cars were stolen last year, some of which caused death to other roadusers.  In my constituency &mdash; and Minister of State, Deputy G. Birmingham is involved in this also &mdash; a great tragedy occurred in which a young husband was fatally injured by such a vehicle. At the time this happened feelings ran very high in the area.  I have no doubt but that those citizens on the north side of the city would very much support any steps taken that would punish and eventually eliminate, or certainly reduce, the number of stolen cars in this city.  It does constitute an enormous problem and, unfortunately, the Garda and the laws have not been at all successful to date. There is also the difficulty of the theft of cars by children who are under age.  Most of the cars stolen in this city are stolen for so called &ldquo;joy-riding&rdquo;.  Only last evening I attended a residents' association meeting at which that very issue was discussed. There was then raised the whole question of the wording or phrase &ldquo;joy-riding&rdquo;, when it was criticised and much condemned.  Where a car is stolen and where its driving involves a risk to life it cannot be described as &ldquo;joy-riding&rdquo;.  Perhaps this is a term that should be eliminated as far as publication of such escapades is concerned.</P>
    <P>The submission by the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors should be very carefully considered because it is very difficult for legislators, not having had practical experience of police work or the expertise involved in detection, to <Col N="917" /> decide fairly what is right, but we here have serious obligations to consider all submissions by experienced people such as the association I have referred to. Their report indicates great difficulties and problems even when some of the measures in the Bill are put into practice.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I urge the Minister to consider these submissions very carefully.  I am not for one moment suggesting that all these submissions should be accepted, but I express the hope that the Minister will give all submissions the consideration they deserve, particularly that from the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors.</P>
    <P>In this House we share the belief that the biggest curse to have hit this country in recent years has been that of drugs. Last year almost 1,600 people were charged under the Misuse of Drugs Act, an increase of 27 per cent on the previous year.  Using the same comparison, there was an increase of 56 per cent in the amount of drugs seized by the Garda. The amount of heroin seized in 1982 increased by a staggering 643 per cent from the previous year.  Dublin has been described as the drugs capital as far as trafficking is concerned.  This is highly serious because more and more foreigners are becoming involved in the drug scene in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Garda Commissioner's Report for 1982 indicates that a total of 69 non-nationals were charged with drug offences. They came from all parts of the world, Britain, America, Iraq, Thailand, Jamaica, Morocco and so on.  Entry to Ireland by non-nationals is very easy because the corridor between Britain and Ireland permits all travellers to enter Ireland without any great check.  This must be looked at very seriously by the Minister, particularly in view of recent commentaries that Dublin has become the capital for heroin and a passageway to other countries for very big drugs traffic.  The recent haul of heroin outside the fencing at Dublin Airport was a dreadful indictment of our security at the ports.  It is obvious that big drug interests have a number of contacts on the ground here who are prepared to take great risks. Young people are so desperate for a fix <Col N="918" /> that they will assault and rob to get the money required for drugs.  It is happening every day.  People are paying enormous sums of money for drugs.</P>
    <P>In the assault on drugs, education is a vital need, because parents would not recognise drugs if they saw them or the symptoms of drugs in their children.</P>
    <P>Therefore, strong laws are absolutely necessary, plus a very big education campaign involving all sections of the community. In recent times here drug pushers have been described as being worse than murderers.  Such statements are not made lightly when we consider the far reaching effects a drug pusher can have on young people.  It very often results in death.  The penalty for drug pushing, therefore, should be similar to that for murder, or perhaps more severe.  People involved in drug pushing should not be allowed to move freely among our people.</P>
    <P>We have had recent examples of how the courts deal with this.  We had two cases not long ago, the Preston case and the da Silva case.  Preston is a Dubliner and he was involved with cannabis pushing. As everyone appreciates, cannabis is much less serious than heroin, though I do not condone it &mdash; I am very critical of all drugs.  That young man received the maximum sentence of 14 years imprisonment, whereas the second party, a foreigner, received a suspended sentence and walked freely from our shores to return home.</P>
    <P>I regret that this should have happened because I am afraid it damages the image of our courts in the eyes of the people. Deputies do not wish to be critical of the judiciary but we are entitled to ask questions in regard to situations such as this. The same judge was involved in both cases.  In sentencing the first party he said he regretted that he could not impose a life sentence as drug importers were in the process of destroying an entire generation of young people.  He said he hoped that drug pushers would learn that those who destroy other lives would have their own lives destroyed.  The second judgment was therefore very strange in view of those comments.  I have heard it described as a scandal and a disgrace.  I believe that any action taken by the <Col N="919" /> Courts could not be tough enough.  We have a very serious problem on our hands, and if we do not move swiftly and strongly to eliminate that problem Ireland has a very difficult future ahead as far as our young people are concerned.</P>
    <P>In the fight against general crime, particularly vandalism in this city, parents should be playing their part, but unfortunately far too many parents do not have any feeling of responsibility for their children from a very early age.  It is extraordinary to find so many parents who have no idea where their children go at night, whom they are with or what they are doing.  Many parents do not even bother to inquire about these things. Unfortunately, today's society seems to dictate that parents are entitled to their own social activities to the extent that fewer questions are asked of and less responsibility shown towards their children. This attitude obviously has had a very serious effect on our society, and it is not surprising, therefore, that so many young people get themselves into trouble away from home at night.</P>
    <P>Parents will have to be taught to play a fuller part in accepting their responsibility to bring up their children properly. I do not know how this can be done because of the attitude of society in this era.  I suggest, however, that the onus for their children's crimes should be put firmly on parents when compensation becomes necessary.  Local authorities and the Government are paying millions of pounds annually for the damage to premises and injury to persons by vandals, by young children wandering in our streets at night without the slightest supervision from parents.</P>
    <P>I will refer briefly to the difficulties being experienced by young people today who have nothing to do particularly because of our high unemployment rate. There is the added tragedy that they have very little prospects of jobs in the future. I believe, therefore, that we should endeavour to create some form of State involvement, perhaps under the auspices of the Department of Defence, the Department of Education and the Department of the Environment, to put <Col N="920" /> young people who have nothing to do and who have very little prospects of getting early employment, to do something. It would provide very useful training, would get them off the streets and, most importantly, get them away from the difficult problems with which they would otherwise be confronted by having nothing to do and wandering around our streets.  It would also be good for their future wellbeing and would provide them with some form of training which could be used to their own advantage and would benefit the whole community in the future.</P>
    <P>Any legislation, no matter how thorough and good it may be, can only work with the support and co-operation of the people.  In recent years, many communities have built up some very fine local community organisations with first class community spirit.  This in turn has advanced facilities within their own areas for children, environmental improvements and many other activities.  However, community associations are, more and more, expressing serious concern about the rising wave of crime and vandalism in their areas and are becoming extremely impatient.  They are very anxious to help and to contribute in a positive way towards the elimination of these problems in their areas.  They are very committed to creating a better environment for themselves and their children in their own communities but they do not know how best they can contribute.</P>
    <P>In recent times we have seen the emergence of a number of vigilante groups in different communities.  They are well meaning and well intentioned but we all know they can cause new problems by taking the law into their own hands.  Such activities cannot be condoned, but, nevertheless, the time has come for some form of very active and definite co-operation between the local gardaí and residents.  It would be a very positive step, for instance, if the Minister had talks with senior Garda personnel to discuss how such co-operation could be brought about which would, obviously, also be of great assistance to the local gardaí.  There are community police forces working in some towns and cities <Col N="921" /> in Europe and it would be a very worthwhile exercise for us to seriously consider embarking on such an operation which, I am quite sure, would not only be of benefit to the authorities but would also be a tremendous morale booster, giving new confidence to our older citizens that something was being done to give them protection within their own areas and homes.</P>
    <P>I extend a welcome to section 24 of the Bill, which proposes to introduce majority verdicts in criminal proceedings.  This is a very important change, because we all know that intimidation of jurors takes place.  It is very disturbing and must be frustrating to the Garda that some decisions coming from our courts are so inconsistent.  I have already referred to a case concerning drugs.  Judges do not seem to be answerable to anybody, and I appeal to the Minister to consider this matter very carefully.  Everybody in authority must answer to somebody and, as far as the Judiciary are concerned, some system will have to be contrived which will make them answerable for the decisions they take in the courts.</P>
    <P>There must be no let up in the fight against crime.  If we need additional gardaí they should be provided irrespective of the cost, but they must also be properly equipped and fully trained to exercise the very difficult duties which they have to undertake.  It is a very sad reflection on our society and our laws when children of 15 and 16 years of age drive in stolen cars to a Garda station openly and deliberately taunting the gardaí to chase them and, having succeeded in doing that, battering and damaging the Garda patrol car.  In many cases a number of Garda cars have been put out of action on the same night.  It is unbelievable that this should take place, but it is an indication of how bad crime is in Dublin city.</P>
    <P>There are many different aspects of law breaking which are not confined to teenagers or young people.  It seems to be a way of life that it is oneupmanship if you can get away with something.  This is blatantly obvious in all sections of society.  For instance, in 1981 proceedings were taken against 51,000 motorists who <Col N="922" /> drove without proper insurance but only 27,000 were convicted.  This is an example of the type of problem which our police force face in bringing people to court and securing convictions.  I sincerely hope that as a result of this new legislation crime will substantially decrease.  If it is to be successful we may have the problem of inadequate prison facilities to house those sentenced under these new measures.  It is expected that these measures will result in more and more offenders being brought to court and, consequently we will have many more convictions.  We already have that problem, and recently I saw figures which indicated that every third person going into Mountjoy walked out the back entrance almost immediately because of overcrowding.  It is ludicrous to think that we now have a waiting list for Mountjoy. We must do something about it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods has already highlighted the inadequacies of our prison service, and the Minister must give high priority to this aspect if the Bill is to be successful. It is widely accepted that law and order have broken down, and the general public feel that the situation is grave enough to accept the strongest measures possible. For that reason many people welcome this Bill, but it needs the help of everyone if it is to work.  We fully support the Bill, and I wish the Minister every success in putting through this legislation, which I know will benefit everybody concerned. As far as law and order are concerned, there must be no political divide. As we all have the same aims and objectives we must work towards them.  I am particularly concerned to see that the ordinary citizen receives the protection of the law and the courts and, if this Bill helps towards achieving that, I will be very satisfied.  For that reason, I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Labour (Mr. G. Birmingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with a certain air of unreality that I contribute to this Bill.  It has been so long promised, and to find it is now on the floor of the House seems almost unreal.  Indeed, Deputy Brady began his contribution by saying that the draft of this Bill was <Col N="923" /> almost ready when the last Government left office.  In fact, if all the drafts of the Bill which have been referred to by successive Ministers for Justice and their apologists were to be found it would strain even the very efficient filing system that I am sure operates in St. Stephen's Green.  But the Minister is to be congratulated on bringing the legislation before the House after promises going back over a period of years.  It is likely to prove to be the most substantial piece of legislation to come before the Dáil in this session, indeed during the lifetime of this Dáil perhaps.</P>
      <P>The Bill has long-term implications for almost every section of society, ranging from the Garda at one extreme to those who are involved in crime at the other extreme, and of course to the general public.  For that reason it is important that it be debated fully both inside the House and outside it.  Some of those who have contributed to the debate already have referred to the statistics on the incidence of crime with special reference to the greater Dublin area.  I do not intend to repeat those statistics.  A number of Deputies have produced anecdotal evidence of the effect of crime.  Some of the cases are almost beyond description, but it is not my intention to add to the list since already in the debate the statistics have been put on the record.  However, it is worth commenting that this crime situation affects not only those who are its victims but also all those people living in an area in which crime has been committed and who live in fear of being the next victims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proper, then, that as legislators we debate what our response to this problem is to be.  Rather than concern ourselves with the question of sentencing, we must tackle the root causes of crime, and in that context there is not just one response.  It would be easy to suggest that a solution could be found by way of extra powers for the Garda, by longer sentences and so on, but that would be to identify only a part of the campaign and perhaps not even the most important part.  How often, for example, do we consider the motivation that leads to <Col N="924" /> crime?  Deputy Brady has referred to the problem of the unauthorised taking of mechanically-propelled vehicles.  Last evening the Deputy together with Deputy Bruton and myself attended a meeting at which this problem was one of the main items for discussion.  People at that meeting had harrowing stories to tell of the extent to which their daily lives have been interfered with by the driving at high speeds around small suburban estates of cars that have been stolen.  We must ask what leads 14- and 15-year olds to steal powerful cars and drive them at high speeds on busy suburban roads.  As Deputy Brady has indicated, this activity has led to a number of tragedies in our constituency.  The young people involved see this behaviour as an opportunity of securing attention from their peers and even from those in authority.  If we are to do anything about changing the outlook of those young people we require to do something more than simply provide for more gardaí and for tougher sentences. A concerted effort is required if we are to remove the motivation and the temptation that leads these young people into this activity in the first place.  Such effort will require the co-operation of different agencies and of the people involved in the various spheres of activity.  For instance, the area of housing policy is of relevance in this matter.  There is also the question of the provision of leisure and sports activities for young people, and of importance, too, is the question of the adequacy of our education system, of the curriculae available to young people.  In general, there is involved the whole question of the extent to which we create a society which offers those young people both promise and hope.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney commented that recently she had received a deputation from the National Youth Council who were anxious to illustrate the value of youth work, and who are making the case for greater State resources for that work. This form of activity has a role to play in the fight against crime, a fact that was recognised clearly by the group of Ministers of State who sat as a task force on the question of drug abuse.  I am glad to <Col N="925" /> say that it has been recognised by this Government in the most practical way possible.</P>
    <P>The House will recall that when we took office the Estimates for Public Expenditure for this year had been published. At that stage provision had been made for only a 1 per cent increase in funding for the Voluntary Youth Service. This Government considered that unsatisfactory and made extra funds available to that service to the extent that funding was increased this year by 36 per cent. The House will recall also that since then the Government have taken action to alter the terms of the scheme known as the Development Officers Scheme which was introduced four years ago.  Under the terms of that scheme the contracts of those youth workers around the country were to expire at the end of the year.  The Government considered that to be an intolerable situation and took the necessary steps to guarantee permanency of employment to the people concerned.  I welcome the fact that Deputy Haughey has identified this as one part of our response to a very serious situation.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that there is a balanced allocation of resources and effort as between the two related areas of law enforcement &mdash; the area that comes after the crime in terms of detection and so on and that area which comes before, that is, the area of prevention.  Crime levels depend not so much on the Department of Justice or on the courts or on the Garda, though all of those have a role to play, as on the whole range of Government activity.  We must create the proper social and environmental conditions in which people who wish to work have the opportunity of doing so.  At the same time, we must ensure that there are adequate leisure and recreational facilities for our young people.  We are spending huge sums of money on incarcerating people in prison.  It seems from those surveys that have been conducted in this regard that the public wish that situation to continue, but I do not know if they would be prepared to pay the extra taxation that would be involved in providing for a system in which much longer sentences were the norm.  We have arrived <Col N="926" /> at a situation where it is now more expensive to lock a person up in prison or in one of the other institutions than it would be to send him to a second level school or to university though of course such choice is not available to our Judiciary. They have not the alternatives of college or prison.  Of course, some extra alternatives are available to them.  The community service order legislation brought through the House by the Minister for Justice earlier in the session provides an additional alternative to prison which I am very happy to see coming into existence, and we hope it will become effective very quickly.</P>
    <P>While it is right at the beginning of any contribution here to say that everybody is involved in this fight against crime, it is not solely the responsibility of the Department of Justice and the Garda. There is no gainsaying the fact that the Garda are in the front line when it comes to fighting crime, and they have seen their role change over the years from being held by the community right across the board in the highest respect to where too many people now seem to regard them as fair game.  For example the number of woundings and other acts endangering the life of gardaí grew by over 70 per cent from 17 in 1981 to 29 in 1982.  About one-third of the acts of wounding or other endangerings of life recorded in the crime statistics were endured by members of the Garda force.  Those figures highlight the vulnerability of the Garda and the debt that we as a society owe them for their constant efforts on our behalf to afford us protection.  Thanks to the gradual adoption of a policy of putting more gardaí back on the beat, we hope that we will shortly see the effect of more gardaí involved in preventive activities in relation to crime and not simply reacting to incidents.</P>
    <P>At this stage it is worth mentioning the document produced last year, by the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors on the question of community policing.  Anyone who proposes to contribute to this debate and holds himself out as being seriously concerned about our response to the crime problem has a responsibility to consider the contents of <Col N="927" /> that document.  I am glad to see that it is being considered at the very highest level.  The Garda Commissioner announced in his introduction to the crime force: &ldquo;It is the duty of the force to redouble their efforts towards fostering good relations with the various groups in society as well as with the public generally so as to win their support and co-operation in the task of keeping the peace which is so vital to good order in our society&rdquo;.  He said also that continuing efforts through the use of the press office and community relations officers are being made toward this goal and that during the year the head office staff directing this work will be expanded. That is encouraging news, and it is good to see that the Garda Síochána recognise the need to be involved on the ground with the communities they serve.</P>
    <P>We will make real progress in the area of community policing only when we tackle the very fundamental problem that, generally speaking, gardaí do not live in those areas where the crime rate is highest or in the areas that suffer most as a result of the level of crime.  The Garda are seen as a middle-class force living in middle-class areas policing working-class areas, and until we make some sort of effort to get gardaí back to their communities on a 24-hour basis &mdash; which means living in the areas they police &mdash; we will not make progress.  I see all sorts of difficulties about that, but some sort of incentive should be available to gardaí who are required to move into and live in the areas where they are assigned responsibility.  In parts of this city, and I am sure in other cities, considerable alienation exists now in some areas between the Garda and local communities. There are a number of reasons for this some of which I have touched on already such as high unemployment, the inadequacy of recreational facilities, poor planning and the fact that, because criminals have tended to grow more sophisticated, gardaí have been forced to concentrate all their efforts into producing a more sophisticated response to crime which in some cases has had the effect of removing them from the community <Col N="928" /> in which they are based.  It is very difficult for the ordinary citizen to relate in any meaningful way to the local gardaí if their relationship with them is confined to standing on the footpath while the gardaí speed by in high-powered patrol cars.  That is why it is so encouraging that the Commissioner has placed an emphasis on putting gardaí back on the beat, something which has already been seen to have an effect as expressed at the meeting to which Deputy Bruton and Deputy V. Brady referred last night.  It was encouraging to hear people comment that they had seen a real recognisable improvement in the space of a year.</P>
    <P>The terrible consequence of what happens when large sections of the public become alienated from the police force has been illustrated graphically in recent times at home and abroad.  We have not yet witnessed here scenes of the scale of those at Brixton in 1981 and other British cities last summer, but we have seen incidents that indicate a similar trend. Gardaí have been attacked going about their job, squad cars have been rammed and stoned.  In the inquiry into that disorder in Brixton Lord Scarman found that a major causatory factor in the rioting was the serious breakdown in relations between the police and the community that they were serving.  I do not believe that we are approaching a Brixton situation here but what we saw happening last summer should serve as a salutary reminder to all of us of the consequences that can flow if hostility is allowed to develop between the police force and the community.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year I deputised for the Minister for Justice at Templemore on the occasion of the largest passing-out for many years.  I was privileged to be invited to address the new gardaí and I made an appeal then which is worth reiterating now.  I asked the new recruits to show compassion and understanding in their relationships with the young people they meet.  Many of the young people they will be required to deal with will not have had the benefits of education and training enjoyed by those new recruits, many of them will not have worked, they will not have earned respect and the self-esteem <Col N="929" /> that flows from that.  Those new recruits and their colleagues at the junior end of the force as young gardaí have a very special responsibility and opportunity to establish close relationships with young people in their area.</P>
    <P>Very many gardaí are already doing fine work in their local areas such as spending their spare time with young people in the local youth clubs, sports organisations and so on.  That is an effective way to be a guardian of the peace. Young people are in need of guidance, leadership and counselling and gardaí, particularly those of their peer age, are in a position to provide all of that.  To the young person whom the garda assists on a voluntary basis he becomes a colleague, friend and mentor and not the hostile figure of authority which could easily be the case.  That kind of voluntary community work is so valuable that recognition should be given within the system to those members of the force who engage in it.  If necessary the time spent by them on this work could be regarded as official duty with consequent benefits.  Involvement in that kind of activity could be complementary to the work of the juvenile liaision officers scheme.  I hope to see more and more young members of the Force involved in this area.</P>
    <P>One sphere where greater attention is required is that of Garda training.  I know that a social skills and community relations course has been introduced in Templemore.  This will help the Garda to become more effective and thus retain the traditionally high respect given to members of the Force.  I am pleased the National Federation of Youth Clubs has been invited to become involved with that course.  It can only be of benefit to those who participate.</P>
    <P>The Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors have recommended that community gardaí should undergo an initial period of training on appointment. This would include crime prevention techniques, sociology, the causes of crime, particularly juvenile crime, an introduction to youth and community work, community policing systems in other countries, the role of the various <Col N="930" /> voluntary and statutory organisations and the whole question of human and inter-personal relations.  I hope their views will be taken seriously.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been a considerable expansion in the size of the Force.  Emphasis must be placed on training, including in-service training.  It is desirable that we be in a position to pick out those recruits with particular potential at an early stage and single them out for special training.  We have a situation now where huge numbers are applying for entry into the Garda Síochána, including a considerable number of third-level graduates.  The standard of recruits has never been higher.  I am certain it would be possible to identify people who would benefit from courses in advanced training at a very early stage. As a corollary that would require a scheme that would allow continuous additional training after recruitment. Something has been done in that regard but we must place greater emphasis on this matter.  We have increased the size of the Force to such an extent that it is difficult to see the answer in still more recruitment.</P>
    <P>The response comes at a number of levels.  First, there is a response in terms of the obligation to provide a kind of society where crime will not flourish.  Secondly, there are the specific responsibilities that fall on the Garda Síochána. Thirdly, there is the legislative response setting down the parameters within which the Garda must do their work.  For some time there has been a feeling that the balance that must exist between the rights of the accused and the rights of the prosecution has gone awry.  In every criminal case there are two parties seeking justice, the accused and the people of Ireland represented by the prosecution.  This Bill seeks to right that balance.</P>
    <P>Our legal system has operated on the fundamental basis of presumption of innocence, that a person must be found guilty beyond reasonable doubt.  Our whole criminal procedure is designed to give effect to that fundamental principle. It operates on the thesis that the parties do not come to court as equals, that the accused comes as an individual to stand <Col N="931" /> trial but that on the other side the prosecution has available to it all the resources of the State and that that is an unequal contest that can only be made fair by so drafting the rules of procedure as to afford a high degree of protection to the accused.  It is felt that sometimes that thesis does not stand up.  For example, it is felt it does not stand up when instead of dealing with an individual accused one is dealing with a threat to society as a whole and to the security of the State.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we have modified our procedures when dealing with those whose aim it is to overthrow the State.  We have done this since the foundation of the State.  Similarly, when the French authorities were dealing with the OAS terrorists they felt their ordinary legal system and their courts were not adequate.  The German authorities when dealing with the Bader Meinhof group, and also the Italians, found it necessary to depart from normal standards.  Even apart from those special cases, there is a feeling that the sophistication of some of those who come before our criminal courts is such as to equip them to play ducks and drakes with our legal system.  For that reason there is the feeling that our system requires an overhaul.</P>
    <P>Almost nobody has dissented from the basic premise that it is time to see how well our legal system is serving us and to make changes.  The purposes of such changes would be to increase the likelihood of those who are guilty of offences being convicted.  There has been criticism of some of the individual provisions in the Bill.  It has been suggested that some have failed to get the balance right.</P>
    <P>Many parts of the Bill have been widely welcomed.  The provisions in regard to bail seem to me to be ones of commonsense. I suspect that most members of the public would be amazed to learn that up to now it has not been an offence to fail to surrender to one's bail.</P>
    <P>The provision for consecutive sentences is one that will be universally welcomed. At the moment bail is granted as of right and if an accused is going to stand trial in the District Court the maximum <Col N="932" /> penalty that can be imposed provides an obvious temptation to operate on the principle of, if one is going to be hanged, or going to be imprisoned for 12 months, one might as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb, or imprisoned for three murders or six murders instead of just one. Again I think the public will see that as a sensible balance and one long overdue.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the higher penalties for the offence of the unauthorised taking of a mechanically propelled vehicle is worthwhile on two grounds.  First of all, the offence will now be tried on indictment, attracting a maximum penalty of five years.  That indicates public distaste for this offence and the fact that the public does not regard the offence as a minor offence.  The fact that the Legislature takes this step of increasing the maximum sentence from six months to five years is a signal to the judiciary of the way in which this offence is viewed by the public. I hope it will produce a satisfactory response from the Judiciary.  On that basis it is welcome.  It is also welcome because of the consequences that will flow from this.  The offence will carry a penalty of five years, and that should result in the gardaí being available to carry out investigations into other areas of crime.  That is very important, because we now have a situation in which it is almost impossible to convict someone for the unauthorised taking of a mechanically propelled vehicle unless he is caught in the act.  The result has been an increase in car chases.  They are a nightly occurrence in some parts of the city.  Other avenues of detection will be henceforth opened by this Bill.  That is important, and I hope those who take cars without authorisation will be detected and convicted. I hope too those detections will stem in the main from the provisions in this Bill rather than in the necessity to engage in highspeed car chases.  A number of Deputies made the comment that being involved in a car chase has an attraction for some people.  They find their sport in this fashion.</P>
    <P>With regard to increased penalties for certain firearm offences, while I do not think there will be very many cases, in practice I do not think the present maximum <Col N="933" /> will be exceeded.  This marks the gravity with which these offences are viewed and will act as a signal again to the Judiciary that they should respond to that view.  I welcome the provision for that reason.</P>
    <P>On the question of the obligation to provide notice of an alibi in indictable offences the provision here is again welcome. I do not think anyone could have any great problem with it.  There are, then, some technicalities about the order of closing speeches and so on which, if anything, will be to the advantage of the defence and will certainly remove some anomalies in present procedure.</P>
    <P>Sections 20 and 21 deal with the area of proof by written statement and formal admissions.  These sections are very welcome but I question whether they go far enough.  Over the last two years the length of criminal charges has got longer and longer and longer.  Trials lasting several weeks have now become the norm. Many of these trials are held without a jury.  They take place in Green Street before the Special Criminal Court.  Consider what the length of the trial would be with a jury present.  If trials were to continue of such duration as seems to be the norm at present many people would find it impossible to serve on juries.  The possibility then of a trial by one's peers would become a thing of the past and we could reach the stage, which seems to have been reached in Britain, where one has to breed a certain variety of juror so that there would be people in a position to devote themselves to the hearing of these cases.</P>
    <P>Why do these trials take so long?  One reason is that many of the major trials in the last few years have resulted in prolonged arguments on the admissibility of certain evidence.  It is almost a trial within a trial.  As well as the evidence being questioned the lawfulness of the accused being held in detention has also been argued at length.  If it is a trial with a jury present it is inevitably prolonged and it might be necessary then to argue the point twice, first in the absence of the jury and later with the jury present. Another reason is the number of technicalities <Col N="934" /> raised in any case of any substance.</P>
    <P>In the Central Criminal Court one will find literally dozens of gardaí wandering around waiting to be called to give evidence. It is a ludicrous situation.  The onus is on the prosecution to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt and so the prosecution has to anticipate arguments that may be raised by the defence and counteract them in advance.  Remember the courtmartial in the summer months in which the Secretary to the Government was called to give evidence that the Government had sanctioned the involvement of an Irish peace keeping force with the UN in Lebanon.  That had to be proved because it could not be established in advance whether or not it would be an issue.  That was done at considerable expense.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill are welcome, but the Minister did state that he is engaged in consultation, particularly with those counsel specialists in criminal law and, as a result of those consultations, it might be possible to go a good deal further. Indeed, it might be possible to reach a stage at which in advance of the case actually coming on for hearing it would be possible to determine the next issue as to whether the accused was present, as to whether he intended to give the money back, or <i>vice versa,</i> instead of having to traverse a whole range of matters which could be legally removed from controversy. That could be very important, because criminal trials are very costly. The State is responsible for the fees of prosecuting counsel and usually for the fees of defending counsel in a number of cases, and anything that can be done to shorten trials must result in a significant saving.</P>
    <P>This is something the Minister can and should explore further because there is goodwill among practitioners towards ending what is seen as an archaic system. I do not think anybody feels that he is serving justice when, for example, prosecuting in a manslaughter case or a case of dangerous driving causing death he is obliged to call the driver of the ambulance which brought the body to hospital in order to prove that there was not a <Col N="935" /> second accident on the way.  That sort of obligation does not impress anybody who is obliged to listen to it and it is quite possible to remove much of that from our legal system.</P>
    <P>I have so far skipped over section 3, the detention section, and sections 16, 17 and 18 dealing with inference.  In the case of the detention section, it is fair to say that the starting point for most people would be that they would wish that the granting of the power of detention was not necessary.  The fact that it is proposed to confine the area where it would be available is evidence of that.  On the other hand, most people would feel that some power of detention is now necessary. Specifically one would think of the case of organised crime and drugs which are probably the main areas that would not at present involve invoking of the Offences Against the State Act.  Few people would have any qualms about the power of detention in such cases, but they would be concerned to see that the power was not abused and was reserved to those cases where it was strictly necessary.</P>
    <P>What safeguards are we offered?  The first and, perhaps, most important safeguard is the guarantee of an independent complaints tribunal.  The Minister has stated emphatically &mdash; and has produced a supplementary explanatory memorandum to assert &mdash; that the powers being conferred by this Bill will not be brought into force until an independent complaints tribunal is in existence and he has also indicated that both Houses will be given an opportunity of discussing the complaints procedure before it is brought into effect.</P>
    <P>At this stage there are some questions to be asked.  For example, who will serve on this tribunal?  What investigative powers will they have?  Will they have to rely on the Garda to do their detecting?  If a complaint is made will the tribunal be obliged to invite a member of the Garda to investigate it, so that their only function will be to assess the report which comes back from the garda assigned to that task?  It is a most valuable safeguard to those who will find themselves in custody but also to those members of the <Col N="936" /> Garda who by holding people in custody may be open to unfair allegations.  These are the two sides of the one coin.</P>
    <P>I hope that the tribunal when established will be seen to be independent and that the members will be people of such standing in the community that their decisions and recommendations will be accepted without challenge.  I hope that the procedures under which they operate will be such that they are in a position to get to the truth of what is always a very difficult thing to decide.  It will not be easy to find out where the truth lies in regard to what happened in a Garda station if the only people there were the accused, who obviously has a vested interest in putting forward the complaint, and the investigating members who have an interest in denying the complaint.  It is essential that the people involved in the tribunal should be people of standing and experience and the machinery available to them should be such that they will have every possibility of finding the truth.</P>
    <P>The other safeguard is the fact that the power is restricted to particular offences, basically offences carrying a penalty of five years.  There is a problem because many quite trivial acts would in theory carry a sentence of five years' imprisonment. Stealing apples from an orchard, for example, would constitute the offence of larceny under the 1916 Larceny Act and in theory would render the culprit liable to a sentence dramatically in excess of five years.  I do not believe any Member of this House would wish to see the powers conferred by this Bill used in such a case.  It is inconceivable that a member of the Judiciary would impose a sentence of five years or more for a minor shop lifting offence but in theory the maximum sentence available to the court is in excess of five years.</P>
    <P>What can be done about indicating to the courts and the Garda who will implement this legislation what is in our minds? The suggestion has been made that what is required is a schedule of offences and I find this suggestion only superficially attractive.  It would be very difficult to draw up such a schedule.  The first thing would be to list the offences and nobody would dispute that the powers should <Col N="937" /> exist in cases of murder and rape and so on.  In the area of offences against property the matter becomes more and more difficult.  The simple offence of larceny can cover anything from the most minor misdemeanour to dishonesty on a grand scale.  It is hard to imagine any definition which would cover acts of grand dishonesty and exclude much more minor matters.</P>
    <P>Reluctantly I am drawn to the conclusion that the Minister has adopted the correct approach in drawing a distinction between those offences which carry a sentence of five years and those that do not. At least it is a rough and ready indication of the category into which an offence falls.  It will be necessary for the Garda to accept that they will not be following the wishes of the Oireachtas if these powers are used in minor offences and cases where everybody involved must know that a substantial sentence would not be merited.  That is not an ideal way to approach things and it is unfortunate that we will be relying on internal guidelines for the Garda rather than, as legislators, making clear exactly what we have in mind.  Having given the matter some thought, at this stage I am not in a position to suggest to the House any way in which one can differentiate between those offences that are sufficiently serious to allow the Garda exercise their powers and those that are not.  In Britain, for example, the distinction is drawn between arrestable and non-arrestable offences.  That distinction replaced the distinction that still exists in our law &mdash; I hope it will not exist for much longer &mdash; between felonies and misdemeanours. They faced the position that some acts of trivial misbehaviour might, in theory, render a culprit liable to a sentence of five years.  I hope that can be teased out on Committee Stage and that Members on all sides will address themselves to the question of what is the most effective way of confining the powers granted by the Bill to those offences for which they are justified and avoid giving powers to the Garda in cases where they do not need them and, certainly, should not have them.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if his statement to the Irish Nurses' Organisation on 11 November 1983 that our total health expenditure in this current year will be of the order of £1,100 million is accurate; and if so, the reasons for this overrun, given that the budget estimate was £925.6 million for current expenditure and £53 million for capital expenditure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be no over-run on the Health Estimate in the current year.</P>
      <P>The budget non-capital estimate of £925.6 million for Health for 1983 represents the grant provision payable in 1983 towards approved non-capital expenditure on health services.  Most of the balance of grant due is payable in the following year and final adjustments are made on the basis of audited accounts.</P>
      <P>The gross non-capital expenditure related to the non-capital grant provision of £925.6 million is £1,070.5 million.  This expenditure is categorised by Programme and Service on pages 202 and 203 of the 1983 Revised Estimates for Public Services and falls to be increased to £1,090 million to take account of amounts proper to the Health Vote included in the Special Vote for Remuneration, Vote 50.</P>
      <P>Capital expenditure will be £53 million as provided for in subhead K of the Health Estimate.</P>

      <P>Absolutely.  It is quite remarkable, if I may sound somewhat self-laudatory, that this is the first year since 1978 we have kept rigidly within our Health Estimate.

As the Deputy is aware, we take care on a health basis of UK nationals here.  That money enabled us to meet any over-runs which were there at that time.  As a consequence the £13 million was saved.

I am considering this in the context of our capital programme.  I am anxious that these four months should not be lost for orthopaedic operations in Merlin Park.  The working conditions there have been uncomfortable for those operations.

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is correct that such a committee was established, representing the Departments of Agriculture, Health, Environment, Industry and Energy and Labour, to co-ordinate inquiries into any question of a link being established between the operations of the Merck, Sharp &amp; Dohme factory and the particular problems associated with the farm in the area.  The most useful aspect of this has been the recent co-operation whereby a number of animals were put down and are being currently investigated by way of extensive laboratory tests.  That is being done by both the Department of Agriculture and the farmer concerned on a carefully controlled basis.  On that basis the findings <Col N="942" /> should be available quite soon to enable us to come to a definite understanding as to what precisely is wrong, if there is anything wrong, in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>As it is the Minister for Health to whom we are addressing the question I think he will agree that his responsibility is to the people living in the area.  The responses he has been giving are matters for the Minister for Agriculture or perhaps the Minister for Labour. But the specific question I put down was to ask the Minister if there was any threat, to his knowledge, to the lives or health of people in the area or if he had conducted any tests to discover, apart from the epidemiological patterns to which the Minister has referred, if there is any danger to the health of human beings in the area?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I might reassure the Deputy that I have devoted a very considerable amount of time to this issue in this area.  The deputy medical officer of the Department of Health and the local medical officers of the South Eastern Health Board have also devoted a very considerable amount of time to this matter. It is being discussed extensively and intensively at departmental level, with my Department directly involved.  So far, after widespread investigation and very considerable study of disease patterns in the area, we have been unable to come to a conclusion with regard to the particular plant concerned.  Of late, we have had perhaps the most definite prospective investigation open to us, namely, the laboratory tests on the cattle on this particular farm.  That will be of major value to us, to the farmer concerned, to the health board and to the Departments of Health and Agriculture.</P>

      <P>The decision as to whether any necessary changes in the law relating to adoption will be provided in the Children Bill or in separate legislation will be dependent on the extent of the legislation changes proposed by the committee and on the progress which will have been made in the meantime on the preparation of the Children Bill.</P>
      <P>The present position in relation to the Children Bill is that my Department has almost completed an extensive redrafting of the general scheme of the Bill to take account of my own views and preliminary comments of other relevant Departments.

      <P>asked the Minister for Health the family planning advice and facilities that are made available to the general public by each of the eight health boards; and the guidelines, if any, that have been given by his Department to health boards in relation to the provision of family planning services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Arrangements for the provision of family planning services are similar in all eight health boards.  The Health (Family Planning) Act, 1979, places an obligation on the Minister to provide a comprehensive natural family planning service.  This service is provided by voluntary organisations assisted by my Department and the health boards.</P>
      <P>Regulations made under the Act require health boards to provide a family planning service, as defined in the Act. They indicated that this may be done by means of arrangements under section 26 of the Health Act, 1970, in this instance through general practitioners.</P>
      <P>In notifying health boards of the commencement of the Family Planning Act broad guidelines were set out.  It was indicated that family planning advice was generally accepted as coming within the ambit of general medical practice.  Persons seeking advice, therefore, normally would be expected to obtain such advice in the course of consultation with their general practitioner.  Where medical card holders sought such advice the consultation fee would be covered by the General Medical Service.</P>
      <P>The service to be provided directly by health boards was seen as complementary to the GP service.  Boards might provide more specialised information or advice in relation to particular matters of family planning through their specialist obstetrical and gynaecological services. The boards could also support training programmes in family planning for general practitioners.</P>
      <P>Family planning services in this context means information, instruction, advice or consultation in relation to family planning and contraception.  It does not include the provision of contraceptives.</P>

      <P>The general thrust of the Act is not aimed at placing particular responsibility on health boards to the extent the Deputy or I might wish.

      <P>There has been a very considerable change, even in the past four or five years.  I came into possession of a very recent study, as yet unpublished, which states that 86 per cent of family doctors now give advice on family planning.  Precise details of this are not available.  I assure the Deputy I will be doing my utmost in relation to bringing forward amendments to existing legislation &mdash; I hope there will be across-the-board agreement on such amendments &mdash; and I will be giving every encouragement to health boards to become involved more actively in assisting family planning services in their areas.  I should like to see in all health board areas women's clinics being set up not only for family planning but for the processing of cervical smears in relation to breast cancer.  I should like to see these set up and opened on a weekly basis&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>How much money has been made available this year by the Department for natural family planning advice?  The Minister has announced that female sterilisation will be included in the new measure.  Has he had any discussions on this matter with hospital boards?  I understand that the ethics committees operating in most hospitals will not undertake female sterilisation.  Therefore, it would be appropriate in advance of the legislation if he would have appropriate discussions with the hospital authorities in this regard.</P>

      <P>In relation to the first part of the question, I have a statutory responsibility to make moneys available for research into what is known as natural family planning methods.  I made a sum of £17,000 available this year for that.  I do not have any legislative authority to make moneys available for other methods of contraception to other organisations &mdash; I am precluded from doing so under the Act.  In regard to female sterilisation, I hold the view that it is a normal medical practice in regard to contracreption and that there should be a facility available in certain medical circumstances in hospitals, particularly in the greater Dublin area so that women would not have to go to Cork, where the waiting list is very long, or travel to either Liverpool or London to avail of established medical practice in relation to contraception. Unfortunately in the Dublin area that matter is not being resolved, but I will endeavour to resolve it.</P>

      <P>The Poisons Regulations, 1982, which came into operation on 1 March 1983, confine the sale of hormones and injectable antibiotics for animal use to pharmacies.  Intra-mammary and non-injectable antibiotics may also be sold by certain outlets licensed by health boards, provided the sale is under the direction and control of a named pharmacist or veterinary inspector in the case of each outlet.  These controls are supplementary to those operated under legislation administered by the Minister for Agriculture.  That Minister has recently announced details of proposals to be introduced shortly for further controls which will, <i>inter alia</i>, restrict the sale of hormones and certain antibiotics to prescription-only sale.</P>
      <P>The Food Advisory Committee will be submitting to me in the near future a report on antibiotic residues in food, which will recommend a wide range of further measures.  I will have these recommendations examined in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture and, where appropriate, they will be implemented as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health have a general responsibility for the safety of foodstuffs, including milk and meat products. Sampling is carried out for this purpose by health boards at retail level and includes monitoring of milk for antibiotic residues.  The need for further monitoring of milk and meat by health boards additional to arrangements being developed by the Department of Agriculture is being considered.</P>

      <P>The Food Advisory Committee of the Department were asked some time ago to undertake a very detailed analysis of the problem.  They indicated that they would report by the end of the year.  I brought considerable pressure on them &mdash; I thank them for the work they have done &mdash; and their report will be available in a week or so.  I can assure the Deputy that there will be no delay.  I am concerned that there will be no residues at all, but I am more concerned about hormone residues which can be particularly harmful.  The general monitoring and control systems and the statutory powers and regulations available to me are quite extensive and are being implemented.</P>

Has the Minister any information about that?  I am not happy that the action being taken is sufficient to deal with the problem.</P>

      <P>The main investigation has centred around the presence of antibiotic residues.  I can assure the Deputy that I am keeping in very close touch with the Department of Agriculture on the question of hormone residues. As the Deputy knows, particularly in relation to meat exports, the Department of Agriculture exercise very considerable care and a very high level of inspection is carried out by that Department. The result of an analysis in 1982 and 1983 of the presence of hormones in meat for export indicated that no sample contained residues of hormones.  To that extent, the picture is quite good, but domestic meat might be another issue.</P>

      <P>A great deal of concern has arisen because the regional health board public analysts analysed samples of food.  They started the microbiological analysis of foodstuffs only during the past two years.  Prior to that the work of the analyst was confined to the analysis of food for the presence of chemical additives, such as colouring, and other dangerous substances, such as arsenic and lead.  Now, systems to monitor milk and milk products for hormone residues and meat and meat products for hormone and antibiotic residues are being developed by the regional analysts at present.  A good deal of information has become available, but I can assure the Deputy that I am keeping a very close eye on the situation.  As a former member of the Food Hygiene Advisory Committee I am taking a particular interest in this area, but there are ample statutory powers open to me at present.</P>

Is it not a fact that the creameries and the meat plants impose very severe penalties on suppliers if their produce does not reach a certain standard?  I ask that the Department carry out an in depth investigation into this subject in order to allay the fears of the public, because this type of scare could do a great deal of damage to the dairy industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the progress that has been made in the provision of Tallaght hospital, County Dublin; and if, in view of the urgent need for this facility there, he will expedite its provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tallaght Hospital Board, which was appointed to plan and build the new hospital, is expected to <Col N="958" /> complete the planning brief for the hospital before Christmas.</P>
      <P>On submission of the brief to me, I will have it examined in my Department as quickly as possible.  It would then be my intention to allow the further stages of planning to proceed on the development as resources allow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give some indication to the House as to when we may see construction work commencing on this hospital which is so urgently needed?  Secondly, would the Minister be prepared to use existing plans based on other hospitals of comparable size to save time, in view of the urgency?  Finally, can the Minister confirm that the site for the hospital is under the control and in the possession of his Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The board are now well advanced into Stage 1 of formal planning, that is the preparation of the planning brief.  As the Deputy knows, there are no less than six separate stages.  After that, there is the development and control plan, then the sketch design, the construction and drawings, the bill of quantities and the invitation to tenders. I am not as yet in a position to give the precise date but the completion of these remaining stages in a project costing some £60 million would take, on planning alone, perhaps up to three years.  Dublin Corporation have agreed to the transfer to the Department of a 38-acre site in Tallaght for the new hospital, in exchange for 39 acres of land at Cabra which belongs to the Department of Health.  We have made the exchange and the Chief State Solicitors' office are working on the legal formalities of the transfer at present.  However, I assure the Deputy that in advance of the construction of the hospital, a proposal from the Meath, the Adelaide and the National Children's Hospitals to establish consultant-staffed, out-patients clinics in Tallaght in advance of the provision of the hospital has been accepted.  Discussions are going on between the three hospitals, the Eastern Health Board and my Department about the type and number of clinics to be provided and the type of accommodation <Col N="959" /> required for them, so that we will have an integration of those hospitals into the Tallaght area.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There are undoubted difficulties in terms of obtaining suitable interim accommodation in Tallaght.  I have had great difficulty with relation to an employment exchange, not to mention out-patients' clinics.  My Department and the hospitals concerned are working actively on that issue.  There was no time scale in terms of the Tallaght major hospital development.  The board were appointed in March 1981; the planning takes a number of years and the construction will take another three to four years. This is a very major project involving £60 million in current costs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLoughlin Mr. McLoughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLoughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>They are on this issue.  Is it the private consultants who decide on the hospitals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Tallaght Hospital Board have accepted a proposition <Col N="960" /> that the appointment of architects which is of considerable importance to this hospital should be by competition. The board are discussing the terms of the competition with the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland.  I expect to get the agreed terms in the near future.  This will be a public hospital.  I have advised the board that I am not prepared to sanction any private hospital on the campus of this hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLoughlin Mr. McLoughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLoughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Usually architects' fees and consultants' fees for the design of public buildings such as schools and hospitals are 12¾ per cent.  In times of high unemployment and low recruitment in the public sector, it cost £7.2 million to design this hospital which cost £60 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Stage 1 has not come to me yet.  The next stage is the development of the control plan for the 39 acres and the layout.  Stage 3 will be the sketch design.  I will be in very close touch with the hospital board in that regard.  I hope some public representatives will serve on the board.  There is none on it at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister tell us why he will not allow private hospital facilities to be built on the campus since many people would like to pay for their own private health care to relieve the Exchequer which appears to be very hard pressed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Basically it is a matter of the control of resources.  I hold the view that if hospital consultants wish to <Col N="961" /> cater for private patients it is their privilege to do so.  In relation to Beaumont where seven acres were sought, or Tallaght where a slice of the campus site was also sought, I do not believe public money should be used.  A major public hospital should be on a public, integrated and unified basis for the people at large. That will be generally accepted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>

      <P>Are not the statistics which the Minister has given a little misleading as to the incidence of TB?  It depends on what basis you are starting from.

      <P>Currently I am examining the general tuberculosis policy with the organisations concerned.  I propose to issue guidelines to health boards and hospitals as soon as possible.  I share the Deputy's concern.  The policy on the pasteurisation of milk is still being pursued vigorously by my Department.  Raw milk can be a vehicle for several diseases including tuberculosis.  Of major importance is the eradication of the disease in cattle which causes a major TB problem in human beings.  I have asked the medical officers and the local veterinary officers to liaise on a more effective basis.</P>

I missed one of the Minister's figures, but it seems there is no decrease in the incidence of TB.  Does the Minister think the reason for the failure to reduce the incidence of TB is the continued existence of TB in cattle?  Is that a major factor?</P>

I have a very personal interest in this because I am a very high consumer of dairy products such as my pinta, I like my toast swimming in butter and I like big hunks of cheese at times.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I need hardly say that the Government appreciate very fully the extraordinary pressures which a kidnapping places on many people, especially the family, friends and associates of the kidnapped person, as well as the inhumanity of the action in relation to the victim himself; but the Government's attitude must be one of total opposition to the payment of ransom, and for at least two reasons.  First, the payment of ransom would be likely to encourage others to resort to the same tactic.  Second, the level of money usually sought by way of ransom is such that the Government could not acquiesce in the idea of its falling into the hands of paramilitary or other subversive groups.  The probable <Col N="965" /> cost in terms of human life and human suffering does not need to be spelled out.</P>

    <Title>Criminal Justice Bill, 1983: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Labour (Mr. G. Birmingham) George Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Labour (Mr. G. Birmingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Question Time I was dealing with the new power of detention.  I was making the point that while I was disposed to welcome the provision in principle I was anxious that it be confined as strictly as <Col N="996" /> possible and, in particular, I was anxious that it be confined to the very minimum number of cases necessary.  I hope we can discuss that further on Committee Stage and consider what is the most effective way to achieve that.</P>
      <P>The question then is what other safeguards may be available to us.  The Bill holds out the possibility of one very effective one with the provision giving power to the Minister for Justice to make regulations in relation to taping.  I know this is not an easy matter and that it will take time.  I accept that it is not something that can be done overnight but I am very anxious that the Minister for Justice would regard this as a priority and would, as quickly as possible, make a reality of this provision because I believe that if taping became the norm, the legislation would represent a very real addition to the rights of a person in custody.</P>
      <P>The Bill also affords protection in that for the first time it spells out the right of an accused to have access to his legal adviser.  I welcome that and I welcome the fact that all of the safeguards afforded by the Bill are extended to the Offences Against the State Act.  It should be made clear just what the function of the solicitor in that case is.  It seems that he does not have the right to remain present for the entire period of detention whether it is six hours, 12 hours or 20 hours.  It seems to me that it is already the practice and it should be made clear that the legal adviser has the right to consult in private with his client.  It should also be made clear that the questioning should not commence until a reasonable period has elapsed after the solicitor has been requested to attend at the Garda station. I believe that is probably present practice but if we are going to give these extra powers it is important that they be spelled out as clearly as possible and I am anxious that this happens.</P>
      <P>We must say that detention is a necessary evil but it must be seen in that light and we should be careful to ensure that giving this power to the Garda does not change the whole role of the Force from one of investigation into one of simply interrogating those whom they suspect of committing offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="997" /> The other sections which have caused some anxiety are sections 16, 17 and 18, the sections dealing with the inference that may be drawn from the failure of accused persons to mention particular facts, the inference from failure to account for objects, marks and so on and the inference from the accused's presence at a particular place.  Some Deputies on all sides of the House have taken very fundamental objection to these provisions. I do not share that.  A number of elements of our criminal law already take the view that an accused person or suspect does not have a right to opt out of the pursuit of truth.</P>
    <P>It is already the case, for example, that a garda investigating offences under the Road Traffic Act is entitled to put questions to a suspect and the suspect is obliged to answer.  It is already the case for example, under the Road Traffic Act, that a suspect is obliged to give a specimen of his blood or of his urine to assist in achieving the truth.  If we have accepted these departures from a general principle of no self-incrimination, then it seems to me there is nothing inherently wrong in doing so in the case of much more serious offences.  The specific sections, 17 and 18, dealing with the failure to account for objects, marks and so on and failure to account for being in a particular place do not cause me any problems.</P>
    <P>In the case of section 16, I understand what the Minister seeks to achieve, and I sympathise with what he seeks to achieve, but I wonder whether another way might not be found to achieve the same objective without giving rise to the fears that have been expressed.  We must remember that we are dealing with a person who is in a Garda station, who may have been there for many hours and may not be aware of the precise charge he is going to face.  Indeed, the charge may not even have been formulated at this stage.  In those circumstances someone unaccustomed to finding himself in that role may, through ignorance or simply a lack of appreciation of what is relevant, fail to direct himself to matters which will subsequently be important.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="998" /> A general obligation to bring to the notice of the Garda all matters that may subsequently turn out to be relevant in respect of charges not yet formulated and still less laid against the accused might present difficulties.  I wonder whether the objective could be met by providing that the accused would have to answer specific questions put to him by the Garda.  This is an approach that was adopted by Judge Ó Briain in the Ó Briain Committee Report which came out in 1978.  He said that he considered the general rule of the right of silence should be somewhat modified and that a suspect should be required to answer certain questions.  He said that the refusal or failure to do so might be made the subject of comment by the judge at the trial and/or by the prosecution with the leave of the trial judge.  The jury should be told to draw whatever inference they think proper from a refusal to answer all or any such questions.  Such questions might relate to identity and address, marital status, explanation of stains on clothing, property, including money, found on the suspect, an account of his dealings with a vehicle believed by the Garda to have been used in a crime, his movements for a specified period of time before and after the crime and some other kindred questions to be set out in a statute and strictly limited.  He also said that, outside of such matters, the suspected person would retain his right of silence, as at present, quite unimpaired.</P>
    <P>The approach suggested by Judge Ó Briain is worthy of consideration and adopting it would achieve all that is sought to be achieved by section 16 but without giving rise to the degree of public disquiet that seems to have arisen at the moment.  I would not necessarily limit the questions that could be asked to those catalogued by Judge Ó Briain but an attempt to specify what the accused has to answer and to reveal can only be helpful. We must try to be as specific as possible in this area so that everybody knows what is expected of him.  Otherwise, those who are well used to finding themselves in Garda stations and who have some knowledge of criminal procedure, the barrack room lawyers who have been <Col N="999" /> around the track a few times, will not find themselves in any difficulty with this section.  It is conceivable &mdash; I do not say it is probable &mdash; that those who have no experience might find themselves in difficulties. An amendment to take account of that would allay fears and represent an improvement in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go on at any great length.  I welcome the Bill and the spirit in which the Minister has introduced it where he has indicated clearly his willingness to accept comments, suggestions and improvements either from Members of this House or outside.  That is not always the approach adopted by those whose function it is to introduce legislation in this House and it represents a welcome departure.  I hope to contribute at some greater length on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill in view of the deterioration in law and order and the continued rise in the crime rate.  However, I doubt if legislation is the solution to the problem.  The Garda Síochána have been working well with the limited facilities available but they have not been in a position to get at the people behind serious crime, especially violent crime.</P>
      <P>The community are very concerned about crime and there is a willingness to co-operate in every way with the Garda. The Garda should take advantage of this goodwill and, if possible, become more involved at local level.  I should appreciate if the Minister could involve the people in this fight and the time is also opportune to get more gardaí back on the beat.  In doing so they become more involved with the people.</P>
      <P>In the Tralee area a number of gardaí have become very involved in youth clubs, GAA clubs and development associations. As a result, they have built up a very good relationship and this can be developed.  It has been said that over the past number of years, especially in the United States, where this has been adopted, there is a decreasing rate of crime because policemen have got involved and established themselves with the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most serious problems facing <Col N="1000" /> us is drugs.  I understand that approximately 1,600 people were found in possession of drugs last year, an increase of approximately 15 per cent over the previous year.  I have no doubt that this percentage will increase this year.  I should like to congratulate the Drugs Squad on the tremendous work they are doing and they deserve extra manpower. I was very surprised to learn that there are only two ban-ghardaí attached to the Drugs Squad, considering that of those convicted for drug offences last year 25 per cent were teenage girls.</P>
    <P>If more finance was made available to youth development organisations, especially the National Youth Council, many more young people would become involved and would help to develop leisure interests.  It would fill the time of many of these youngsters who have no opportunities due to the lack of jobs. They could become involved in youth work and this would be an education in itself.  I ask the Minister to seriously consider this because many of the problems regarding crime relate to involvement with drugs.  It is well known that when you are addicted you must find money to buy the drugs.  For this reason a start should be made in the schools and education should get priority.</P>
    <P>During the last number of years there has been a shocking increase in crime, especially in our cities.  There has also been a considerable increase in violent crime often directed against the weaker sections of our community.  The number of undetected crimes is also increasing.  It is clear something must be done to help the Garda solve more crimes.</P>
    <P>I welcome the extra powers given to the Garda in the Bill.  It has been a great scandal that in many recent cases the Garda know the people involved in crime but cannot do anything about it.  It must be remembered that some of these extra powers are breaking a legal tradition that goes back for centuries.  Accordingly, a provision should be inserted to review those powers on an annual basis.  It is essential for the proper administration of our system of justice that the forces of law and order command the respect of the general public.  Thankfully, that has <Col N="1001" /> been the case up to now.  The provision of a system to deal with complaints, allied to the extra powers for the Garda, will ensure that this will continue.</P>
    <P>The Garda require more than extra powers; more assistance is necessary.  It is ridiculous that such highly trained people must spend a considerable amount of their time typing long reports. More secretarial assistants should be allocated to the Garda to relieve members of the force of this type of work.  There should be an extension of the on-the-spot fine system.  That would eliminate the necessity for the Garda to compile long reports about minor offences.  It is not necessary to bring all crimes before a court.  For instance, a house-breaker caught on the spot could be dealt with out of court.</P>
    <P>An essential element in the drive to beat crime is the co-operation of the public. It is essential that the Garda and the public work hand in hand.  That will be achieved only if there is a close relationship between the two and if more gardaí are put on the beat.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the courts system works efficiently.  There appears to be need to appoint more judges so as to ensure a speedier administration of justice. It is clear that our courts should operate for longer periods.  The holiday periods should be shortened and the working day should be longer.  In referring to the courts it occurs to me that in this republican country the day of the wigs and gowns should be short-lived. Such paraphernalia of a by-gone age can intimidate ordinary members of the public.</P>
    <P>I accept it is only right that our courts give priority to criminal matters but civil work has been allowed to run into considerable arrears.  Any improvement of the criminal justice system should also mean an improvement in civil litigation. I understand that in our District Courts there is a considerable backlog of civil cases.  Apparently, there are not enough district justices to deal with those cases. The delay in hearing actions in the High Court has reached scandalous proportions. People have to wait years before their civil cases are heard.  In Kerry <Col N="1002" /> people have a choice of having their actions heard before Cork or Limerick juries.  In Cork the delay can be as much as five years while in Limerick the delay is not more than one year.  We depend in Kerry on doctors who work under the Southern Health Board and for that reason it is often necessary to adjourn cases to Cork.  That causes great inconvenience.</P>
    <P>One aspect of criminal justice that has not been properly dealt with in the Bill is the question of punishment, especially for offenders under 21.  Obviously it is no longer sufficient to send offenders to jail. A greater effort will have to be made to get at the root problem.  A system of community work should be encouraged. I am in favour of giving the Garda more powers to help them in their fight against crime on behalf of the community but they must be asked to become more involved.  In Tralee and other parts of Kerry gardaí have become very involved in station work thus being deprived of getting involved with the community. The Minister should consider relieving gardaí of such office work.</P>
    <P>The Garda meet many obstacles when dealing with criminals and I hope the Bill will go some way towards resolving that. We hear a lot of talk about the rights of criminals, but what of the rights of their victims?  We must ensure that those who have been robbed, assaulted or terrorised are protected and that those responsible for such offences are brought to justice. We must be satisfied that the provisions of the Bill are in the interests of the general public.  The Bill seeks to correct injustices committed against law-abiding citizens.  Its provisions should be clearly defined for the Garda so as to avoid any problems later or accusations regarding the interpretation of them.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed by many people about some of the provisions and I hope the Minister is able to allay their fears.  There are many people waiting in the wings for an opportunity to attack the establishment and that is one reason why it is imperative that the Bill be watertight. Those who are most vocal about the provisions of the Bill have a responsibility to shoulder.  While I welcome the introduction <Col N="1003" /> of the Bill, I must stress that it is essential that we proceed cautiously. Consequently, it is essential that we insert a provision to review its terms on an annual basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>In introducing the Bill the Minister, fairly and correctly, did not make any excessive claims for it.  He did not advance it to the House as being likely to cure the enhanced criminality from which the country has been suffering in recent years with a mounting tempo.  The Minister was wise not to make any such exaggerated claims.  Every armchair observer of society and armchair critic has his own ideas about the reasons for crime waves.  The study of crime waves, and the study of criminality, have formed a couple of complete self-contained sciences.  I am not a criminologist or a penologist and I do not intend posing as one, but I have a smattering of the subjects.  It can be said that some of the opinions which are commonly canvassed about criminality are not supported by any of the studies which have been carried out since this matter was first approached on a scientific basis, at least in this century.  One notion is that a period of hardship and of recession tends to encourage criminality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that we find a wave of criminality or a ripple in crime statistics parallel with the curve of general prosperity.  In the nineteenth century that measure was used by reference to a number of crude indexes such as the price of grain, bread and the minimum subsistance items necessary for livelihood.  That is no longer true in this century.  Even in periods of general prosperity in this century when, as a former Prime Minister of Britain used to say, people never had it so good, the crime rate instead of declining, as Victorian optimists might have supposed it would, advanced inexorably. Some of the explanations for that are based on the idea that with prosperity has come heightened aspirations and expectations and that they are spread around and made more urgent for people by the operations of the advertising media.  That <Col N="1004" /> is a reasonable enough suggestion which may have some validity for some people. It may be that people according as they get more prosperous are less careful of their property and that whereas once upon a time it would have been impossible to find in the average Ford Prefect or Ford Anglia car of my childhood or even of yours, Sir &mdash; although I think you are younger than I &mdash; people touring around the countryside looking for anything worth stealing, that is no longer the case. It is worth a criminal's while, or even the time of one who is only occasionally delinquent, when the police are stretched on security duties of all kinds and, as Deputy Foley says, even administrative duties, to break open a car and within a few minutes wrench out something which he can sell for £150 or £200.  I am not counting things which might be left in the back of the car such as fur coats or briefcases full of drugs.  Goods are accessible in a way they were not formerly.  In houses, even those by no means the preserve of the upper classes, can be found stealable and readily convertible objects. These things encourage criminality also, according to a widely held belief among criminologists.</P>
    <P>Some people would say &mdash; Deputy Flanagan would be among them &mdash; that a breakdown in family life and a general collapse of old-fashioned standards is also an accompanying feature which accounts for it, certainly in a country like ours.  I do not know the reason for it, but that view on the face of it has some validity. Perhaps it is due to organised religion being somewhat on the defensive and less sure of itself than it was 30 years ago, or to a moral decline of the kind that Deputy Flanagan would describe and castigate. Perhaps parents are not as attentive to what their children are doing as they were at one time, and that may not be their own fault.  Maybe it is because their own problems are so abominable and pressing and society does so little to support them and offer them the kind of warmth and shelter &mdash; I am speaking metaphorically &mdash; that was normal once, at least in the countryside.  The children get the short end of whatever affection or interest is in the household and that tends to drive <Col N="1005" /> them out of the household into minor delinquency which in the case of those unlucky, genetically or environmentally can become a major delinquency later.</P>
    <P>None of us knows what the roots of crime are.  We are trying to guess at them. I have mentioned two or three factors which are not my idea or Deputy Flanagan's but they correspond pretty well with the consensus of a large number of criminologists who have no political or any other axe to grind but who spend their life in the study of this social phenomenon. The Minister is as well aware of that as is anybody else and he did not present this Bill as likely to cure anything. He offered it merely on the basis that so far as the State could offer any help to the prevention, combating or even repression &mdash; that word is not popular now &mdash; of crime it should not be found wanting.  We should not be found guilty of lethargy in bringing laws up to date and making them capable of meeting the challenge which criminology presents today.  He put it on that modest basis and I would put it no higher than that.  No matter what we do in here with pieces of paper, it will not do a great deal to reduce criminality outside.  Certainly, it is possible to think up powers which will constrain criminals in one way or another by putting them for longer periods behind bars or by operating a system of quasi-internment which would put them behind bars before they got any further, so to speak, even without trial.  Some countries have such a system but nobody has schemed to have it here.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not done anything which goes remotely as far as warranting expressions of that kind, but he has produced here a fairly radical set of proposals which, if enacted, will alter substantially traditional forms of criminal justice here.  I do not regard myself as a very long-standing Member of the Dáil.  I am a baby politically compared to Deputy Faulkner or Deputy Harte but because of the rapid political turnover in here I seem to have moved into the senior end of the House.  Very shortly before I ran for the Dáil for the first time Deputy Micheál Ó Móráin was Minister for Justice in the unlucky administration of that <Col N="1006" /> time.  He produced a Criminal Justice Bill in 1967 which contained at least one of the proposals which the Minister has in front of the House today, and perhaps more than one, but I am not sure of the details and I have not consulted the old Bill.  The one which is identical is the idea that we should depart from the traditional notion of unanimous jury verdicts. If criminality can be reckoned in terms of the crude numbers of offences reported to the police, in those days it was about one-third of what it is now and public concern then was nothing like as urgent or panic-stricken as it is now.  The indignation industry inside and outside the media was not as well developed as it is now.  Mushroom societies for the protection of this and that to issue statements at the drop of a hat were not in quite the same proliferation in 1967 as we have come to experience today.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Minister is producing a Bill now which, unlike Deputy Ó Móráin's Bill, starts off with the advantage that he has the public instinctively on his side.  Deputy Ó Móráin did not have that and the relatively quiet-spoken and low key civil rights organisations which existed then &mdash; I was a vice-president of one of them &mdash; objected soberly, rationally and in an orderly way to many of the provisions of the Bill and we were joined by people in the media and so on who had no axe to grind.  With one thing and another the Bill had never got beyond the Second Reading before that Dáil was dissolved in 1969.  The new Dáil, even though dominated by the same Government who re-emerged from the election of that year, never re-introduced it.  The problem then was relatively small and protests were relatively muted, but the Government felt that encroachments on traditional forms of criminal justice and forms of criminal justice which tend to protect civil liberties were not worth the political price.  I do not intend to disparage in putting it that way.  I believe they saw the point and respected the objections which had been made and did not think that the benefit which the Bill might have conferred on the administration of criminal justice was worth making so many inroads on civil liberty.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1007" /> We are in a different situation now. The Minister has been man enough to grasp the nettle and recognise that fact and to do what many other Ministers have been mumbling about for many years, that is, bring on a Bill more radical in some respects than that of 1967 and put it before the House with an open mind willing to hear suggestions about it. He is meeting a House and a public opinion which are by instinct a great deal more receptive than they would have been 15 years ago.  Even the Fianna Fáil benches, who are as quick to make hay out of a political difficulty on this side of the House as ever they were, are in general in agreement with the purpose of the Bill and have not offered an opposition to it based on any sort of radical principle. There is a feeling all around the House that something must be done about criminal justice, and done quickly, particularly when we are dealing with a dimension of a problem which is not central to it, a dimension which has the same relation to criminality as applying a temporary field dressing or a temporary bandage to a wound before it is properly treated. This is a marginal dimension of the social problem we are facing.  To approach a measure like this with the idea that something simply has to be done irrespective of what that is, is bad.  I know that is not the attitude of the Minister or his Department. I know how many anxious hours have been spent on this and I am sure the same could be said about some of the Deputies on the far side of the House who were in the post now occupied by the Minister.  It is bad to pass something radical under the impulse of a national panic about crime.  We may find ourselves doing something that may seem a good idea, such as clobbering delinquents and putting them behind bars.  Many of these people may be roaming around free because of a technicality or because the old-fashioned liberal criminal law allowed them to escape through loopholes that we now propose to close.  It may seem a good idea to take some action about such matters, but we must consider whether we are doing damage to the fabric of the criminal system that it will not be too easy to repair.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1008" /> I know that when people talk on a Bill like this they must talk soberly.  I do not mean to raise a scare about the matter but it has to be recognised that the Minister is proposing, in the best of faith and after a lot of consideration, very radical reform of the criminal law.  Once those changes are in place it may not be so easy to dismantle them later.  It may be that the awful cycle of criminality &mdash; much of it related to the North of Ireland, to the corrosive hatreds and the many savage acts that have become associated with that part of the world &mdash; will subside.  It may be that the cycle will pass.  Sometimes I think that is the only thing we can hope for, that people will get tired of murdering one another, of carrying out robberies, of burning and destroying and of making life unbearable for many.  Relative to murder and savagery the wave of criminality here is petty and that may also pass or at least come within tolerable limits.</P>
    <P>It might be a good idea &mdash; it is not too late for the Minister to consider it &mdash; if we were a bit cautious about this Bill.  We could buy perhaps most parts of the Bill but we should put a time limit on it.  In a sense we are in a civil emergency and we should treat it as emergencies have been treated during the years by Governments, many of whom have been Governments of this colour.  I do not wish to upset Deputy Foley by mentioning the Civil War and I am sure he will believe me when I say I am not trying to make a political point.  When the Civil War subsided with all its bandwagon criminality &mdash; I am not talking of the people who were fighting for a political principle but I am referring to those who get into the act &mdash; the very stringent martial law powers which the Government had were dismantled and they were replaced by a Public Safety (Temporary Provisions) Act which, in a way, had its own death certificate stapled to it.  It lapsed after a few years and was replaced by less radical and more permanent legislation in 1926.</P>
    <P>In 1939 we had a most formidable set of emergency provisions, the preparation of which had begun in 1937 or 1938 at the time of the Czechoslovakia crisis, for dealing with war-time conditions.  The <Col N="1009" /> 1939 Emergency Powers Act spawned subordinate legislation under which the most dreadful things were done, at least judged in ordinary conditions.  Under these powers a military court was set up consisting of military officers and when they convicted someone of an offence they passed only one sentence and that was the sentence of death.  Under sentence of that court three or four men were shot.</P>
    <P>I mention these points just to show how far-reaching was that legislation but, of course, it was a war-time situation. The legislation had to be renewed by this and the other House every year.  It came before the Houses in the years between 1940 and 1945 and it eventually lapsed in 1946 and all that remains is a vestigial fragment in the form of some element of prices legislation.  In 1976 when this party were in power the Dáil was recalled in the middle of the recess after the British Ambassador was murdered.  The Government introduced an emergency powers Bill that had measures that would not have seemed radical by the standards of the 1930s or 1940s, let alone the 1920s. It was hotly opposed by the other side.  It provided for a seven-day arrest, whose purpose was much the same as that for the 20-hour arrest now proposed in this Bill.  The Act which is still in force contained section 2 which provided for extended arrest.  The Act stated that section 2 should remain in force only until the expiry of a period of 12 months beginning with the passing of the Act unless it was continued in force or was brought again into force by an order under the section.  That Act was signed by the President on 16 October 1976 and before the 12 months had elapsed the Government had changed.  On 16 October of the next year the Government of which Deputy Lynch was Taoiseach and Deputy Collins was Minister for Justice did not renew the section.  The Act is still on the Statute Book and the powers could be brought into operation again merely by the Government signing an order.  These powers were let fall into abeyance by the decision of the Government in 1977 not to renew the section.</P>
    <P>I am not making any point about that. <Col N="1010" /> Perhaps the Government were right to let it lapse.  There may not have been any need for it at that time, or at any time.  I am not arguing about that matter.  All I am saying is that as recently as 1976 this House passed emergency legislation to deal with what seemed to be a paroxysm of criminality.  I admit that the murder of an ambassador is just as foul as the murder of the most obscure private citizen north or south of the Border.  It is not the personality of the man that counts but, of course, the matter had political dimensions of a kind a Government could not overlook.  It seemed to be a provocation of the most extreme kind and there were also other things happening at the same time.  A member of the Garda Síochána was blown to pieces by these heroes, booby-trapped in a house not far from Portlaoise.  It was a ghastly murder that triggered off a series of events.  They led to political events that have nothing to do with criminal law.</P>
    <P>It is worth reminding the House that in the past we have had legislation which everyone recognised as radical, which nobody wanted to see made permanent. Everyone regretted the necessity for such legislation and we took account of that by making the legislation temporary. There are legal eggs that are difficult to unscramble.  There are some sections in this Bill that I can see could not easily be made temporary.  One might make them temporary but perhaps that would be an injustice because when the temporary period expired there might be a situation of injustice as between a man whose case had been caught on one side of the line and a man whose case had luckily fallen a day or an hour on the other side of the line.</P>
    <P>I admit there are powers in this Bill which it might not be easy to build into a scheme of temporary operation but I should like the Minister to consider to what extent this Bill in its entirety, or at least some parts of it, could be made temporary.  He certainly has the good wishes of the House and he might well have the total support of the House in trying some different form of criminal justice.  This will be a different system of <Col N="1011" /> criminal justice operating on principles that have never before been recognised in this country.  It would be a good thing if he would consider examining to what extent this radical departure from what has been traditional and from what worked well enough might be made to expire after 24 months unless continued in operation by resolution of both Houses.</P>
    <P>I believe there is goodwill on the part of this Government and I am willing to make the same presumption, for the sake of argument, in favour of whatever other Government might replace them.  If the Government saw the Bill in operation as an Act and found that something dreadful was happening under it &mdash; for example, that police misbehaviour was rampant under it, although I have no reason to suspect anything like that &mdash; the Minister and the Government would do well to consider taking the power to suspend the operation of some section of the Act, even within that two-year period.</P>
    <P>I take it for granted the Minister would not try to stand over behaviour under the Act which amounted to a breach of the rights of the ordinary citizen.  A person remains a citizen with rights even if he is a criminal behind bars.  The Supreme Court, following what was said by an American judge, held some months ago that there is no iron curtain separating people in prison from the Constitution. They have rights, as have people whose conduct is being criminally investigated. If they are duly convicted and sentenced for a crime known to the law, the exercise of a certain range of their constitutional rights must necessarily be suspended if they are put in prison but they remain citizens with rights, at least to the extent that is compatible with serving a sentence of imprisonment.  If the Minister found that, as a result of this Act, unfair procedures were being followed resulting in injustice, it would be his plain duty or the duty of any Minister to put a stop to those procedures.  A simple way of doing it would be by building into the Act a power vested in the Government to suspend immediately the operation of any rule which the Bill now contains.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1012" /> I am surprised that after all the talk about abuses of bail the Minister has opted for this method of reflecting the Government's very proper concern with it.  He has adopted the method of saying to a delinquent: &ldquo;All right, you are on bail but if you are convicted of a further offence while on bail you will be treated quite differently from the way you would have been treated had you not been on bail.  The mere fact that you are on bail will subject you to a heightened liability should you be convicted of committing an offence while on bail.&rdquo;  If I may say so respectfully, the section could have been more felicitously drafted.</P>
    <P>It would have been worth having a go at trying to re-establish something like the old bail rules which operated here from Purcell's case, I think it was, in the twenties until O'Callaghan's case in 1966. The latter case turned the law of bail upside-down.  Formerly it had been open to a court to refuse bail, in other words to order a person accused of an offence to be kept in custody until his trial if it seemed likely to the authorities that he would commit further offences if let out on bail.  That was the way the system worked until 1966.  I can see the problem about it.  It means imprisoning somebody on suspicion, merely because the police suspect him of being a bad character who could not be trusted to be let out on bail. He might go off and steal some more videos or something like that.  If it is a political, subversive offence in which the man may be a murderer, or the police may think he is a murderer, it is a much more serious matter.  Undoubtedly it is a system whereby there is an element of depriving a person of his liberty on suspicion. There is no blotting that out and I am not trying to minimise it or deny it.</P>
    <P>That system was shot down by the Supreme Court in 1966 for the very liberal reason that it was a form of preventive justice which they said was unknown to our system.  With the greatest respect to the Supreme Court, that is simply not true.  Our system has digested and thrived on systems of preventive justice in one shape or form ever since the State was set up.  I do not say that it has been necessary always to employ such systems or that <Col N="1013" /> they have always been in operation, but what is the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1940 but a system of preventive control which is still on the Statute Book, under which somebody can be indefinitely interned on the warrant of a Minister, even the Minister for Fisheries, on the grounds that the Minister is of the opinion that the person's continued liberty would be a threat to public security?</P>
    <P>That Act has not been used since about 1962.  Deputy Haughey, when Minister for Justice, was the last Minister in charge of the operation of that Act and it is only fair to say that it was during his term of office that the Act went out of operation. Certainly Deputy Lemass, as Taoiseach, operated that Act and locked people up indefinitely during the period of IRA activity &mdash; relative boy scout operations &mdash; when unfortunate misguided idealists like Seán South went up to the North and made frontal attacks on police barracks and lost their lives in the process.  During that period the Act was brought into force and people were interned without trial.  To say that this is unknown to our system of justice is simply not true.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that I spoke in that disrespectful and categorical tone about any of the courts.  I have not consciously said something that is not true.  All I am saying is that it is difficult to reconcile the pronouncement by the court that preventive justice is not part of our system when we have on the Statute Book a system which cannot be described otherwise even if it has not been used for 20 years.  Is it not also preventive justice to have a system whereby bail can be refused on the basis of the probability that the accused person will not stand trial?  A person who perhaps has no fixed domicile here and who the Garda may consider likely to skip bail may be refused bail.  I admit that that system of preventive justice is not as valuable to the people as the old system was but there is no point in denying that the old system, too, was one of preventive justice and did mean locking up someone on suspicion but when we are dealing with the panic level of criminality, as we are, we may be driven to such action.  We are being driven to include in the Bill <Col N="1014" /> measures of a kind that were not part of the law before.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I am surprised that successive Ministers since 1966 have not done something about the bail law by way of restoring and entrenching in legislative form the criteria that had been recognised from the twenties up to the sixties, having as much regard as possible to what was said in O'Callaghan's case and leaving it to the courts to shoot it down if they so wished.  Then, if the courts did so, it could have been put to the people, as some Taoisigh have said they would do, and, if accepted, written into the Constitution by way of some form of cover for a reasonable bail system.  The people have had their pockets picked for what was a useless referendum operation this year when something useful of the kind we are talking of might have been done. Instead, the people were set by the ears and we had a national debate, if one might refer to the cat fight in those terms, so foul and continuing for six months as not to bear thinking about.</P>
    <P>That referendum which cost £1 million was held merely to prevent Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael telling lies about each other.  Why could we not have combined with that referendum an appeal to the people to vote for the entrenchment in the Constitution of some reasonable provision in regard to pre-trial custody?  I am not talking about a tyrannic or a police State like provision but a provision of a kind that exists in other democracies and in other member states of the EEC.  Italy, though, is a notorious example of people spending very long periods in custody before trial.  That used to be the position in Germany, too.  It happened here occasionally also.  We had the case of the notorious Doctor Singer, whom the former Deputy Liam Cosgrave described as being out on the Costa Brava with his hat on the side of his head and a glass of brandy in each hand, toasting the Fianna Fáil lawyers who did not succeed in putting him behind bars.  However, Doctor Singer, who was not convicted, spent about 18 months behind bars during which time he taught himself the legal system of the country and acted as a porter barrel lawyer to every other <Col N="1015" /> inmate in Mountjoy.  He diffused the knowledge of our country's laws in a way for which one can be marginally grateful to him but at any rate he did remain in custody without trial for a long period.  It is true that in his case, as the Supreme Court said when he sought <i>habeas corpus</i> on the grounds of the length of his pre-trial detention, the charges against him were very numerous and complicated.  It might have been difficult for the State to prepare the case and have it ready to go before a jury in a much shorter time.  In the case of Dr. Singer there might have been grounds, with appropriate safeguards, for allowing him out on bail.  The safeguards, I presume, would be that he would report to the Garda regularly or that his passport would be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>In any case, when someone spends 18 months in custody awaiting trial, all reasonable limits in regard to pre-trial custody have been exceeded.  I am not trying to defend a situation of an unlimited period of pre-trial custody but there must be a middle way somewhere and it should not have been beyond the wit of the Department of Justice and of the political will of successive Governments to put this matter right, either by way of legislation or by way of appeal to the people on some appropriate occasion.</P>
    <P>I am not entirely happy about the method the Minister is choosing.  I accept that it may be frightening enough to deter but I am not sure if that is sufficient justification for it.  Let us take a situation in which there are two delinquents, one of whom has a record as long as my arm while the other has a much shorter record.  Let us say that the one with the shorter record is on bail while the other one is in custody.  If the one with the shorter record commits another offence while on bail his sentence ultimately is doubled but this will not happen in the case of the man who is in custody because he does not have the opportunity of committing another crime.  I am not sure that, either in the deep sense or in the constitutional sense of the word, that is fair.</P>
    <P>If I am reading the section correctly, it does not make clear that the new offence which is to be the basis for the consecutiveness <Col N="1016" /> of the sentences is to be an offence committed in the bail period in respect of the former offence alleged against the accused.  I presume the Minister means by the words &ldquo;or any sentence passed on him for previous offences&rdquo; any sentence passed on him for previous offences, he having been committed to bail in respect of the charge of that previous offence.  I am sure that what the Minister is trying to do is threaten someone who is on bail for offence X that, if he then commits offence Y and is convicted of the two offences, the sentences will be made to run consecutively; but as that is not clearly explained in section 9 perhaps the Department would have regard to it.</P>
    <P>I intended making some observations on other sections but I shall not delay the House in case the Minister wishes to get in to reply this evening.  Before Committee Stage there are a couple of points that the Department might have to regard. There is reference in a couple of places in the Bill to recordings and to the destruction of records but I cannot find anywhere in the Bill a safeguard that could be regarded as watertight, from the accused person's point of view, that the recordings would be immune from being tampered with.  We know that an ordinary tape can be snipped and changed around in such a way as to convey a wrong impression of a conversation.</P>
    <P>Needless to say I have no reason to suspect that the members of the Garda Síochána or any member of the Force would do such a thing but it has not been unknown in the past in some police forces.  An accused person and, for all I know, the people who will be attacking this Bill, if it ever reaches the Supreme Court or the High Court will be advancing the point that there can be no security for an accused person, at any rate so far as the Bill goes, that that tape has not actually been interfered with.  If an accused person denies that such a conservation took place in that form he would need some assurance that at least the tape had not been tampered with.</P>
    <P>To some extent the same problem arises in regard to the destruction of records.  He would need some assurance <Col N="1017" /> that before the records are destroyed no copies of them had been made.  Again, it is all very well for a blackmailer to say: &ldquo;I will give back the compromising photographs and the negative&rdquo;.  But nobody knows how many prints he may have made from the negative.  The wretched person who is being blackmailed may find himself paying the blackmail, getting back the negative and a print but, for all he knows, a thousand other prints may have been run off that negative.  I mention this, not through any suspicion that that kind of blackguardism, or that kind of disregard of the clear intent of the law, could be imputed to any member of the Garda Síochána &mdash; I hope and trust that is not the case &mdash; but an accused person who will have a closer acquaintance with the way the police operate may feel entitled to raise that objection, that he has not got that security, and may feel that the provisions offered here do not offer it to him.</P>
    <P>The last matter I want to mention contains the miscellaneous part of the Bill. Since there is a certain miscellaneous section, a certain ragbag of provisions with which I have no special fault to find or have anything much to say about, it would be a good thing and certainly would redress the balance to some extent of hard line which the Bill otherwise tends to convey if the Minister included a section which would have the effect of restoring the law on acquittals in criminal cases to what everybody supposed it was before the judgment in the O'Shea case decided by the Supreme Court in November of last year.  If I may just in a few words explain the point there: it was always taken to be the law here until recent times that if somebody was acquitted whether by a jury or after a summary trial the summons against him was dismissed by a District Justice, there was no appeal by the State against that acquittal or dismissal.  There is certainly a procedure in regard to the District Court dismissals whereby the State can bring up the question of whether the justice was correct in dismissing the charge and we had two very recent instances of that, in the cases of Garda Nangle and Mr. Pat O'Connor.  These were both <Col N="1018" /> instances brought to the High Court, under that procedure, in order to have a point of law decided.  But had the point of law gone against the defendants in those two cases they would have been back before the court again.  I am not so much concerned with the small beer of criminal litigation, although in a sense it should be a seamless garment, but it is a very serious thing when we start hearing from the Supreme Court that the Constitution has to be interpreted in such a way that appeals can be brought to the Supreme Court against the acquittal of a defendant.  The reason this arises is not because the Supreme Court are illiberal people who want to give the State the status of a cat in a game of cat and mouse &mdash; that is not the reason.  The reason is that one finds in Article 34.4.3. of the Constitution:</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court shall, with such exceptions and subject to such regulations as may be prescribed by law, have appellate jurisdiction from all decisions of the High Court, and shall also have appellate jurisdiction from such decisions of other courts as may be prescribed by law.</P>
    <P>That is what it says.  It goes on to say that exceptions may be made by law in the future, in other words, post-1937 exceptions from this appellate jurisdiction.  In other words, it is open to both Houses of the Oireachtas and to the President to enact a law which would take away from the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court certain categories of High Court decision, in fact all categories if they wished, except for ones involving the constitutionality of an Act, which is not in question here.</P>
    <P>No such exception has ever been made by law in the case of High Court decisions taking the form of a jury acquittal in the Central Criminal Court.  The Central Criminal Court is simply another name for the High Court when exercising its criminal jurisdiction.  Therefore, if, in the Central Criminal Court a jury finds a person not guilty and he is therefore acquitted and discharged by the presiding judge, that acquittal is a decision of the High Court within Article 34.4.3 of the <Col N="1019" /> Constitution and the Supreme Court have said &mdash; if language is to mean anything &mdash; that that acquittal must be appealable; in other words, that the prosecution is entitled to take that acquittal up to the Supreme Court, to reverse the acquittal and expose the accused man to another risk of having to run the same risk of trial all over again.</P>
    <P>This is a long day's work and I do not want to weary the House with it now. Perhaps the Minister would be disposed to consider such a proposal.  We could talk about it at greater length later; I am not going to lecture the House for an hour on the subject, but I hope I have succeeded in explaining in an nutshell what is the problem.  Formerly it was thought that the Constitution had made no difference to the old traditional rule whereby an acquittal was final, whereby a man could be tried for something once and if he got through a jury once, whether because the jury had completed their session and, on the merits and their evaluation of the evidence, pronounced a person not guilty, or because the judge at an earlier stage in the trial directed the jury to pronounce him not guilty because the evidence did not warrant any other conclusion, in those two cases always it was thought that the man could literally walk out of the dock a free man.  That is an English idea if you like.  I do not know what the English have done about it in their country since then, but it was always regarded as a basic principle of criminal law here that a person could not be tried twice on a similar charge.</P>
    <P>The characteristic of criminal justice by which an acquittal can be appealed against by the prosecution &mdash; therefore exposing the accused person to a second bout of anxiety and a second risk &mdash; is something we tend to associate with Eastern Europe, with regimes under which, please God, none of us will ever have to live.  I would be sorry to see that principle introduced here.  I want to make it clear yet again that the Supreme Court probably, man for man, do not want it introduced here either.  They have no option but to interpret the Constitution, as the Article of the Constitution clearly says <Col N="1020" />&mdash;&ldquo;... all decisions of the High Court, ...&rdquo;  The Supreme Court have said, whatever we may feel personally is right or wrong, we have to obey the Constitution, and there is no basis for distinguishing between an acquittal decision of the High Court and any other kind of decision of the High Court.  So the majority of the Supreme Court said that acquittals could be appealed against.  They did say, of course, that that did not mean that the whole thing should be thrown open, that they would restrict the reach of the appeal very narrowly, that they would not behave unfairly and so on.</P>
    <P>It is also true that, of the five judges, two dissented and dissented most powerfully from the majority.  If it is not a disrespectful thing to say I personally think that the two who dissented had the rights of it. I say that with unaffected respect for the three judges who were in the majority.  But the point is that the only people who can put this right are we in these Houses of the Oireachtas and the President.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a chance now &mdash; I know he is open-minded about this and all other things in this connection.  It could be done by a single section that I think I could draft on the back of an envelope as could anybody in his Department to remove that illiberal possibility, to restore the law to what it was always supposed to be, to adopt the attitude, if you like, now entrenching in statutory form the decision of the two judges, Judge Henchy and Judge Finlay &mdash; the President of the High Court who was sitting that day on the Supreme Court &mdash; in the liberal direction of trying a man once only on the same charge which had been thought &mdash; it now appears erroneously but which anyway had been understood &mdash; to be the law here ever since the State was founded.  I have spoken much longer than I had intended and I will conclude by wishing the Minister well with the Bill and with all his other work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to have been given the opportunity to say a few words on the Bill.  A measure of this kind had been demanded by the general public <Col N="1021" /> for a long time and many were beginning to lose faith in our seriousness about this whole matter.  The Bill is welcomed by the people in general.  I appreciate that some have expressed reservations about it but it is important that people take time to examine Bills and if they have reservations about them that they should voice them.</P>
      <P>There is another side to this whole matter of rights of the individual.  There is much talk about the rights of those who commit crimes: indeed they are the only people about whose rights we seem to be concerned.  Very rarely do we hear anything about the rights of the ordinary person to go about his business in a free unfettered way.  This Bill is aimed at restoring the balance.</P>
      <P>None of us wants to see people being the victims of bad laws and being incarcerated in the wrong, but we want to see those who commit crimes being prevented from getting around our laws.  I have been amazed at the voice of the legal profession, a voice with a vested interest in this area.</P>
      <P>Most of us here spent a few weeks canvassing in a Dublin constituency.  We had to knock on doors and found that people were afraid to answer them.  They spoke through a slit in the door and if they opened the door we found they had several locks.  Many of them were virtual prisoners in their own homes.  Many of them cannot even go to church because of their fear of being knocked down or mugged and robbed.</P>
      <P>Is that the kind of society we want?  We have heard about the concrete jungle and in this respect I wish to talk particularly about elderly people, without being emotive. Many of them in our cities cannot go about their business or do the ordinary things in life.  Many of them are afraid to walk in and out of their homes because they fear being mugged, being knocked down, being robbed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies stand up here to advocate the appointment of more gardaí.  There is no point in appointing more gardaí if we tie their hands behind their backs.  That is what happens.  The Garda found it nearly impossible to bring criminals before the courts and even if they succeeded the law <Col N="1022" /> was such that the criminals were able to laugh at the law and get around it.  That had been the position for a long time and it had to be stopped.</P>
    <P>The Minister has guaranteed a complaints procedure, so this Bill will not erode the rights of people in the way many speakers have suggested.  According to the complaints procedure, if people feel they are being hard done by, not being treated according to normal practice, they will have redress.  Surely that is a sufficient guarantee for those concerned about the rights of individuals.  I agree we should be concerned about people's rights, but not in a lopsided way. Apparently the rights of criminals had to be protected at all costs while those of ordinary citizens were trampled on. Therefore, the sooner this legislation is enacted the better.</P>
    <P>There is a laughable situation about stolen cars.  Every night hundreds of cars are stolen and those whom the Garda succeed in apprehending are charged with having taken the cars without the owners' consent.  Does anybody think of the tens of thousands of pounds worth of property involved in car theft?  Of course they are not charged with that crime because it might not stand up.  They laugh at the law.  They even go outside Garda stations taunting the police, asking them for a run, because they do not care whether they are caught or not.  Now under this legislation they can be charged properly and sentenced, and I suggest this will have a deterring effect.  We must consider the loss of life caused by stolen cars.  It was something we could not stand over.</P>
    <P>I believe this Bill will help to reduce crime.  People had begun to think that it was the thing to do to break the law, it was the profitable thing to do because the chances of being caught and convicted were negligible.  Of course, if they were caught they could claim free legal aid and laugh outside the courts.  The House would be remiss if it did not enact legislation such as this.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will make few if any changes in the Bill apart from technical or drafting amendments.  I suggest that the meat of the Bill should not be <Col N="1023" /> tampered with.  Left as it is, it will be an indication that we are serious in our efforts to protect the rights of our law-abiding citizens.  No matter where one goes, the maintenance of law and order is the main topic of conversation.  In urban areas people have been demanding that our streets be made safe.  The only way we can do that is to ensure that those who have been making them unsafe will be apprehended and dealt with in the strictest way.  The time is past when we can allow criminals to roam at will and do what they like.</P>

In his presence I accepted that challenge and made four efforts to raise the matter.  Now I may discuss this situation but I am confined to certain areas.  I believe it is impossible to discuss it without taking the group of companies into account.  Nevertheless, I am delighted to have this opportunity of doing so now.</P>
      <P>When we take the group of PMPA companies into account we realise it was wholly-owned by Irish investors who invested their money to help the Irish economy.  These people are now in a very delicate situation because their hard-earned savings are at risk.  The PMPA were one of the biggest companies in the country employing more than 2,000 people up to a few weeks ago.</P>
      <P>I want to deal with the closure of the garages and the redundancy situation. Last Wednesday afternoon, 17 out of 34 garage managers got phone calls from the administrator saying they should be at a meeting in Dublin at 10.45 a.m. on Friday week.  They were told the garages were being closed.  Some of these people, and one of them is in my constituency, tried to contact the local union official, a representative of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union.  Despite the fact that he was in the same town as the garage, the union official refused to meet the PMPA worker.  I want the Minister to tell the House whether a prior arrangement had been made between the Government, the administrator, Mr. Kelly, and the unions that no action would be taken when these closures were being forced.  This was a very unsatisfactory way for the administrator to get in touch with these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my constituency 20 people were affected, 18 of them married.  Sixteen of those 18 have mortgages from some of the bigger financial institutions not associated with the PMPA.  These people will not be able to make their repayments and they do not know if they will get their statutory redundancy payments or their holiday money.  I want the Minister to allay the fears of the 230 workers in the garages and the 130 workers in McCairns <Col N="1025" /> and other groups and let them know where they stand and what are their rights.</P>
    <P>The company specialised in insurance for many years and moved into the motor industry.  If they had confined themselves to these two areas they might not be in their present difficulties.  Because they invested in more risky projects, the group of PMPA companies are threatened.  As a businessman I appreciate the difficulty that Mr. Kelly faces.  He has a duty to consolidate as much of the company as possible and to hold together the PMPA insurance company and provident society.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out the effect of the closure of these subsidiaries on the PMPA insurance company.  There were no problems on the surface for the ordinary people in the PMPA group until a month ago.  Many people had taken out insurance with that company in good faith and they had special concessions granted.  I want to know if the vehicle recovery service, the car replacement service and the engineer's report service are still available to all members of the PMPA insurance company.  This is one reason why I wanted the Minister, Deputy Cluskey, to be here this evening because the closure of the subsidiaries has a major effect on the PMPA insurance company.</P>
    <P>When a company is in difficulties, if it is to be made solvent, or any of its subsidiaries are to be made solvent, the company should be managed in a prudent way.  At present there are people of 18, 19 and 20 years of age, accountancy students&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If that is the position I regret it but it is very difficult to deal with one without referring to the other.  The receiver's company is paid at the rate of £27.50 an hour.  These junior staff have come into these subsidiaries and have <Col N="1026" /> taken control.  They have ignored the other staff and management.  I appreciate that the legal right has been vested in them by the courts, but it is a very sad situation that inexperienced people can come in and take over a company&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>If these companies are to be made solvent and if there is to be any hope of securing the investment in these companies, it is necessary that senior expert accountants be sent into every subsidiary and not first or second year accountancy students who do not have any experience in controlling or managing companies.  I want to ask the Minister or anybody involved in business: &ldquo;Would you allow a teenager or a 20 year old inexperienced person to come in and take over your company?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I must explain to the Deputy that, in order to qualify for an Adjournment Debate, the matter being raised must be the responsibility of a Minister.  What the Deputy is now dealing with is not the responsibility of the Minister for Labour or the Minister for Tourism.  By virtue of an Act passed by this House, it is the responsibility of the administrator, who is responsible to the courts.  If any complaint is to be made about him it should be made to somebody who has an interest in the business or it should be made to the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate your point. I am highlighting the position.  It is very serious and it affects thousands of people. I want to go back again to the question of staff.  The commitment and loyalty of the PMPA to the nation and to the Government has always been exemplary. They paid all their taxes, their PRSI and their VAT properly and in time.  The Minister should make it clear that the workers whose taxes were deducted and whose payments were made will be compensated <Col N="1027" /> properly if they are to be made permanently redundant.</P>
      <P>The PMPA company invested money in a special pension fund for the staff. Are the investments in that pension fund safe and secure, and will the staff benefit from them?  If not, what is the position of those investments?  There were 9,000 depositors in the PMPA Provident Society and in the region of 2,000 depositors with the Irish Benefit Building Society, making a total of 11,000 depositors.  If these 11,000 depositors came from an average of five, at least 50,000 people are affected by the liquidity situation in the PMPA group.  I should like the Minister to tell the House whether the investments in the provident society are safe and secure.  If not, can he give a commitment that his Government will make every effort to ensure that genuine people who invested money will be compensated?</P>
      <P>Other companies under much more stringent law cannot accept money from minors.  The PMPA were able to accept money from minors and, as a result, parents making investments for their children's future invested money in the PMPA society.  They are not sure whether those investments are now null and void.</P>

      <P>It is very difficult to deal with one matter without referring to the other.  I appeal to the Minister to give a <i>de facto</i> guarantee that the staff in the subsidiary companies who are now redundant &mdash; and most of these companies are in the country areas, three in my own province and one in my own constituency &mdash; will receive their proper redundancy, that their pension investments are safe and that whatever money they are entitled to through the investments they made in the PMPA companies will be honoured <i>in toto</i> by the Government and <Col N="1028" /> that they will ensure that the administrator of the company, Mr. Kelly, will pay the staff what they are entitled to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>If I were on the other side of the House &mdash; and I was on that side more than I was on this side &mdash; I would raise this matter on the Adjournment.  In my constituency we have exactly the same problem of people who have been laid off as a result of what happened to the PMPA.  Therefore, I have every sympathy with the case the Deputy has made for the employees of the company, and people who have invested their money in the company thinking they were helping the Irish economy by investing in an Irish company with Irish employees.  I am totally at one with the Deputy in his approach to the problem and in trying to do what he can for the staff of the company and the subsidiaries.  Nevertheless, I am confined in my remarks to the operations of my Department in this instance, that is, redundancies and what follows as a result.</P>
      <P>Three hundred and forty-eight employees of various PMPA companies throughout the country were laid off last Friday, 25 November.  They had received notice of lay off on Friday 18 November 1983.  It is understood that this action was undertaken by the administrator following a detailed examination of the PMPA Group subsidaries which indicated that many were incurring significant, ongoing losses without any realistic prospect of recovery.  The administrator has pointed out that under the legislation it is his duty to preserve the assets of the PMPA Insurance Company and to protect it from the ongoing cash drain which was occurring because of the losses in the subsidaries.</P>
      <P>The bulk of the lay-offs affected the PMPA Garage Division, accounting for some 234 employees; other PMPA subsidaries accounted for the remainder, 114 persons.  Accordingly, the total number of persons laid off on Friday last was 348. The PMPA Garage Division consists of a total of 31 garages of which 17 were closed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Discussions between the administrator and trade unions representing the <Col N="1029" /> workers have taken place and further discussions have been arranged.  The administrator is making arrangements to issue statutory redundancy notices to all employees affected by the lay offs tomorrow. These notices will expire on 16 December 1983.</P>
    <P>I should point out that some employees to whom these notices will issue would, on the basis of their service with their separate companies, be entitled to longer periods of notice and I have been given to understand that in these cases the administrator proposes to make additional payments in lieu of notice.</P>
    <P>I am taking all possible steps to ensure that the employees in question who will be made redundant will receive their full statutory entitlements and I have no reason to believe that they will not receive those entitlements.  Officers of my Department are in contact with the administrator of the PMPA group of companies and he is fully aware of the position regarding the statutory entitlements of the employees.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has referred to matters to which I cannot reply because they are not covered by the operations of my Department. He referred to contributions to the pensions fund.  I am sorry, but this is a matter for the administrator, as are the moneys paid into the building societies. Any investment made in the company is also a matter for the administrator.  I am sorry I cannot expand on what will be the outcome in that area.</P>
    <P>I cannot tell the Deputy the position with regard to the vehicle recovery service and so on.  I will look into it and let him know as soon as possible.  Because of the amount of notice given to me I cannot give him that information at the moment.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has asked me to give guarantees. I can certainly tell him here and now that statutory redundancy payments, minimum notice and holiday pay will apply to the members of the PMPA garages division who have received their statutory redundancy notices.  That, at least, is information which the Deputy will be keen to have and which will be of some little help to those who have been the victims of this unfortunate demise of <Col N="1030" /> the PMPA garage division, in so far as it affects the 17 garages.  That is as far as I can guarantee, where my Department are concerned.  It is of some benefit to know that that will be the case and I can give that assurance to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>The other questions which he has asked are either matters for the administrator or, in the case of the vehicle recovery service, something on which I shall get the up to date information for him as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Tracey Mr. N. Tracey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Tracey</NameTxt>
      <P>There was one very relevant question which the Minister has not answered.  That was whether or not there was a prior arrangement between his Government, his Department, his administrator and the unions about the way in which these closures would be brought about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any agreement whatsoever on this basis.  I can state categorically that, where my Department are concerned in dealing with industrial relations, no such agreement was made between Government, unions and the company as to the way lay-offs or closures were to be made.  The discussions at present continuing between the unions and the administrator is an area in which the unions and the administrator have their own rights under industrial relations law.</P>
      <P>There has been no conspiracy of any sort in this area to bring about any closures in any sector of the company.  It is purely the administrator's decision and that is the only answer that I can give.</P>

      <P>In a statement on the Estimates of my Department, delivered to the Dáil on 6 July last, I expressed what I conceive to be, and to have been from the beginning of this State's existence, the essence of its policy of military neutrality.</P>
      <P>The ideological divide between East and West is an enduring reality of international life and we naturally find ourselves closest to those Western countries with whom we share common values of pluralistic democracy.  All of our partners in the European Community are members of a military alliance but, as I said in my statement on 6 July, we find no reason to believe that Irish non-membership or membership of the Atlantic Alliance makes, or will make in the foreseeable future, any crucial difference to the overall security of the region in which we live. We do find, however, that our position outside military alliances enables us to play a modest but constructive diplomatic role as a neutral country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that this position has facilitated the pursuit of a foreign policy whereby we contribute effectively to the achievement of international peace and security by speaking out independently in the United Nations and elsewhere on such important matters of international concern as the need to curb and reverse the arms race and the problems of Southern Africa.  In our approach to specific international problems we consistently seek to have the principles embodied in the UN Charter upheld.  As regards deprivation or abuse of human rights, we do not shrink from identifying and seeking to help redress such instances, whether <Col N="968" /> they occur in Afghanistan, in South Africa, in Central America or elsewhere.</P>

      <Col N="969" /> The preliminary report for the overall mid-Galway Regional Scheme, covering zones 1 to 4 inclusive, was submitted to my Department in September, 1977 and approved in principle in April 1978.</P>
    <P>Stage 1 of the mid-Galway scheme provides headworks for the supply of water to zones 1 and 2 and is nearing completion at a cost of £1.45 million.  It is intended that the distribution pipelines will be primarily laid by proposed private group water schemes, including the proposed mid-Galway group scheme for which technical documentation is at present being prepared by Galway County Council.</P>
    <P>My Department suggested to Galway County Council that the preparation of contract documents for the zone 3 scheme might be deferred in view of the lack of major group schemes proposals and the long term nature of the proposals to augment water supplies to Athenry. However, an advance section of the zone 3 pipelines has been laid as part of Derrydonnell group water scheme.  In addition, short term improvements in the Athenry water supply are being carried out under the council's small schemes programme 1983 at an estimated cost of £15,000.</P>

      <P>Medical cards issued in 1982 to those holding contributory pensions were reviewed in January 1983 in accordance with the guidelines set down for determining eligibility.  As a result of this review the individual concerned was found to have an income considerably in excess of the guidelines and was accordingly notified by the health board on 3 March 1983 that his medical card was withdrawn.  Any charge for general practitioner <Col N="984" /> services since that date is a matter between the individual and his doctor and the health board have no liability.</P>

      <P>(1) The decision to build a new maternity wing at Galway Regional Hospital was based on the need to alleviate the problem of overcrowding in the existing accommodation and also on the need to upgrade facilities there; (2) The estimated cost of planning, building and equipping this development is of the order of £4 million at current prices; (3) It is expected that building work will be completed by the end of December 1983; (4) The scheme comprises an out-patients department, admission suite, delivery suite, a special care neo-natal unit and an administration department together with a 31-bed ward block; (5) and (6) The Western Health Board has requested 75 additional staff to service the new extension. However, in common with all other health agencies, the board must operate within existing financial and staffing constraints. Accordingly any additional staff required must be provided by redeployment. While parts of the delivery suite <Col N="985" /> and of the neo-natal unit have been put into use in this way the commissioning of the total development, which is the board's highest priority, can only take place when further necessary redeployment measures are taken.</P>

She appealed against this disallowance but following oral hearings of her case the disallowance was upheld from 9 September 1982 to 30 November 1982.

      <P>Under Irish law a divorce which is effected or recognised as valid under the law of a foreign country in which the parties are domiciled is recognised as a valid divorce.  Where such a divorce takes place, the parties are no longer regarded as married persons under Irish law.  In this jurisdiction, the domicile of both parties is taken as being that of the husband.  The divorce obtained by the late husband of the person <Col N="991" /> concerned was therefore accepted as being valid and she cannot be regarded as his widow for the purpose of eligibility for widow's pension.  She is however in receipt of single woman's allowance from the Department at the maximum rate since May 1982.</P>
      <P>The review referred to by the Deputy related to a specific case in which the circumstances were different.  In the present case the husband was domiciled outside the country when he obtained the divorce.  The legal position in these circumstances is that the divorce is valid under Irish law and when the husband died the person concerned was not his legal widow.  In the previous case the husband was at all times domiciled in Ireland and the divorce was obtained in England by his wife.  In these circumstances the legal position is that the divorce is invalid under Irish law and when the husband died his wife was accordingly his legal widow.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): I am informed by the Garda authorities that there have been a number of attacks in recent months on county council rent collectors in the Tallaght area and that this is a matter of particular concern.  Special measures are being taken by the Garda, in consultation with the representatives of the rent collectors, <Col N="994" /> in an effort to combat this type of crime.  As the House will appreciate, the specific measures being taken are a matter for the professional judgment of the Garda Síochána and must, moreover, be kept confidential as publication of details of the measures would militate against their effectiveness.</P>
