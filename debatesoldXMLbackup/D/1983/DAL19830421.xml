    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>: It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 1, all Stages, 2 and 7 (resumed).  By agreement, the proceedings on item No. 2 will be brought to a conclusion at 2.30 p.m., if not previously concluded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>: I wish to raise two points with the Taoiseach.  Would he be prepared to acknowledge that the Order of Business before us today really amounts to nothing and that in fact we are wasting our time here today?  Would he make some statement about the legislative programme <Col N="1544" /> of the Government?  Is there any legislation on the stocks or will we from now until the summer recess be dealing with minor technical matters of the sort we have on the Order Paper today?  Is the Taoiseach prepared to make any statement or to say anything to us about the unprecedented flood of leaked documents, which we learned about in our newspapers this morning?  Would he agree that it discloses a very dangerous and unhappy state of affairs that the most confidential documents of this sort can be made available to Members of this House who are not entitled to receive them and to people in the media generally? Would he further acknowledge that his Government have perhaps set a very dangerous precedent in this regard and that the old Irish sean fhocal filleann an feall ar an bhfeallaire is not entirely inappropriate in this situation?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>: The first point raised by the Leader of the Opposition is quite in order for the Order of Business. The second point raised by the Leader of the Opposition regarding leaked documents is hardly in order.  It is certainly not in order beyond a brief question, which has been made, and a very brief reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>: My brief reply is that I share the concern of the Leader of the Opposition about the fact that these documents have been leaked.  With regard to the Order of Business for today the matters are ones that the Dáil has to deal with.  The Dáil will have a heavy load of legislation between now and the summer recess.  The Finance Bill will be the first major item but there are a number of other matters to be dealt with before that. Consultations between the Whips will, as I said yesterday, take place on this legislation and how it can be got through the Dáil by the time the Summer recess takes place.  There are a number of very substantial measures involved and we will have some difficulty in getting through them all in time.  I can reassure the Leader of the Opposition on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>: Could the Taoiseach at <Col N="1545" /> this stage give us some indication of what these measures are and what the difficulties in regard to them are that he refers to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>: There are a number of difficulties.  Like all measures they have to go through the process of approval with the Government in relation to heads of legislation, drafting, agreement by the Government and submission to the House.  The process is underway in respect of these measures, which are at different stages.  As I said, I am anxious that the Whips should get into consultation about them.  We can give an indication of the measures which we see as likely to arise and which are important to get through.  I suggested yesterday that this should be done through the Whips in the ordinary way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is the Taoiseach talking about measures which have not yet been processed through the Government machinery?  Is he talking about measures that yet have to be put to the Government and subsequently drafted by the parliamentary draftsman?  If that is so, what in heavens name have the Government and the bunch of Ministers been doing for the last four months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>: Some measures have been approved by the Government and others have yet to come to the Government. They are ones which we are more than happy to discuss with the Whips, as I said.  The last rhetorical question is one to which I think the answer should be fairly evident from the amount of activity which has taken place and the problems we have had to resolve in the wake of what the previous Government left behind them.</P>

      <P>: Arising out of the information given to the House yesterday by the Taoiseach that he intends to appoint an electoral commission in the near future, <Col N="1546" /> could he inform the House if this electoral commission will be established under the existing Act of the Oireachtas or whether he intends to introduce a new Bill changing the terms of reference and the composition of the proposed electoral commission?</P>

The leaked documents seem to indicate that there is some difficulty in relation to that area.  Perhaps the Taoiseach could clarify the position for us now.  Will we have it in time for the weekend so that we can study it for next week?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a technical one.  Its purpose is to clarify the law in relation to the determination and making of rates by local authorities and to ensure the validity of rates determined or made in recent years.  Perhaps Deputies would bear with me while I explain the background and details of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities have raised questions recently about the timescale within which local authorities must make the rate. Section 29 of the Local Government Act, <Col N="1550" /> 1946, requires that a rate be made &ldquo;either immediately prior to or at the beginning of each local financial year&rdquo;.  A later enactment&mdash;the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955 &mdash; reinforced this by requiring local authorities to prepare estimates prior to the beginning of the year to which they relate.</P>
    <P>The derating of domestic dwellings and certain other property in 1978 created a different situation.  Deputies will be aware that the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act of that year gave a power of direction to the Minister for the Environment in regard to the level of rate poundage increases.  The local authority estimates cycle therefore had to await decisions on national budgetary measures which were generally not made until the beginning of the calendar year and, in the exceptional circumstances of this year and last, until well into the year. The 1978 Act recognised this problem and purported to deal with it.  Section 14 of that Act provided that a local authority could prepare an estimate in the financial year to which the estimate relates notwithstanding the contrary provisions of the 1955 Act.  The 1978 Act went further. It allowed local authorities to spend up to one-half of the previous year's budget pending the adoption of the estimate and rate.  The 1978 Act, therefore, clearly envisaged and provided for the estimates cycle taking place in the year to which the estimate relates.  Moreover, local authorities must prepare their estimates in a period prescribed by the Minister by order.  Ministerial orders in recent years have set estimates periods which have ended as late as 15 May.  The preparation of estimates is an essential prelude to the making of the rate.  Nevertheless, local authorities have asked that the law be clarified as regards consistency in the provisions relating to the preparation of estimates and the making of rates.</P>
    <P>Part of the urgency in relation to the Bill arises from the fact that local authorities are already in the process of determining and making the rates for this year and it is desirable that the law be clarified urgently.</P>
    <P>I should say that I would prefer that <Col N="1551" /> local authorities should be allowed to prepare estimates and make rates much earlier than in recent years &mdash; preferably before the commencement of the financial year.  This makes for better budgetary planning and earlier flow of rates and other revenues.  This Government have as an objective the bringing forward of the national estimates cycle and this will facilitate the setting of earlier estimates cycles for local authorities.  The timing of the two most recent general elections has meant that this year and last the estimates cycles have been much later than one would have wished for.  The main purpose of the Bill is to deal with that situation and to remove any doubt about the validity of the rates for those years.  It will not in any way hinder the adoption of an earlier cycle for further years.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>: We are prepared to accept this Bill without any divisions.  We recognise that if legitimate doubts exist there is need to remove them as soon as possible. I understand the Department's attention was drawn to these doubts by the courts and that there is grave concern at any delay in implementing the provisions of the Bill which, as the Minister said, is designed to dispel doubts which may exist.</P>
      <P>It would have serious consequences for local authorities if a case could be proved that rates made under the 1978 Act were not legally payable due to the technicality which the Minister has outlined.  As the House will recall, the 1978 Act was introduced by a Fianna Fáil Government and we fully support that Act, the principle feature of which was to remove the obligation to pay domestic rates.</P>
      <P>Section 14 of the 1978 Act overrides the 1955 Act, but if doubts have been expressed as to whether it also overrides the 1946 Act then we readily consent to this Bill which is designed to remove those doubts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to delay the House much longer but I would like to take this opportunity to ask the Minister to explain some procedural matters.  It would be helpful if he could inform the House of the time scale for the adoption and making <Col N="1552" /> of rates.  I would like him to give an assurance that section 1 of this Bill will not result in a local authority being able to postpone indefinitely the adoption of estimates and the consequent striking of the rate.  Section 1 states that the power of a local authority to determine and make a rate shall be validly and effectually exercisable at any time in the local financial year to which the rate relates. That leaves the matter very open.  Any time could mean the autumn or even up a very broad scope which is contrary to the principle which the Minister enunciated in his statement that he wishes to have local authority estimates prepared at a much earlier time.  We all agree it would be preferable if the estimates could be prepared before the start of the financial year and we recognise the difficulties which have arisen in recent years because of the dates when general elections were held and the effect that had on Departmental Estimates.</P>
    <P>I would also like the Minister to clarify the position of local authorities who may refuse to impose what they consider to be penal charges which are now being reccommended by county managers.  Of course, these recommendations are being made by the managers at the behest of the Minister for the Environment.  Cork Corporation have already refused to accept the charges proposed by the manager there.  Limerick Corporation are in a similar position.  Many local authorities have not yet got to the stage where they are obliged to make decisions on the estimates being brought before them.  I would like the Minister to clarify whether, in present circumstances, a county manager can threaten the members of his local authority that they can be dissolved by ministerial order if they do not comply with the charges which he is suggesting.  I would like the Minister to spend some time on that as I do not believe the manager has the power to impose such charges at present, certainly in regard to charges for the supply of water in urban areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister informed me this week in reply to a parliamentary question that no power exists under which local authorities <Col N="1553" /> could charge for the supply of water to households in the urban authority area although we know that county councils have been charging in most cases up to now for that service.  Why is it necessary to impose new charges?  Surely the Minister has an obligation under existing legislation to recoup local authorities fully for the domestic rate relief that they are required to give.  The last Coalition Government in their 1982 Estimates left the local authorities short by about £12 million of the amount necessary to recoup fully the rate reliefs which they were required to give.  In reply to Question No. 673 of 19 April 1983 the Minister stated that the allocation to local authorities in 1983 is adequate for their continuation of normal services.  Why, therefore, if no shortfall exists in these allocations, is it necessary for local authorities to introduce new charges in 1983?  Everybody is well aware of the heavy impositions on the community through PAYE, PRSI, VAT and many other forms of charges which the Government have sought to introduce.  We have seen the community's reaction already on the streets to these high levels of taxation. The Minister must be aware that the charges which he is imposing will be very strenuously resisted at local authority level.  It is a matter, of course, for each local authority to decide on the financing of the services within their area, taking into account the State subvention and the obligation on the Minister to recoup local authorities the domestic rate reliefs and also the agricultural rate.</P>
    <P>The House will recognise that there is a temptation to open this whole area but I expect we will have an opportunity to do that when the Minister introduces his promised Bill in regard to extending the powers of local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>: In reply to Deputy Molloy's request in relation to the striking of the rate, I assure the Deputy that local authorities will wish to strike a rate as early as possible because this will result in a better and earlier cash flow for the local authorities.  This Bill deals mainly <Col N="1554" /> with the exceptional circumstances of the past two years where there have been delays in striking rates.  In relation to the making of the rate, the normal procedure is that the estimate is prepared by the manager to be adopted at the estimates' meeting of the council.  This meeting must be held within a period prescribed by ministerial order but it can be adjourned to any date which is within 21 days of the date of the initial meeting. this means that the rate will have been determined either within the period prescribed by the Minister or at least 21 days after the end of that period.  I do not see any possibility of the striking of the rates being adjourned <i>ad infinitum</i>.  As it is in the interests of councils and local authorities to strike a rate at the earliest possible date, I am sure this will be achieved.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy went into the wider area of local charges for the provision of services.  I do not intend to go into this in great detail today because we will be repeating the discussion within a matter of weeks as I hope to have a Bill before the House at a very early date giving wider powers to local authorities in relation to their raising of charges.  I am somewhat amazed to hear Deputy Molloy questioning the proposed legislation to allow for charges and I would like to restate the situation for his benefit&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>: I questioned the level of charges and why it is necessary to introduce any further charges at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>: It was necessary to introduce charges because of the shortfall in the provision of the Estimates which were made by the outgoing Government last November.  The Deputy is aware that a sum of £97 million was not provided for in the Department of the Environment and it was necessary, in the course of this budget, to provide an extra £31 million. The normal charges which would be increased in the annual cycle will be raised as usual and the power and discretion for urban authorities to charge for water will be in the new Bill which will be before the House in a matter of weeks. In the course of the introduction of that Bill, we will have a wider opportunity to <Col N="1555" /> discuss the whole question of local authority finances and the long-term proposals which I have in mind for those.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Bill put through Committee, reported without amendment, and passed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of the report of the Working Party on the Register of Electors.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to open this debate on the report of the Working Party on the Register of Electors.</P>
      <P>The working party were established in June 1982 by my predecessor as Minister for the Environment.  The impetus which led to their establishment was a fairly general level of dissatisfaction with the standard of accuracy of the 1981-82 register of electors on which, as Deputies will recall, two general elections to Dáil Éireann were held.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference given to the working party required them to examine and make recommendations on the registration process with a view to effecting a real improvement in the standard of accuracy of the register of electors. The working party were also asked to make recommendations on a scheme of postal voting for the disabled and other persons who may be unable to vote in person at an election and on access to polling stations for disabled persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The membership of the working party consisted of public service officials with experience in the registration of electors and the conduct of elections.  Two were officers of the Department, four were local authority officials, two were county registrars and one a county sheriff.  I have already conveyed my thanks directly to the members of the working party.  I <Col N="1556" /> would like to take this opportunity to record publicly my appreciation of the work which they have put into the preparation of this report.  I am sure that members of the House will wish to be associated with this expression of appreciation.</P>
    <P>As the report indicates, submissions were invited in the national press from interested bodies and as a result a substantial volume of submissions was received and considered.  A list of the individuals and organisations who made submissions will be found in the second appendix to the report.  I think it appropriate to record my gratitude to the people and the organisations concerned for their public-spirited attitude in taking time and trouble to prepare submissions.</P>
    <P>Immediately on receipt of the report the Government directed that it should be published in full and laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  We also decided, in view of the subject matter and nature of the report, that Government time should be made available as early as possible for a full debate on it. To ensure that this debate would be informed and constructive, I arranged for copies of the report to be forwarded to each Member of the Oireachtas as soon as the printed edition was available.</P>
    <P>Where electoral matters are concerned, touching as they do on the very essence of the democratic process, it is important to have as much agreement as possible on procedures and, in particular, on any changes which are contemplated in those procedures.  It seemed to us highly desirable, therefore, before formulating any firm proposals based on the recommendations in the report of the working party, that the Dáil should be consulted and Deputies given an opportunity of expressing their views.  For me it will be of great benefit in preparing proposals to be fortified by the opinions and advice of Deputies.  I would like to assure the House that any suggestions made will receive full consideration.</P>
    <P>The principal recommendations of the working party are summarised in chapter 2 of the report and it is not necessary for me to repeat them.  However, I would like to make a number of points which I <Col N="1557" /> hope will be of interest in the context of this debate.  Legislation would be required to implement some of the recommendations in the report while others could be implemented by regulations or administrative action.  It will probably be necessary to proceed in stages.  The recommendations regarding the register of electors, in particular, will involve detailed consultation with registration authorities and county registrars.  The recommendations in this area envisage a revised, shorter time-scale for the preparation of the register, the publication of electors lists instead of a draft register and an intensification of the field inquiries. Before formulating final proposals it will be essential to consult with these authorities, who will be responsible for the implementation of any changes, as to the implications of the recommendations in terms of administrative arrangements, manpower and so on.  These consultations are now getting under way.</P>
    <P>A comment may be appropriate on the role of registration authorities &mdash; the county councils and county borough corporations.  Inevitably, at election time the wrath of politicians, the public, the newspapers falls on the registration authorities for any shortcomings in the register.  In this connection the report makes interesting and instructive reading. It reminds us that the vast majority of qualified persons are correctly registered and that the number who are not registered, or are incorrectly registered, represents a tiny proportion of the total electorate.  It draws attention to the relative lack of resources available to registration authorities and points out that many of the so-called errors found in the register are not errors at all but arise out of the nature of the registration process. While registration authorities must not be complacent about their performance, it should be said that generally they do a good job in difficult conditions.  What we need to consider is the scope for sensible measures to improve the situation on lines recommended in the report.</P>
    <P>In relation to postal voting, the extended system of voting by post which is recommended will have to be examined <Col N="1558" /> carefully, particularly from the point of view of avoiding abuse.  We recall that at the 1974 local elections postal voting facilities were available to any elector who was unable to vote in person by reason of his occupation, absence from the address where he was registered, illness or physical disability, or of his employment by a returning officer in connection with an election.  A total of 30,689 persons applied to vote by post representing 1½ per cent of the electorate. From the administrative point of view the system operated satisfactorily but many public representatives expressed serious reservations about it.  Several Deputies put on the record of the Dáil their belief that there was widespread abuse.  This whole area will have to be looked at carefully in the context of any extended system of postal voting.  What must be done is to devise arrangements which strike a sensible balance between the desirability of providing postal voting facilities for those who need them and providing reasonable safeguards against abuse.</P>
    <P>Access to polling stations by disabled electors is an area in which we would all like to see improvements.  The working party, having drawn attention to the constraints, make some interesting suggestions, in particular, the possibility of transferring the disabled person's vote to a more accessible polling station.  Postal voting for the disabled would do much to remedy the problems arising, but the need remains to consider whether special measures may be feasible to facilitate those disabled who may wish to continue to vote in person rather than by post.</P>
    <P>As elected representatives, matters affecting the electoral procedure are particularly our concern.  The problems relating to the register, postal voting and access to polling stations have been analysed with commendable thoroughness by the working party, but it is for the Oireachtas to decide what should be done.  The purpose of today's debate is to get the views of the Members of this House so that account can be taken of them in preparing firm proposals.  I look forward to hearing these views and, again, I assure the House that all views <Col N="1559" /> forthcoming from Members will be carefully weighed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>: I have been a good many years a Member of this House and I cannot recall any previous occasion where a report was circulated to Deputies and brought for debate before the House itself within one week of the report being made available to the Members.  I am also very disappointed at the Minister's contribution in which he has given no indication whatsoever, as far as I can make out, whether the Government are accepting the recommendations in the report.  I cannot see what useful purpose the debate will have being held so soon after the publication of the report without the benefit of the Government's intentions being made available to the House.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the Government were anxious to give the House an opportunity to debate this as soon as possible. Quite a number of Deputies have not even had an opportunity to read this report yet.  This was the reason for my leader's comments earlier on that what this House is being asked to discuss today in unreasonable.  There is no great urgency that the matter should be brought at this stage before the House. The only reason the Whips asked for our agreement seems to be that the Government had no other legislation, no other matter of great public importance which they thought Dáil Éireann should consider at this stage.  It is extraordinary that this should be the view of the Government. As spokesman on this side of the House, I must record our dissatisfaction at not being given adequate time to study the report.  Naturally, as spokesman I read the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like also to go on record to thank the chairman and members of the working party for the work they did, but it is rather too much for the Minister to say that the purpose of today's debate is to get the views of the Members of this House so that account can be taken of them in preparing firm proposals.  I am certain a large number of Government Deputies have not yet fully studied the contents of this report.  I have said enough about that.  In my view we are <Col N="1560" /> merely filling in time and it is unfortunate that the time of this House should be used in this way.</P>
    <P>The working party were established in June 1982 by the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy R. Burke.  As Fianna Fáil spokesman for the Environment, I would like to express the appreciation of my party to the chairman and the members of the working party for the efficient way they carried out their duties. I believe, from the hurried examination I have made of the report that their recommendations are of great value and, in the main, should result in substantial improvements, first, in the standard of the register of electors, second, in the proposed extension of the postal voting and, third in regard to improving access to polling stations for disabled and elderly people but I would like to have heard which recommendations the Minister considered should have been implemented.</P>
    <P>People who contest elections, work for candidates at election time and canvass on a house-to-house basis during election campaigns, will be aware of the serious dissatisfaction about the inaccuracies in electoral registers in recent years.  In some cases whole streets have been omitted and people who had been included on the register of electors since reaching the qualifying age, having been on the register for may be 20 or 30 years, were shocked and angry to find that, for no good reason their names were omitted and they were denied the opportunity of casting their votes.  In many cases people have gone to the trouble of examining the draft register of electors and on noticing that their names were not included, making proper claims and having them heard at the revision court, presided over by the county registrar, and then finding that their names have still been omitted from the official register and they have no redress.  That is a cause for very serious complaint.</P>
    <P>The working party have identified one of the reasons for these extraordinary omissions as being the necessity to print <i>in toto</i> the draft register and then reprinting it in its final form.  That double printing of all the names on the register &mdash;<Col N="1561" /> over two million people &mdash; will result in some printers errors being made.  The suggestion to drop the draft register and publish a list of omissions and names to be added and deleted is a sensible proposal.</P>
    <P>We are debating this subject without having heard the proposals to be put forward by the Minister or his Department. The working party made five recommendations to improve the register and I will deal with each in turn.  The first main proposal is that the register should be prepared within a revised shorter time scale.  they suggest from 15 November to 25 March, coming into force on 6 April. A person would have from 5 March to 6 April to claim to be included on the supplementary list.  The proposed time scale is on page 26.  I would like to make some suggestions in this area with which the House may agree.  To change the qualifying date from 15 September to 15 November is a good idea.  There is no real necessity to have such a long period between the qualifying date and the publication of the draft register.  The date which is of importance to the public and to those who use the draft register prior to election time, such as politicians who are anxious to ensure it is accurate, is the date on which it is published.  Heretofore it was published on 1 December and was available for public scrutiny and for the lodging of claims up to 15 January.  That was a very bad time of the year with the Christmas holiday intervening.  Many registering authorities did not always produce the draft register for public scrutiny on the required date.</P>
    <P>I can recall on several occasions not receiving the draft register until the week before Christmas.  If the statutory requirement was that it should be made available by 1 December, that hardly ever happened in the Galway West constituency. I do not know what the experience was in other constituencies, but that shortened the period during which one could arrange to have the register distributed throughout the constituency, have people examine it and arrange for claims to be made for omissions and deletions.  The intervention of <Col N="1562" /> the Christmas holiday period meant the period was shortened further.  I agree with the suggestion that it be removed completely from the Christmas holiday period and the publication date of 10 January seems very satisfactory, but what is not satisfactory is the idea that the last date for making claims would be 24 January.  That is far too short a period, only two weeks.  As we know from experience registering authorities have not always been able to make the register available on the appointed day.</P>
    <P>If the proposed new lists are to be made available only on or after 10 January, but claims must statutorily be lodged by 24 January, in many cases the period would be as short as a week.  That is a suggestion with which no practising politician would agree.  As an alternative I suggest that it be extended to 10 February, in other words to give a period of four weeks for claims to be lodged.  That would require consequent changes in the other dates.  As listed on page 26, the date for publication of the list of claims is suggested as 31 January but I suggest that should become 17 February; for the completion of returns of endorsed lists of claims by county registrars the suggested date of 21 February should be changed to 25 February; the proposed date for publication of the register is 25 March, which could be retained, and the register would come into force on 15 April.  That is an important proposed change in the recommendations of the working party who suggested that the register come into force on 6 April.  I will give my reasons for this in a minute.</P>
    <P>On receipt of the draft register I have had to arrange for its distribution to units of my organisation throughout my constituency to ensure that supporters of my party will continue to be included in the voters register.  It is a political exercise which I consider to be very valuable, as all politicians will agree.  That requires quite a period of time because the register has to be broken up and distributed to give time to others to examine it locally. It often involves going from house to house and then coming back and submitting reports directly to the county secretary. Alternatively it comes back to me <Col N="1563" /> for transmission to the county secretary, who would draw up the lists.  Much time is required to do that successfully and the period of two weeks is far too short.  I hope that the Minister intends to adopt these recommendations and bring forward legislation later in which he will allow a minimum of four weeks for that exercise.  On page 26 of the report the following is contained:</P>
    <P>At present a period of 10 days is allowed for corrections in respect of names appearing in the claims list. Specifying such a period is considered to be unnecessarily formal and it is proposed that this provision should be dropped.  It will still be open to interested parties, of course, to make such claims.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister can give some indication about what he and the Department consider to be the appropriate procedures to be followed when names are omitted from the claims list: how can they be included in the list and how will they be checked if that facility is to be removed?  The report goes on at page 27:</P>
    <P>The register will be published on the 25th March and will come into force on the 6th April.  A period between the publication of the register and its entry into force is necessary because in the event of an election the register to be used is needed at the beginning of the election period by the Returning Officer, and for the purpose of canvassing, etc.</P>
    <P>I have already suggested a change in those dates &mdash; that the period be from 25 March to 15 April.  My reason is that I considered the period recommended by the Working Party to be too short.  If a general election were called either for 6 April or 7 April and if the register is only to be published and available on 25 March it would not then be available for the full duration of the campaign which on the average has a three-week span.  It is my view that the register should be available for the full duration of the campaign, particularly for the last three weeks of the campaign.  It would be intolerable if one had to carry out an election <Col N="1564" /> without the benefit of the register for most of the compaign period.  It could cause great confusion and would prove a serious hindrance to the efficient operation of our democratic process.  A lot of time would be wasted with people coming in demanding to know if they were on the register and we would not know because the register had not been published in time.  Therefore I strongly recommend that the period between the publication of the register and its coming into force should be at least a period of three weeks &mdash; if necessary, a little longer, but certainly not shorter.</P>
    <P>The second major recommendation in regard to improvements to the register appears on page 5.  The working party recommend that the practice of publishing the full draft register should be discontinued and that only lists of additions and deletions should be made available. That, in practice, should prove to be a very valuable change which would help to eliminate many of the mistakes being made because of the reprinting of 2½ million names on two different occasions &mdash; first in draft and then repeating the whole thing when the final register is being made available.</P>
    <P>There is also a suggestion that these lists should be published in local newspapers. I have no doubt that if the Minister were to find that to be practicable it would eliminate many of the mistakes and omissions of recent years.  It would create immediate public interest.  It would be a topic of conversation and possibly would be the most effective step the Minister and the Department could take to bring to the notice of the public that the register of electors was available for public scrutiny and that time would therefore be available to make claims.</P>
    <P>I do not know how much money is being spent at present on advertising on television and on stamping envelopes reminding people that they should check the register of electors in the period between 1 December and 15 January.  I do not think that has any great public impact: I do not think TV advertising has been very imaginative.  I have never found any great public reaction, like people saying, &ldquo;I must go to the post <Col N="1565" /> office or the Garda station to check whether my name is on the register of electors&rdquo;.  I do not think there is great public awareness.  My experience as a politician has been that there seems to be great ignorance on the part of the public in regard to the procedures that have to be followed in the revision of the register on an annaul basis.  The public seem to be interested in whether they are on the register only when they hear an election has been announced.  There is intense interest at that stage.</P>
    <P>The suggestion I have referred to, it is not a recommendation, that the list of additions and deletions should be published in local newspapers, would bring about an instant response from the public and possibly would result in the most accurate register of electors ever produced here.  The only obstacle I can see to it is the cost, and I am not sure it would be very great.  I do not have figures on the number of claims for additions and deletions each year but I have a rough idea of the numbers in my constituency. Therefore I would not consider that the cost of publishing the list of claims in local newspapers would be excessive. Indeed, I recall some years ago that organisations such as the St. Vincent de Paul Society used to publish the names and addresses of all subscribers.  They are not doing that now because of the cost, but when a major part of the machinery in a democracy is being revised the State would be well advised to spend money to ensure that the public would be made fully aware of their rights to check the register.</P>
    <P>The third major recommendation in regard to improving the register refers to the number of field workers:</P>
    <P>Sufficient field workers should be employed by each registration authority to ensure that the field work involving a complete house-to-house check will be completed in time to be reflected in the electors' list.</P>
    <P>If that recommendation is not implemented, the work of this committee will have been a complete waste.  I strongly urge the Minister to implement that recommendation.  It is crucial to the success <Col N="1566" /> in achieving a more effective and accurate register of electors.</P>
    <P>An interesting comparison is made in the report about the accuracy of the population census carried out every five years.  The most recent census of population in 1981 is estimated to have cost £3.8 million.  The public have full confidence that the national population census was an accurate count of the population. An elaborate system was established resulting in house-to-house calls by field workers on the ground and also involving very careful supervision of those people. Unfortunately, the same care and attention have not been given in the past to the preparation of the register of electors. Great responsibility has been thrown on the rate collectors.</P>
    <P>As we all know, rate collectors have become scarce on the ground in rural Ireland since the abolition of domestic rates.  They are not as closely in touch as they used to be with each individual householder because they have not got the occasion to call to any householder. The only obligation which rests on them now is to call, if necessary, to business enterprises or the remaining enterprises with responsibility for paying rates.  The domestic rate has been abolished and ordinary householders have no official contact with the rate collector.  He still continues to carry responsibility for compiling the register, and is responsible for its accuracy, despite the fact that he has such little contact with the local community. There is a serious deduction from his remuneration according to the level of accuracy determined by the officer in charge of the registration authority.</P>
    <P>The figure of £3.8 million given as the cost of the census of the population in 1981, when compared with the cost of compiling the register of electors over a similar period of only £700,000, indicates the degree of importance given to this task up to now.  Unless the Department are prepared to commit an adequate amount of funds for the establishment of a network of personnel on the ground to check the register, the whole exercise will be a waste of time.  The recommendation of the working party that sufficient field workers should be employed can never <Col N="1567" /> be implemented unless the political will is there on the part of the Minister and the Government to provide sufficient funds to ensure that sufficient field workers are employed.</P>
    <P>The figure provided of £700,000 is grossly inadequate.  There is no possibility of increasing the number of personnel involved in this task unless the Department make realistic allocations to the local authorities.  There is an unfortunate obligation, in one sense, on the local authority to carry half the cost.  With the present system of financing local authorities it is not realistic to demand that they provide this improved service unless the Department will provide them with the financial wherewithal to carry out the Department's instructions.  We have had a history in recent years, since the 1978 Act was passed, of Ministers introducing legislation placing responsibility on a local authority to provide a certain service and at the same time not providing additional funds to enable the local authority to provide that service.  This is a very serious anomaly which is the cause of much frustration for elected councillors, and it has caused much distress to local authority accounting officers and county managers.</P>
    <P>Whoever replies to this debate should make clear what the Government's commitments are in relation to the recommendations and whether they are serious about requiring an improvement in the degree of accuracy in the register of electors. We need that statement because it was not the present Minister or any Member of the Government who established this working party.  Unless there is an indication from the Government that they support the recommendations and intend to introduce the necessary legislation and provide the necessary finance, involving Deputies in a debate of this kind will be a waste of time.  Hopefully we are not wasting our time here today. Hopefully the Minister will pay some heed to some of the suggestions we are making.  Hopefully in particular, serious note will be taken of the recommendations made by the working party, and we will see the legislation and the finance <Col N="1568" /> provided in the future to satisfy the desire of everybody in this House and in the country that we should have an accurate register of electors.</P>
    <P>One comment on page 23 of this report interested me very much.  It is rather unusual, bearing in mind that the Minister has informed the House that the people who comprised the working party were civil servants, or officials of local authorities, or county registrars.  The comment is that the public must be encouraged to take an informed interest, to understand the procedures involved and co-operate in them, to be specific in their criticism and to refuse to accept an inadequate service.  Three cheers for all these civil servants and public officials who advised the community to refuse to accept an inadequate service, but they did not tell us what steps the public should take to make known their refusal to accept an inadequate service or what form their protest against an inadequate service should take.  It is a very bald statement and quite extraordinary coming from public servants.  The only comment of any critical nature I would make of them &mdash; I subscribe to the sentiment; why should we accept an inadequate service? &mdash; is that they do not give us any idea of what they think we can do if an inadequate service continues to be made available.</P>
    <P>The fourth major recommendation for the improvement of the register refers to a change of residence.  If this takes place between 15 November and 24 January the elector should be registered at the new residence.  This is a very sensible recommendation.  I would add the warning that it is absolutely imperative that, if a person is to be registered at his new residence he must be removed from the register at his old place of residence.  It has been the cause of much wonder how people who move from one constituency to another manage to be registered in the new constituency while still remaining on the register in their old constituency. There does not seem to be any co-operation between the registration authorities and the county registrars in examining the electors' lists and the various claims submitted.  Time and again we have been <Col N="1569" /> told of people who have voted twice on the basis that they were registered in two different places.  It is very difficult to know about this unless it happens to come to light afterwards.  I urge that special provision be made to ensure that when a person moves his place of residence his name is deleted from the original list.  The recommendation here which only allows for this where people change residences between 15 November, the new suggested qualifying date, and 24 January, the suggested date for the last day to receive claims, I consider to be too restrictive.  There should be a provision in the supplementary list for people to be registered up to the time an election is announced.</P>
    <P>The fifth and final major recommendation to the register is set out as follows:</P>
    <P>A supplement to the register to correct errors of a clerical and typographical nature should continue to be published, subject to the clarification that in cases where a person's name is due to appear on the final register but is inadvertently omitted, such name should be included in the supplement. In addition, the supplement should be published as soon as the process for the holding of an election begins.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the views of the working party in this case.  They elaborated on those views in the report.  Most people will agree that, in the main, omissions from the list come to light during an election compaign.  At that stage the supplementary list should allow for omissions to be included in the supplementary list.  I suggest that claims up to one week before polling day should be allowed.  I know that the public servants involved will shrink in horror at the administrative difficulties they claim this would create but I think it has a lot to do with the will of the people who are charged with implementing the measures.  If one wishes sufficiently to do something I believe it is possible to devise efficient methods to do it.  However, if the attitude is to make life as easy as possible, one can always say the task is impossible.</P>
    <P>In this day it should be well within our competence to devise an efficient and adequate method of including an elector's <Col N="1570" /> name on a supplementary list even up to the time an election is announced. I make that suggestion but I suspect from experience it may not be well received by the officials charged with carrying out the measure.  If adequate arrangements are made and if good procedures are adopted there is no reason it should not be done. We have only to look back to the local elections in 1974 when the postal voting arrangements were along similar lines, when claims were being made close to the time of the election date.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the number of claims would be excessive and I think this facility would remove a major cause of complaint against the present system.  I am surprised the working party did not make stronger recommendations in this area.  People who contest an election or participate in an election campaign and who go to each door in an area are on occasion confronted by a resident who will say that his name is not on the list and who will ask how he can rectify the situation.  Those people who are campaigning are nonplussed because there is no provision in the law to cater for this.  We are now reviewing the law and making suggestions for its improvement and I recommend strongly that procedures be introduced to enable claims to be made up to one week before polling day.  I do not think the number would be excessive or that it would present the major administrative problems that I suspect some public servants might seek to claim.  Even if it should prove to be cumbersome, I recommend to the Minister that it be tried out on an experimental basis.</P>
    <P>These are the five main recommendations of the working party.  I am not very impressed with the fifth recommendation and I have made my own suggestions which I consider an improvement.  I should like to compliment the working party on the thorough way they have examined the whole problem and the open-minded approach they adopted.  I should also like to commend the public-minded people who submitted recommendations to the working party.  I am very pleased to see that two Fianna Fáil Deputies were among those who made suggestions and recommendations to <Col N="1571" /> help the working party in their deliberations. I commend Deputy David Andrews and Deputy O'Hanlon for their work and also the other people and bodies who made contributions.</P>
    <P>The next major area the working party were asked to consider was the matter of postal voting.  Members of the House will agree that every qualified elector should be able to vote, if not in person then by postal vote.  It is absolutely essential that the success of the democratic process be guaranteed by devising facilities which enable all qualified voters to exercise the franchise.  The recommendations of the working party with regard to postal voting are very sensible.  In the main they recommend the extension of the postal vote to people who are physically disabled and that includes elderly people and electors prevented from voting in person due to their occupation.  They make a condition that this should apply only to persons ordinarily resident in a particular constituency on the qualifying date and there are various flexible interpretations with regard to the qualifying date.  I understand it has been accepted that if a person is ordinarily resident in a certain place he could be absent for a period up to 18 months and still be accepted as ordinarily resident at that place.  I understand that that flexible approach has been adopted up to now.</P>
    <P>However, the working party did not recommend extending the postal vote to certain categories.  One category might gain the sympathy of the House &mdash; public servants employed by the State who, because of their duties, have to reside away from this country.  The postal voting facility should be extended, firstly, to all members of the diplomatic service and other State employees required to reside abroad in the fulfilment of their duties.  I cannot see how we can deny these citizens the right to vote in our elections.  It is a weakness of the report that it has recommended against this.  The working party appear to have been over-influenced by the law in regard to the place where one is ordinarily resident in a particular constituency.  A person in the diplomatic service ordinarily resident <Col N="1572" /> abroad for, perhaps, 15 or 20 years would not qualify for a postal vote under this law and this should not be so.</P>
    <P>The recommendation of the committee is otherwise very sensible &mdash; the provision whereby people can make a claim for postal voting on being able to show that the circumstances of their employment will deny them the opportunity of being present to cast their vote in their local polling station on the appointed day.  If they can produce documentation from their employer or a doctor or, in the case of the self-employed, a statutory declaration, then the deciding officer, presumably the county registrar, would extend the postal vote to them.  This will give that opportunity in future to people like commercial travellers, seamen, members of the airlines, fishermen and a whole range of people going about their ordinary task of earning a living and who are as interested and involved and have as much stake in any election as any other citizen.  It will give them the opportunity to cast their vote and help to determine who shall govern the country and maintain the peace and democratic process which we have enjoyed since the establishment of this State.</P>
    <P>It is extremely important that as many as possible should be enabled to vote and that every facility should be extended to them.  Only in very exceptional and necessary cases should this be denied.  Unfortunately, it is now denied to a very large section of the community.  One reads the newspapers on the day after a general election and sees the headlines of a 70, 75 or 80 per cent poll, but one can be sure that it will never be a 100 per cent poll under our present electoral law, under the arrangements available at present to enable people to vote.  People in poor health in hospital are not able to walk into their polling station to cast their vote and a very substantial percentage of the electorate have had no opportunity of casting a vote in any election over the years since the State was founded, because of the denial of the postal vote.</P>
    <P>In the 1974 local elections the postal vote was available only to Defence Force and Garda personnel.  A whole section of the community have been disfranchised <Col N="1573" /> because we in the Oireachtas have not provided them with the facilities and the procedures to enable them to cast their vote.  This recommendation is obviously of very great importance.</P>
    <P>I would like clarification from some Member of the Government in reply to this debate as to what form the statutory declaration in respect of the self-employed would take.  It is mentioned on page 40 of the report that people seeking to prove that because of their employment they will not be able to be present at their polling station on election day must justify their application through the presentation of a statutory declaration. Would this statutory declaration involve the payment of money to a Commissioner of Oaths?  I would be opposed to any charge being made on anybody providing the statutory declaration.</P>
    <P>Other Members of the House when they come to contribute to this debate or who have time to further consider the contents of this report may suggest that postal voting be extended to other citizens who are not ordinarily resident in the country on the qualifying date.  The recommendation on page 45, section 4, that no ballot paper should be sent to an address outside of the State, I could not agree to.  If we extend the postal vote to the diplomatic service and State employees, the vote should be posted direct to these people.  If I remember correctly, the procedure for postal voting in local authority elections required the application to be made from an address in Ireland and if one were residing abroad at the time of the election the vote had to be sent to one's home in Ireland and from one's home to wherever one resided abroad, and back.  It certainly proved very cumbersome.  With reference to State employees, provision should be made to have the vote sent direct to these electors.</P>
    <P>Reference is made on page 35 of the report to the Local Election Postal Voting Regulations, 1974.  Is it the intention to have postal voting in the local authority elections to be held in 1984?  If so, will the 1974 postal voting regulations apply? If this is so, it should be pointed out that these differ from the recommendations <Col N="1574" /> in this report.  The 1974 postal voting regulations for local authority elections provided that the postal vote could be granted if one could show that one was going to be absent from the constituency on the election date, or if one were employed by a returning officer.  Neither of these two recommendations is contained in the working party's report and I would like some clarification as to the application of the 1974 regulations in the event of the local elections being held in 1984.</P>
    <P>It would be helpful if on this side of the House we could know that it was the Minister's intention to introduce uniform postal voting regulations which would apply across the board to local elections, general elections, presidential elections, referenda, to the Údarás na Gaeltachta elections and, of course, would apply also to by-elections.  We have not had any indication as to what are the Minister's intentions and we have been left in the dark in this respect.  If it is the intention to introduce uniform voting regulations will the 1974 local authority postal voting regulations continue in operation until a new Act is passed? Might we have some indication as to whether the Government have given any consideration to this whole question of postal voting?  Can we expect a new Bill to be brought before the House implementing the suggestions of this working party and, if so, what will be the time scale?</P>
    <P>The postal vote was not made available during the most recent local elections in 1979 because the European Assembly elections were held on the same day.  It was decided that it would not be appropriate to have postal voting extended to the electorate in the case of local elections when they were being denied that right in the case of the European Assembly elections.  The decision was taken not to grant postal voting at all for those local authority elections.  We understand from recent statements of the Minister that it is likely that the European Assembly elections and the local elections will be held on the same day in May 1984.  Therefore, we should like some clarification as <Col N="1575" /> to what are the Government's intentions in this whole area of postal voting as they affect local authority elections and the European Assembly elections to be held next year.</P>
    <P>The working party gave some information in their report on postal voting facilities available in other European countries. I must say that I consider the existing postal facilities in the Federal Republic of Germany to be the most enlightened system in operation in Europe at present.  The German postal vote is available for absence from the constituency, in the event of a change of address, an occupation difficulty, because of an illness or because of old age or physical disability.  It extends also to the diplomatic service serving abroad at the time of the election.  I should like to see the same type of scheme operate here eventually.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the existence of a supplementary list.  In whatever legislation is introduced after this there should be provision made for a supplementary list of claims for postal votes where one could show that it was necessary because of illness, because of absence or change of address.  The arguments in the report against extending the postal vote to a wider section of the electorate are purely administrative, as outlined on page 37 of the report and I shall not go through them here.  It is not beyond our competence to devise a satisfactory system.  I recognise the difficulties involved but I do not think they are insurmountable.  I hope some further thought will be given to that.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of postal votes I might make a reference to the existing facility extended to members of the Defence Forces and Garda personnel. The situation has arisen in the past in which a member of the Defence Forces had retired prior to the date of the election and his name had been included on the voters' register as a postal voter.  He was residing in an Army barracks.  As we are aware, the arrangement at present in operation is that the returning officer sends the ballot papers directly to the officer in charge of the barracks where the voter is residing, if he is residing in <Col N="1576" /> barrack quarters, and arrangements are made for him to vote, secretly of course, in the baraacks.  He does this in his own time.  He is handed the ballot paper.  But where a member was no longer a serving member of the Defence Forces it has happened that these ballot papers have not been forwarded to the ex-soldier's last known address.  In the regulations there should be a requirement on the Army authorities to forward the ballot papers to the last known address of a postal voter who had formerly resided in their barracks.  If that was done it would eliminate a problem which arose in the past on a number of occasions and which was at one time the subject of a very hot and angry debate here.  Of course the same should apply in the case of Garda personnel but it would not arise as frequently in their case.</P>
    <P>The third major area which the working party were asked to consider was that of access to polling stations for disabled and elderly persons.  Here the objective should be to ensure maximum independence for disabled persons by the elimination of any obstacles to their free access and circulation.  On page 49, paragraph 9.2, of the report reference is made to the Memorandum for Guidance of Returning Officers at Dáil Elections as issued by the Department of the Environment prior to the November 1982 general election.  This memorandum refers to the importance of facilitating disabled voters when polling stations are being arranged.  It goes on to say:</P>
    <P>The memorandum advises ... that &ldquo;polling stations should in all cases be located on a ground floor to provide ease of access by physically incapacitated electors.  To facilitate electors confined to wheelchairs consideration should be given to the provision of a ramp if the polling station cannot be reached without negotiating steps&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As far as I can ascertain that memorandum was ignored totally.  There is little use in the Minister issuing memoranda of that kind unless there is some follow-up to ensure that the recommendations are implemented, and they were very valid recommendations made for very good <Col N="1577" /> reasons.  I know that the Wheelchair Association and other organisations representing handicapped people have been making representations along those lines for quite a number of years.  I commend the Minister of the day for issuing separate instructions to returning officers to make provision for handicapped people. But in my experience very little has been done to enforce those instructions.  If the Department are interested I might quote just a few examples in my constituency. There is no way that a person confined to a wheelchair could enter the Ozman House polling station in Galway city.  I canvassed in the Spiddal area during the last general election and a gentleman in a wheelchair told me it would be impossible for him to gain access to the Spiddal national school polling station, that he would have to be physically carried in. That completely defeats the wishes of Parliament that people in wheelchairs should be facilitated to get there through their own efforts without seeking the assistance of people to lift them bodily in and out of polling stations.  In the Mervue national school polling station many of the polling booths are located on the first storey of that building.  There is no way a handicapped person could negotiate those stairs.  There is the same difficulty in the Claddagh national school polling station in Galway city.  Those are just a few I can very quickly recall in my constituency. We can be sure that up and down the country there are hundreds of polling stations where a handicapped person in a wheelchair could not gain access. Returning officers cannot implement what the memo provides for if the budget allocated is not adequate to acquire suitable premises.  Instead, they will take the soft option and avail of the free premises, which is the local national school.</P>
    <P>Again, it is a question of the Minister giving instructions but not providing the wherewithal to implement them.  It is very frustrating for a returning officer to receive a direction of that kind and to know that if he sets about hiring a premises to which there is easy access for disabled persons the expenses involved may not be approved by the Department. That is an area in respect of which I <Col N="1578" /> should like some clarification from the Minister.  He should tell us what the guidelines are for expenses that may be incurred by returning officers and also how restrictive are the Department in this regard.  Time and again public representatives have complained to returning officers about inadequate facilities only to be told that the facilities can only be as good as those for which their budget provides.  We could be merely wasting our time if the will is not present on the part of the Minister to ensure that these excellent recommendations are implemented and that the additional finance necessary is provided.</P>
    <P>An election is the instrument whereby people express their democratic will.  The facilities and arrangements provided for the electorate in this respect should be the best possible so as to ensure that at least the people have confidence in the system.  On those grounds alone we can justify increasing substantially the moneys spent in arranging for elections.</P>
    <P>It is important, too, that lists of voters be accurate and that polling stations be accessible and well lighted.  It is a dreadful situation when people have to struggle up grassy banks into broken-down school houses in order to vote and in addition, in the case of a winter election, to have only candlelight from about 5 o'clock in the evening.  This is not good enough.  It does not help to create confidence in the democratic process.  Counting centres should be large enough to enable the public to observe the vote counting procedure. In Dublin access is very restricted.  In some rural areas where suitable arrangements in this regard have been made, the people concerned must be commended.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with the recommendations regarding accessibility.  The suggestion that temporary ramps be provided in order to make the polling stations accessible to the disabled is excellent as is also the suggestion to site polling stations in hospitals and institutions.</P>
    <P>Regarding the booklet that is issued to presiding officers I should like the Minister to clarify the position regarding paragraph 18 which concerns illiterate voters. I have known of instances in which <Col N="1579" /> this paragraph was interpreted by the presiding officer as meaning that when a person who was illiterate came to shout out his vote, the presiding officer instructed the Garda sergeant present and the poll clerk to leave the station.  I do not know whether that is the correct manner in which the law should be interpreted. The only people who remained in the station were the presiding officer, the illiterate voter and the personation agents for the candidates.  That situation has caused quite an amount of controversy in the Galway-West constituency. It has resulted in a good deal of correspondence between the returning officer in Galway and the Department of the Environment but so far he has not been given any clear instruction as to what the procedure should be in such cases.  In other words, the Department have not said yet whether the presiding officer was correct in the manner in which he interpreted the law.  Parliamentary questions from me on the matter have been refused on the grounds that the Minister has no obligation to state the law.  He may not have an obligation to state the law in the case of parliamentary Question Time but he has a responsibility to explain to the House what the law is in regard to that issue.</P>
    <P>I wish to commend the officials who worked assiduously to produce this excellent report and I hope that the contributions from this side of the House will be helpful to the Minister and that at an early date he will bring forward the legislation to implement the recommendations. If he does so, he can be assured that we on this side of the House will be very pleased.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am very pleased to have this opportunity of discussing this Report of the Working Party on the Register of Electors.  As the Minister said, such an opportunity is the very essence of the democratic process.  It is very important for all of us to have an input into this process.  I concur with the remarks congratulating members of the working party who have put so much work into this report and also for having <Col N="1580" /> done so much work in just more than six months.</P>
      <P>I was amused this morning at the shallow protestations of the Opposition concerning the legislation being ordered for today.  They were implying that it was not important, that there were some shenanigans, that there was no other legislation ready.  The Leader of the Opposition was the loudest so far as these protestations were concerned.  We have now heard Deputy Molloy say rightly that a major part of the machinery is being revised. What is more important than that the Members of this House have an input into that revision?  During his lengthy but very good deliberations, Deputy Molloy told us that we must have concern for people who might have voted twice. Combine that with the shallow protestations of the Leader of his party and ask ourselves where are we.  History has the rest documented.  It is difficult to know what to make of the Opposition.</P>
      <P>There were many submissions from interested parties when the work of the group was advertised.  In this respect I congratulate my own local authority, Wexford County Council and also the urban district council for the tremendous input on their part into this whole issue. Our county manager is a tremendous upholder of local democracy and indeed of local government in Ireland.  Hardly a month passes without issues of this kind and issues relating to the whole process of local government being discussed at our council meetings.  My own views are that a thorough and effective system of local democracy is the basis of our overall democratic process.  If we do not have a thorough system for the political parties in the local areas the rest will not work. The register of electors is an essential input in ensuring that everyone who is entitled to vote has a vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before going into some of the detail of the report I should like to raise one general point.  All our citizens and not only those who are resident should be allowed to vote.  There are many non-nationals living among us who are paying their taxes and who have contributed to the wellbeing of this country but who do not have the right to vote.  I appeal to those <Col N="1581" /> concerned and to the Government to consider this question.  As an example of what I have in mind, I am thinking of a woman in Wexford who is not Irish but who has lived here for 17 years.  She is married to a Wexford man.  She has reared her children and has contributed to the taxation system.  It can well be said of her that she is more Irish than the Irish but she does not have a vote.  There are many non-nationals living here who are involved in business or in farming or who are here because they are married to Irish spouses.  All of these people should have the right to vote.  All of them should be allowed to vote if after a given length of time here they are contributing to our system.  Those who pay taxes are entitled to say how those taxes are spent and that is all one is doing when one exercises one's democratic right to vote, to say who should govern and who should dictate the method of spending.  I hope that overall issue will be considered in conjunction with the very good report of the Working Party.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy said he was disappointed that there did not appear to be a recommendation from the Government, particularly from the Minister, in offering the report to the House.  I am satisfied that there is a recommendation from the Government and I should like to draw the Deputy's attention to the following extract from the Minister's speech:</P>
    <P>What we need to consider is the scope for sensible measures to improve the situation on lines recommended in the report.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not keeping us exactly to what is in the report but is anxious to hear the views of all Members.  Clearly he is stating that it was on the lines recommended in the report that he would like us to consider the issue.  That is recommendation enough for me without being a straitjacket and that is as it should be in a democratic process.</P>
    <P>The working party was established about a year ago and they advertised last July seeking submissions from various bodies.  The following were the terms of reference of the working party:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1582" /> To examine and make recommendations on:</P>
    <P>(i)  The registration process, with a view to effecting a real improvement in the standard of the register of electors, [None of us would argue with that]</P>
    <P>(ii)  a scheme of postal voting for disabled persons and others who may be unable to vote in person at an election, and</P>
    <P>(iii)  access to polling stations for disabled persons,</P>
    <P>Indeed, the working party were prepared to discuss any other aspect if any of the submissions from the public and general bodies indicated there was a necessity for it.  In fact those three points covered all the submissions made to the working party.</P>
    <P>The issues which the greatest number of submissions dealt with was the time scale during which the register is revised. The report points out in detail that at the moment 15 September to 15 April is the span from the qualifying date to the enforcement of the register.  It has been suggested that this be shortened and that 15 November become the qualifying date, 25 March for the publication, and 6 April the date for the entry into force of the register.  I accept Deputy Molloy's point that the two weeks suggested, between 10 January and 24 January, is too short to make claims and for political parties to assess the situation.  We should not make any bones about the fact that the people most interested in the register of electors are the political parties in as much as we are the ones who have a vested interest in ensuring that they are correct, that those who are entered are entitled to vote and that those who should be deleted are deleted.  In my view this is the area most open to abuse, whether it is in the compiling of the register or in the operation of the postal voting system. All parties share the blame in my view. I take the point that that period should be longer but I will not argue now whether it should be three or four weeks. However, the Minister should investigate that and tell the House if he considers two weeks to be sufficient.  Any change, <Col N="1583" /> as Deputy Molloy mentioned, would mean all other dates would be moved forward.</P>
    <P>I could not understand Deputy Molloy's explanation why the publication of the register on 25 March and its entry into force on 6 April would, as it were, cramp his style if an election was called. He did not ask us to change the publication date but spoke of what would happen if there was an election about 5 April or 6 April.  Surely in that case it would be necessary to move to put the publication date back if the political parties needed more time to study the register?  If there is an election on 5 April and the register is published on 25 March it will not make much difference if the register comes into force on 15 April because that would be after the election.  I am afraid I lost his line of argument but I do not agree with him on that.</P>
    <P>I agree with the suggestion that the practice of publishing a full draft register should be discontinued.  Over the years, that has happened and various correction lists were issued.  That has been changed back to the full draft register.  I wonder what experiences caused the change back to the full draft register but, as far as I can read the situation, it would be an easier matter to handle at local level by publication in the newspapers.  It would be better if we adopted a system of publishing the list of deletions or additions. It would be easier to control the situation and for the public to investigate their situation <i>vis-à-vis</i> the register.</P>
    <P>The third improvement suggested was that sufficient field workers be employed by each registration authority to ensure that the field work, involving a house to house check, is completed within a given time.  That is the basis of an efficient and correct register.  Over the years a great job was done by our rate collectors.  The accuracy of the register, considering the amount of work, the number of names and the amount of detail in it, has been tremendous but with the change in the system of rate collecting &mdash; most rate collectors have become Revenue collectors &mdash; it is not possible to have as heretofore the number of people with an intimate <Col N="1584" /> knowledge of every household in detail.  Rate collectors, particularly in rural areas, knew when children were born, when they went to school and, in most cases, were still collecting rates from that household when that child became eligible to vote.  They knew more about what was going on in rural Ireland than any other individual and were part and parcel of the community.  The situation today does not allow for that and the field worker will be the most important contributor to an efficient and accurate register in the future.  We need an adequate number of field workers and the only limiting factor in that regard is the provision of finance.  The Minister should ensure that the money will be available to enable the recruitment of sufficient field workers to carry out house to house investigations essential for the accuracy of the register.</P>
    <P>I also accept that any extra legislation necessary to provide certain services must go hand in hand with the need to provide funds for the Department concerned. Over the years we have expected local authorities to implement new legislation without making funds available to provide services in terms of work or manpower.  The money in this case will have to be provided by Government.  We should not expect local authorities to provide the money particularly at a time when they are badly in need of it.  With regard to the supplement to the register to correct errors of a clerical or typographical nature I disagree with Deputy Molloy who felt we should have a safety net system around election time.  The only reason I disagree is that I believe it would be open to political abuse.  I include all parties in that; I am not removing myself or my party from that.</P>
    <P>We all know the scurry that takes place when an election is called.  The register is examined and it is only then we notice that somebody has been left out or that a person of 17 years of age has been entered.  A man dead for 20 years is suddenly back on the register, his name having been removed earlier.  We are all confronted with this kind of thing.  A child born six months previously appears on the register and we are told that it is <Col N="1585" /> really the grandfather's name but he is dead.  So it goes on.  One cannot expect returning officers to be familiar with every individual in their area.  All political parties must share the blame.  What would happen if we decided to have a supplement and a safety net system at election time whereby anyone who thinks he or she is entitled to vote could make a claim?  The administration of such a scheme would be impossible because the same people who would be involved in organising the election would also be involved in adjudicating on claims.  It would be open to too much abuse and would be administratively impossible.</P>
    <P>I would favour broadening the scope of those entitled to vote to include non-nationals as well as our own citizens.  I am delighted to see the recommendations on postal voting but I am not native enough to think that it will not increase the amount of abuse.  It definitely will.  In 1974 I stood for the first time at the local elections in County Wexford.  A broad postal voting system was used at those elections and there were some prosecutions for abuse.  Everyone involved realised that there was a far greater incidence of abuse than appeared through the official channels.  The main area of abuse involves people living in flats who move between Dublin and the country.  In many cases they are registered at two or three addresses.  The postal votes arrive for them and the local party on the ground know what is going on.  These postal votes are even collected in bunches and sent out.  Let us not pretend it does not happen.  We must be sure if we broaden postal voting that we minimise this abuse.  It was far more widespread in 1974 than official channels would lead us to believe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Deputy should ask his former colleague, Lorcan Allen, about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Inclusion on the postal voters' list should be open to registered electors who are physically disabled but I believe it <Col N="1586" /> should also be open to anyone who is entitled to vote.  In Wexford there was much dissatisfaction among seamen and over 400 seamen registered their protest because they could not vote last November. They have been particularly vocal in County Wexford but I know there are many other groups in other counties who feel they are being deprived of their franchise. The Garda and Defence Force personnel have always been allowed a postal vote.  Deputy Molloy mentioned the members of the diplomatic service and public servants working abroad.  It is a very interesting point and I feel they should be entitled to a postal vote.  There is a precedent for this in other countries.</P>
    <P>The method of implementing the postal voting system varies greatly among EEC countries and I am sure we could learn many lessons from their experience.  Germany has the broadest system of postal voting and anyone who cannot be at home appears to be allowed to vote, whether disabled, ill, working away from home or in the diplomatic service abroad.  Belgium and France had fairly wide postal voting facilities but abolished them because of abuse.  Let us hope that when we introduce this broad system of postal voting for all our citizens and residents entitled to vote we will not decide after a few years that it was a big mistake.  Let us implement the system as fairly as we can.  Our European partners have not been able to implement it in a manner which is sufficiently free of abuse but perhaps we will learn from their experience and avoid the same mistakes.</P>
    <P>Access to polling stations for disabled persons was a major area of discussion. All of us who have been involved in manning polling stations have been aware of the acute embarrassment caused to many a disabled person, especially a person in a wheelchair, who has been hauled into a polling station to cast a vote.  The provision of a simple ramp would solve the problem and I fully support the recommendations in this report regarding the facilitating of disabled persons.  It has been said that the postal vote for many disabled persons will take a lot of worry and harassment out of casting a vote but many will still prefer to vote in person <Col N="1587" /> and we must look after these people as well.  Most of the schools which are used as polling stations have a few steps, but ramps would solve this problem.  A returning officer should be enabled to authorise a voter on request to attend a more accessible polling station.</P>
    <P>Returning officers should also make greater use of the power to site polling stations in hospitals and institutions.  I have not much experience of other areas but I have worked in elections in Dublin and Wexford and there has been tremendous abuse in ferrying patients from hospitals and other institutions to get them to vote.  This is done by all the political parties.  The patients are lined up and cars are coming in and out and if they see the car of the wrong party coming there is abuse.  It would be amusing if it were not so serious.  It would be a very important step forward to site a polling station in a hospital, especially when the number of electors in that hospital would make it an efficient way of spending time and money.  I agree fully with the reports' recommendations with regard to improving access to polling stations generally for the disabled person.</P>
    <P>There were many submissions from interested parties and individuals.  On the matter of improvement of the register the main submissions related to complaints about the time over which the register was complied.  Christmas and the New Year is not a satisfactory time for looking at the lists, sorting out the claims and trying to improve the system to make it more efficient.  This period has been shortened and I agree with that.</P>
    <P>The census of population held every five years or so costs a great amount of money &mdash; £3.8 million in 1981.  There was a very efficient supervisory system.  There were many submissions to the effect that we should compile the register of electors either with the census or in a census-type operation.  The working party felt in their wisdom that because of the confidentiality in the compilation of the census and the type of information required on a census form, people might feel it to be an invasion of privacy if anything they put <Col N="1588" /> on a census form appeared in print, as on the register of electors.</P>
    <P>I believe this matter could be overcome. There is no reason why, with the very complicated form we get to fill in for the census, that a perforated strip could not be placed on the side with details for the register of electors, and people could fill that in.  This could be torn off and kept separate from the information for the census.  I respect the views of the working party who have had many years of experience and wisdom within local government and the civil service.  They might consider that impracticable and perhaps there is need for more discussion to see if that could be got over.  It still does not get over the problems of the intervening years, the inter-census years.</P>
    <P>In regard to postal voting, most of the submissions asked for it to be extended but they also warned against the potential dangers of abuse.  I do not believe any of us need to be warned about that.  I have yet to see any suggestions about how this can be overcome.  They are neither in the submissions nor have I heard them in the House.  That is secondary to the fact that every person should have the right to exercise his or her franchise.  The inaccuracies in the register of electors in general appear to be far less than the politicians and the public perceive.</P>
    <P>The report of the working party states that one of the greatest areas of inaccuracy is in relation to the people who have just reached 18 years.  The span at the moment from 15 September to April means that in September you have to get the list of all those who will be 18 years before 15 April.  The length of time and the vagueness involved is one of the reasons which contributes to the inaccuracies of the 18-year-olds who are either put on too early or are left off when they are 18.  With the idealism of youth and the initiative young people have, they either could not care less about voting or else they are very interested in exercising their vote for the first time.  It is a great frustration for young people to find that they are not entitled to vote, which usually happens when they get to the polling booths because many do not bother checking beforehand.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1589" /> Double registration was mentioned briefly.  I wonder if Deputy Molloy had his tongue in cheek when he was talking about it.  I assure the House I have not. Double registration should not cause double voting.  Double registration is an inaccuracy but it does not automatically lead to abuse on behalf of the elector whose name happens to be in twice.  It should not lead to abuse but we must check this area more carefully because it has caused abuse throughout the country not alone in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Registration of deceased persons is a classic one.  It is even worse in rural Ireland than it is in Dublin.  They can be dead and buried for 20 years as far as the register is concerned and suddenly appear on a register for some reason. People alive and well can be on the register for years, as happened in County Wexford recently, and suddenly be deleted from it for no explicable reason when they come to exercise their vote. That is really worse than having the deceased on the register.  Who would be involved in deleting from the register a person, who is perfectly entitled to vote, who has been resident at the same address for years?  We may all take a bit of the blame in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>: There are a lot of problems with the distinguishing letter which appears after some of the names.  We all know that L after a name on the register denotes someone who may vote at local elections only.  The letters LE means that the person may vote at local and European elections.  The letter P denotes a postal vote.  I do not apologise for saying again that those with L after their names should be allowed to vote in general elections as well as local elections.  If they have been a minimum length of time in the country and if they are eligible to pay taxes here they should be eligible to vote in general elections and share the responsibility of how that money is spent by the politicians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The greatest number of errors arises <Col N="1590" /> from inadequate field work, the furnishing of insufficient information by householders and insufficient checking.  While I have been critical of the political parties and how they can misuse the register I would like to say that without the politicians taking such an interest in the register over the years, particularly in election years, there would be a far greater number of inaccuracies.  If sufficient money is provided by the Government to do the field work this will sort out a lot of the problems.</P>
    <P>People expect the register to show who is entitled to vote but it is only at election time that many of us are bothered who is entitled to vote.  The public must take more responsibility in ensuring that they have the right to vote.  I accept that it is very hard to interest the public in a subject like this.  We are told on the TV that Garda stations and post offices have the register, that we should check the draft register but this means nothing to most people.  A far more comprehensive publicity campaign is needed.  School children of 16 and 17 years should be advised that they have the right to vote at 18, to be sure to see that they are on the local register and to exercise their right to vote.  This is very important.</P>
    <P>We have been told by the working party report that the incidence of genuine error is very small.  There are, however, problems with the register and if remedial action is not taken the situation will get worse not better.  There are other options, apart from a register of electors, and these were dealt with by the working party but, in general, they came to the conclusion that the present system of a register is perhaps the best system that anybody has come up with.  They discussed dispensing with the register.  In theory, an election could be conducted without a specific electoral register. Every elector would be required to establish identity and entitlement to vote at the polling stations before being given their ballot papers.  I do not believe the chaos this would cause would be conducive to conducting an election in a proper and democratic way.  I, like the working party, would not favour that and I do not <Col N="1591" /> believe anybody would call for such a system to be implemented.</P>
    <P>The working party also discussed preparing and publishing the register immediately before an election.  The main disadvantage is the administration of such a system.  With regard to general elections the register would have to be prepared and published within three weeks, a physical and practical impossibility. It would have advantages if it was administratively possible, because it would be up-to-date, everybody would be interested in knowing what was happening and it would be in everybody's interest to ensure it was correct, the general public as well as the political parties. Perhaps, if it could be done it would be free from a lot of errors but I believe the administrative aspects of it rule it out completely.</P>
    <P>Other points discussed were transferring the obligation to register to the individual. That would not work because without proper monitoring of the field work many people would not be in a position or would not wish to know, bar when an election is imminent, whether they were on a register.  It was suggested that we employ postmen and gardaí to do the field work.  We do not have sufficient gardaí to do their own field work without burdening them with this task.  Using a postman to do the work could be looked at.  He is in day-to-day contact with people in his own area and he, as the rate collector used to be, is well known.</P>
    <P>After considering all the options the working party came to the conclusion that none of the approaches could be recommended above the present system of registration of electors.  The other main nationwide survey undertaken on a regular basis is the census of population. It would be useful to see whether this could be applied to the preparation of the register.  The working party spent some time discussing this.  The census involves a comprehensive type of field work operation linked to a carefully defined supervisory structure.  A sum of £3.8 million was spent on the census.  If that much money was spent on the register of electors we would have the same accuracy <Col N="1592" /> and detail but such an amount could not be justified because of the problem of obsolescence.  The register has to be updated every year whereas the census is updated every five years.  There is some justification for spending such money on statistical information which will serve the State for a number of years.  However, it would be hard to justify this type of expenditure on a yearly basis.  Commonsense dicates this cannot be so.</P>
    <P>Every aspect of the census operation could, with advantage, be brought to bear on the preparation of the register of electors.  The comprehensive mapping and listing operation and many other procedures would make our register extremely accurate.  It all comes back to money and in present economic circumstances the working party could not recommend such a comprehensive and detailed operation in relation to the register. I agree with that.  None of us could expect more.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy drew our attention to page 23 of the working party recommendation and to what he called a &ldquo;bald&rdquo; statement.  It was that the public must be encouraged to take an informed interest, to understand the procedures involved and to co-operate with them, to be specific in their criticism and refuse to accept an inadequate service.  Of course they must refuse to accept inadequate service. Is that not why we have more people protesting, voicing their views and demanding more of politicians, and rightly so?  An inadequate service in any field is not acceptable.  The inadequacies could be remedied but we must have the will to do that.  I would call that statement &ldquo;bold&rdquo; not &ldquo;bald&rdquo; and commend the working party for it.</P>
    <P>The working party are against any radical departure from the present method of compiling the register.  They consider that the present approach must continue and most of us agree with that.  The various options they looked at did not appear to be the answer.  Until something is produced, what we have is reasonably adequate and more accurate than many of us think.  Considerable consideration is given to the extension of the system of postal voting.  I agree with Deputy Molloy's <Col N="1593" /> suggestion that we include the diplomatic corps and public servants who are serving abroad.  I should be interested to know why France abolished their widespread system of postal voting.</P>
    <P>There was some discussion about postal voting for prisoners.  Our prison population is about 1,200 but this figure is probably six months out of date.  Of this number, 500 are detained for a period in excess of 12 months and of these 20 per cent would normally reside outside the State.  Prisoners are not registered at a prison but may be registered at the address at which they were residing if they were there from 15 September of the year onwards.  The working party do not recommend that this facility of postal voting be extended to prisoners.  I did not agree with that.  People are incarcerated in jail for many different reasons.  Some people are in jail and many of us think they should be out while others are out and get away with crimes for which many of us think they should be in jail.  It is an important matter for an individual to exercise his right to vote.</P>
    <P>The point about islanders having a postal vote rather than going to polling stations is important to the individuals concerned but in terms of overall numbers it does not affect the postal voting system greatly.  In as much as they can be facilitated islanders should be entitled to a postal vote.  A problem can arise where some claim a postal vote and others insist on their right to vote at a polling station. We could have a polling station on an island for five or six people with the remainder of the people voting by post. However, that matter could be got over by having a consensus from the islands concerned.</P>
    <P>One of the controversial points is that no ballot papers would be sent to an address outside the State.  If we agree that the diplomatic corps and public servants abroad are entitled to a postal vote &mdash; I hope we do &mdash; this clause should be deleted.  We do not have much faith in people who are representing the State in the diplomatic service abroad if we think they cannot be trusted to fill in their voting paper correctly and send it back.</P>
    <P>The detail given in the report on access <Col N="1594" /> to polling stations for disabled persons shows the importance the working party put on this aspect.  This is an area where there could be immediate improvement without spending a lot of money.  We could have temporary ramps. We could re-site polling stations in hospitals and other institutions where they are deemed necessary by virtue of the number of people in those places who might need to vote and by giving discretion to returning officers to allow disabled persons to vote at a more suitable polling station.  These are all essential and practical recommendations.  I support them all and perhaps more suggestions will come from Members of the House as to how we might make easier the whole matter of exercising the democratic right to vote and facilitate disabled people.</P>
    <P>The only major limiting factor in effecting an improvement in the electoral register is money.  I hope the Minister and the Government have the will to improve the standard of the electoral register and, in so doing, will provide the necessary finance.  In the overall terms of budgeting and estimating, not much money will be needed.  The improvements and the standard of the register in general is totally dependent on adequate field work, house to house canvassing and person to person checking by people who have sufficient knowledge of the local scene to get the work done efficiently and correctly.</P>
    <P>The provision of money for the field work and the extension of the postal system are two very important recommendations. I welcome the extension of the postal system.  We must realise that, although it opens the door to further abuse, we must opt for it nevertheless. We must try to find out why our neighbouring Europeans have had to abandon extensive systems of postal voting.  We must get it right when we introduce it so that we will not be coming back here in a number of years time wondering where it all went wrong and dismantling the system.  Democracy is based on sound, local government.  This whole area of compiling the register, having an accurate register and having on the register <Col N="1595" /> everyone who is entitled to vote are matters of great public importance and deserve the time and attention which the House is now giving these matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>: It is no harm to bear in mind that Deputy Molloy spoke for a considerable length of time and if everyone speaks as briefly as I intend to do, many more people could get in on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate is very useful.  It is very important that Deputies should have an opportunity to express opinions on legislation that is going to be introduced to the House before it is framed.  For that reason I welcome the debate and I do not regard it as a useless exercise.  The <Col N="1596" /> experience of the last three general elections has focused attention on some of the more glaring inadequacies of our electoral process.  It can be no comfort to anyone committed to the democratic process to know that in the recent elections almost 30 per cent of the electorate did not exercise their vote, largely because of the practical difficulties and inaccuracies in the register.  There should be a wide-ranging review of the methods and practices used by the State in its organisation of elections and by the political parties in their conduct of election campaigns.  The basic thinking governing the State's approach to elections seems to be that its responsibility ends when it makes it possible for people to vote.  The aim should be to make it as simple and as convenient as possible for people to vote.</P>
    <P>One of the major factors of the poor turn-out which we regularly have at elections is the state of the electoral register. From my own experience in Dublin North-West, I estimate that up to 10 per cent of the electorate there were not eligible to vote because they were either removed from the register or listed for the wrong constituency because of change of address and so on.  That figure may be higher in the North-West constituency than for others but the figure is also high in Rathmines where there is a large shifting population.  It is estimated that something like 25 per cent of the population in Ballymun changes in a matter of eight to 12 months because of the number of people moving from the flats to corporation accommodation on the far side of the city.  Most people moving from Ballymun go to Tallaght and it is virtually impossible for those people to get back to Ballymun to cast their vote.</P>
    <P>The improvements suggested by the report in relation to the electoral register are good so far as they go although I question some of the proposals and I think that a number of suggestions made to them, which they turned down, should be reconsidered.  The suggestions made by the committee do not go far enough. The period of time during which the register is compiled is still far too long.  It is seven months at present and the proposals put forward by the working committee <Col N="1597" /> suggest it could be reduced to about five months.  Even five months is far too long. It should be compiled in a period of not more than a month and the use of the census system would be useful in that regard.  The census system of compiling the register was turned down by the working party on the basis of cost, not simply in relation to the cost at this time but they said it might not be worth it because they had not yet decided whether the margin of error was large enough to justify it.  I argue that the accuracy of the register and the democratic procedures which we have are worth whatever it costs to get them right.  I recall that last year when there was talk about a general election it was felt that the country could not afford a general election.  That sort of thinking is dangerous.  If we cannot afford to have proper democratic procedures and elections we will lose our democratic processes.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the present totally inadequate provisions for postal voting should be improved.  I go along to some degree with the working party's recommendations in this regard.  However, I am concerned about one of their points referring to postal voting.  They say that application for inclusion on the postal voters' list should be supported by medical or employment certification as appropriate or a statutory declaration in the case of self-employed persons.  The self-employed person may well be able to afford a statutory declaration.  I have no idea what form of statutory declaration would be required to obtain one but normally you would go to a commissioner for oaths and at a cost of a few pounds you get your declaration signed.  Medical certificates can also cost money and it is likely that people who require medical certificates are the people least likely to be able to afford such certificates.  I suggest that any legislation which the Minister is considering should provide for a system of certification by the local gardaí known to the person who requires a postal vote.  This would be a better and less costly way of processing the system.</P>
    <P>Generally we welcome the extension of the postal vote but we feel that the <Col N="1598" /> possibility of allowing people to apply for postal votes when an election has been called, which again was rejected by the working party, should be considered again.  Otherwise a large number of people who are short-term patients in hospitals, people going away on holidays, people confined to the house for a short period, will not be able to vote.  Our purpose must be to make it possible for all to vote regardless of the circumstances they may find themselves in.</P>
    <P>In relation to the postal vote also I will refer briefly to the point raised by Deputy Molloy and Deputy Doyle from Wexford concerning the Diplomatic Corps, public sector workers and State employees who find themselves abroad working for the State.  The provision of postal voting for such people has been turned down on the basis that they must be resident in the State in order to be eligible to be on the electoral register.  If that is the only reason &mdash; it seems from the report that that is the only reason &mdash; then that should be amended.  It is quite improper that people who are serving this country abroad should be deprived of their right to vote for the Government.  Likewise, non-nationals who are resident in the State should be given the right to vote in national elections.  Many such people have been living in this country for a considerable time and some have raised their families here.  I know of one case in my constituency of a man who has been resident here for 20 years and has not been able to vote in the national elections for that length of time.</P>
    <P>While I would welcome the extension of the postal vote to disabled persons, representations have been made to me indicating that a considerable number of disabled persons would prefer the facility of putting their vote into the ballot box. In other words, they want access to existing polling stations.  It has been suggested that the provision of ramps would enable these people to gain access to the stations. It should be ensured also that polling stations would be on the ground floor. Even for elderly people it is essential that polling stations be on the ground floor.  I make a strong point to the Minister also that mobile polling stations which have <Col N="1599" /> been rejected by the working party should be reconsidered.  We should endeavour to ensure that every person disabled, elderly or whatever, does not feel that he or she is being treated as a second class citizen.  The option should be there for those who are disabled to choose the postal vote if they wish but some system of mobile polling station should be instituted.  The report suggests that it is within the powers of the returning officers to establish polling stations in hospitals and institutions.  I do not know of any example of this being done to date, but again the Minister should give serious consideration to it.</P>
    <P>Taking the wider perspective in relation to elections, the possibility of holding elections on Sunday should be considered. This is common practice in many European countries and there is no reason why we should continue to follow the British and American system by asking people to vote on normal working days when for many people this is the least convenient time.  If we do not provide for a system whereby people who moved from their district a short time before an election is called &mdash; for instance a person who has moved from Ballymun to Tallaght, for instance, or even out of the city altogether &mdash; election day is also a working day and the possibility of such persons voting is restricted further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>: I draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that the report is merely on the register of electors and anything more than a passing reference to Sunday voting would not be in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am raising it in order to highlight the fact that the report refuses to allow people to register at short notice.  When people have to vote on a normal working day the difficulty of casting a vote in those circumstances is increased.  The alternative to having it on a Sunday would be to make polling day a public holiday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect of this matter of enabling people to vote is the circus that takes place outside many of our larger polling stations.  Some restriction should <Col N="1600" /> be put on that kind of activity and a way of doing this would be to reduce the numbers of people who have to vote at various polling stations.  In some constituencies up to 10,000 electors go to a single polling station.  It would be far better if a larger number of polling stations were provided so that smaller numbers would be using any one station.</P>
    <P>To conclude, I ask the Minister to indicate when he intends to introduce legislation on the lines recommended in the report.  I urge him to introduce this legislation in time for the local elections in 1984 and the European elections.</P>

      <P>: I can assure Deputy Fitzsimons I will not delay him. This is one of the most important debates to come before this House.  I was amazed this morning when the Leader of the Opposition voiced his consternation and <Col N="1601" /> said we were wasting our time today.  I disagree completely with him.  We are discussing a most important issue &mdash; the right to vote.  This is something we fought for for many years.  Unfortunately the situation still arises where people who should have the vote find at election time that they cannot vote because their names are not on the register of electors. This is very serious.  Had many more people had the vote in the past it is probable that our political history would have been different.</P>
      <P>I want to compliment the working party on their detailed report and also those who made submissions, in particular the county registrar for County Clare, the Clare County Council and Ennis Urban District Council.  When I read the names of the members of the working party I was amazed to note that not one woman was involved.  The reality is that there are a number of women in public life, at national and local levels, and over 50 per cent of the electorate are females. It was unfortunate that the Minister overlooked appointing a woman to the working party and I hope such a thing will not occur in future.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of the working party were very limited.  The Minister should have made recommendations to the working party.  The activities outside polling booths, powers of presiding officers and polling clerks, the allocation of presiding officers year after year to polling booths and some of the abuses which have gone unreprimanded at polling stations need examination and it was a pity this working party did not have an opportunity to examine these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the first recommendations was the change of dates.  Like previous speakers I am not too pleased with the proposed date of publication of the register, 10 January, with the last date for making claims being 24 January, two weeks later, and publication of lists of claims on 31 January.  Political parties make a great contribution in this area and as a member of a political party I regard this as a very short period.  This is one point in the report with which I do not agree and I <Col N="1602" /> ask the Minister to consider extending that date at least a further two weeks.</P>
    <P>The working party propose that in addition to the publication of the current register, lists of additions and deletions be issued.  This is an excellent idea because it will be evident to all who are interested exactly what the situation is. In the case of the proposed additions, if the people who have the right to vote do not see their names on the lists, they will have the opportunity to have their names added.  This is highly commendable and should be brought in as quickly as possible. In the past the examination of the register has been left to the rate collectors.</P>

When I called Deputy De Rossa, Deputy Fitzsimons questioned the matter.  I replied that I was not establishing a precedent. While the sole responsibility for calling Members rested with me, I said I was taking a number of things into account, including the subject we are discussing, the fact that it affected parties and that this was a limited debate.  When Deputy De Rossa concluded, I called Deputy Taylor-Quinn and Deputy Fitzsimons again expressed surprise and questioned the matter.  I explained, again without prejudice, that I was obliged to preserve a balance and in accordance with long standing practice and precedent I was moving from one side of the House to the other.</P>

      <P>: The working party suggested that there should be sufficient field workers employed to ensure there is a complete house-to-house check before the electoral lists are compiled.  In the past the rate collectors have done this job.  In some cases people were satisfied with that situation but there was a fair amount of discontent, depending on which side appointed the rate collectors. To a point, that has been unsatisfactory because it has led to many allegations by political parties who have been saying so-and-so was taken off the register because of a particular political affiliation. It has been said that somebody under age had been put on because of certain political affiliations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order that such a situation will not <Col N="1604" /> arise in the future we should have people less politically involved than rate collectors. Deputy Doyle suggested postmen. I agree with that suggestion.  They, with officials from the Department and, possibly, representatives from the political parties, could do quite a good job in compiling the register.</P>
    <P>I consider the suggestion of a supplement to the register a good idea.  The working party suggest that the register in future should contain a supplement which should be published as soon as the election campaign would begin. Although I agree with that suggestion I consider that the publication should be two weeks before the date of the election because many people often are not interested in checking the register or doing anything about registering until an election has been called.  People could be reminded a second time to check the register and if they had been omitted they could go to have their names included and have them published in the supplement.</P>
    <P>It is a good idea to broaden the postal voting system.  It is now limited to the Defence Forces and the Garda.  I go along with Deputy Molloy's suggestion to have it extended to the diplomatic corps.  I would go further and suggest that it be extended to press correspondents who have to cover events abroad, particularly since we became a member of the EEC. Business people and others whose employment requires that they be out of the country should be included, but this should be carefully monitored because it could be open to abuse.  Country registrars should be very careful to ensure that those who apply for this right will be qualified for it.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that there will be better access to polling stations for disabled persons.  In the Clare constituency I can think of few polling stations that have easy access for the disabled, particularly those in wheelchairs.  Most polling stations are in schools which have steps and this means that disabled people have to be carried in to vote, if they decide to vote at all.  The sooner ramps, even temporary structures, are provided at all polling stations the better.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1605" /> Improvements in the electoral system depend on allocations of money.  I hope the Minister will regard this as a priority because the right to vote is held dearly by all people.  It is a right which we fought for during the years and we should cherish and respect this right.  I was interested to hear Deputy Molloy say that it is accepted and widely known that there is rarely a 90 per cent poll in any polling booth.  I had not thought the Deputy was so politically naive.  We all know of cases where there have been extraordinarily high votes, touching on 98 per cent and 99 per cent.  Indeed I have heard of a number of polling booths where polling has exceeded the number of people who were alive: the percentage did not go beyond the number on the register, but it went beyond the number of live people. Indeed some corpses have returned to vote on the day, so more than 100 per cent of the live register voted.  That is most unsatisfactory.  It will have to be very closely watched so that those people who have departed this life, those who have left the country and people who have moved to other areas permanently would be taken off the register and kept off it.  Some of the abuses going on now are appalling and all parties are offenders, particularly in urban areas and in flatland.</P>

      <P>: I did not think they were that innocent in Meath.  As a former flat dweller I remember an occasion when certain members of a political party came to the house and, not knowing that any of us had any political affiliations, they asked for the polling cards that had been posted to that house.  It happened that there were quite a number of cards but many people who had previously lived in the house had left.  We all know that personation happens, particularly in Dublin, and some serious action will have to be taken against it.  It is not on a small scale.  I will go so far as to say that thousands of personations occur. This will have to be closely monitored. I compliment the working party and all <Col N="1606" /> those responsible for the report.  It is a good report and it should be implemented as soon as possible.  I hope lack of money will not prevent proper action being taken on it.  If such action is not taken we will be seen to have little respect for the franchise.  We will be seen to condone abuses in the voting system and it is something any party or any Government cannot allow.  Every effort should be made to ensure that all people will have the right to vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesNFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>: I want to be associated with the protest of the Leader of this party and Deputy Molloy about the shortness of notice in regard to this report.  I saw it for the first time yesterday. It is necessary that the report be put before the House but it seems to me that it has been used as a filler because the Government have not other legislation prepared.  It is highly unusual that we should have this debate only a couple of days after the issuing of the document.</P>
      <P>I intend to be brief because we have to conclude before 2.30 and I suppose the Minister or Minister of State will require time to reply.  Without reiterating the points that have been made, I have learned a few things today about electoral registers which I was not aware of before. Things are happening in some parts of the country which do not happen in others.  Perhaps we are a bit too dignified in my county.  There are no abuses there of which I am aware.  We do not bring anybody back from the dead to vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said the incorrectness on the register represents a tiny proportion of the total electorate.  I do not know how tiny tiny is.  Since we began to computerise the registers every Deputy knows there are mistakes in every register.  In the past two or three elections people who had voted all their lives found they had been left off the register through a computer error.  One assumes that is what it was.  One hopes there is nothing more sinister in it than that.  A returning officer in a local area who knows a mistake has been made should have discretion to allow that person to vote, but that does not happen.  I suggest that we should all have permanent voting cards, like a passport <Col N="1607" /> or a medical card, which could come up for annual review.  In the past three elections we went to enormous expense sending out voting cards and so on. The Minister should consider my suggestion seriously.  When a person dies the voting card could be withdrawn.  This would put an end to many of the abuses in the system.  There would be no great difficulty in administering it.  I am sorry the Minister is not here to hear my suggestion, and I hope it will be considered seriously.</P>
    <P>We are a very politically-minded people.  In the United States in a presidential election they are lucky if they get 50 per cent of the people to vote.  Normally the figure is about 45 per cent.  In the last election, despite the fact that it was the third election in 18 months, we had a 73 per cent poll.  That is good by world standards, but it could be better. I made a suggestion on another occasion in this House on the Estimate for the Department of the Environment.  The Minister should give serious consideration to having voting on Sundays.  It is fair to say that most of us are churchgoing people.  I suggest that we should vote on Sunday rather than on a weekday.</P>
    <P>In France they have a two-Sundays operation.  We could have a one-Sunday operation.  This would have several advantages.  Civil servants may say: &ldquo;This will create problems for us.  We might have to give our staff double pay.&rdquo;  I do not see how that would affect my suggestion. We should give deep consideration to it.  The 73 per cent vote in the last election could be increased by 10, 15 or 20 per cent if we voted on Sunday.  This would suit all parties.  I made this suggestion to the House before and nobody took it up.  Deputy De Rossa pre-empted me today.  I urge the Minister to give serious consideration to it.</P>
    <P>I am trying to pick out points which have not been raised already.  A revision of the constituencies is scheduled for some time later on this year.  The Minister should also consider a revision of the local authority areas.  We have not had one for some years.  In Country Meath we <Col N="1608" /> have had quite an increase in the population in the past eight or nine years. Obviously some local authority areas need to be revised.  When the commission are reviewing the constituencies perhaps they could review the local authority areas as well.</P>
    <P>It has been said that non-nationals should be allowed to vote here.  There is an anomaly here.  British people often say that while Irish people can vote in British elections British people who live in Ireland cannot vote in our general elections.  When Deputy Haughey was Taoiseach, at the famous Summit in Dublin he discussed this briefly with Mrs. Thatcher.  The Fianna Fáil Party accept this idea in principle.  The Minister should introduce whatever legislation is necessary to do away with this anomaly.</P>
    <P>We sometimes see the letters &ldquo;L&rdquo; and &ldquo;LE&rdquo; on the registers.  Some Irish citizens have foreign names.  I think in particular of one Italian name.  Because they have foreign names the letter L or the letters LE are placed before their names on the register.  On polling day people have protested to me that they were not allowed to vote because these letters were in front on their names.  Where that occurs, if it is pointed out to the presiding officer that this person is an Irish citizen, he should be allowed to use his commonsense and let that person vote if he is entitled to vote.  I met some very irate people who took out Irish citizenship and because those letters were in front of their names they were not allowed to vote.  A bit of commonsense is required here.</P>
    <P>The suggestion about the postal vote is a good one.  While it is possible that it could be open to some abuse, in general the principle is good.  I agree with the working party that we should introduce it as soon as we can.  Deputy Molloy dealt very thoroughly with that and I do not propose to delay the House further on it except to say it is an excellent suggestion. I remember when it was introduced in the 1974 local elections.  I thought it was a good idea but it was dropped for whatever reason.  The Department must have known of some good reason why it should not be continued.</P>
    <P>I now come to the question of 18-year <Col N="1609" /> olds.  Our schools should hold exercises in civics.  Despite the fact that considerable money is spent on advertising on television and in the newspapers about registering one's name on the electors' list many people do not bother to do so. School leavers should be advised to go to the post office to check that their names are on the list.  The Minister might send a circular to all schools emphasising the importance of ensuring that one's name is on the list.  This is very important for young people who are 18 years and who are entitled to vote.</P>
    <P>As far as we know the local elections and the European elections will be held in May, 1984.  I am not sure if the date has been fixed.  Deputy Molloy or some other Deputy asked earlier that we be given definite information on that point. Perhaps the Minister would also tell us the date of the next general election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am Chairman of the Dublin City Council Finance Committee and that committee have been considering for some time the matter of the register. We have had three general elections and the local elections which were held in 1979, and considerable difficulties arose on a number of occasions.  Mr. Tom Colgan of Dublin Corporation was a member of the working party.  He has now retired from the corporation but he would have given the views of that authority and I hope they will be borne in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the problems that we, as public representatives, encounter is that people come to us on election day and tell us their names are not on the list.  I am not talking of 18-year-olds but of people who have voted in previous elections but who have suddenly found their names omitted. There are several documented cases where this has happened.  Invariably these people come to the public representative for whom they were going to vote but nothing can be done for them. It is my belief that something should be done for such people.  If a person has lived in an area for a considerable time he should be able to go before two peace commissioners or a garda superintendent and a peace commissioner in the locality. <Col N="1610" /> They could certify that the person lived in the area and he should be given a vote. What happens is that the person is told at the polling station to go to the local Garda station and they refer him to his TD.  That person could spend many hours on polling day going from one place to another in an effort to get a vote to which he is entitled.  I should be most annoyed if my name were taken from the register without my knowledge.  All that is needed is for two local peace commissioners or a garda superintendent who know the locality to say that the person concerned has lived in the area for a considerable time.</P>
    <P>The question of access for disabled persons is something I have been pursuing for a considerable time.  In my constituency there is one man who is a quadriplegic. He is paralysed from the neck down.  His father took him to vote but because he could not gain access to the polling booth he was not able to vote.  In Dublin the returning officer at local elections is the city manager and in general elections it is the city sheriff.  Because public representatives have direct access to the city manager he has accepted recommendations from them that access will have to be made at polling stations for disabled persons.  However, at general elections when the city sheriff is in charge he will not give any such commitment.  In fact, he is hostile to representations and apparently because he is in the higher echelons of the outer heavenly atmosphere he is not answerable to the Minister or to the local authority.  I am very disappointed that the city sheriff is not responsive to the public need or the representations made by public representatives. He has not accepted an invitation to meet members of the city council.  He has made decisions regarding the right of people to vote and that should be remedied.  Nobody should have that power.</P>
    <P>I consider that people in prison should be given the right to vote.  Obviously it would present a problem if everyone in Mountjoy had a vote in the same constituency &mdash; God knows what promises would be made.  If people in prison were allowed to use a postal vote giving their <Col N="1611" /> home address that would be fair.  There is no reason why a person who is being imprisoned supposedly for rehabilitative and corrective purposes should not have a vote.  It is a very considerable indignity to have one's right to vote taken away. People in prison should be as much entitled to vote as anyone else.</P>
    <P>Another problem arises particularly in areas where there are many flats: I refer to places such as Rathmines.  In an area like this people may have their names on the register in Dublin and also in their home county.  Many of them may go home to vote, leaving behind them their cards for the Dublin constituency and their votes may be used by others, even without the card.  I do not see any problem in voting without a card provided one can identify oneself or be identified by another person.  However, in an area like Rathmines where there are many flats people would not be known and extra precautions must be taken to ensure that impersonation does not take place, particularly given the tight voting position in the past two elections.  It could influence a marginal seat and that would have a disastrous effect on democracy.</P>
    <P>Some years ago in London a Member of Parliament succeeded in applying to the courts the day before an election to have the residents of a new housing estate given the right to vote.  The local magistrate decided that they should be given the vote.  As I understand it, there is no such power in this country.  At the last general election I found that the residents of a new housing estate in my constituency were not on the register but nothing could be done about it.  Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council are building enormous housing estates and there is a considerable transfer of population. If an election were to take place during the compilation of the register many housing estates would be omitted. This is absurd. It should be possible to ensure that the people concerned could apply <i>en masse</i> to the courts to be entered as an addendum to the register and given the right to vote.  It is morally wrong that entire housing estates are excluded but that is happening.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1612" /> The checking of the draft register is often done on a voluntary basis by the political parties.  Winter time, when the register comes out, may be a good time for some areas and bad for others. I do not know if this should be regulated by law or by the local authorities who know better the needs of their areas.  It might be better to compile that register in the summer.  These draft registers of electors are left for inspection in places such as Garda stations, libraries, local authority offices and post offices for people, but they will probably be hard to find in a local Garda station.  I do not see why these could not be left at churches, schools and supermarkets where so many people go.  These would be convenient locations for people to check if they are included.  That would be very easily arranged and fewer errors would arise on the register.</P>
    <P>I support the suggestion that non-nationals residing in this country should be given the opportunity to vote.  It is wrong that people living here for 20 or 30 years who have abided by our laws and paid their taxes should be denied that right.  In one housing estate in my constituency there are three such families, one of whom has been established here in business for the past 25 years or more. These people are loyal to our customs and our ways of life, but happen to have been born in Scotland.  They can vote only in local and European elections, which is totally wrong.  They sooner that situation is remedied, the better.</P>
    <P>There is also the case of a girl of 18 whose parents are Irish, but who was born in England.  She is now residing here with her parents, but because details of her birth have been provided, she has not been given a vote in general elections.  I do not know the reason for this, but I understand that it will be corrected when the vote is given to non-nationals.  This anomaly is absurd.  The time to review these regulations is well overdue.  I will certainly lend my support to a system which will give votes to non-nationals resident here.</P>

      <P>I would like to associate myself with the remarks of Deputy Molloy, our spokesman on Environment, and also Deputy Fitzsimons, in paying tribute to the working party responsible for drawing up this report.  It is a worthwhile document containing valuable information in relation to the compilation of the register.  It is a pity that we had not more time to study this document which is very important for all Members of this House because if people are not on the register, they cannot vote and if they are not able to vote, some Members of this House may be defeated and others elected.  It is a matter of concern to everybody.</P>
      <P>I represent a constituency including the new town of Tallaght and, for the past few years, part of the new town of Clondalkin. For some years we had many problems with the register with regard to a constant moving of people into these areas.  The staff of Dublin County Council have made great improvements in the recording of the register.  In the past two elections, the problems were not so apparent as in other years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer to page 8 of the report &mdash; access to polling stations and so forth.  I appreciate very much the comments made in regard to facilities being provided for disabled people.  This is commendable and will help these people considerably.  At <Col N="1614" /> every election there are additional polling stations opening in the new town of Tallaght, with many problems about new votes.  It is very often the case that these stations have a very inexperienced presiding officer in charge.  All the necessary arrangements may not have been made and people may have to leave without voting.  As the Minister of State is present, I hope he will give some consideration to this matter.  This affects all parties and the problem is well known.  At the 1977 general election the new town of Tallaght was developing rapidly and there were numerous problems as a result.</P>
    <P>I also refer to page 51 of the report &mdash; polling stations in institutions.  I was not aware that the sheriff was entitled to set up polling stations in institutions.  There is reference in the report to this, which I appreciate very much.  In the constituency of Dublin South-West, there is one institution, Crooksling Hospital, mainly catering for elderly people.  Every year a number of people from there are on the register but a very small percentage are able to vote.  I sincerely hope that the recommendation of the report will be made operable.  There are one or two other institutions in the constituency to which I hope this will also apply.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the postal vote will be extended.  The report refers to seamen, from whom I have had many representations. I am pleased that these people will now be catered for.  I welcome the report and again congratulate the people responsible, who have done a wonderful job.</P>

      <P>: The Chair has called for brevity and I hope that I do not disappoint. I would like to put on record my appreciation of the work which has gone into the compilation of this very extensive report.  It has been exceptionally well researched.  The submissions contained therein will, it is hoped, have the desired overall effect, that is, that the register of electors will be more accurate in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a pity that we are confined to such a short period for discussing such an important document.  It is an extremely important document as far as politicians <Col N="1615" /> are concerned because they rely on the accuracy of the register of electors in order to generate sufficient support to gain a seat on either a local council or in the national forum.  There has been a tremendous amount of criticism voiced from time to time of the secretaries of local authorities, the people referred to in this document as the field assistants, whose job it is to ensure that people are accurately registered for election purposes.</P>
    <P>The main attack came after the 1982 general election when the register of electors was almost two years out of date. Naturally there would then have been considerable omissions, inaccuracies, people on the register who should not have been on it and so on.  Over the years the register of electors in rural areas has been maintained reasonably accurately. Rate collectors, whose responsibility it was to ensure that the register of electors was maintained reasonably accurately did an excellent job on which they should be complimented.  There was also a tremendous input by politicians, by a large number of other agencies, all with local knowledge of an area and in constant touch with the people.  That is precisely how the register of electors can be kept accurate.</P>
    <P>There are so many submissions in this document that it would be irresponsible of me &mdash; because time is running out &mdash; even to attempt to address myself to any number of them.  However, I must mention some of them in order to assist the Minister, when drafting legislation, so that at least he will know the views of the Members of this House.  With regard to the compilation of the register, I am all for appointing competent people to do the job.  This is vitally important and may involve other organisations, political or otherwise.  Here we must compliment the political parties&mdash;although they do it for their own purposes&mdash;for ensuring that on election day the register is reasonably accurate.  That eliminates a lot of the frustration that might otherwise arise.</P>
    <P>We are running out of rate collectors because of the elimination of rates on housing.  For that reason we must consider <Col N="1616" /> paying people&mdash;as is done in other countries&mdash;to ensure that the register is kept up-to-date.  The onus should be placed on the local authority and on the person being paid to ensure that the job is done accurately and well.</P>
    <P>We sampled postal voting in the 1979 local elections.  It was suggested by politicians &mdash; and it is on the record of this House &mdash; that there was considerable abuse in this area.  The elimination of abuse in a postal voting situation is extremely difficult.  Nonetheless there are genuine reasons why postal voting should be extended.  When the Minister is considering that question he should give serious consideration to the elimination of such abuse.  I know that there is abuse in all forms of voting, even to the extent that people can be brainwashed going to a polling station, when they actually record their vote in a semi-mechanical way.</P>
    <P>I feel very strongly also that consideration must be given to people who are in institutions, who are on a register and who would normally and dearly wish to vote at election time.  Such people must be given serious consideration, as also should people in hospital for short periods.  Ways and means have been suggested of getting rid of the existing draft register.  We must give that serious thought because the draft register, if properly drawn up, is the most accurate of all ways of ensuring that the final register is accurate.  Clerical errors can be eliminated at the final stage.  The overall objective should be to ensure that all those people qualified and entitled to vote are on the register.  Omissions have given rise to very serious criticism from all quarters.  People who have voted for years on an election day have found they have been eliminated from the register for some reason or another.  That practice is most undesirable and must cease.  Of course there has also been the question of double registration which has led to a lot of abuse.  Personation has been part and parcel of the Irish scene.  Irish people going to America took pride in the fact that they could personate and won elections and a lot of influence in high places arising from personation.  Fortunately <Col N="1617" /> that practice has been kept to a minimum in this country and that is the way it should be.</P>
    <P>In the interest of allowing others have their say I shall conclude by saying I welcome the report.  I endorse many of its provisions and I look forward to legislation that will put many aspects of this report into effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>: I make a special plea to the Minister when drafting legislation to consider those individuals in our diplomatic corps serving abroad.  I know this was considered in the course of this report.  But it seems to me to be a rather dubious situation that individuals of such distinction as those who participated in the drawing up of that working party report would not feel that diplomats were as trustworthy as they in the matter of voting.  I do not see anything untoward about diplomats in our embassies abroad casting their votes.  They are not going to incur the risk of personating or doing anything wrong.  I have great faith in them; they serve the people of this country abroad and they serve the interests of this nation abroad.  Because of that they find themselves in a situation quite frequently &mdash; where they have been over 18 months abroad &mdash; of being unable to cast their votes.  There is the situation here in which Americans vote in their embassies in Congressional elections, Senate elections, presidential elections, which indeed can become quite festive occasions for exiled Americans here on business or who are in their diplomatic service.  I do not see any reason why &mdash; as in Germany, Denmark or Holland &mdash; we cannot liberalise our laws to provide for these people.</P>
      <P>I might mention also seamen, people serving the national interest by reason of taking our exports abroad.  I realise this has been dealt with in the report but there is a special case to be made for them also.</P>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for having allowed me make those few points.</P>

      <P>: In replying on behalf of the Government and the <Col N="1618" /> Minister I should like to thank Deputies for having participated in this debate. This has really been a listening/exchange of information type debate from which we wanted to get as quickly as possible the views of the elected Members of this House.  I heard Deputy Molloy earlier express a certain degree of displeasure at the speed with which we had moved.  I should say it was not our intention to pre-empt or exclude Deputies from having an opportunity to digest the contents of the report.  In fact there is a lot of meat in the report.  On the contrary, it should be said that we face elections in May and it is desirable that we attempt to be in a position to implement whatever changes we in this House agree on in time for those elections.  Therefore an earlier debate was considered preferable rather than postponing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is the Minister referring to 1983 or to 1984?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am talking about the European and local elections for 1984. There is no ulterior motive in relation to the timing of this debate.  We are anxious to hear the views of all Members as soon as possible and I assure Deputies that everything that has been said during this debate will be evaluated in conjunction with the recommendations of the report.</P>
      <P>Most Deputies who have had a chance to go through the report will recognise that the working party have done a good job in evaluating the various options in relation to the problems that have arisen down through the years.  That does not mean necessarily that we are accepting all the recommendations or that Deputies must agree with the recommendations, but the working party have gone through the whole process and have identified and analysed most of the problems that have surfaced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to thank also all those who made submissions.  A good deal of work went into some of these submissions which came from local organisations and from various constituencies.  My constituency of Dublin South-East submitted a report which was based on the experience of the Director of Elections during two elections when anomalies that were very disturbing <Col N="1619" /> occurred.  About 23 per cent of the population in that constituency live in private rented accommodation.  The lack of accuracy as between two or three elections was frightening.</P>
    <P>Deputy Walsh raised the point about the problem of establishing identity and of not being allowed to vote if one's name did not appear on the register.  As elected representatives we must find an acceptable means of ensuring that anyone whose name inadvertently does not appear on the register should be in a position to vote somewhere.  We have all had experience of people finding that their names had been removed from the register although they had been included on two or three previous occasions.  There are enough forces at work in our society trying to undermine the democratic process. We must give every encouragement to people to vote.  I have taken note of the views of Deputy Walsh on that matter.</P>
    <P>I should like to put on record my personal support for the views of Deputy Andrews relating to giving the right to vote to diplomats, seamen and people who either for personal reasons or for reasons of working abroad whether on behalf of the State or otherwise cannot exercise this right.  Personally I do not accept the recommendation in relation to that aspect in the report but this is a debate in which we are all talking about what is in the report and I look forward to coming back with a series of proposals to put before the House.  There is a very strong case for people in the diplomatic service or for anyone who because of his work finds himself abroad at election time.  The present situation means effectively that these people are disfranchised.  I have had occasion to meet diplomats who have not been able to vote here in the past four to six elections because of their being abroad.  This is not something that happens in other countries.  We should take steps to ensure so far as possible that everybody who wishes to vote is facilitated, that the minimum of hindrance is put in their way.</P>
    <P>The question of postal voting was raised, too.  From my own experience I <Col N="1620" /> know that there were many reservations expressed about the alleged misuse of this facility but I think the misuse relates more to the way in which people voted rather than to the facility.  It is difficult to distinguish the anger that some people have because of their reckoning that the election went the wrong way.  We need to put right the system of postal voting.  The experience of the 1974 local elections whereby people were able to have their names included on the postal vote register just before the election was not satisfactory.  As the report suggests, we must look at this whole question and at the possibility of extending it.  There are people who are not able physically to attend at a polling station on election day.  We should facilitate such people.</P>
    <P>There is the whole question of the putting together of the register and of the accuracy of it now that rate collectors are a declining group in the work force.  We must find other ways of compiling the register accurately.  Perhaps postmen could be utilised in this task.</P>
    <P>If after this debate has ended the Opposition spokesman has any other views that he may wish to bring to our attention, I should be grateful if he would do so.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>: That is correct.  Perhaps Deputy Andrews is not fully aware of the situation.  We are all anxious that the system be put right.  Experience of the last three elections indicated a wide range of anomalies and much dissatisfaction with the system.  People in all of the political parties, especially in urban areas, were aware that there were grave inaccuracies and that something would have to be done to put the matter right.  The working party established by my predecessor, Deputy Burke, did a lot of good work.  I am now giving the undertaking to the House that we will evaluate carefully all the points made in the debate in conjunction with the recommendations of the report.  It would be our desire and our intention to come back to the House as soon as possible with legislative proposals should such be necessary and with regulations designed to ensure that those who are entitled to vote are given every opportunity to do so and that the accuracy of the register is maintained at the highest level possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Minister for Transport (Mr. J. Mitchell) Jim Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>: The severe financial constraints on the Exchequer have necessitated the postponement of this and many other projects.  The Deputy can be assured that the delay in proceeding with this project will be the minimum possible bearing in mind the overall financial situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is the Minister aware of the saving by way of capital expenditure this year?  Is he aware that the first industry being established in the new IDA complex at Ringaskiddy has intimated that their costs have been increased substantially because of the Government's decision not to proceed with the deep water berth?  For those reasons, and because of the unemployment situation in Cork, does the Minister agree he is justified in going back to the Minister for Finance and asking for the money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>: The amount originally provided for in the draft Estimate was £1 million.  In considering the overall financial situation and trying to meet the borrowing requirements of the last Government and the budget deficit left for us, we had to make decisions that would reduce expenditure and, unfortunately, this project had to be deferred.  In reaching the decision about that project I was aware that there is no industry there or any in prospect that would require the deep water facility.  I am conscious that the project is a desirable one and I hope that the financial situation will improve <Col N="1623" /> quickly so as to permit me to finance the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister should show some concern for the project. Is the Minister aware that because of developments in coal shipments, coal vessels have to partially discharge at other Irish ports before berthing at Cork? Is the Minister aware that a banana boat had to go elsewhere to discharge its cargo because of the lack of proper facilities in Cork?  Bearing in mind the unemployment situation in Cork will the Minister agree to approach the Minister for Finance again to make the necessary £1 million available for that project?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>: Many desirable projects had to be deferred by us and the previous Government &mdash; in some cases they were abandoned &mdash; because of the financial situation.  As a former Minister for Finance the Deputy is aware of this. One of the reasons for our terrible financial dilemma was that former Governments did not take tough decisions.  In the overall interest of creating meaningful lasting jobs we have to get our financial situation right.  Unfortunately, some undesirable and unpleasant decisions are forced upon us as a result.  We will not be serving our long-term interests if we yield to every request.  It is a matter of regret but we must stand firm on such matters.</P>

      <P>: The Minister mentioned deficits and I should like to know if he would make any distinction between borrowing for productive capital works and a deficit on current account.  The Ringaskiddy project is a productive one which would bring wealth to the Cork area.  If the Minister lumped all deficits together, will he make that distinction and agree to Deputy Fitzgerald's request to ask the Government for the money for this productive project?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>: There is a difference between current budget deficit and the capital budget but where they merge we <Col N="1624" /> get the total Exchequer borrowing requirement.  We must take all projects into account.  Bearing in mind that we were limited in the number of cut-backs we could make on the current side we had to turn to the capital side.  Some of the cut-backs on the capital side were justified but on the other hand there were projects, such as the one under discussion, where expenditure would be justified if we had the money.  I would love to be able to tell the Deputies that I will be able to find the money but I cannot.  I am sure Deputy Wilson, my predecessor, is aware of the problems facing me.</P>

      <P>: I would refer the Deputy to the debate on the Second Stage of the Air Companies (Amendment) Bill, 1983, which took place in the House on 1 March 1983, in the course of which I dealt comprehensively with the position of charter flights from the United States this year.</P>
      <P>I would repeat that the actions which I have taken allow for a doubling of the number of charter seats that can be offered from the New York and Boston gateways, as compared with the 1982 level of operations, and for a 50 per cent increase during the peak months June to September.  I am satisfied that the charter programmes which I have approved, coupled with the services being offered by the three scheduled service carriers, will provide ample capacity for the coming summer.  Accordingly, and in keeping with messages already conveyed to interested airlines and tour operators, I do not propose to authorise any further summer 1983 charter programmes from New York or Boston.</P>
      <P>Filings received subsequently from the US airlines, Global International Airways and Capitol Air, on behalf of a tour operator named Tour Flites International for charter programmes from New York have been refused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated in the course of the <Col N="1626" /> debate on the Air Companies (Amendment) Bill, 1983, my decision on charters was taken only after the fullest consultation with Bord Fáilte, Aer Rianta and SFADCo, all of whom acknowledged that the decision was necessary in the best interests of Irish tourism and the development of Shannon Airport.  I would add that my decision does not affect charters from Chicago, or indeed any other US point besides New York and Boston.</P>

The decision was made in the best interest of Irish tourism.  We have made very generous increase in the number of charters possible from the New York and Boston gateways and I repeat that other points of origin are not affected by the decision.

      <P>: As far as the United States is concerned the Irish tourist market offers fantastic value.  Prices in London have been so substantially decreased that there will be a massive influx from the US this year.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport when it is intended to proceed with the construction of the electrified suburban train service to (a) Blanchardstown, (b) Clondalkin and (c) Tallaght, County Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>: I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies are probably aware, the initiative in planning rail projects, including suburban electrification, rests under statue with CIE.  In the latter connection the board submitted for approval proposals to extend the present Howth-Bray scheme to Greystones and to provide a rapid rail link between Tallaght and Heuston Station.</P>
      <P>The Greystones proposal was turned down by the former Minister for Transport last August.  This decision was based on an assessment of available funds, investment priorities in the present difficult financial situation, traffic projections in the context of all commuter requirements and the estimated cost involved. Following representations from local interest I am now giving further consideration to the Greystones proposal but I cannot hold out much prospect, in present circumstances, that the extension can be approved.</P>
      <P>There are no proposals at present for the provision of electrified services to either Clondalkin or Blanchardstown and as to the Tallaght proposal I would refer the Deputies to my reply of 2 February 1983 on this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>: I find this reply amazing. Is the Minister aware that Tallaght is the most rapidly growing area in Europe?  Within a few years it will be a city of 100,000 people and within the decade both Clondalkin and Blanchardstown will also be cities of that size.  There are no proposals whatsoever in regard to a rail system to enable commuting from Clondalkin and Blanchardstown, according to the Minister's reply.  Does the Minister intend to make proposals or suggestions or how does he think the 100,000 people in each of these towns are to travel?</P>

      <P>: Deputy Mac Giolla will know that I am acutely aware of the transport problems in west and south-west Dublin.  CIE have recently accepted a suggestion from my Department that a joint Department of Transport/CIE evaluation should be undertaken of the proposed provision of an electrified rail link from Tallaght.  That will get under way very shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>: I accept that the decision had been made about the Bray-Greystones section of the line.  In view of the commitment in the Programme for Government that they would develop the rapid rail system as soon as the present Howth-Bray scheme was completed, does the Minister feel there is an obligation on him to extend the Howth-Bray scheme and start the line to Tallaght?</P>

I hope that the fact that I personally insisted that part of the capital provided in this year's Estimate would be spent on new rolling stock to be built at Inchicore should somewhat alleviate the rolling stock problem and, hopefully, might allow for some sort of improvement in the suburban services of the nature mentioned by Deputy Mac Giolla.</P>

      <P>: As the Deputy is aware, because of the substantial losses being incurred on the company's car ferry service between Cork and Pembroke, the board of the B &amp; I decided to terminate the service with effect from January, 1983.</P>
      <P>In order to minimise the effect however of the withdrawal of the service on tourism in the Cork-Kerry region the board of B &amp; I, at the request of the Government, has agreed to provide a summer car ferry service on the Cork-Pembroke route for the 1983 season.  The service will operate from mid-June to mid-September.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>: I would be delighted if we could provide an all-the-year-round service again.  As Deputy Wilson is aware, the Cork-Pembroke all-the-year-round service has been very unprofitable. I will, of course, watch very closely the performance of the summer service this year and the better the results of the service the better the prospects for the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>: As the Minister is aware, <Col N="1634" /> it is very difficult to disentangle the losses on the Cork-Pembroke, Rosslare-Pembroke and Dublin services and very difficult to pinpoint the exact losses on the Cork services.  Is the Minister aware that it is usually said that it is £1,500,000 each in this kind of round about way which is not very satisfactory?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>: There are some difficulties in apportioning overheads for different services where there are joint overheads. On the other hand, boards of State companies are appointed to run the companies on behalf of the State and Ministers have to rely on the information provided to them by the companies.

He has already told the House that the B &amp; I company took a decision to lay on a summer service. Now he has said that it was at his express request.  I am not pushed how it came into being.  I welcome it, but it is not going far enough.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am taking it that the Deputies' questions refer to the proposed new pension scheme for CIE wages grades employees. As the Deputies will be aware, following the rejection by the contributing members of the proposed improvements in the existing scheme, my predecessor in July, 1982 authorised the continuance of negotiations between the company and the trade union group on a definitive <Col N="1637" /> pension scheme on similar lines to public sector type schemes as to contributions and benefits for the wages grades employees of CIE, the proposed scheme to be considered by the Government on the basis of prevailing financial circumstances when it was finalised.  At a meeting with the CIE unions on 7 February 1983, I confirmed that the proposed scheme will be considered by the Government on this basis when the final draft is submitted to me.  Negotiations are in progress at working party level at present and I understand that the question of retrospection in the case of retired members is being discussed in these negotiations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Commissioners of <Col N="1642" /> Irish Lights operate and maintain a number of major lights serving shipping generally. These lights are all in working order.  Other lights, serving primarily local shipping and fishing traffic, are operated and maintained by local authorities, harbour authorities and other bodies.</P>
      <P>My Department were informed some time ago by the Commissioners of Irish Lights that inspections done by them on local lights showed that a number of these lights were not being properly maintained. My Department had discussions on this matter with other Government Departments and it is understood from the Commissioners of Irish Lights that an improvement in the situation has since come about.</P>

      <P>: As the Deputy is aware, the CIE deficit has grown substantially in recent years and it was the severe deterioration in CIE's financial position that led to the engagement of McKinsey in 1979 to undertake a major study of CIE.</P>
      <P>Consideration of future long-term policy in relation to CIE has been interrupted to some extent by changes of Government since the McKinsey Report was published.  Matters in relation to CIE are under examination in my Department with a view to the submission of proposals to Government in due course.

The McKinsey Report did not recommend either closure or severe retrenchment of the railway but it did set out the financial implications of a number of future policy options.</P>

Deputy Wilson set a limit of £86 million as a subvention for this year and, given that the outturn for last year was in the region of £108 million, it does indicate &mdash; and I am sure Deputy Wilson was conscious of this when he was making his decision &mdash; severe retrenchment.

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>: No.  The first problem I have to deal with is the decision by the previous Government to limit the subvention this year to CIE to £86 million. This means there is a £22 million reduction on last year's subvention.  If you take account of inflation, it is even more than that.  I must make decisions which will enable CIE to operate within the limits of the subvention set by the previous Government.  Having made decisions in that regard, I will then turn to consideration of the McKinsey Report.</P>

However, realistically speaking, as the Government have to provide the subvention for CIE and they have to live within that limit, that will impose on CIE the necessity to make difficult decisions.  I am sure Deputies opposite will support CIE very strongly in their decisions.</P>

      <P>: Is the Minister aware that it was understood by the island community that consideration was being given in the Department to the type of vessel which would be the best replacement for the <i>Naomh Eanna</i>?  It would be a fast passenger vessel to serve the tourist trade in the summer months and also a cargo-carrying vessel to serve the island on a 12-month basis.  There was also a proposal to have a small cargo vessel going from Kilronan to Inish Méan and on to Inis Thiar as a feeder service.  Could the Minister indicate whether this Department are considering what type of vessel to acquire for this service?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport if he is aware of the proposal by the board of Aer Rianta to hand over the provision of food and drink at Dublin Airport to a foreign concern; his views on the matter; if he is prepared to make extra capital available to Aer Rianta for the improvement of the above facilities to Irish workers and management; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am aware of the proposal by the Aer Rianta Board to <Col N="1650" /> transfer the management and operation of catering services at Dublin Airport to an outside concessionaire.</P>
      <P>Aer Rianta have incurred heavy financial losses on catering operations at Dublin Airport for many years now. Despite many efforts by the board and management of the company to eliminate those losses, the situation has continued to deteriorate to the extent that it is no longer acceptable.</P>
      <P>Aer Rianta have examined many alternatives and have considered proposals from a number of Irish and international firms to rectify this unsatisfactory situation. The proposal which has finally been adopted by the board involves the taking over of the existing staff by an international firm specialising in airport catering. This firm is also willing to invest a considerable amount of capital on improving the present facilities available to passengers and to the public.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Aer Rianta Board regards these proposals as being in the best interests not only of passengers and the public but also of staff inasmuch as the new arrangements envisage an expansion of the range of catering activities with consequential prospects of additional employment.  I also understand that the proposals involve continuity of employment for existing staff without any worsening of their conditions of service.</P>
      <P>In the present economic climate I can only welcome a proposal which will not alone eliminate losses and generate revenue for Aer Rianta but which also holds out prospects of increased employment. I also welcome the proposed investment of capital by the new concessionaire.  Aer Rianta requirements for additional capital at Dublin Airport over the next five years for operational purposes are considerable and the proposed investment by the new concessionaire will relieve the burden on the Exchequer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>: Would the Minister agree that the right course is for the board to proceed on the proposals put forward by the work force and for the Government to provide the extra capital, about £75 million, necessary to improve catering facilities at the airport so that the travelling public can have good facilities, but that the bars and restaurants at Dublin Airport should be under Irish control?  It is not Sweden of the welcomes, it is Ireland of the welcomes we are talking about.  The Minister is involved in a ludicrous situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>: It would be a new philosophy indeed if we in this country were to reject foreign investment which offered the opportunity of additional employment over and above protecting present employment.  I am rather taken aback by Deputy Burke's observations in this regard in view of the fact that it is in his constituency.  The board of Aer Rianta are a very representative board who were appointed by one of my predecessors and a member of the Deputy's own party.  The board are representative of the trade union interests.  The board, with whom I met recently, have made this decision.  It would be wrong for me to interfere in the running of the company. <Col N="1652" /> Also I believe that the board have made a very good case for the decision at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>: The fact that it is in my constituency is a matter of deep concern to me because I am well aware of the concern of the work force at the airport. Is the Minister aware of the concern of other workers at the airport that, if this concession goes ahead, if the board of Aer Rianta get their way and hand over the food and catering facilities at the airport, other areas of activity at the airport such as security can be given away? Cleaning, baggage handling, in-flight meals and other areas can equally be handed over to concessions.  Is the Minister suggesting seriously that that is in the interests of Irish workers or of Irish semi-State bodies generally?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>: I would not wish to add to the fears of workers at the airport. Of course, in periods of change and uncertainty workers have these fears.  On the subject matter of the question, the fact is that employment is guaranteed for the present staff and the possibility of further employment is there without cost to the Exchequer.  The Deputy should agree &mdash; he may not agree &mdash; that this is perfectly good and it is in the interests of the workers concerned, and also of the Exchequer of course.  I only wish that we could get many other deals like this whereby jobs were protected and the prospect of additional employment was possible.</P>

Would the Minister agree that the way to handle the situation of the improvement of facilities and the protection and expansion of employment at Dublin Airport is for the semi-State sector and the Government to invest in <Col N="1653" /> bringing in multinationals or semi-State bodies of foreign Governments to handle a basic facility, such as the serving of food and drink.

The Minister may recall that at one time the restaurant at Dublin Airport was of such quality and excellence both in regard to food and service that it set a headline for the rest of the country.

I would earnestly appeal for the wholehearted co-operation of Members of the House and anyone outside the House who may be able to help in these investigations, and I ask them to contact the Minister for Justice. The leaking of these documents has very serious implications for the process of the Government.</P>

I have had no meeting with the committee, I have never released any document and I think Members of the House, other than the Deputy, will know how to treat that extraordinary allegation.  With regard to the question of the investigation, at the moment it is being carried out internally. <Col N="1655" /> The question of whether it should be taken further by way of Garda investigation is a matter which the Government have not yet had time to consider.  It would appear that one of the documents in circulation is an internal memorandum between two civil servants which never reached the Minister in question or any other Minister.  That is a factor we will have to take into account in the inquiry.</P>

Does he agree that he did not give me the information in his original reply?  He said an investigation is being carried out.  When asked who is carrying out the investigation he said no specific decision has been taken.

No decision has been taken as to whether, as in previous cases, they should be put into the hands of the Garda, an obvious course of action depending on whether results are achieved in the initial inquiry.  In regard to the earlier part of the Deputy's question, the answer is I do not agree with what he said.  The Minister for Justice has not leaked any document at any stage. Anything he has done in the performance of his duties has been done publicly in the House.</P>

    <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of the Reports:</P>
    <P>Developments in the European Communities &mdash; Seventeenth, Eighteenth, Nineteenth and Twentieth Reports.</P>
    <P>&mdash;(Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs).</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. J. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>: As Deputies will be aware, the Government are required, under section 5 of the European Communities Act, 1972, to report twice yearly to each House of the Oireachtas on developments in the European Communities.  We will today, therefore, be discussing the 17th to 20th Reports which cover the period from July 1980 to June 1982.</P>
      <P>Section 5 was inserted into the European Communities Act in order to provide the Oireachtas with an opportunity on a regular basis to debate and review developments in the European Communities. It is, I believe, important for this House to assess periodically the development of the European Communities, how Ireland can best contribute to this development and the effects which it, in turn, has on this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, in recent times there has been a growing tendency to measure Community benefits in terms of cash flows only.  Such a yardstick does, of course, have the advantage of being easy to quantify.  However, the use of such a crude criterion to measure the advantages and disadvantages of Community membership can lead only to a partial and distorted picture of such membership. In saying this, I am not in any way attempting to dismiss such criteria as irrelevant.  Certainly the benefits which this country derives from such Community instruments as the Regional and Social Funds, Structural Aids for Agriculture, special Community borrowing <Col N="1701" /> facilities, interest subsidies, and so on, are real and tangible and, we would argue, need to be further strengthened in order to eliminate the disparities in wealth as between the various regions of the Community.  In addition, of course, the Irish farming community have benefited from the price support system of the common agricultural policy.  All these are, as I have said, real and tangible benefits resulting in 1982 in a net benefit to this country of approximately £450 million.  But this provides only a partial picture of the Community and the implications of membership for Ireland.</P>
    <P>Community membership has wide ranging implications which cannot be measured simply in terms of receipts from the EEC budget for all of its member states, including Ireland.  For us, for instance, membership has meant to a certain degree a restructuring of our industrial sector, with a decline in some of our traditional industries dependent on the home market coupled with a development of new industries geared to the European market.  There has also been a diversification of our foreign trade patterns with a reduction in our traditional dependence on the British market.</P>
    <P>Membership of European Political Co-operation, which is a consequence of our membership, has afforded us the opportunity to participate actively in a very deep and extensive consideration of political developments in the world at large and in the formulation of common policies related to a large number of these developments.  These are just some of the impacts which membership has had in Ireland.  Overall too it might be said that our partnership within the Community has had a particularly significant impact in the social and cultural spheres, leading to the growth of a more wide-ranging &ldquo;European&rdquo; view, on the part of Irish people &mdash; particularly the young.</P>
    <P>A community is never static but develops through the interaction of its members and the influence which external factors have on this process.  So it is with the European Community which today stands at a crossroads in its development. The imminent exhaustion of the Communities' financial resources, the <Col N="1702" /> demands for a redirection of budgetary flows and all which this entails for the common agricultural policy, the need for the development of existing and new policies aimed particularly at the problem of unemployment, the impending enlargement to a Community of 12, the problems of existing decision-making procedures and the inter-relationship between Commission, Council and Parliament; all of these problems require urgent solutions which must be found &mdash; and found by a Community experiencing severe economic difficulties as a result of the current international recession.  It is not enough in this situation to sit on the sidelines.  How these problems are tackled will dictate whether the Community will move forward or backward over the coming decade.  Ireland must play an active and positive role in seeking the necessary solutions.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the reports currently before the House.  One of my predecessors, Senator Dooge, has already introduced the 17th and 18th reports to this House.  Deputies will understand, therefore, if I restrict myself to giving a synopsis of the period covered by the two latest reports, that is, from July 1981 to June 1982.  I will, of course, be happy to respond to queries raised by Deputies on any of the four reports before the House today.</P>
    <P>During the 12 months covered by the 19th and 20th reports the Community honoured, on 25 March 1982, the 25th anniversary of the treaties establishing the EEC and EURATOM.  It was not a particularly auspicious time, however, either internally or in its external relations, for the Community to celebrate. The challenges presented by the world economic crisis, by the accelerating pace of widespread unemployment, especially youth unemployment, and by internal institutional difficulties within the Community, were posing serious problems for European consensus and solidarity.  And yet it has been at times of crisis, and worse, that in the past European countries found the courage, the conviction and the political idealism to build on their individual and collective strength and experience and, in this way, to create an <Col N="1703" /> environment in which bold and responsive plans for economic and social progress could be put in place.  The Community urgently needs a similar idealism and similarly ambitious policies to-day.</P>
    <P>This then was in brief the broad economic background against which the Community, in its Mandate exercise, was conducting a fundamental examination of the issues and policies which would be required to meet the challenges and, indeed, the aspirations, of the eighties and beyond.  Senator Dooge went into considerable detail, in his searching analysis and assessment of the Commission's Mandate Report when, as Minister for Foreign Affairs, he introduced the 17th and 18th Reports on Developments in the European Communities to this House on 22 October 1981 (Vol. 330, No. 3).  I do not intend to cover this same ground.  However, it may be helpful to Deputies, given the continuing crucial importance for both Ireland and the Community of this issue, if I sketch in briefly some of the background to the question.</P>
    <P>The Community has moved from institutional crisis to institutional crisis in the past three years largely as a result of the British view that, as its receipts under the common agricultural policy were extremely limited, it was a disproportionately large net contributor to the EEC budget.  In May 1980, following lengthy negotiations, the Council responded to the UK case by agreeing to make budgetary repayments to the British Government in 1980 and 1981.  At the same time, they gave a Mandate to the Commission to resolve the problem by changes in the structure of Community policies.  It is worthwhile recalling that this examination of policy development was, to quote from the Mandate, to be pursued &ldquo;without calling into question the common financial responsibility for these policies which are financed from the Community's own resources, or the basic principles of the common agricultural policy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Mandate Report was the central question discussed by the European Council in London on 26 and 27 November <Col N="1704" /> 1981.  The Government, who were represented at the Council by the Taoiseach and Minister for Foreign Affairs &mdash; then Deputy FitzGerald and Senator Dooge &mdash; with the Minister for Agriculture &mdash; then Deputy Dukes &mdash; as adviser, took a particularly forceful and active part in these discussions.  The issue &mdash; and I cannot over-emphasise this point as the coming year will almost certainly see this question being raised in a similarly acute way &mdash; had profound implications for the future of the Community as we know it, and for Ireland's position within it.</P>
    <P>A reality of Community membership for Ireland was that it involved a balance of advantage and disadvantage as, indeed, it does for every member state. We could not, therefore, entertain, eight years after membership, that this might be changed in an unbalanced way, however worthwhile some of the proposals put forward were, especially in the policy development area.  I cannot accept that there is something wrong, or inhibiting to the development of other policies, in the fact that the CAP absorbs its present percentage of the Community budget.  As the Community, in the period in question, had really only two fully developed policies, and as one of these had no budgetary impact, it was hardly surprising that the CAP element of the budget was so significant.  It is pertinent to add that in past years when adequate funds were available there was no worthwhile development of other policies thus casting doubts, to put it no stronger, on the contention that the CAP cost was the real reason for the non-development of policies in other areas.</P>
    <P>I should say as well here that the management of the CAP over the past number of years had resulted in the percentage of the Community budget being taken by agriculture falling from 74 per cent in 1977 to 63 per cent in 1981.  I see little logic or merit, therefore, in singling out agriculture as the root cause of any alleged budgetary imbalance within the Community.  The problem lies rather in the size of the budget and not in its actual distribution.</P>
    <P>In addition to the CAP aspect, the <Col N="1705" /> debate on the Mandate at the London Council centred around the chapters dealing with: (a) the development of policies other than the CAP; and (b) budgetary problems.  A broad measure of agreement was reached on the policy development chapter but, in the absence of agreement on the other chapters, this remained provisional.  In the case of the budget chapter, it was found impossible to reach agreement, especially in relation to the period and principles of the budgetary rebates to Great Britain, and the limitations of budgetary contributions in the case of the Federal Republic of Germany.</P>
    <P>The position was, therefore, that, early in 1982 when it became clear that progress on the Mandate was not politically feasible, at least in the immediate future, negotiations on a further <i>ad hoc</i> refund to the UK were begun.  This was ultimately agreed on in May 1982 by the Foreign Affairs Council, following very difficult negotiations, including an unsuccessful attempt by Britain to block the 1982-83 farm prices agreement.  Elements of the agreement also included the taking of a decision on what was called the &ldquo;subsequent solution&rdquo; before the end of November 1982.  It has not, in fact, proved possible to meet this deadline.</P>
    <P>The momentum to this debate which was lost for some time, largely as a result of the blocking by the European Parliament of the British refunds for 1982, was again taken up last February with the publication by the Commission of a Green Paper on &ldquo;The future financing of the Community&rdquo;.  The Commission will be following up this Green Paper in May next with precise proposals both on the own resources question and on the British budgetary problem.  For some considerable time ahead, therefore, I envisage major negotiations taking place on the provision of new own resources, on a definitive resolution of the British budgetary question and on the development of new Community policies.  These negotiations will be crucial for Ireland.  I will, of course, keep Deputies informed of their development.</P>
    <P>Turning to the institutions of the Commuity, the period under report has seen <Col N="1706" /> a number of developments to improve co-operation between the Council, the Commission and the Parliament.  The classification of expenditure as obligatory, such as most of the spending on CAP, or non-obligatory, over which Parliament has the last word in deciding its level, has been a source of tension between the Council and the Parliament. In June 1982 the Presidents of the three institutions signed a Tripartite Declaration which prescribed formal procedures for co-operation in dealing with this problem and thereby to improve the budgetary procedure and to reduce the scope for conflict in this area.  I am sure that this approach is the right one and the declaration marked an advance in this important and significant area.</P>
    <P>Parliament has played, as it should, an increasingly influential role in the affairs of the Community.  Through its direct election, it has given a particularly democratic flavour to the Community and, while the Government do not always find themselves in full agreement with its views, I look forward to the organic growth of that institution on the basis of its democratic foundations.  I must say, however, that it would be unwise to anticipate any radical changes in Parliament's powers, at least in the context of the present lack of progress towards European integration.  Such progress is an essential condition for any substantial increase in these powers.</P>
    <P>Parliament has adopted a number of resolutions aimed at widening its functions in relation to the other institutions. The resolutions concern Parliament's role in the negotiation of agreements with third countries, its right of legislative initiative, procedures for resolving differences, and its right to be consulted on various issues.  The Council has discussed these matters with the Parliament and some progress has been made on co-operation generally between the institutions.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the question of a uniform electoral procedure for the Parliament has been considered by the Council but that so far no agreement has been reached and indeed agreement is unlikely to be reached for the 1984 elections.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1707" /> Progress was also achieved in the negotiations on the accession of Portugal and Spain to the Community in the first half of last year, when agreement was reached on mini-packages of certain chapters listed in the report.  Following the request by the European Council last June, the Commission submitted to the European Council on 3-4 December 1982 an inventory of the problems posed by enlargement.</P>
    <P>The European Council welcomed the inventory presented by the Commission which, in its view, constitutes a new impulse to the enlargement process and asked the Council to examine the issues set out in it.  A report on progress was submitted to the meeting of the European Council on 21-22 March 1982.  The European Council intends to take stock of the situation regarding the enlargement negotiations at its next meeting to be held in June and to give political orientation for the completion of the negotiations. Ireland, along with the other member states, wishes to see a speedy and successful conclusion of the negotiations on enlargement of the Community. At the same time, it must be accepted that the problems facing the Community in the area of own resources must be solved in order to ensure that the Community can cope with the effects of enlargement.</P>
    <P>A referendum held in Greenland on 23 February 1982 resulted in a majority in favour of withdrawal from the Community. Arising from the results of this referendum, the Danish Government presented a request that Greenland's status in the European Communities be changed from that of full membership to that of association as one of the overseas countries and territories.  The Commission has issued its opinion recommending that this request be acceded to; this opinion is now being examined by the member states and the appropriate organs of the Community.</P>
    <P>In March 1982, the Greek Government presented a memorandum concerning its position on its relations with the European Communities.  The memorandum <Col N="1708" /> referred to the economic problems of Greece, which it attributed partly to Greece's membership of the European Communities, and suggested that special arrangements be adopted to alleviate these problems.  The European Council of March 1982 requested the Commission to study and report on the memorandum. In June 1982, the Commission set out the results of its initial consideration of the Greek demands for which it has tried to find answers compatible with existing constraints.  The Community has recently presented its report on the Greek memorandum. The report contains a number of proposals for Community measures in reply to the memorandum.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the Community's external relations, the period under review saw a deepening of the international recession which placed considerable strains on the world trading system. It is very heartening for Ireland, as a small open economy, that the Community and its major trading partners have, in general, avoided a protectionist response to these strains and that at the recent GATT ministerial meeting delegates undertook to resist protectionist pressures.</P>
    <P>This is not to say that there are not difficulties.  Deputies will recall the dispute with the United States over European steel exports.  I am happy to say that an agreement has been reached in this matter.  The United States, and other trading partners such as Australia and New Zealand, have also criticised aspects of the Community's agricultural trade policy.  This was, likewise, a particular issue at the GATT ministerial meeting. I am confident that a satisfactory accommodation can also be reached in this matter, although recent subsidised sales of agricultural products by the US in markets in which the Community is a traditional supplier have not helped.  The Government will seek to ensure that the Community's right to a fair share of the world market in agricultural produce, which was confirmed in the Tokyo Round negotiations and the principles of the common agricultural policy, are maintained.</P>
    <P>The growth in the Community's <Col N="1709" /> adverse trading balance with Japan was a matter of serious concern in the period in question.  Deputies will appreciate that for certain members states, which manufacture goods such as motor cars, television sets, and so on, which are in direct competition with Japanese goods, this is a very sensitive matter.  The Community has, therefore, sought to encourage Japan to open its markets to imports of manufactured goods.  I am encouraged by the steps which the Japanese Government have taken in this regard.  It is, of course, too early to say what their effect will be but the Japanese Government have shown increasing understanding of the concerns with which Japan's trade surplus is viewed by her trading partners and, despite present difficulties, I feel this augurs well for future relations between the Community and Japan.</P>
    <P>I might perhaps mention two other developments which encourage me in the view that the world trading system will survive the current recession.  One was the extension to 1986 of the GATT Arrangement on International Trade in Textiles (the so-called Multifibres Arrangement). Without the disciplines imposed by this arrangement, it would be quite impossible to ensure that, while developing and newly industrialised countries got a fair share of the world market in textiles, older textile industries in the developed world had the required breathing-space to adjust to the competition.  The other development was the amendment of the OECD Arrangement on export credits, adjusting minimum interest rates upwards, particularly for those countries classified as &ldquo;relatively rich&rdquo;.  This avoided a free-for-all in the rates offered under officially supported export credit systems.</P>
    <P>In the period covered by the twentieth report, legislation was enacted to enable Ireland to comply with its obligations as a member of the Common Fund for Commodities. I am pleased to report that the remaining steps necessary before the ratification of the Common Fund Agreement were completed expeditiously. Ireland's instrument of ratification was deposited on 11 August 1982.  In the near <Col N="1710" /> future, the House will have occasion to look at an individual commodity, jute, for which an international producer-consumer agreement has been negotiated under the Integrated Programme for Commodities.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the Community &ldquo;Plan of Action to Combat Hunger in the World&rdquo;, which was prepared following an initiative by the Italian Government and a number of European Parliament Resolutions highlighting the worsening world food situation.  As part of this programme, the Development Co-operation Council of 3 November 1981 agreed to grant 40 million ECU in exceptional food aid to the least-developed countries.  The plan of action aims to provide a framework for combined Community and member state support for the food strategies of individual countries. It was agreed that Mali, Kenya, Zambia and Rwanda should be chosen as the initial beneficiary countries.</P>
    <P>The Community welcomed the progress made at the Versailles Economic Summit of June 1982 in the direction of agreement on an early launching of the global negotiations on international economic co-operation for development. Unfortunately progress towards the negotiations is at standstill because of the unfavourable world politico-economic climate.  However, Ireland, in common with the other member states of the Community, is committed to these negotiations and will continue to press for them in the appropriate fora.  Developments at the recent Non-Aligned Summit in New Delhi, and Group of 77 Ministerial Meeting in Buenos Aires, have shown that a more realistic and pragmatic approach than heretofore is being taken by the developing countries, and attention will now turn to the industrialised countries.</P>
    <P>Relations with developing countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) continued to expand during the period under review with the accession of Belize and the State of Antigua and Barbuda to the Second ACP/EEC Convention of Lomé.  During this period, too, Ireland ratified the Agreement on the accession of Zimbabwe to the Convention. In the Mediterranean area, the <Col N="1711" /> Community is examining a communication to the Council on a Mediterranean policy for an enlarged Community.  It is expected that this policy will consolidate and develop co-operation arrangements with the Mediterranean countries in the framework of the &ldquo;overall Mediterranean approach&rdquo; worked out in 1972.</P>
    <P>I have dealt earlier with the position of the common agricultural policy in the mandate negotiations context.  I should now like to say a few brief words about the 1982-83 marketing year price increases which, for reasons which I have already mentioned, were not, unfortunately, agreed on until 18 May 1982.  The main features of the agreement were an overall price increase of about 11 per cent together with the continuation of the premium for suckler cows and the introduction of a calf premium at the rate of £21.90 per calf.</P>
    <P>There were intensive negotiations during the period under review aimed at the establishment of a common fisheries policy.  As Deputies are aware, this policy was agreed early this year.  This common fisheries agreement marks probably the most important development in the Community in recent years, with the establishment of what is, in effect, the third fully developed policy area in the Community.</P>
    <P>The adoption of the policy also opens the way for the future development of the Irish fishing industry.  I am sure Deputies will wish to join me in congratulating my colleague, the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, Deputy Paddy O'Toole, on helping to bring these negotiations to a successful conclusion.</P>
    <P>The growing tragedy of unemployment was, inevitably, of deep concern to the Community during this period.  The European Councils in March and June, for instance, devoted considerable time to discussing the situation.  They considered that the objective of reducing unemployment called for a co-ordinated policy among the member states to promote productive investment, to increase competitiveness and productivity, and to develop a Community industrial strategy <Col N="1712" /> based on a technology and innovation policy.  Agreement was reached to step up efforts to modernise European economic structures, to increase the convergence of the Community economies and to develop a specific Community measure to combat unemployment, especially among young people.</P>
    <P>In October 1981, the Commission presented to the Council its proposals for the Review of the European Regional Development Fund and a Council working party began discussing the matter in December 1981.  These discussions are still continuing.  The Review has also been discussed from time to time by Foreign Ministers in Council, and will be on the agenda of the forthcoming Foreign Affairs Council on 25-26 April.  Ireland has long called for the development of a comprehensive Community regional policy which could make a genuine contribution towards lessening disparities between regions and we are pressing for this in the review discussions.</P>
    <P>The review of the European Social Fund, which was due to be completed by the end of 1982, did not, in fact, begin until October last, when the Commission submitted its proposals to Council and so is outside the period under review.  On this subject, too, however, discussions are still continuing.</P>
    <P>Turning to European political co-operation, I can report that it continued to develop in a satisfactory manner in the period under review.  The Foreign Ministers of the Community, in November 1980, requested a review of the working methods and administrative arrangements of political co-operation.  This review, known as the London Report, was agreed by the Foreign Ministers at their meeting on 13 October 1981.  The London Report was laid before both houses of the Oireachtas on 16 October 1981.</P>
    <P>It is not my intention to go into details concerning the recommendations of the London Report.  There was some discussion of these during the debate on earlier Community reports in this House in October 1981.  In the London Report, the member states reaffirm their commitment to the process of political co-operation. <Col N="1713" /> They emphasise their pledge to consult partners before adopting final positions or launching national initiatives on &ldquo;all important questions of foreign policy which are of concern to the Ten as a whole&rdquo;.  They undertake that in these consultations each member state will take full account of the position of other partners and will give due weight to the desirability of achieving a common position. The London Report restricts the discussion of security questions to their political aspects, that is, to consultations on and the preparation of, the diplomatic activities of the Ten in those fora in which they together, as Ten, encounter such issues.  An example of such activity is to be found in co-ordination on arms control and disarmament issues at the United Nations.  This provision, though its insertion was of considerable importance to Ireland, in reality does no more than state formally what has been the case in regard to discussions of security issues within European Political Co-operation.</P>
    <P>The proposal initiated by Foreign Ministers Genscher and Colombo concerning European Union have been discussed intensively during the period under review.</P>
    <P>The object of these discussions is to achieve agreement on the text of a declaration on European Union, incorporating notably a bringing together under the umbrella of the European Council of the functions of the Communities and of EPC, while retaining the essential character of each &mdash; the former based on legally binding treaties, and the latter based on political commitments.  Closer cultural and legal co-operation is also envisaged.</P>
    <P>The discussions also cover proposals to improve the operation of the Community institutions, in particular in relation to decision-taking by majority-voting where the Treaties so provide.  Ireland recognises that, where vital national interests are at stake, it can be necessary to defer decisions indefinitely.  The abuse of this position is, however, a matter of concern and must be eliminated.</P>
    <P>In the discussions on the Genscher/Colombo proposals, Ireland has urged that economic and social progress <Col N="1714" /> and the creation of greater convergence between the economies of the member states is the best basis on which to secure progress towards European Union.  It is the concrete and visible measures taken in these areas which will enable the peoples of the member states to identify their interdependence and which will form the basis of the solidarity which is essential if the task of building a European Union is to succeed.</P>
    <P>Turning briefly to the various areas of tension in the world, which were discussed by the Foreign Ministers in Political Co-operation during the period under review, a number of major developments took place in the Middle East during the period covered by the reports. The Ten co-ordinated their response to these and continued to seek ways by which the principles of the Venice Declaration of June 1980, the basis in their view of a just settlement, could be implemented.</P>
    <P>The most serious development, and one whose consequences are still very much with us, was the invasion by Israel of Lebanon on 6 June 1982.  The Ten vigorously condemned this action as a flagrant violation of international law. They reaffirmed their support for the independence and territorial integrity of Lebanon and called on all parties to abide by the relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council.</P>
    <P>The situation in Poland was, of course, a major preoccupation of the Ten throughout the period under review, as it still is.  The Ten reacted, both jointly and individually, to the declaration of martial law in December 1981 and have continued to follow developments closely.  The basic attitude of the Ten was made clear in the statement issued by the Foreign Ministers on 4 January last year. In that statement the Ministers appealed to the Polish authorities to end as soon as possible the state of martial law, to release those arrested and to restore a genuine dialogue with the Church and Solidarity.  They also noted with concern and disapproval the serious external pressure and the campaign directed by the USSR and other Eastern European countries against efforts for renewal in <Col N="1715" /> Poland.  The Community later indicated its disapproval of this pressure by limiting the importation of certain goods from the Soviet Union.</P>
    <P>Martial law was formally suspended in Poland at the end of 1982 but this suspension was accompanied by a number of exceptional legislative measures some of which appear to create possibilities for repression which did not exist before August 1980.  The Ten consider that the distance now dividing the Government and the population in Poland can only be reduced through a dialogue between Government and authentic representatives of all political and social groups as well as by a search for national consensus.</P>
    <P>At the CSCE Review meeting in Madrid the Ten are working for agreement on a balanced and substantial concluding document which would mark tangible progress within the human dimension of the Helsinki Final Act and would contain a precise mandate for a Conference on Disarmament in Europe.  There are some hopes that it may prove possible to bring the Madrid meeting to a conclusion before the summer.  Deputies will be aware that during the period covered by the 20th Report the Falkland Islands dispute was a major issue in European Political Co-operation.  I will confine myself here to expressing the hope that we have seen the last of armed conflict in that region of the world.</P>
    <P>In Central America the continued growth of tension has been of considerable concern to all members of the Community. Since many of the difficulties were judged to have arisen as a result of the grave economic and social problems of the region particular attention was given to the possibility of allocating more Community aid to the region.  By these means it was hoped that the Ten could, with the agreement of the countries concerned, help to reduce tension and promote peace in Central America.</P>
    <P>The Ten have pursued their policy of strong opposition to and condemnation of apartheid in South Africa and have supported the efforts to find an acceptable basis for the implementation of the <Col N="1716" /> United Nations plan for Namibian independence.</P>
    <P>The situation in Afghanistan remains a threat to regional stability and to international peace and security.  The Ten believe that Afghanistan must be enabled to return to its traditional position of neutrality and non-alignment and that conditions must be created in which the people of that country can determine their own form of Government free from outside interference.</P>
    <P>The Government are following with interest the efforts of the UN Secretary-General and his personal representative to try to reach a negotiated settlement to the Afghanistan crisis.  We believe however, that, if these talks are to have any chance of success, there must be a demonstration by the Soviet Union of its genuine willingness to contemplate a withdrawal of its troops in compliance with the various UN Resolutions.</P>
    <P>The problem of Kampuchea is also still with us.  Ireland, together with out Community partners, has contributed to the international relief effort in the region. Indeed, on that note, I was glad to meet some of our volunteer workers on the borders there recently.  We can be very proud of the work they are doing there. In many ways they are very fine ambassadors for this country.</P>
    <P>The people of Kampuchea have undergone appalling suffering over recent years as a result of domestic cruelties and the hardship imposed by foreign invasion and occupation, and major efforts are urgently required to secure a lasting political settlement to the crisis &mdash; a settlement which must, in our view, involve the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops and respect for the right of the Kampuchean people to determine their own future free from intimidation or coercion.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that in recent weeks further attacks by Vietnamese forces have taken place against a number of encampments for displaced Kampuchean civilians along the Thai-Kampuchean border, resulting in a further influx of refugees into Thailand.  I wish to avail of this opportunity to deplore these attacks and to appeal to the Government of Vietnam to refrain from any further <Col N="1717" /> such actions.  Having seen the situation there, I feel very strongly about it.  The lot of both sides is bad enough without their being under attack constantly from the Vietnamese forces.</P>
    <P>The situation in Turkey has been a cause of continuing concern to the member states, particularly in regard to alleged violations of human rights.  In order to impress on the Turkish authorities the extent of their concern, the Ten requested the Foreign Minister of Belgium, Mr. Tindemans, to visit Ankara in March 1982.  Mr. Tindemans conveyed to the military rulers the feelings of the governments and of public opinion in the Communities on the matter.</P>
    <P>We are now looking forward to the accession of Spain and Portugal to the European Community.  Despite difficulties which have arisen on certain economic aspects of the accession negotiations, the Ten recognise the political importance of these two countries' membership. Because of this concern, it has been agreed to associate Spain and Portugal as fully as possible with the procedures of European Political Co-operation. They have been kept informed regularly of developments within Political Co-operation, with a view to gradual harmonisation of their foreign policy positions with those of the Ten.  In addition, during the period under review, the first meeting at ministerial level took place, between the Foreign Ministers of the member States, and their Spanish and Portuguese colleagues.  This meeting saw a valuable exchange of views on matters of current interest to both sides.</P>
    <P>I can record with gratification that the Community and its member states are increasingly seen as a distinct collective political grouping in international relations and that they are able to exert a more effective influence on world affairs. The success of political co-operation lies in its gradual and evolutionary manner of development.  It has sought to build on mutual information and consultation in order to clarify common themes in the individual foreign policies of the member states and by so doing it has steadily encouraged the growth of mutual understanding and confidence.  Ireland has <Col N="1718" /> maintained constantly, however, that steps to intensify co-ordination in the political field must be based on a growing community of interest in the economic and social fields.  Consequently, further development of political co-operation must go hand-in-hand with efforts to maintain and strengthen economic integration within the framework of the Treaties.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that this introduction gives only a brief summary of the major developments in the Community in the 12 month period in question.  If Deputies wish to raise questions on these or indeed on other developments related to Community affairs, I will, of course, try to take up their points and respond.</P>
    <P>I would suggest, in conclusion, that what we witnessed in the period in question should be seen as a holding operation in the history of the Community.  Member countries wished to move ahead, to develop new policies, to resolve the sterile budgetary dispute and to introduce a new impetus and a new dynamism into Community affairs.  And yet, perhaps because of the all-embracing impact of the depression, the ultimate political vision and will was found to be lacking.</P>
    <P>In the coming months, we &mdash; Commission, Parliament, Council &mdash; will again have to look fundamentally at the related questions of additional own resources and the development of new policy areas for the Community.  The very future of the Community of Ten, not to mention a Community of 12, is at stake here.  I intend that Ireland will play an active, positive and progressive role in these discussions. We must use the strength and vigour of our belief in the Community and its institutions to broaden the debate from the narrow confines of budgetary flows, where it has for too long been bedevilled.  We need a qualitative move forward, and quickly, in Europe.  Deputies can be assured that we will play our full part in achieving this important and urgent aim.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>: I wish the Minister of State every success on his reappointment and I have no doubt that he will make a success of the difficult job with which he <Col N="1719" /> is entrusted.  I take this opportunity also of congratulating the Minister for Foreign Affairs on his appointment and I wish him every success also.  Since both these appointments have been made I am confident that the frequency with which meetings took place during my term in office has not diminished.  I have a certain envy of the Minister in that he has a Minister of State to help him.  I could have done with such help on occasions and if I had had that help I might have had a different time from that which I have experienced in the past four months.</P>
      <P>We are debating reports on developments in the European Communities for a period of two years.  While not wishing to cast doubts on the usefulness of these reports as reference works, there is a valid point in relation to commenting on developments up to two years after they have taken place.  I do not think there will be any disagreement on either side of the House so far as that is concerned. It is fair to say that the limited number of sitting days in the last Dáil rendered it impossible to fit in such a debate.  The only exchanges that take place in this House on European issues relate to formal statements by party leaders.  It would be far more valuable if the Minister for Foreign Affairs could report from time to time, perhaps after Foreign Affairs Councils, on issues currently under discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Standing Orders of the House make it virtually impossible to have any worthwhile discussion on these issues through, say, a series of Parliamentary Questions and the normal follow-up by way of supplementary questions on these issues. One could consider raising specific matters on the adjournment but this course of action leaves much to be desired.  My original suggestion that the Minister or the Minister for Foreign Affairs might consider reporting back to the House after each Foreign Affairs Council meeting would probably be the best way of giving the House the opportunity to discuss various important issues that arise. Such a procedure would not necessarily take up too much time but would benefit <Col N="1720" /> considerably both the House and the public.</P>
    <P>One of the most important subjects that has spanned the past two years and which remains unresolved is the financing of the Community.  I deplore the narrow focus of the debate which has concentrated on how much different countries put into the Community and how much they visibly take out.  It is not so long ago that we had a Heads of State meeting at Dublin Castle and the one headline we all remember from that related to Mrs. Thatcher saying that she just wanted her fair share.  That is regrettable.  Perhaps I will have more to say about it later on.</P>
    <P>Germany makes the largest payments to the Community.  There is no doubt about that.  Germany is often referred to as the paymaster of the EEC.  Their whole economy has benefited and continues to benefit enromously from Community trade, as shown by the fact that they have a trade surplus at least equivalent to their payments into the Community. On the other hand, Ireland may appear to benefit greatly because of agricultural and other receipts, but there has been a very high rate of industrial losses in older industries due to Community membership.</P>
    <P>It is also a fact that there has been no change in our relative position with income per head 60 per cent or less than that of the Community average.  I have often heard it said &mdash; and I never agreed with it &mdash; that perhaps we should be the good boys in the EEC context, that we were doing well, and that if we rocked the boat by making further demands we would probably suffer for it in the long run.  I remember seeing a document prepared by a senior British civil servant which made the case that Ireland should be reminded that we were doing very well and, therefore, should be the good boys, as it were, while tough negotiations and discussions were taking place.  At every opportunity we should make the point that, while we recognise that we are doing reasonably well, so are others, including the United Kingdom.  I will have more to say about that later on.</P>
    <P>With regard to Community finances, it is a fact that the finances are coming close <Col N="1721" /> to the revenue ceiling.  Various solutions have been proposed to this problem, but the most straightforward solution would simply be to raise the VAT ceiling.  I admit, of course, that that is a somewhat regressive tax and it slightly exaggerates Ireland's payments to the Community on our ability to pay basis.  It is far more acceptable than a payments method which would seek to create a direct link with benefits from the agricultural fund. The genuine commitment to the Community of countries which adamantly refuse to increase its funding, to my mind, must be in some question.  There is very little point in high-sounding declarations about European unity if every effort is being made in the meantime to restrict the financial base of the Community's activities.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest failures of the Community over the past two years has been its inability to co-ordinate economic recovery out of the recession.  The limited relevance of the Community to economic recovery has not helped its image.  Time and again our Government and Taoiseach sought action at European level with very limited success only.  The time has come when one could ask: Can it be justified that so much time should be spent by the Taoiseach of the day and senior Ministers in Brussels at meetings which often produce so little by way of result?</P>
    <P>It comes back in part to the unwillingness of the larger countries to commit the necessary resources.  If I might be permitted a personal observation, I remember some time last November or December being asked: &ldquo;What way are things going in Brussels?  What is your reaction to them?&rdquo;  Truthfully I said one of the things I found most difficult to understand was the constant inability to make decisions within the EEC.  This is so.  To get decisions was probably the hardest thing in the world.  Our meetings were a series of constant hagglings over the British demand for budget refunds.  We spent days and nights trying to find a solution to a problem that exists and to which a solution must be found.  However, the problem helped to grind the decision-making process in Brussels practically to <Col N="1722" /> a standstill.</P>
    <P>The lack of progress made with regard to decision-making on other matters was unbelievable.  This time last year we were at the peak of a row between Britain and France in particular on the question and method of refunding the British on their budget rebate problem.  At that time I saw some brinkmanship displayed by the British and it often made me wonder if their commitment to the EEC was as strong and healthy as one would like a full member to have.  Even though that separate question was totally divorced from the fixing of farm prices for the year nevertheless there was an unofficial link between getting agreement on the budget rebate question and the fixing of farm prices.  There were public denials that that was so until a junior minister from the British Parliament admitted late one night that this link was there.  The matter was flushed out into the open then.  The consequences of that unofficial link which was established for the purposes of intimidating other members to toe the line with regard to the British budget rebate question was a totally unwarranted delay in the fixing of farm prices until 21 May.  It was then that we fixed it at a Foreign Ministers' meeting in Luxembourg, a gathering which went on until 4 a.m.  The only comment I will make about that is that decisions arrived at at 4 a.m. are often not the best decisions because truthfully we spent many more days haggling later over what decision we had arrived at.  Each member state had a different recollection of what was decided.  I do not think they have decided the matter yet.  I can recall that at the Heads of State meeting in Denmark early in December there was still disagreement on what had been decided on 21 May.</P>
    <P>The brinkmanship exhibited at that time with regard to an intimidation to get agreement on the budgetary question for the UK held up the agreement on farm prices and that cost our farmers a great deal of money.  At that time some commentators expressed the view that the farming community here were losing in the region of £500,000 per day.  We are all aware of the method that had to be <Col N="1723" /> employed to get agreement on farm prices in the end.  The earlier Luxembourg agreement was broken and farm prices were only agreed as a result of a majority vote, a break in an agreement that has been in existence for a long time. That was wrong because the UK knew there was goodwill on the part of all member states, including Ireland, to try to find a solution to their problem but nevertheless we suffered considerably because of their actions.</P>
    <P>One of our principal interests in the EEC is the annual fixing of farm prices. During 1981-82 we obtained outstandingly good packages for Irish farmers.  I believe the percentage increase last year was 11 per cent.  Although I accept that conditions for 1983 are less favourable Irish negotiations now are unsatisfactory if we are to believe what was printed in this morning's newspapers.  The display of arrogance and truculence by the British Minister of Agriculture, Mr. Walker, seems to have floored our case.  It is an unfortunate feature of this year's price fixing procedures because the offer of 4 per cent falls far short of what is required. I felt a certain resentment last week when I read that Mr. Walker threatened to object to the calf subsidy scheme and ensure its discontinuation unless we toed the line on other separate issues.  Mr. Walker is an extremely able negotiator, a very shrewd person, a man one has to mark very carefully.  I should like to think that our Minister for Foreign Affairs or our Prime Minister would let their opposite numbers know that if Mr. Walker is serious about objecting to the continuation of the calf premium subsidy then the British cannot always expect the co-operation we have given on the question of a budget rebate.  Mr. Walker is wrong and the facts of life should be explained to him.  I am not threatening economic war but we must protect our own interests effectively.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to make progress within the EEC when prices which should have been introduced many weeks ago at the start of the season are being delayed. They were a month late last year and we lost out on benefits.  I say more in sorrow <Col N="1724" /> than in political anger that some of the sneers and comments made about us in Government when we announced the calf premium subsidy were unjustified and unnecessary.  A favourite line during the Galway by-election was that the scheme would not work and that calves were being hawked around from one place to another in an effort to register them for the scheme.  We must be very forceful in negotiations, particularly on the question of agriculture, because we are dealing with a person who is extremely ruthless in protecting the interests of his own people and Government.  Proof of that can be seen in the public squabbles he has had with the French and others.</P>
    <P>During the past two years, particularly when we were in Government, we succeeded despite the pressures in maintaining the value of the pound.  Only a short time after coming into office this Government were forced into a devaluation which has added £400 million to the foreign debt and set at naught the heavy sacrifice demanded of the taxpayers in the budget.  I suspect that one of the main unstated reasons for the devaluation was to cover up for a generally poor performance, particularly in the agricultural sector, in getting and maintaining reasonable prices and achieving a greater increase for farmers than it seems they are now to get.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the matter of political co-operation.  We all regret the breakdown of the latest Middle East initiatives. I am afraid one of the difficulties in making progress towards a solution is widespread scepticism of American political will.  The Israeli Government time and again seem to be able to defy the United States administration with impugnity and it is my view that the Arabs will not firmly take the path of compromise unless they are convinced that the Israelis are taking that path.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell us the position with regard to the Genscher-Colombo proposals.  We have no wish to obstruct European progress but we are alarmed at the increasing demands from various quarters that Europe should recognise that it will not make further progress economically and should begin <Col N="1725" /> to develop a security-defence dimension. I want to make it crystal clear that as far as Fianna Fáil are concerned we will not permit any tampering with our policy of neutrality.  If all that is meant by political aspects of security is that many world problems post a threat to security, then these problems can be discussed.  We are not prepared to participate in military decision-making by members of the Atlantic Alliance, nor can we accept that it would be within the competence of the European Community to recommend or endorse NATO decisions, such as the siting of missiles in Europe later this year or to co-ordinate military interventions outside Europe by member states.  The Minister should make this clear in any discussion on the Genscher-Colombo proposals.  I would welcome a full debate in the Dáil on these proposals so that their implications could be publicly discussed and our European partners would be in no doubt that they represent no change in our position of neutrality.  We have made it clear that meetings of Minister for Defence are absolutely unacceptable to us.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of the question of the admission of Portugal and Spain to full membership of the European Community. My recollection is that about Christmas time there was a 75 per cent achievement in regard to the question of Portugal's accession.  That figure was given to me by the Portuguese Foreign Minister.  Being a small nation I suggested that Portugal's entry should be taken on its own and should not have to wait until the Spanish question had been settled.  I did not find much support for this suggestion and it appears that Portugal's accession will be delayed until such time as the Spanish entry has been sorted out.  I clearly recollect that at that time progress on the Spanish question had reached the 30 per cent mark and that many great problems, including the fish problem, remained to be solved.  The fish problem has a specific interest for us because the Spanish have the biggest fishing fleet in Europe.  They have approximately 3,300 fishing boats.  If we spoke to our fishermen on the west coast they would tell us how big a threat they are to <Col N="1726" /> their livelihood and to our fish stocks.</P>
    <P>There will be major problems for us but we are not against the accession of those two countries.  There are big problems for us in the Community in relation to their accession and we should talk about them in this House.  Should we, because of the present difficulties within the Community, rush into having two additional members before sorting out the existing difficulties, particularly the financial ones?  Can we not get agreement from others, because we are at the ceiling as far as income is concerned, about restructuring the Community's finances? As I have already said, because of my experience of the failure to make decisions, if there are two additional members sitting around the table, those difficulties will be magnified one-sixth.  I do not believe that anybody will disagree that things will not be any easier.</P>
    <P>We would like to protect our situation within the Common Market.  If there is to be a further drain off, as there must be, particularly in the case of Portugal, because it is a poor nation, how will that affect us if something is not done in the meantime to strengthen the financial arrangements within the Community? This problem was being faced up to certainly up to Christmas.  Perhaps the Minister of State will be able to state if any progress has been made there.  Will it take more money away from the CAP? What will the Mediterranean scheme cost?  Will there be a shift in emphasis from Northern Europe to the Mediterranean?  If that happens it will have an affect on us and we need to examine this very closely.</P>
    <P>There is another matter, which is new but to which we must be alerted, the question of full members renegotiating their position once they are in.  That has already happened in the case of Greece. The Minister of State said the question of renegotiation there is concluding and they are now looking for better terms. The British are doing the same thing under a different name.  They are looking for their fair share and they want to get out as much as they put in, which takes away from the spirit of the Community. These matters must be examined.  If the <Col N="1727" /> Greeks rushed through their negotiations for the purpose of getting in and, having got in, want to have a new set of negotiations perhaps there are ways and means that, if we feel we can benefit from examining our situation, we should look at that also.</P>
    <P>I note what the Minister of State said with regard to the US steel problem, which was very much in evidence over the last year.  This caused a serious problem for the Community.  It is only natural between the USA and the EEC that problems will arise.  I was shocked at the lack of structures that should be in existence to deal with problems of this magnitude. The President of the Commission at one time was a Dane and then a German who went to deal with the American administration officials in Washington.  A different man went each time.  I failed to get agreement that the Foreign Ministers would as a group meet the Secretary of State, Mr. Shultz, because the French do not want the Foreign Minister of the Ten, for their own particular internal reasons, to meet the Americans or to meet anybody as a group to discuss economic matters affecting the Community. We had officials of the Commission and the Commissioners going to meet people in the administration in Washington.  The whole thing smacked of inefficiency and, as a result, the big row over steel dragged on and on and demanded a lot of time for discussion.  We did not make any decisions on the matter.  I believe there is room for improvement there.  I am not saying that I have the answer to it.  The suggestions I felt might improve the situation were not acceptable.  I hope the Minister and his advisers can come up with better suggestions which might help.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the EEC are making progress with Japan.  If the situation there were not so serious one could say it was amusing.  The Japanese markets were practically closed completely to us but yet imports from Japan were exceptionally large.  I am glad to see that the situation is changing although admittedly very slowly.  I hope the Commission will follow this up because there is a very large market there which we should have <Col N="1728" /> access to.  If I were asked to give an honest comment on my last meeting of the European heads of state it would be that I witnessed the obvious frustration of all the heads of state incapable of coming up with anything worthwhile to deal with the great problem of unemployment in the Community.  I am sure the number has risen since then but at that time there were 12 million people unemployed and very little progress was made with regard to doing something worthwhile for them.  Almost a full day was taken up with discussing the situation. Suggestions were made but nothing worthwhile has come forward to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>I have dealt briefly with political co-operation and the Middle East.  The situation in Poland occupied much of our time during the course of the political co-operation meetings as did Central America.  The situation there is extremely difficult and we would all like to see it sorted out completely.  During my attendance at the United Nations during the month of September I had discussions with a number of people from Central American countries and with some in particular the divergence between their views and the views of the United States are so wide that one sees great difficulty in solutions to the very serious problems emerging in a very short period.</P>
    <P>I was glad to see that the Minister of State mentioned the question of Turkey. I was very impressed with what the Belgian representative, Mr. Tindemans, did during the course of his visit to Ankara in the early part of last year.  I hope the promise he got from the military in Turkey that free elections will be held within two years will be kept.  It is a sad situation which exists where former prime ministers and politicians are jailed instantly if they comment on the military regime or their operations.  It is not necessary for me to repeat what the Minister said about Afghanistan, Poland or Kampuchea. There is no disagreement between us on that.</P>
    <P>This debate would probably have been better if we were not discussing a report <Col N="1729" /> which covers two years.  The Minister should consider having a debate in the House after each of the Foreign Affairs Council meetings.  The House would find that more interesting and would be kept in touch with what is going on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>: I regret having to hold up the House on this issue this evening. It may seem a parochial matter but it affects almost one million people.  I raise it to express the sheer frustration of the people of south Dublin about the lack of progress which has been made.  It may seem that I am just talking about another road which needs tarring or other work but I am not.  This is a road which it is proposed will go across the whole southern section of Dublin city.  According to the consultants it will carry up to 100,000 cars a day when it is finished in 1989.  If the road is not finished Dublin city will grind to a halt.  I say that without any exaggeration.</P>
      <P>Anybody who has had the pleasure of driving anywhere between the Naas Road to Dún Laoghaire knows that the average speed a car travels at is 5 to 7 miles per hour.  I ask the Government to cut through the red tape.  I have no doubt the Minister will give me a long list of each section, junction, allocation and decisions taken by the council and changes of plans.  I know all about these and about the rows between various golf clubs, colleges and so on.  Deputy Shatter knows them as well as I do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I plead with the Government to cut through the red tape and finish the road. The total funds which have been allocated so far amount to £2,500,000.  Only a small fraction of the road has been built for that.  If the jet which had to land at Mallow had known about this fraction of road it could safely have landed there.  It runs from Greenhills to the Tallaght road.  It starts nowhere and goes nowhere.  It can best be described as one <Col N="1730" /> and a half miles of beautiful runway.  It has been built with public money and is just lying idle.  It is as big a scandal as the beautiful empty offices we have in town. The road must be connected up.  It is no use the way it is.</P>
    <P>This has been going on for ten years. The Minister of State is more familiar with the problem than I am.  This is 1983 and I hope the three of us are not back here in 1993 trying to get the road completed. We had a debate earlier today about rail services needed for Dublin. The statement was made time and time again that this city is grinding to a halt.  It transpired that there is no overall CIE plan to try to relieve the congestion.</P>
    <P>Only a small section of the road has been built in ten years.  That is not acceptable. What is the completion date for the road?  I want the Minister to cut through the red tape and give me straight answers. When can we look forward to him or someone on this side of the House cutting the tape to open the southern cross route?  There are hundreds of thousands of people waiting for an answer to this question.  I am as sensitive as anyone to the cost and it would be no harm to know the overall cost of the road.  Will it be £20 million or £50 million?  So far it seems that only £2,500,000 has been spent on it. Has all the land been purchased?  This will cause problems if not.  I want to be able to tell people when it will be finished and how much it will cost.  If we get answers to these questions we need not bore people with a lot of detail.</P>
    <P>On 1 May 1981 a letter was written to the southern cross study group by Deputy FitzGerald in which he said:</P>
    <P>We consider the southern cross route as absolutely necessary to the proper development of south Dublin. It will play a vital role in the commercial development of that area as well as protect the quality of life of its inhabitants. We are convinced in Fine Gael that this project is essential and I hereby re-iterate Fine Gael's commitment to it.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister of State is not Fine Gael but I know the Leader of the <Col N="1731" /> Government wishes to have the road built and I ask him to expedite the matter.</P>
    <P>There are many other aspects one could go into.  There are sections of the road for which money has been allocated but which have not been built.  There has been disagreement about large sections of the road.  The southern part of Dublin has the fastest growing population of any European city.  It is an area which is fast becoming a concrete jungle and one where traffic stands still.  If the Government do not have an integrated transport plan for this area combining road and rail things will come to a halt.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Shatter, and I spend a lot of our time performing a sad duty and that is attending the funerals of nine-year-olds and ten-year-olds who have been viciously run down by motorists in this area.  It is almost a daily task and not one which we relish.  I attribute these problems to the difficulties in the area.  I ask the Minister to cut through the red tape and try to devise a plan for the whole area south of the Liffey.</P>
    <P>Any area, Rathfarnham, Dundrum, Ballinteer or Ballyboden, is bigger than Galway city and together they are bigger than Cork city.  They are enormous cities and there seems to be no plan to try to sort out the difficulties in that area.  I want to express the frustration of my constituents and to ask the Minister to carry out the commitment given by the Leader of the Government and to cut through the red tape so that I can report to the people of south Dublin that this commitment has been lived up to.  I would ask the Minister to inform me of the timetable, costs and an opening date for the road.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>: If there is agreement on any single issue among all Deputies who represent Dublin South in all the parties, it is the urgent necessity to build the southern cross route.  I have heard <Col N="1732" /> Deputy Brennan's speech repeated time and time again in the council chamber of Dublin County Council.  It is no harm to bring home to central Government the urgent necessity to build this road.  In my time as a member of Dublin County Council I felt continuously frustrated at the length of time it seemed to take to bring matters to any sort of conclusion. There have been endless deliberations and waiting for reports from engineers commissioned to examine and re-examine the route and to advise council officials as to where the appropriate route should be.  Some of the delays are not the fault of the officials; they are the fault of councillors, including myself, who have sought to ensure that the route takes the most practical course to cause the minimum damage to the general area.  However, the stage has now been reached where there is need for urgent progress in the building of this road.  Indeed that stage was reached many years ago and Deputy Brennan is right in saying that there does not seem to have been any overall plan for the provision of roads in the Dublin south area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>South Dublin is the fastest growing area in the whole country and the existing road structure is incapable of taking the traffic passing through it at present.  It is getting steadily worse.  There have been a number of road accidents and the blockage of traffic at rush hours is creating enormous problems for the people living in the area.  Central Government have a very distinct role to play in cutting through some of the red tape and procedures in ensuring that this road is built very rapidly.  There can be no dispute about the need for the road.  It is fully supported by everybody who lives in the area.  It is needed not merely in the context of road safety, which is one of the most important aspects of it, but also in the interests of a proper traffic flow system. There are also sound economic reasons for building this road quickly because in Dublin South there are a number of industrial estates either built or about to be built which will require this type of road structure to service them.  If we do not provide that road structure, we will have an increasing number of juggernaut <Col N="1733" /> lorries trailing through residential areas and demolishing garden walls and cars in their path.</P>
    <P>It sounds very parochial to talk about individual roads but on Ballyroan road, every second or third week, some individual's garden wall has been demolished by a juggernaut or other vehicle going along a road which was originally built for residential purposes and was never envisaged as a main thoroughfare.  It has now become one of the busiest roads in Dublin South and there is an urgent need to divert this type of traffic out of built-up residential areas populated by a large number of young children.  There have been a number of very tragic accidents in the last 18 months in this area.  Many of these accidents would never have taken place if this route had been built years ago.  When the massive number of housing estates were being planned for Dublin South, the road should have been built then.</P>
    <P>I do not see at present any time scale and I agree with Deputy Brennan when he says it is very difficult to know when this road will be built.  I greatly fear that in five ot ten years time we may still be debating the need for the road and asking the Government to provide the funds.  I understand &mdash; I am sure the Minister will correct me if I am wrong &mdash; that all funding which has been sought by Dublin County Council over recent years has been made available by different Governments formed by different parties. It is not a party political issue.  There is no outstanding request at present from Dublin County Council for funding and I hope that, as the council require funds, they will be made available.  The Minister should confirm that.  In election campaigns, some people in political parties suggested that Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael were not going to provide funds if they were elected.  My experience has been that each party, during successive Governments in recent years, have always provided the funds as they have been sought.</P>
    <P>In accepting the urgent necessity to build this road, I ask the Minister to enter into urgent discussions with the officials <Col N="1734" /> of Dublin County Council to ascertain what steps can now be taken to hurry the procedures required to bring this road into being without it dragging on for many years.  The Minister has a role in this and I would like to see him taking up that role in conjunction with council officials and with elected councillors on Dublin County Council, to see it there is some way in which the present procedures can be speeded up.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister is in a position to refer to all the points made by Deputy Brennan.  Perhaps he will say that the matter should be referred back to Dublin County Council officials by way of questions to them.  If that is the case I would ask the Minister to take today's discussion as an opportunity to take an initiative and to talk directly with officials and councillors to see what we can do to speed up the process and provide this road for the people who badly need it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>: The estimated cost of the precise southern cross section, the one over which there is an alignment dispute, not the portion which is built, in other words, from Firhouse to just below Wesley College, is £20 million. The Firhouse to Naas connection, some of which is already built, will cost £10 million.  That forms part of a western by-pass around Dublin city known as the western parkway, linking up with the southern cross and the total combined estimated cost on today's prices is £61 million.  Does the Deputy want to hear the rest of the bad news?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>: Exactly.  That is the first reply to the Deputy's question.  The second is that the estimated timetable as set out in the roads development plan &mdash; the Deputy should sit comfortably to hear this &mdash; is between 1986 and 1992.  That is the estimated completion date for the entire project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I accept fully with little or no reservation the degree of frustration and <Col N="1735" /> anger in the area and the necessity for this road.  I know the area and I know the problem.  However, how are we to schedule its funding to shorten the time set out in the roads development programme?  I accept the suggestion made and the invitation from Deputy Shatter supported by Deputy Brennan to meet officials of Dublin County Council to talk about this issue.  The county council for a variety of reasons have not themselves progressed this thing as quickly as they could.  I take full responsibility for the red tape over which I have control but I will not take it for organisations over which I have no control.  Maybe between the two the thing can be speeded up.</P>
    <P>The funding of major roads such as this and other roads is something that we need to get cash into now rather than wait for the normal time span in terms of capital allocation.  There is no point in condemning the sins of the past at this stage.  We all know that it should have been done better and it is no pleasure for me as an advocate of it being done ten or 12 years ago to stand here now and say, &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo;.  The political question is how to get from here to the resolution of the problem quickly.  We will have to raise additional funds and we are actively pursuing ways in which additional funds can be made available for the road network and we hope to be in a position to give details of that to the House.  Legislation may be involved in the process, but in the interim we could not advance the work much faster if we were to write a cheque for £20 million for Dublin County Council now because they are not in a position to proceed with putting cement on to the ground or clearing the site.</P>
    <P>I say to Deputy Shatter as a member of Dublin County Council and to Deputy Brennan as a representative of the area that the county council themselves with their consultants must bring forward the final detailed proposals for the alignment of the land.  As the Deputies know, they have made a number of changes and I will not try to repeat what has been said, but we need to have the details finalised so that tender documentation can be prepared and work can commence on site. <Col N="1736" /> There is no constraint from us in relation to that.  The engineering section have approved in principle the major proposals at this stage but the consultants have to come back.</P>
    <P>Both Deputies will be aware that there has been a dispute going back for a long time about the alignment of the Southern Cross.  It was included in the final stages of the ratification of the development plan for Dublin County Council on 31 March this year, but even within doing so the point was made that the alignment <i>per se</i> is merely that and not the final fixed location route of the road.  Therefore, we have ambiguity in this.</P>
    <P>I recognise and share the concern of the Deputies.  There is a critical national need to build this entire road system and because of that we must look again at the priorities for capital roads allocation.  If that means cutting back on the allocation for Galway then I am sure Deputy Brennan will explain in his sweet and soft tones to his senior colleague and front bench spokesman, Deputy Molloy, why it is so necessary.  That is part of the hard choice that we must make.  The southern cross road which affects the entire region of Dublin and all traffic coming into and around the city must be seen in the context of a national road of maximum priority. In that context we can bring forward the timetable, but at present the official timetable set out four administrations ago in the roads plan for the eighties is 1986-92.  I do not find that acceptable and we are currently revising and reviewing that roads development plan.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Deputies that we take note of the debate that has taken place today and regard this motion on the Adjournment as representations in relation to looking at that timetable.  This was raised on the Adjournment in 1981 in a similar vein.  Money is a problem but not the immediate problem.  It is easy for me to say that, but really I am saying to both the Deputies and to the public representatives in the area that they must come forward with an agreed proposal on the grounds as to how this is to be built and where, and we will come forward with proposals as to how it can be funded.</P>

      <P>: This is just a long question.  The Minister would be the first perhaps to open up his mind to have more radical answers to old problems.  To join in Deputy Shatter's request, this might be a very good experiment for the Minister. There may be more radical and quicker ways to provide the employment and at the same time provide a road.  The date of 1992 is a depressing prospect for the people of south Dublin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>: Let me suggest to Deputy Brennan and also to Deputy Shatter in his county councillor capacity that they consider one of the things we will discuss <Col N="1738" /> with the officials is how we could make one CPO for the entire alignment of the route and have one public hearing.  A great deal of legal work would be involved in that in terms of referencing; there are staffing implications and undoubtedly we will be hit with the embargo etc., but we can sit down and talk about these things and see if we can combine resources.  That is the first way we can cut through the red tape of the CPO acquisition.  It is really focusing resources on the task and getting one CPO hearing, one process.  There will be objections to the CPO because somebody's back garden, front garden, or favourite view of the western world will be affected by this road, as both Deputies are better aware than I am.  My first immediate suggestion is let us try as hard as we can &mdash; there may be suggestions as to why it cannot be done &mdash; to short-circuit that.  There is no point in the engineering department bursting their guts to get the thing up to the law department and for the law section then to sit on it and not make the resources available. If we are to run it through the system, each section of the county council must give it priority.  We must also look at the construction aspects and bring forward the design and tender documents simultaneously in advance of the programme so that there is no reason for delay other than the availability of money.  As a socialist and a member of the Labour Party I have always had radical ideas about how you get money. &ldquo;Watch this space&rdquo; is what I would say.</P>

In normal circumstances the child in question would be receiving fixed appliance treatment at this stage.  However, this particular type of treatment is one for which the Department of Health has been seeking to get agreement since July 1981 on a scale of charges with the private orthodontists who provide the service on behalf of the health boards. The absence of an agreed scale of charges has led to a hold up in the isue of authorisations for treatment.  Discussions on a fixed scale of fees are in progress with the private orthodontists and I am hopeful that agreement will shortly be reached so that treatments can again be proceeded with without delay.</P>

    <P>The Deputy may be referring to the position at the Rehabilitation Institute's <Col N="1676" /> community workshop at Castlebar, where disabled persons, who in the opinion of the assessment team are deemed unlikely to benefit from further vocational rehabilitation, have had their disabled person's rehabilitation maintenance allowance withdrawn and replaced by the disabled person's maintenance allowance.  Decisions in regard to eligibility for allowances for individual disabled persons, and the nature of these allowances, are matters entirely for the health board and it is not open to me to intervene.  However, I shall have a look at the practice generally in regard to payments to workship trainees who are found unsuitable for continued training and I shall deal with the matter in the Green Paper on Services for the Disabled which I hope to publish later this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>: The items which constitute means for unemployment assistance purposes are set out in section 146 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 1981 and in the Unemployment Assistance (Calculation of Means) Regulations 1934 as amended.  The rules for the calculation of means for old age pension purposes are contained in the Third Schedule to the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The assessment of means on a factual basis under both codes is carried out by <Col N="1695" /> social welfare officers who visit the homes or farms of applicants for the purpose.</P>
    <P>The actual value of the cash income of the applicant is taken into account with certain specified exceptions.  The exceptions include such items as income from social welfare schemes and in the case of unemployment assistance wages received while working under a contract of service since this income would have ceased when the applicant became unemployed.</P>
    <P>Account is taken of the yearly value of investments, or capital or property (e.g. house property) which is not being personally used by the applicant and this value is calculated in the manner prescribed by the legislation.  Income derived from a shop or farm is determined in accordance with the actual position on an income/expenditure basis. In the case of a farm which is worked the income is assessed by reference to income derived from the sale of stock, crops, milk and other farm produce.  Account is also taken of farm produce consumed on the premises and of any grants or subsidies received.  On the expenditure side all expenses necessarily incurred in earning the income are allowed for, including interest actually paid in respect of loans obtained in connection with the running of the farm.  The difference between income and expenditure is taken as the yearly means of the applicant.  In the case of old age pensions, the income of each of a married couple is taken as half of their joint incomes.</P>
    <P>There is right of appeal in all cases to an appeals officer if the applicant consiers that the means assessed in his case are excessive.</P>
