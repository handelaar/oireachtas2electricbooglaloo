      <P>On the Order of Business, I want to draw the attention of the House to the manner in which the Finance Bill is being dealt with.  I am quite certain that my protests will have no effect whatsoever but, nevertheless, in the general interest of the business of the House, particularly the financial business, I should make this protest.  The Government have been talking a lot about Dáil reform, especially in the financial area.  At present the House is endeavouring to deal with one of the most controversial, revolutionary and complicated finance measures for a long time.  The first point is that we are asked to deal with this Bill in a very compressed period of time.  However, I will not pursue that.  The Minister for Finance has, even up to this morning, been circulating amendments which are of substantial import and of critical importance to many sections of the community.  I object to this process.  It is not possible for us to deal with some of these amendments that have come out at such a late stage in the way we would like to, to consult commercial, business and other interests concerned and get an informed view of what <Col N="2108" /> is proposed.  The way in which the Minister is bringing forward these amendments haphazardly and very late in the day makes a nonsense of any suggestion that this Government are serious in their intention of having the House deal with financial business in a responsible manner.</P>

      <P>I am not blaming the Chair, I am putting the blame fairly and squarely where it belongs, on the Government.  I want to draw your attention to the matter of advance corporation tax.  The Bill was published with a certain, very specific proposal with regard to advance corporation tax.  Subsequently, the Minister said &mdash; not in this House but somewhere else &mdash; that he was making changes in this regard in so far as international corporations were concerned. Finally, we now have&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I do not know if we can do anything about it now but I wish to protest on behalf of the Opposition, who are anxious to deal with this Bill in a responsible and mature way and have been prevented from doing so by the way in which the Minister is handling the situation with regard to amendments.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 10 has been ruled out of order.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2112" /> Section 3 agreed to.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 4 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We support the principles embodied in sections 3 and 4 for a variety of reasons not least because they follow on what we introduced in terms of the principle of the split incomes of married couples.  These two sections deal with the arrangements for separated couples.  Perhaps the most significant provision in the tax code in respect of married couples was made two or three years ago when we introduced the provision on split incomes in respect of the working wife at home.  This illustrates to a considerable extent the fact that financial legislation can be used to create a desirable social climate.</P>
      <P>We are dealing here with the consequences of marital breakdowns and separations, and the tax conditions which arise as a consequence.  By far the most important thing which has been done to protect marriage and to encourage the role of the woman in the home was done by this party in Government just over two years ago when we split the incomes on this basis.  We support what the Minister is doing in applying the same principle now to separated couples.  In terms of maintenance arrangements or payments they will be liable to single or joint assessment by agreement.  We support that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Legislation of this kind has a very important role in ensuring that the social order we support will be strengthened and supported.  That is what we achieved two or three years ago in this area.  This Bill in general does quite the opposite. We went beyond the Murphy case in the Supreme Court which dealt with the working wife outside the home, and applied the same principle to working wives in the home.  Had we not done that, the level of tax in the PAYE sector would be such that the outcry would be enormous. The relief introduced then for good and sufficient reason is now a base <Col N="2113" /> of our tax.  It is a major element of tax reform and I am glad it is there.  Were it not there we would have more problems of separated couples to deal with than we are coping with this morning.</P>
    <P>Some of the pressures on young married couples arise to a considerable extent from the pressures of the tax system among other things such as mortgages and so on.  If anything, the section of the Bill we will be dealing with later makes it more difficult to maintain the institution of marriage from day one.  Perhaps the provisions of sections 3 and 4 will become more operative and we will have more separated couples to deal with because of the pressures on domestic situations particularly in the early years of marriage.  The Minister should take account of the fact that tax legislation of this kind can promote social stability and encourage it, having regard to what we have always recognised to be the role of the woman in the home, and we should encourage married women, if possible, to look at their role in the home, rather than prevent them working outside the home.  We have done that under income tax legislation.  That is what we should be at, not what this Bill generally will be doing when we come later to the reduction of the relief for mortgage interest, but quite the opposite.  While we support sections 3 and 4, I am afraid we may see the application much more of the effects of these sections because of the Minister's failure to act consistently in other directions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome these sections, especially section 4, but I do not think it goes far enough.  Separated couples are now explicitly entitled to either single or joint assessment but are still denied separate assessment.  Joint assessment will require that either the husband or wife submit a tax return on behalf of both of them.  Also, when husbands and wives are separated, generally they do not know what each of them is earning and refuse to co-operate in joint assessment. In practice very few couples whose marriage has broken down will be able to agree or communicate sufficiently well to <Col N="2114" /> complete a tax return.  There is the additional problem in this area, where one partner has deserted the other: of how it can be contended then they they should have joint assessment?  There will still be the partner with a family who has been deserted, be that husband or wife, left in a situation in which he or she will be subjected to single assessment and will be unable to benefit from the provisions of this section because it does not provide for separate assessment.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister to consider that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the main thrust of the remarks made about these two sections because they are designed to deal with a situation which has created not only an anomaly but an injustice for many people.  It is for that reason that we have provided these two sections in this year's Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>I must say that I regret somewhat that Deputy O'Kennedy should have felt so sour on such a nice morning as this as to make the concluding remark he did make.  It seemed to me to be unnecessary to the case he was making.  It appeared to me that he brought into this discussion an angle which is rather extraneous, not to say totally irrelevant to the objective of these two sections.  We had a long discussion yesterday on the rates of taxation, on the tax bands, on the effects of taxation on incentive to work and so on. I had a number of remarks to make yesterday to Deputy O'Kennedy and to some of his colleagues during the course of which I acknowledged &mdash; as I think we all must in the light of the facts that we face &mdash; that we do have a very serious difficulty in relation to the overall level of taxation.  But to bring that into this discussion seems to me to be more than a little waspish and not really relevant to what we have in hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation we are aiming to deal with here arises from the fact that there are differences in treatment of separated couples depending on whether they separated under a voluntary agreement or under a court order.  Essentially what we want to do here is to give separated couples the same range of tax options as <Col N="2115" /> those available to married people so that they will not find themselves, as they do today, very often in a situation in which their total tax bill is greater than it would have been had they remained together married.  Of course, the very fact that in some circumstances their tax bill can be greater than if they were living together as a married couple creates an extra problem for them, because in the circumstances about which we are talking normally they would be maintaining two households. It seems to me inequitable that, in face of that fact which creates its extra costs, it should be the case for some of them that their tax bill is higher than it would be if they were living together. What we need is an adjustment of the provisions of our tax system in order to overcome that problem.</P>
    <P>I can see the concern expressed by Deputy J. Doyle but I might simply assure him that separated couples, under the provisions set out here can have separate assessment.  We have endeavoured &mdash; with, I think, complete coverage &mdash; to ensure that the same tax options are available to such a couple as are available to married couples.</P>
    <P>If I might give a brief outline of the sections it might help to fix it in our minds.  Sections 3 covers cases involving separation, divorce or annulment and provides that in future all maintenance payments made in these cases will be payable without deduction of tax.  To the extent that they are for the maintenance of the other spouse they will be deductible in computing the income of the spouse who is the payer and will be chargeable to tax in the hands of the recipient.  Maintenance payments specifically for the benefit of children will remain the income of the payer, who, dependent on the circumstances, will be entitled to all or part of the income tax child allowance in respect of those children. Both spouses will be taxed, then, as single persons.  This, therefore, provides the same tax treatment for all maintenance payments as is provided under existing law for maintenance payments under a deed of separation.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides in the case of a <Col N="2116" /> couple who are married but separated that the couple will have the right jointly to elect to be assessed to tax on their combined incomes as if they were living together.  This is the key part of it.  In that event the husband will pay tax on his income without the benefit of a deduction for the maintenance payments and will be granted the married personal allowance and the double rate bands.  If the wife has other income apart from maintenance payments, the tax on their combined incomes will be apportioned between them so that she will pay the tax appropriate to the other income and the husband will pay the tax on his full income without deduction of the maintenance payments.</P>
    <P>The provisions of these two sections will apply to maintenance payments made on or after the passing of this Bill. They will apply to payments made under existing arrangements only if such arrangements are replaced or varied after the passing of the Bill, or if the couple concerned jointly elect that the arrangements should apply.  In those circumstances the provisions will apply only to payments made after the variation of the arrangement or the election for the application of these arrangements, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>I welcome the approach the House has taken to these two sections because, as has been generally recognised, they represent an advance in equity for people who find themselves for one reason or another in a very difficult situation and one in which we should remove the obstacles to the fair treatment of those persons which have been in our law for some time past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We, too, welcome these sections of the Bill.  But, if the Minister is going to comment on what I say in the House, let him not misrepresent me.  I did not this morning go back into the tax bands argument we argued forcibly here yesterday and which the Minister rejected.  He must live with the consequences of that.  What I did say was that the application of the provisions of sections 3 and 4, which we support for a lot of reasons &mdash; it is consistent with what <Col N="2117" /> we have done before &mdash; unfortunately will be called into play more often because of the provisions of other sections of this Bill.  To keep it on the record, the Minister can comment but he should listen first to what I say before commenting on what I did not say.  For instance, section 6 proposes to reduce the tax allowances in the first year of marriage at a time when most couples face heavy costs.  They start their marriage with extra financial burdens as a consequence.  As an example the reduction in the mortgage interest relief in respect of couples who have commitments will bring extra pressure to bear on marriages.  We are dealing simply with these facts.</P>
      <P>While supporting sections 3 and 4, I regret that other provisions in this Bill perhaps will ensure that the provisions of sections 3 and 4 will apply more often than any of us would wish.</P>

      <P>Is section 4 agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome these sections because in my experience the existing tax code creates enormous problems when marriages break down.  The tax code was complicated in this area before the Murphy case and it became a good deal more complicated thereafter.  It had reached the stage where it was so complicated that I believe neither lawyers nor accountants fully understood it and one often saw conflicting advice given to people in identical circumstances.  I agree with the Minister's comments that under the existing tax code if a marriage breaks down, depending on the type of arrangement reached and whether a wife is to be supported pursuant to a court maintenance order or alternatively if the parties conclude a separation or a maintenance agreement, they may often find due to anomalies in the tax code that they are paying more tax as separated individuals than they were paying when they resided together.  In so far as these sections will now apply a uniform tax system for dealing with all couples who are unfortunate enough to experience marital breakdown and find themselves <Col N="2118" /> living apart, I welcome them.  There is a need for uniformity in these areas and there is a need also for persons to be treated equally and to ensure that when marriages break down people do not have to incur unduly large fees for lawyers or accountants in trying to sort out basic day-to-day arrangements for the support of a wife and children.</P>
      <P>I do not feel it is appropriate to score unnecessary party political points in a debate such as this.  The Committee Stage of a Bill such as the Finance Bill gives this House a true legislative role in trying to make some sensible input to the development of legislation.  I do not intend to refer to the remarks made by Deputy O'Kennedy but I note with some amusement the claim by his party to the benefits of what accrued as a result of the Murphy tax case which led to this House having to ensure that married couples were not discriminated against in the area of income tax as opposed to single people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 11, lines 27 and 28, to delete paragraph (b). </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the section which proposes to reduce the PRSI allowance when the indicators are that if anything we should be moving in the other direction.  How much would it cost this year to accept this amendment which is designed to restore the allowance to what it was last year, <Col N="2120" /> £312?  We are not dealing with huge figures here.</P>
    <P>The other amendment is tabled by Deputy Bell whose proposal is concerned with indexing the allowance this year. This is a reasonable proposal in view of the climate of opinion among employees. Our approach is to acknowledge that we are in a difficult fiscal situation.  Normally an Opposition would propose that the allowance should be indexed, as the present Government when in Opposition asked us to do in many areas.  However, we are simply asking that the allowance be maintained at the level which existed last year.  We want to ensure that this reduction, which is seen as a penalty, will be removed.  What would it cost to remove that penalty on the basis of our proposal?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the section is to modify the special allowance first granted in 1982-83 and to continue it in operation this year but at a slightly lower rate.  The amendment put forward by Deputy O'Kennedy would propose to keep it at the same level as last year and Deputy Bell's amendment would propose to increase it somewhat over last year's level.  The cost of maintaining the allowance at the level at which it operated in 1982-83 would be roughly £60 million in 1983 and approximately £92 million in a full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We came to consider this year what we would do with that allowance which was introduced last year on a one-year basis for 1982-83.  The total cost of maintaining it at last year's level would be approximately £60 million.  There are a number of problems to be met in relation to PRSI payments and the introduction of the allowance last year was a response to a particular kind of pressure.  Perhaps Deputy O'Kennedy will remember that some of the events we have seen in recent weeks have not been completely without precedent in previous years.  I am sure Deputy Mac Sharry has a very keen memory of that time.  We had to consider what to do with that allowance on the basis that it would cost some £60 million this year.  There are groups of people in our <Col N="2121" /> society who are not particularly well looked after.</P>

If Deputy O'Kennedy and Deputy Fitzgerald will wait for a moment, I will come in proper order to the specific answer to the specific question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if that gets under Deputy O'Kennedy's skin.  That is his problem.  I am making the point in a certain sequence and if the Deputy would have a little patience we will get there. We had to consider what we could do about this allowance.  There are some groups who are not particularly well served.  There are low paid people at work who have a special problem and in order to deal with that problem we have to look at ways of improving the conditions <Col N="2122" /> in which they live.  For people at work on low incomes there is a limited benefit they can get from our tax system. For example, if their incomes from work are the below the exemption thresholds, no amount of changes in tax-free allowances will be of any benefit to them because they simply do not have a taxable income.  Even for people whose taxable incomes are low, changes in tax-free allowances cannot help them because they have not enough income to take up the full amount of the tax-free allowances. There was a particular difficulty here which we wanted to meet.  That was the reason we decided this year to use £5 million of the £60 million which retention of this allowance at last year's level would have cost to provide a scheme of assistance for people at work on low incomes.  We will use the £5 million we have made available by changing the PRSI allowance to bring in a family income supplement.  I referred to this in my Budget Statement and I think I mentioned the figure then.  We will use the £5 million to bring the scheme into operation later this year.</P>
      <P>I make the point that that use of that portion of the moneys which we would otherwise have spent totally on PRSI allowances represents a more equitable way of using the funds.  I take the points made about the general level of taxation and its impact.  If there is a measure of this kind that we can take which evens out the use of the tax revenue foregone by the State that the allowance represents I think we can do that with a gain in terms of equity in the system and with a positive gain in terms of another measure that will be specifically directed at people who otherwise get little benefit from tax allowances. That is the complete answer to the question posed by Deputy Kennedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy said that the reduction in the allowance is a penalty. I am afraid the word &ldquo;penalty&rdquo; is a word that springs very easily to some people's lips.  It is not in any sense a penalty.  We could equally well represent the reduction in the allowance as being a tangible and real gesture of solidarity by people in a position to benefit from the full amount of the allowances in favour of <Col N="2123" /> their less fortunate neighbours who are not in a position to benefit in full from tax-free allowances.  Far from it being a penalty I would regard it as a measure of solidarity.</P>

      <P>I thought it was a rather peculiar situation.  I wondered about the motive for the reduction but it appears that the Minister gave me the answer before I asked the question.

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy O'Kennedy pointed out, there are many other ways by which money could have been found, particularly in the extra revenue which will be available to the Minister. Even at this late stage I appeal to him to do one of two things.  The Minister tried to convey the impression in this House that the cost would be £60 million. Deputy O'Kennedy's amendment calls for the retention of the sum of £312 which was given last year and at the time I supported that.  The gross cost will be £5 million and the net cost will be substantially less than that.  For the sake of that £5 million gross the Minister is taking one of the most stupid steps in the budget and in the Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that Deputy O'Kennedy and Deputy MacSharry should be aware of the protests last year regarding the increased PRSI rate.  Those protests were very mild and subdued in comparison with the climate of today. We have heard a lot about equity.  We must appear to endeavour to have equity in the tax system.  We are aware of the problems regarding different rates of PRSI for different groups and we know there is a lack of understanding as to why the different rates exist.  Deputy Bell used the figure of £351 and I have no doubt that that is the indexed figure.  Deputy O'Kennedy is merely asking that the figure of £312 be maintained.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to indicate to the House that on Report Stage he will introduce an amendment on the lines suggested by Deputy O'Kennedy.  It is imperative that he does this before it is too late.  Deputy O'Kennedy was right when he said if ears are closed and do not listen then let those closed ears be responsible for the consequences.  I do not like protests and I have never supported them but the sincere attitude of people at present should be taken into account despite the difficult Exchequer situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an ideal opportunity for a Finance Minister to allow the £312 allowance <Col N="2125" /> to continue.  This is a very minor continuation.  This is an opportunity for the official Labour Party members to maintain some of the small semblance of respectability they may have left, to row in behind that amendment and tell the Minister that if he does not give an undertaking to bring in an amendment in relation to this on Report Stage they will at least indicate to the Minister that he does not have an appreciation of the problems of the PRSI sector and the apparent growth in equity taking place.  It is sections like that in a very large Finance Bill which are causing many of the protests. If subsection (b) were taken out of section 5 it would be a very small move by the Minister to indicate that he has at least some appreciation of the plight of the PRSI contributor.</P>
    <P>The £312 was introduced last year because dissatisfaction was expressed at the increased rate of PRSI.  I remember the Minister for Finance earlier this year making play of the fact that he was not increasing the rate of PRSI.  He is now doing it by a mean, backdoor method.  I heard it preached in my constituency that there was not any increase in PRSI this year but there is now a nice backdoor method of increasing the PRSI rate.  We are taking a miserable £26 from the allowance that was given to the PRSI contributor. The Minister will do himself and the Government a favour and he will help to defuse a difficult situation if he lets the present figure of £312 stand.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to indicate to the House now that he will introduce an amendment on Report Stage to cover this.  It will cost £5 million gross which is substantially less net and will make very little difference to the figures.  Obviously the Minister has quite a lot in his back pocket already.  This has been freely admitted at Fine Gael meetings by some of the Minister's colleagues.  They say one thing he will do is have the deficit right because he has a nice handy surplus in the back pocket.  The PRSI people have supported what the Minister's colleagues are saying at Fine Gael branch meetings around the country.  The Minister should act magnanimously and tell Deputy O'Kennedy that he will introduce <Col N="2126" /> an amendment on Report Stage to meet the situation.  If he does not do this the official Labour Party, for God's sake, before it is too late, should give a message to the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>Our credentials in that regard are well known.  I support, in the name of my union, Amendment No. 12, which is being moved by Deputy Bell on behalf of the union.  I appeal to the Minister to listen closely to what we are saying.  The Government's stated philosophy is that this year they will concentrate on the elimination of the abuse of tax evasion and next year in the budget they will look at the restructuring of the taxation system on a more equitable basis.  I want to ask the Minister to reconsider that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to advert to something which was said yesterday, which greatly worries me.  Members of the Government and <Col N="2127" /> others may be so far removed&mdash;I say this with all objectivity&mdash;from the on the ground scene that they are missing out the real feelings of workers on the factory floor.  We are not talking about £5 million, £20 million or £30 million, we are talking about a tidal wave of resentment from workers who see themselves being asked to carry an unfair burden.  Somebody said that the Minister was robbing Peter to pay Paul.  It is even worse than that.  He is robbing Peter to pay Peter.  I would not mind robbing Paul to pay Peter if Peter was the worker and Paul some other sector of the community.  There will be a great cost to be paid if we ignore what is going on at the moment.  There is a very real danger to the whole parliamentary system here because respect for it is being weakened by the apparent inequity in the present taxation structures. There is a very serious social and political spin-off for the community if we fail to take cognisance of that.</P>
    <P>There is a well-known precept in the trade union movement that what we have we hold.  In the context of industrial relations it is well recognised by employers that when workers have something it is not taken from them unless it is done by an agreed exchange principle where one is traded off against another.  I am aware that the Minister is saying that the money saved there is being given to the less well off section of the community. The argument of the trade union movement and my union is that we are expected to carry to an inordinate degree the unfair tax burden in the country.  I am saying to the Minister and the Government on behalf of my union, to apply that principle equally in a political context, that what people have should not be taken from them.  There is an actual reduction in this special allowance this year.  My union, through Deputy Michael Bell, have put down an amendment to have that figure increased from £286 to £351 because that makes allowance for the CPI indexation for this year.</P>

We will handle our affairs in a judicious manner.  Not for one moment do I believe this Government will fall because of any lack of integrity.</P>
      <P>I am asking the Minister now to take into account that the workers are sick because of the impact on them of the budget.  I know that this is really the result of the legacy left to us by the last Fianna Fáil Government.  In their own document <i>The Way Forward</i> some of the toughest and worst aspects of this budget would have been brought in last January had Fianna Fáil been still in power.  That fact has not been spelled out.  The workers are entitled to be informed of all the facts and this Government do not sufficiently stress the facts, because had Fianna Fáil continued in power, the workers would have suffered all these tough measures five months earlier.  The proof of that is to be found in their own document <i>The Way Forward.</i></P>
      <P>I am asking the Government now to remember that nothing makes the heart so sick as hope deferred.  Some gesture should be made to the workers this year. There is not all that much money involved and I am asking the Government to look at the situation and take account of it because by doing so they will restore some degree of confidence in the workers.  Only a small gesture is needed. It need not be deferred until next year. Some small gesture is needed, small in cost but large in improving community relations and I appeal to the Minister to consider the amendment seriously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe the sun is in the Chair's eyes.  The reason for this special allowance must be kept in mind.  It was designed to alleviate the burden of PRSI on those caught in the PAYE net. It is a mistake possibly to spend too much time arguing about whether a few pounds should be chopped off here and added on somewhere else in the PAYE sector.  I would prefer to see a proposal designed to reform the whole PRSI structure.  Having said that we did put forward an amendment, No. 13, which has been ruled out of order.  That amendment sought to assist those on low incomes who would not benefit from the special allowance. We also sought to have this converted to a tax credit.  It is possibly a sign of the times that neither the Coalition nor the Fianna Fáil Party talk very much about tax credits these days.  It is generally accepted that this system is more beneficial to those in the PAYE net and makes for a better spread of tax within that sector.</P>
      <P>I would be interested to know why the Minister has not introduced this system. It was promised on previous occasions. The Government intended to bring it in both this year and last year but so far it has not been introduced.  Amendment No. 10, which has also been ruled out of order, sought to have the tax allowance converted to a tax credit.  In supporting this amendment then I would draw attention to the fact that the real solution to this problem is not special allowances but a restructuring of the entire PRSI system on the lines I have suggested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to say to the Deputy representing the Labour Party and the Deputy representing The Workers' Party that they obviously did not read <i>The Way Forward.</i> Had they done so they would not this morning have made the wild and sweeping statements they did.  The Minister in his reply to Deputy O'Kennedy <Col N="2130" /> gave, as far as he was concerned, a suitable resume of the allowance and the implications of it over the last year.  It is no harm at this stage to recall the necessity for the allowance.  Deputy De Rossa said that in January 12 months the Labour and Fine Gael Parties in Government put forward these huge increases in PRSI.  Those are the facts.  They were carried in the Dáil before 25 March when I introduced the budget.  This allowance was introduced then because of the impact on the taxpayer of the overall changes made and because it was not possible for tax-free allowance certificates to issue to the taxpayers prior to 6 April.  That is the first reason why that action was taken.</P>
      <P>I recall a whole day last year when many Deputies from the Labour Party, The Workers' Party &mdash; there were no trade union representatives then &mdash; and the Fine Gael Party argued about the size of this particular insurance clause.  It was not enough.  It was no good.  People were being robbed under PRSI and taxation. It should be much more.  Fine Gael made great play that this allowance would not affect the lower paid.  The excuse the Minister now puts forward for the reduction in the allowance is that it is in order to transfer that £5 million from other taxpayers to the lower paid.  What he is really doing is transferring this £5 million from the taxpayers to those who do not pay tax.  If he is so concerned about the lower paid why did he in another section later on take a 1 per cent levy off their total income?  I trust the Minister will be able to give a satisfactory explanation for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no harm to recall that this allowance was introduced first on a temporary basis last year and this year.  Obviously this Government have felt obliged to continue it.  Rather than confusing the taxpayers and adding further administrative difficulty to the task of those concerned in the collection of revenue it would have been far better &mdash; the moneys would be something similar &mdash; if the Minister had taken a decision for which he would have been respected in the light of what he has done since.  If he was doing his job properly he could have discontinued the <Col N="2131" /> allowance and forgotten about the 1 per cent income levy.  Now he has two systems which do exactly the same thing. We hear about the difficulties of administration and of collecting taxes from people who are evading or avoiding tax and that it cannot be done because there are not sufficient personnel.  How many people in the Revenue Commissioners will be involved in the additional work created by the PRSI allowance and the additional 1 per cent levy?  In effect, what the Minister is doing is giving with one hand and taking back with the other from the same section of the community.  I do not accept that he has done anything to help the lower paid about whom he is so concerned.  If he is so concerned about the people to whom he has given this £5 million family income supplement, would he not also give them an exemption from the 1 per cent income tax levy?  He will be accused, when this Bill becomes law, of many contradictions in the various items he has proposed.</P>

      <P>If the Minister wants to get the figure from his advisers I will sit down.  It will not vary very much from that.  It is a fallacy for the Minister to imply that the adoption of either our amendment or Deputy Bell's amendment would have to be at the expense of the family income supplement.  That is not the case.  The Minister deals with a whole range of financial dispositions and there is no point in the Minister saying that the reason he reduced this from last year's figure was to introduce the family income supplement.  He said the two are dependent on each other.  That cannot be.  He could pick any other element in the Bill and make that case.  There are a whole range of areas where he could either make savings or, if necessary, impose additional taxation.  I believe the workers would be as happy to see the £7 million, which is half way between our proposal <Col N="2134" /> and Deputy Bell's proposal, being lifted off their shoulders by dropping the development corporation idea.  That will generate a lot of time, activity and excitement for those who are involved but will not reach out to anybody to encourage them to get up and do things or promote incentive or initiative.  That is the kind of public expenditure which we say might be saved.</P>
      <P>The Minister said I was stinging like a wasp.  It is a bit disingenuous of him to suggest that this is a gesture of solidarity on the part of the workers towards those on lower incomes.  The Minister could ask the thousands of workers out there whether any one of them sees the reduction of the PRSI allowance as a gesture of solidarity on their part.  It is a gesture they resist very strongly and the Minister, in the fashion of the old school teacher, has asked for volunteers: &ldquo;You, you and you&rdquo; to express this gesture of solidarity. I am telling the Minister that far from expressing solidarity on the part of the workers who are affected, it does the other thing &mdash; it causes dissension and division.  The Minister made the mistake of saying that the reason that this had to be done is that the workers would get a reduction in their PRSI tax allowance in order to help lower paid workers who might not be in the tax bands at all.  That sort of statement in itself can give rise to further reaction because the indication is that those workers who resist this proposal have no care for the lower paid. That is not the case.  They care considerably for the lower paid but they should not be made to appear as if they do not care because they do not accept the Minister's spurious argument that this is a gesture of solidarity on their part.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that and I do not intend to take a great deal of time gently or ungently prodding the debate <Col N="2135" /> backwards and forwards.  There are a few questions I should like to take up.  The cost of the amendment which Deputy Bell is putting would be £13 million in 1983 and £20 million in a full year. Deputy Fitzgerald returned to a matter which we discussed last night when he suggested we could finance a family income supplement from all of the extra revenue which he and Deputy O'Kennedy think I will have at my disposal because they believe certain forecasts made by a certain body in the last few days.  As I said last night, those forecasts were made on the basis of assumptions different from those which I believe to be relevant in this year's situation.  I do not expect to have a substantial amount of extra funding available in my back pocket or my side pocket or any other pocket.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Minister expects to have extra funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I caution the two Deputies against over-sanguine expectations.  They should know what the price of such expectations can be since they suffered that themselves.  Deputy Fitzgerald suggested that I tried to convey that the cost of Deputy O'Kennedy's amendment would be £60 million.  I do not think even Deputy O'Kennedy thought that.  The figure is £5 million.  I wondered, listening to Deputy Fitzgerald, if he is in any way against the alleviation of poverty, based on the objections he put forward to the section.  He seemed to be suggesting that we should not carry out an action of this kind.  He said &ldquo;We should be endeavouring to improve equity&rdquo;.  I have no interest whatever in appearing to endeavour to promote equity.  I would rather get on with the job and provide in a measure like this a step to meet the problem of low paid people at work who cannot benefit from the type of allowance we are talking about.  This is the essential point; there are people who will not get any benefit, no matter what kind of tax allowance we give, because their incomes are not high enough to be able to absorb their tax free allowance.  They are the group I have in <Col N="2136" /> mind when I say we will set up this family income suplement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said this is a gesture of solidarity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I said it could be presented more fairly as a gesture of solidarity than anything in the nature of the penalty the Deputy suggested.  Deputy MacSharry made a number of points about the operation of the allowance and he pointed out, quite rightly, that the change involved here will reduce somewhat the tax free allowance for one group of people and pay over the benefit of that to people who do not pay tax, paying it over to people who would not be able to pay tax and would not be called upon to pay tax because their incomes simply are not big enough to attract tax.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald said in his own colourful way that the reduction was a miserable £26.  If he believes it is a miserable £26, what is all the argument about?  A reduction of £26 in tax free allowances in a case like this means a change of £9.10 in a year to a person paying tax at 35 per cent, a change of £11.10 a year at 45 per cent and a change of £6.50 a year to somebody paying tax at the initial rate of 25 per cent.  I do not think the change can be represented as being dramatic in the terms of the impact it will have on those who are paying it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The people who will benefit from this allowance are those whose incomes are at least £286 in addition to their normal tax free allowances.  The people who will benefit from these allowances will get them from the £5 million to be raised from those earning £8,000 a year to those earning £25,000 or £30,000 or £40,000 a year.  I do not think there is any great inequity involved in this change in the distribution of these funds in the way we are doing it.  We were looking for a way in which we could use the total of £60 million that would be provided if we were to retain the allowance at its old level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2137" /> I make the case that we will now have a more equitable distribution between different groups.  I cannot repeat too often that it is not open to us simply to increase the total amount because of our overall budgetary limitations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have accepted that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is perfectly legitimate for any Government to look at the equity of the distribution.  Deputy O'Kennedy suggested that it is a fallacy to say that we need this measure in order to finance the family income supplement.  It is not by any means a fallacy because we are talking about the over all value of a particluar tax relief.  It is for those reasons, in addition to others, that it is appropriate for me to vary the provision in this section. I ask the Members to face the fact that we had to use in a more equitable way the total amount of funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject the implication that workers who resist paying this extra PRSI amount and who will not get the allowance for it are not in support of the lower paid workers for whom a family income supplement is to be provided.  I reject the submission that a family income supplement can be provided only in this way.  Otherwise, unless that is made clear, there is a grave danger of one more misunderstanding outside the House among those who already feel that PRSI is heavy enough.  Of course they will be affronted by the suggestion that they are selfish, that they do not care anything about the people who will have family income supplements.  The Minister should be very careful when he is making cases like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not deal with a couple of points I made about his intention to continue with this special allowance in future years.  The allowance was introduced as a temporary measure to relieve the burden of PRSI and because the Minister had to bring in what he considers a more equitable distribution of the allowance, it is not the best <Col N="2138" /> way to deal with the problem of those paying PRSI.  Do the Government intend to introduce a restructured PRSI system which will apply to all sectors, including the farming, the self-employed and the PAYE sectors?  What is their intention in relation to tax credits?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Prendergast pointed out, our concern this year has been to deal as far as we could with the question of equity and efficiency in the collection of taxes.  I made the point that next year we will be having a look at the structure of our tax system with a view to bringing about improvements which many of us desire.  I do not wish at this stage to make any specific suggestions as to what line we might follow either in relation to the tax system itself or the PRSI system which should be looked at in the same exercise.  The contributions made by PRSI taxpayers do not cover the total cost of pay-related benefits paid out. There is another contribution from the general taxpayer to make up the balance. Therefore there is a case for looking at the two systems in the same context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy seems most uncharacteristically to refuse to take the point I am making.  What I said about the genesis of this section was this: we looked at the section in relation to the special PRSI allowances.  Since it was introduced last year only on a one-year basis, I had to decide whether to propose to the Government that we would continue with it, abolish it or do something else with the money.  I am particularly concerned about people on low incomes at work who cannot benefit from the tax-free allowance or the special PRSI allowance. It seemed to me we could use the £60 million involved in maintaining the PRSI allowance in a more effective and equitable way if we used a portion of it to address directly the problems of the people on low incomes at work.  It was not suggested that there was any inevitability about that measure.  It is simply a fairer way in my view of using the money. It is not a decision that was made with any intent to divide.  Only an opposition put to the wall to find arguments could <Col N="2139" /> dredge up an argument of that kind in this context.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the Minister who dredged up the argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>We must look at what the effect of the allowances on our system is and if we can find a way of making the effect more equitable, it is something we should be anxious to do and Members should welcome it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister a specific question about the extension of PRSI.  Presumably he will argue that he is not responsible for that area but he is responsible for parts of it.  I understand that both partners in the Government are committed to the introduction of tax credits in place of tax allowances.  The Minister said he is not prepared to say what he is going to do, but if a decision is not made now or quite soon in relation to tax credits, they cannot be introduced again.  Preparations have to be made now to introduce tax credits next year.  If that is not done now, the introduction of tax credits will have to wait for another year. When precisely are these tax credits being introduced?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have answered the Deputy's question and said I will be addressing this matter when we have finished the Finance Bill.  I am not prepared to say now what precise measures will be in question because I have not worked them out.  I am not prepared to say what specific action we will take in relation to PRSI because I have not worked it out. I can assure the Deputy that as far as the administrative difficulties are concerned. I am fully aware of them and he can be sure full account will be taken of them.</P>

We were told the same thing in 1982.  Now we are being told the Minister does not know what he is going to do about tax credits and PRSI, although both partners in Government have compaigned in at least three general elections on the basis that they would introduce these measures.</P>

      <P>In accordance with long-standing practice, the question is put as I put it, that is, that the paragraph or the words proposed to be deleted stand.  A subsequent amendment which proposes, as the Deputy's amendment proposes, to alter the words is contradictory to that decision and therefore cannot be put to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I do not consider it correct to argue that because the amendment which sought to change the paragraph in a certain way has been defeated another amendment to the same paragraph but seeking to change it in a different way should fall.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2145" /> The question I put to the House was that the paragraph which was proposed to be deleted stand part of the Bill.  The House voted on that and decided that the paragraph should stand part of the Bill.  In these circumstances any attempt to move Deputy Bell's amendment would be an attempt to undo the decision taken by the House and that would not make sense.  I will now allow further argument on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>How much does the Minister expect to claw into the revenue as a result of introducing this amendment to the 1967 Income Tax Act which affects the allowances of young married couples in the first year of marriage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal is estimated to save £6 million in 1983 and £8 million in a full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That represents the usual gross figure of about £6 million with a net figure of about £8 million.  Couples getting married obviously face considerable expense and it has always been acknowledged that income tax legislation should take this into account and give an inducement if necessary.  No one has ever questioned this allowance.  Many young married couples face great financial strain because of their mortgage commitments which will also be affected by this Bill and this reduction will mean that they will get a fraction of what they would otherwise have got in the first year of marriage.  Their net income afterwards will also be affected by this Bill.  In view of the small amount involved surely this change could be left aside.  To introduce what many people describe as a mean little amendment to the 1967 Act is petty. Also, many people in the Revenue Commissioners will spend a lot of time working out this fraction.  We often hear about the money due to the Revenue Commissioners but we should also acknowledge that a lot of people wait for a considerable time under existing legislation to get rebates from the Revenues Commissioners and the Revenue Commissioners have the benefit of that money while those people wait.  When they get it back they do not get interest&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The administration of the system in recent times, as any young married couple will tell you, is bogged down to the point where they are waiting for considerably longer than when we were in Government.  If the Minister does not know that, perhaps it is because he is not long enough in office.  Every other Deputy seems to know that these people are waiting for the rebate to which they would have been entitled under present legislation.  They are now going to wait longer for less because the officials in the Revenue Commissioners will have to work out what fraction they are entitled to&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should support me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Improvements in the administration rests with Government. <Col N="2151" /> They must ensure that these things are done efficiently and properly.  We are opposing this because it changes what has been an established and appropriate allowance in our income tax code.  It is a mean little amendment, as it has been described, and does not take account of the special financial burdens that any couple meet in their first year of marriage. It will also mean that the rebates to which they are entitled will be even slower in coming back to them than they are under the existing provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy is getting quite expert at using words like &ldquo;small amounts&rdquo;.  The difficulties facing us are the result of years of actions by his party ignoring the small amounts, but they all add up in the end.  If Deputy O'Kennedy and some of his colleagues had paid a bit more attention to small amounts when they were in Government we might not have such a large amount to deal with now.  Far be it from me to advise Deputy O'Kennedy on how he might look back on his period in office; but there is an old, true saying that when you look after the pennies the pounds will look after themselves.  Deputy O'Kennedy let too many pennies slip through his fingers and we now have to find the pounds to repay.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy has also spent too much time on that bench in recent weeks with the First Report of the Commission on Taxation in his hand.  People have mentioned how he has waved it around, but I wonder has he ever read it. Recommendation No. 73 states:</P>
      <P>In the year of marriage, both spouses should be taxed as single persons. However, they should have the right to opt to be taxed jointly in the year of marriage.  In such a case any repayment due should be reduced in the proportion that the period of marriage in the year bears to the full year. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is from the report that Deputy O'Kennedy has been waving about for the past few weeks and criticising me for apparently not paying any attention to it. Now that we come to a proposal which <Col N="2152" /> implements a recommendation of the commission, Deputy O'Kennedy chooses to ignore the report.  It would be instructive if the Deputy would read what is said about this measure in that report.  That is, broadly speaking, why I am proposing this measure now.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy also spoke about how long people had to wait for refunds. We all know there are problems in this area and the Revenue Commissioners deal with them every day.  They are due partly to the fact that we have a fairly complicated tax system with a large number of various kinds of reliefs brought in at different times for different purposes. That complicates the operation of the system and inevitably means that it takes longer and costs more to establish what an individual's entitlement is if a number of different heads of entitlement have to be examined.  I am not so sure that Deputy O'Kennedy really applied a huge amount of energy to the improvement of the system of collection in the Revenue Commissioners.  He has seen evidence in recent weeks that we are moving on improving the overall efficiency operation and making available to the Revenue Commissioners the sources needed to carry out their job more effectively.  Since the Deputy has expressed concern on this aspect, I will hold him to that concern and if and when any aspect of that comes into this House I will expect his full support for measures to improve the efficiency of the system so that we can avoid the problem he mentioned, which however is totally irrelevant as far as the provisions of this section are concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Improving the efficiency of the revenue works two ways, first, in collecting and, secondly, in repaying. I was dealing with the second one here because it is relevant.  I am glad the Minister has acknowledged that, because it is a fact that there are considerable sums due to people who are applying for tax rebates.  The Minister knows that and he should direct very serious attention to it.  I accept that the system is complex.  I am simply suggesting that this provision is going to make it more complex and for <Col N="2153" /> that reason the likelihood is that people will wait longer for less.  If the Minister can do anything to correct that, he will have our full support.</P>
      <P>The Minister quoted from the Report of the Commission on Taxation in support of what he is doing here.  He must not have read the introductory chapters because the Commission on Taxation make it very clear that the one thing they do not want to see argued, much less adopted, is individual items being extracted by the Minister and used as if that is implementing the whole report. The very next section runs completely contrary to what the Commission on Taxation suggest, so it is a little false on the Minister's part to use the commission in support of what he is doing here.  The next section in relation to the reduction of tax credits for investors is quite the opposite of what the commission recommend. I am sure the Minister's advisers will recognise that fact.  To say the least of it, the Commission on Income Taxation do not support the Minister's general position.  If he wants to use them, he should not use them so selectively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Approximately £6 million. I am of the opinion that revenue <Col N="2159" /> from VAT and PAYE at the end of the year will be greater than forecast in the budget.  Therefore, there is room to manoeuvre on this issue.  If the Minister cannot see his way to considering this now perhaps he would do so before Report Stage.  Many of the young couples with whom I spoke were quite perturbed about this.</P>
      <P>In regard to the fraction, we are getting into a lot of bookwork on this.  I am open to correction but, as far as I know, refunds of PAYE in some cases can take up to three months.  Judging from my correspondence with the Revenue people refunds, on average, take three months. We are here dealing in fractions.  As the Minister pointed out, the Income Tax Acts are sufficiently complex without getting into this complicated arena.  With all due respect I call it a mean provision, we are stooping very low on this issue.  I am very much in favour of giving newly-weds a chance for the first year at least.  In many cases the amount may not be that high.  I know the Minister will say £6 million is involved.  But I am allowing for buoyancy over and above the amounts projected in the budget with regard to both PAYE and VAT returns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the contributions so far on this issue, the difficulty people on this side of the House are in is that the only amendments which are acceptable and are in order are amendments which seek to reduce revenue.  We are precluded from putting down amendments to collect additional revenue.  For that reason the Minister of State's point in regard to people being irresponsible in promoting amendments which seek to reimburse money to people or whatever does not hold.  Particularly in relation to The Workers' Party the Minister for Finance is aware that we had a comprehensive submission made to him in relation to the taxation system covering the areas of indirect taxation, capital taxation, corporation tax, taxation of the self-employed, farmers, personal income tax, administration.  PRSI and so on. Therefore the Minister of State's argument certainly in relation to The <Col N="2160" /> Workers' Party does not hold.  Fianna Fáil can fight their own corner in relation to that matter.</P>
      <P>The provisions of this section constitute another belt at the PAYE sector, people who, perhaps after years of trying to gather together some money to get married, are now confronted with the withdrawal of the facility they had hoped to have at the end of the tax year.  As other Deputies have said, it is a mean way of trying to balance the books.  There are many other areas in which this money could be collected and with which we shall be dealing as we progress through the Bill.  For instance, last year a section was deleted entirely from the Finance Bill with the support of the three main parties, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour.  That was in regard to the resource tax which would have yielded practically the same amount of money as it is proposed to take from young married couples under the provisions of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my words to those already expressed appealing to the Minister to have second thoughts about this.  As I see it, we accept in this country, the Constitution accepts, the desirability of people getting married; normally it is younger rather than older people who get married.  This Government came into power promising a particular interest in young people.  We are in the midst of a depression and whereas formerly the two people getting married would both be working now one only is working.  Therefore the relief is all the more important now.  Traditionally there has been recognition of the fact that, when two people are getting married, not on love alone will they live and that the State should, in respect of this allowance, recognise that what they are doing is desirable.  The Government should recognise that in regard to their undertaking they will be incurring increased expenditure.  I might ask the Minister if, in his calculation of the figure of £6 million, he has made provision for the fact that all newly married couples purchase a certain amount out of which he gets a return.  That is the essence of my point. <Col N="2161" /> This seems to me to be a reversionary move from the State's recognition of the fact that it is desirable that young people get married, of the fact that the State should be conscious that, in their first year of marriage, they have commitments and expenditure from which they might be relieved to some extent.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister will contend that it is being done in part.  Here I agree entirely with our spokesman who would contend that the additional burden in calculating that percentage might further reduce the figure of £6 million.  I put that argument to the Minister.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach may talk about responsibility and irresponsibility.  I might say in passing, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that I had the privilege of being in your position when the boot was on the other foot last year. I would not want to embarrass either the Minister of State or indeed the Minister who seemed to think it was possible to get money other than that which was provided.  The Minister need not look aghast at me.  I can remember him saying, on some other matter, something like, &ldquo;To Jericho with the Revenue Commissioners, they do not run the country.  We run it and if we say the money is to be there it must be there.&rdquo;  That is by the way only.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister tell us if the £6 million is estimated to be the gross amount yielded?  For example, has he taken into account the VAT that would accrue if there was not a change in this section?  As I think most people are aware, most of the money refunded under the provisions of this section will be spent on furniture, electrical and general household goods.  If young married couples are not given this refund many of them will be placed in difficulty.  Again, it is mainly the less well off members of the community who will be hit by this provision.  Indeed the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach hit the nail on the head when he said that if they did not do this they would not balance the books.  That is what the people opposite are doing, balancing the books and forgetting about the people.</P>

      <P>I might point out to Deputy M. Ahern that he is now following a line that has recently become unfashionable in his party.  I remember the days when the Fianna Fáil Party seemed to have a kind of antipathy to anything like balancing the books.  I might remind Deputy Ahern that they missed the boat last October.  At that stage his party found a new enthusiasm, after their Pauline conversion in the late summer of last year, when not only were they diligently promoting the balancing of books but I might remind him also that his party were going <Col N="2163" /> to balance them in a rather more severe way this year than we intend doing now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the Chair has a difficult job and I can fairly claim to have taken up less time in this debate than others and to have been more orderly.  Deputies opposite have suddenly found out the difference between gross and net.  Deputy Tunney referred to the gross cost of this measure and Deputy O'Kennedy said that Deputy Ahern mentioned it.  They are looking at only one side of the equation.  It is perfectly true that if the State did not take £6 million of revenue from various people, they would then spend the money on other activities which would produce other revenue for the State.  On the other hand, were the State not to make this saving of £6 million, it would have to raise another £6 million in taxation elsewhere or reduce expenditure by that amount.  The option of borrowing is not open to us.  The very effect of switching from this method of saving £6 million to another method of gaining £6 million or spending £6 million less would in itself have the opposite buoyancy factors.  It will take some time for the Opposition to learn that lesson because when they were in office buoyancy turned out to be a lead balloon.</P>

On the basis of my own personal experience, if no other, I am quite convinced that there are romantic reasons for people deciding not to wait until near the end of the tax year to get married.  I, for very romantic reasons, got married a couple of weeks after the beginning of the tax year and was therefore not one of the people who made a substantial gain.</P>

      <P>The contention on the other side that there is extra buoyancy in PAYE and VAT taken overall is one which comes up with monotonous regularity. As long as it keeps coming up, I do not think I am wasting my time in repeating what I said on several occasions yesterday and this morning &mdash; that the contention is based on a series of forecasts which in turn are based on assumptions different from those which I have used and which in my view are less representative of the situation than the assumptions on which I am working.  I would counsel the Opposition against using that basis for saying that we can relieve a number of measures in the Bill without worrying about the effect on the overall finances.  So long as the Opposition keep making that point I will feel obliged to reply because it is a snare and a delusion to think that on the basis of present trends there would be an extra £100 million in my pocket.  That is pure <Col N="2165" /> hogwash and I would hate to think that any party, even the Opposition party, would adopt an approach to this Bill on the basis of that kind of chimera.</P>

The benefit of this measure came about in our taxation system more by accident than design and this is a point which Deputies opposite, especially Deputy Tunney, might consider.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That point was made at the beginning of the debate.  In reply to each argument we put forward, the Minister makes the general point that he cannot do it, that the Opposition should be more responsible and not ask for this exemption or that.  He ignores the precise arguments on the precise sections.  I protest against that form of response.  On this basis we could let the whole Bill through because each amendment involves a fiscal adjustment and he is making the same old tired response. Apparently there is no problem if the Minister decides to make an adjustment, late conversion though it may be, knowing he has made an initial mistake.</P>

In reply to Deputy Ahern he referred to buoyancy in revenue last year.  I would remind the Minister and put on the record of the House that the anticipated tax revenue last year was the same as the figure given by the same Revenue Commissioners to the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Bruton.  That is the reality. It was not until some time in late July <Col N="2167" /> that it became obvious that there was to be some shortfall in the forecasts made by the Revenue Commissioners, not by either Deputy Bruton or myself.

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the pending general election in the United Kingdom and having consulted all his colleagues on the European Council the current President of the Council, the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, Mr. Helmut Khol, has now posponed the date of the Stuttgart Council until 17-19 June. I was consulted and indicated that I agreed to the postponement.</P>
      <P>Indeed, some days before the issue of postponement was raised with us by the German Presidency, I had already taken the step of indicating to the Chancellor my view that impending elections might pose some problems with regard to the meeting proposed for the 6 and 7 June and my confidence in his judgment as to whether the meeting should be posponed.</P>
      <P>In taking this initiative I was influenced by the consideration that a European Council held on the eve of a British election could in present circumstances have proved disadvantageous from the point of view of the Community as a whole.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware there is a general election scheduled for <Col N="2168" /> Italy on 26 June and will a similar arrangement to that made in the case of the United Kingdom be considered?

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a precedent for this in 1981 when a particular council was postponed.  I think it was the Italian election on that occasion.

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That may well be.  It has happened that this meeting has to concern itself with some very crucial issues, some of which concern the United Kingdom very specifically and, even if the meeting had been adequately prepared in respect of all of the agenda &mdash; and I do not think it had been &mdash; it seemed to me it would be better for all concerned if the meeting took place after rather than before the British general election.  Some of the preparations have not been as good or as adequate, perhaps, as one might have hoped and from that point of view the postponement is also welcome.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>

Would the Taoiseach not agree that if we pressed ahead and got agreement on the British budget rebate question we would have had earlier decisions on other matters affecting us rather than letting them drag on?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I have heard that reference on the news.  I take it that in the heat of the election campaign a verbal slip on her part confused &ldquo;defence&rdquo; and &ldquo;security&rdquo; as, of course, there have been no discussions of any kind on defence, as the Deputy will, I imagine, understand. With regard to reaffirming our position I really do not think that our position as a country outside of the alliance, any alliance, has to be constantly reaffirmed as if we ourselves had any doubt about it.  The very fact that the President has himself described us as one of the important neutral countries of Northern Europe in relation to this visit suggests that we could get along without these constant niggling doubts being cast on <Col N="2172" /> our own position by people in our own State.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach accept that it disturbs me considerably when he keeps talking of the visit of the American Vice-President in the context of the Alliance, meaning the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation Alliance. He has mentioned that several times.  Can I take it that the Vice-President is not coming here in any North Atlantic Treaty Organisation Alliance context but coming purely as American Vice-President to a friendly State?  Does he not think that it would be worthwhile, particularly in view of his own very hazy position in this matter, to reaffirm to the Vice-President our firm commitment to military neutrality?</P>

      <P>First of all, my position and that of my party and my Government is in no way hazy, as our policy statement at the time of the election indicated and as our record in the past has shown.  In fact, if we examine the record the Opposition party has been more forthcoming on a possible change on neutrality than our party has ever been or indeed the Labour Party.  With regard to reference to the alliance, any references I have made have been in two contexts.  The first is reading the press release distinguishing the visit or part of the visit to the important neutral countries of Northern Europe from the visit to the alliance countries, making that clear distinction which the Deputy must have heard.  Any other references I have made have been in reply to questions suggesting that we involve ourselves in the affairs of the Alliance by expressing views on nuclear strategy in relation to the Alliance and I feel that as a neutral country we could do better perhaps not to involve ourselves in that.  The attempt of the Deputy to suggest that in asserting our neutral position in that way I have in some way compromised our position in regard to the Alliance is a bit ludicrous, even for him.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept that there have been some fundamental changes in the use of medical cards since 1 January 1983 when the last guidelines were implemented?  There is the use of the medical card for eligibility for school transport and there has been a tremendous increase in the cost to patients in respect of the drugs refund scheme under which patients are obliged to pay almost 100 per cent more than last year, £23 per month.  This causes hardship for a number of people and therefore there is a legitimate reason why the guidelines should be looked at.

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he intends to change the present procedure whereby consultants use public hospital facilities for their private patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at present considering the question of the use by consultants of public hospital facilities in the treatment of their private patients and I propose shortly to make a statement about the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that any change in the present situation would be a major departure from established practice in the health services?  Has the Minister of State or the Minister had consultations with the health boards about any proposed changes, or have they had consultations with other interested bodies, such as consultants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Our problem has been that we have tended to live with established practice for too long.  If consultants <Col N="2181" /> are using public hospitals for private patients one has to examine if that is correct.  If it has gone on before that does not make it right but it is something which must be examined.  If public funds are used for private reasons, and people are in a position to pay, I would not consider this to be a bad thing.  The Minister said he is going to make a statement on it.  I have not had any consultations with the health boards but the Minister has been visiting the health board areas recently.  I am not in a position to say if he discussed this particular matter with them.  Knowing the Minister I have no doubt he will consult with all concerned before he makes a definitive statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to a similar question I asked last week, the Minister indicated that no record was kept by the health boards of the number of patients being treated privately in public hospitals.</P>

      <P>A question, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister approaching the health boards with a view to getting them to keep a record of the number of the patients being treated privately by consultants, the amount of equipment being tied up, the number of staff involved and the cost to the health boards of this practice?  Is he considering a revision of the common contract between the Department and the consultants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the Minister who made this statement and I know he is keen to have this examined.  Obviously the health boards will have to keep records if there is any change to be passed on to private patients or to consultants. That would be automatic.  With regard to the common contract, the Minister indicated that there would be discussions about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister of State accept that there is a need for consultation between all interested parties <Col N="2182" />&mdash; the health boards, the consultants, the trade unions and so on?  Would he convey to his Minister that because of a change brought about by the Social Welfare Bill people in the category between £11,000 and £13,000 will have to pay for these services, and many of them would not be in a position to do so?  This would be a very fundamental change in the administration of the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a great believer in consultation, which is much better than confrontation.  It would be unwise to make decisions without consulting all interested parties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously if this change takes place records will have to be kept.  It is not just a question of issuing directives.  No doubt the Minister will have consultations with the health boards and directives will issue to them on any changes to be made.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give the actual date but I can assure the Deputy the Minister considers this should be done quickly and I agree with him.  If there are charges against public moneys this should be examined thoroughly.  In view of scarce financial resources in the health area, if we can recoup resources to provide a better health service for <Col N="2183" /> those who cannot afford it, it is imperative that it be done quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not answer the second part of my question. What specific changes are being considered?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Where the consultants are using public hospitals for the benefit of their private parients, any service availed of in that public hospital &mdash; X-ray, blood tests and so on &mdash; would be charged to the private patient.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the number of persons being paid unemployment assistance at the rate of 99p per week or less; and the cost to his Department of making such payments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that some unemployed persons are required to call to unemployment exchanges to collect sums as small as 50p per week and they refuse to do so because it costs more in bus fare?  If he is so aware, would he take action to ensure that a minimum benefit is paid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>When unemployment benefit is means tested the figure can be low.  To ask somebody to call for 50p or 90p seems ludicrous.  I take the Deputy's point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>9.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughConaghan" hpid="Mr. Conaghan Mr. Conaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the basis on which the sum of £19.20 arrears was calculated in the case of an application for unemployment assistance for a person (details supplied) in County Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The sum of £19.20, to which the Deputy refers, is the amount of weekly means assessed against the person <Col N="2184" /> concerned in determining his entitlement to unemployment assistance.  These means were derived from the value of an educational grant.</P>
      <P>He appealed against the amount of the means assessed against him but an appeals officer upheld the assessment. The person concerned was accordingly paid unemployment assistance at the weekly rate of £6.25, being the maximum rate payable to him, £25.45 less means £19.20 during the period of his claim from 5 July 1982&mdash;7 September 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughConaghan" hpid="Mr. Conaghan Mr. Conaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that it is alleged recipients of unemployment assistance in similar circumstances, or even better financial circumstances, were awarded the full payment?  Is he also aware that the family circumstances in this instance are very poor &mdash; the father is on disability benefit and the mother has been confined to hospital for a considerable period?  Would the Minister have this case reviewed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, there are guidelines which have to be followed.  The value of the grant is considered to be £19.20 a week, almost £1,000 a year and that is taken as means. If the Deputy knows of other cases and brings them to my notice, I will have them examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughConaghan" hpid="Mr. Conaghan Mr. Conaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to have the social welfare officer establish if other recipients receive full unemployment assistance, even though they get the full education grant.  There must be equality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the reason his Department insist on sending cheques to a person (details supplied) in County Cork bearing the wrong surname but the right PRSI number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Owing to an error, the claim to disability benefit of the person <Col N="2185" /> concerned was opened and cheques were issued under an incorrect surname.</P>
      <P>The error has since been corrected and replacement cheques issued to the claimant. Payment of disability benefit and pay-related benefit was made to 5 March 1983.  She was certified by her own doctor as fit to resume work from 7 March 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the reason a person (details supplied) in County Laois is not being paid unemployment or home assistance as he has no work or any form of income and as he applied for unemployment assistance 16 weeks ago; and the action he now proposes to take to arrange for immediate payment in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned is not entitled to unemployment assistance as the means assessed against him, £38.00 weekly, exceed the maximum rate payable to him.  Means in his case are derived from his share in land which is let.</P>
      <P>He appealed against the assessment of means and his case was referred to an appeals officer for determination.  Before making his decision the appeals officer requested that further inquiries be made as to possible expenses in connection with the letting of the land and when the inquiries are completed his entitlement to unemployment assistance will be reviewed in the light of the appeals officer's decision.</P>
      <P>The person concerned would not be eligible for supplementary welfare allowance, which is now payable instead of home assistance, as the means applicable to his unemployment assistance claim would also affect his entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it is totally unacceptable that somebody who applied for unemployment assistance on 12 October 1982 has not had his claim processed to date?  If this were an isolated case one would accept it, but I am sure that it is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about land and land held in trust and there may be a problem connected with it.  I will have the matter looked into, but there should not be any undue delay.  However, there are problems because of the numbers on unemployment assistance and every one of these applications must be examined.  However, it should not take as long as in this case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the reason a person (details supplied) in County Cork lost an appeal in respect of her claim for unemployment benefit on the grounds that she was unavailable for work even though strong evidence was submitted on behalf of her application both by employers and by Deputy Bernard Allen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>To qualify for unemployment benefit a claimant must fulfil the statutory condition for entitlement of being available for work.  The claimant must be free to take up employment and must be making genuine efforts to obtain work.</P>
      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit from 24 September 1982 to 27 October 1982 and again from 19 November 1982.  In connection with her claim, she had stated &ldquo;none&rdquo; in reply to a question about the type of work she was seeking.  The claim was disallowed on the ground that the claimant was not genuinely seeking employment and was not accordingly available for work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2187" /> She appealed against the disallowance of her claim and the appeals officer held an oral hearing of the case at which the claimant attended and gave evidence on her own behalf.  The appeals officer had before him all the evidence furnished by the appellant, including the representations made by the Deputy, but he upheld the decision of the deciding officer and disallowed the claim.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the long delays being experienced by people, especially in the Cork region, in relation to appeals?  This is just one example of a litany of them. Does the Minister propose to do anything to improve the situation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>A claim for disability benefit was received from the person concerned on 18 February 1983 in respect of incapacity for work from 24 January 1983.  He was not qualified for payment at the commencement of his claim as according to the records of the Department he had less than the required minimum of 26 contributions paid or credited in 1981-82, the contribution year governing his claim?</P>
      <P>It has since been established that he was entitled to a total of 30 credited contributions in the 1981-82 contribution year and is therefore entitled to a reduced rate of disability benefit.</P>
      <P>A cheque for the amount of benefit payable to 14 February 1983, date of the latest medical certificate received, was issued to the claimant on 11 May 1983.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Dublin area, as the Deputy is aware, we have opened up a centre in Thomas Street which has helped the situation and signing is not done as regularly as it could be done. Given the numbers there are difficulties, but we are looking at the situation all the time and there are no great problems within the city.  There is, however, overcrowding and those suffering most are the staff within the exchanges, because of the volume of work there. At the moment all I can say is that the position seems to be reasonable, although it could be improved.  There have been problems elsewhere which may be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly accept that the staffs are suffering because their number has not been increased in proportion to the increase in the unemployment figures. Does the Minister consider that the time has come to have a new look at the whole method of signing on, particularly in the case of young people?  Is it appropriate to have numbers of young people attending exchanges to sign on and have them waiting for perhaps three or four months to have their claims processed? <Col N="2190" /> Is this desirable socially?  I should like the Minister to make a statement on any plan the Department have for changing the system.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the notional system of assessment was introduced in 1966 for those smallholders whose holdings were totally uneconomic?  Is he aware also that there <Col N="2191" /> are still many farmers on uneconomic holdings and can he tell us whether the Government have plans to ensure that some notional system of assessment will be introduced to replace the PLV system?</P>

      <P>Along the west coast farmers are living on smallholdings which consist mainly of bog and rock.  I expect that the Minister witnessed that kind of situation recently while in Donegal. Should such people not be given a supplementary income to ensure that they can remain on the land and rear their families without having to be subjected to a means test on a regular basis?</P>

Can the Minister give an assurance that any changes that would be made in this area will represent an incentive <Col N="2192" /> and not a disincentive to the smallholders?

      <P>The person concerned claimed occupational injury benefit on 3 November 1982, in respect of an incapacity resulting from an accident at work on 30 October 1982.</P>
      <P>Pending the completion of investigation of the accident, he was awarded disability benefit as an interim measure from 4 November 1982, the fourth day of incapacity. Pay-related benefit was also awarded from 15 November, the thirteenth day of incapacity.</P>
      <P>Following confirmation of the occupational accident, injury benefit was allowed from the date of the accident and an adjusting cheque was issued on 16 February 1983 for the additional benefit payable over and above the amounts already paid for the period from 30 October 1982 to 10 February 1983.</P>
      <P>In error the claim was then closed with effect from 11 February 1983.  Unfortunately, there was delay in re-opening the claim when further medical certification arrived.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment the Minister has put down represents dramatically and graphically the difference between this Government's approach to what the economy needs at this stage and the approach of this party.  At a time when it is clear that we need an incentive for investment, when it is quite obvious that the level of investment available is less than it might be, the Minister proceeds to penalise the income tax relief in respect of distributions and payments of interest on stocks and shares.</P>
      <P>To me and to this party this action is the best example of the difference in approach between the Government and the Opposition. It is quite clear that actions geared only to extract further amounts from whatever source, and with no regard to the impact they will have on the development needs of the economy, are not appropriate or suitable.  A 20 per cent income tax relief in respect of distributions and payments of interest on the holding of stocks, shares and securities in certain Irish companies should not be terminated unless it is replaced by at least an incentive to investors of equal value, or will the Minister tell me there is no need for an incentive for investment of this kind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even as it stands at the moment the <Col N="2238" /> income tax code could be said to discriminate against income earned through investment in productive assets.  Shareholders who receive income from business investments are penalised by the income tax code to an extent which varies between 1.75p and 23.1p, of additional taxation it has to be noted, per £1 of income received compared with taxation on income from any other source.</P>
    <P>The unfavourable climate for enterprise and the discrimination against the shareholder in income tax terms were major causes of the decline in industrial domestic investment in recent years.  The unfavourable treatment of dividends and other distributions from companies in the productive sectors in the economy means that prudent investors understandably tend to place their funds in relatively risk free and unproductive assets.  This does not provide increased employment.  The Minister's colleague, with whose view one tends to sympathise more and more as the lone voice from that side of the House &mdash; and I refer to Deputy Bruton &mdash; recognises that it is a nonsense to recognise the need for venture capital while, at the same time, penalising shareholders in business and industry.</P>
    <P>Some of the major companies in the United States, on whom we rely now for external investment, started with a very small amount of venture capital because of the favourable climate for such promotions in the United States at the time. This is a climate in which we now find ourselves, when the level of external investment in our economy is diminishing. Recently we heard from the Minister for Industry and Energy about the difficulties there are in attracting industry to Ireland.  Those difficulties are recognised objectively by many people.  If, in addition to that, the Minister by his actions is to discourage domestic investment in our own industrial activities he will ensure that, whatever the Minister for Industry and Energy might try to achieve, his task will be all the more difficult.  It is a nonsense to recognise the need for venture capital while at the same time penalising shareholders in business and industry.</P>
    <P>The development of indigenous Irish industry &mdash; and I said this in another <Col N="2239" /> debate on SFADCo &mdash; can take place only in an environment which recognises as this party do &mdash; and I want this to be clearly recorded as the difference between us at this time &mdash; the vital contribution of productive investment and the rewards to which investors are entitled accordingly, having regard to the risk they take by comparison with the safe, secure and in many cases better return they will get from investment in other non-productive activities.  That is the issue we are concerned with here.</P>
    <P>Income earned through investment in industry and productive assets generally is now taxed at a higher effective rate than income from any other source.  Disincentives to investment in Ireland have already had major economic consequences, even before the Minister came in with this short-sighted action.  With privately financed investment as a proportion of GNP falling by 50 per cent in less than three years &mdash; and we had a discussion in the House recently with regard to the ratio of investment and GNP &mdash; it is quite clear that, before the Minister's budget and before this Bill was introduced, it was a matter of concern that the level of investment had fallen to that extent.  As a consequence of what the Minister is now proposing in his budget, and of this action here, it will drop back to the unprecedentedly low level of investment we found in the midseventies, a period which most of us would like to forget about quickly and conveniently.  This year's budget will remove any remaining incentive to industrial investment.  It eliminates up to one-third of the yield to a shareholder of investments made in the past.</P>
    <P>This party are very clearly, strongly and openly in favour of private enterprise. We see it as being the only base for a recovery from the recession in which the world economy finds itself and, in particular, our economy as an open trading economy.  Investment by a shareholder in a business is governed by the expected rate of return he would hope to receive.  That is made up of the forecasted level of distributed profits less the burden of taxation at any given time.  For that <Col N="2240" /> reason income earned is subject to double taxation.  Therefore, we have the corporation tax on the profits, plus income tax on the dividends paid out of the profits &mdash; which incidentally have already been taxed.  It is the combined effect of the two tax rates, less the dividend credit given, that determines the total level of taxation that must be paid. Who is it who owns the company?  Basically it is the shareholders who own the company and it is a fiction to differentiate between the amount of tax paid by the company and that paid by the shareholders.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Taxation, to which the Minister made reference this morning commenting on my reliance on their report on Second Stage, claimed to be acting in accordance with what they proposed in relation to, I think, section 5.  The Commission on Taxation had something interesting to say on this.  They examined the different tax liabilities arising for a manager, for instance, receiving a salary compared with a shareholder receiving a dividend and they concluded that clearly it was inequitable and inefficient that different tax liabilities arise as a result of the method chosen to distribute profits.  Incidentally, they also demonstrated in their report that for any marginal income tax rate of a shareholder a higher effective rate of tax was paid on dividend income.  They called for what they classed as a full imputation system. That is a system where the tax credits and dividends are sufficient to ensure that the shareholders had to pay the appropriate marginal rate of income tax only.</P>
    <P>Tables have been drawn up by the Commission on Taxation and others which demonstrate that dividend income particularly is discriminated against in all cases, particularly with the extent of over-taxation varying from 1.75p to 23.1p extra for each pound of income.  The significant thing is that the highest level of over-taxation arises where the shareholders should incur no tax liability at all. This would arise in the case of an individual who had not exhausted personal tax allowances or tax exemptions, say, from a pension fund.  There is a person who, investing in the future of his country &mdash;<Col N="2241" /> by way of his small contribution &mdash; finds himself penalised to the maximum extent.  Ironically, despite the proposals of the Commission on Taxation changes in corporation tax since the publication of their report have rendered matters worse in regard to over-taxation.  If the Minister wants to quote the Commission on Taxation in ease of one proposal of his he might have regard to what they say in other directions as well and particularly to the fact that they do not want to see one aspect of their overall proposals being extracted as evidence, as did the Minister this morning, of their implementation.</P>
    <P>Obviously there are clear advantages of a low level of corporation tax applying to shareholders in indigenous industry. But those advantages are dubious because the total tax burden borne by indigenous shareholders on income earned on their investment exceeds the tax rate on any other form of income although, frankly, it has to be said that the position is better than it would be if there was a higher rate of corporation tax.  That is about the only aspect of it that diminishes the burden in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>I might reiterate that at a time when the climate in external investment here is obviously not good &mdash; and I call in evidence here the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Industry and Energy &mdash; is no time to penalise, through the tax code, income earned from investment in any business venture.  Even this very day during lunchtime I received a group of traders from my constituency who were wondering how they can in some way promote indigenous small industry, perhaps how they can get together and invest in development.  While we are endeavouring to launch that idea there is this disincentive introduced in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The notion of venture capital generally is related to investment in new ventures which, it is fair to say, carry a higher degree of risk than any other forms of business; of course they do.  Any new venture, particularly in this economic climate, inevitably has a higher degree of risk attached to it than investment in some other safe, secure area which would <Col N="2242" /> give a steady return, at a higher rate for that matter.  Because, by definition, it carries a greater risk on the other hand it must offer the potential of high growth and earnings, the satisfaction of employment generation and output.  But they are being penalised and set back in the Minister's proposal here.  Investors of that type would make such investment only if the expected rate of return, after all taxes are paid, are sufficiently attractive compared with other alternatives to compensate for the degree of risk involved.  Clearly, even under the present tax code, they are not sufficiently attractive. Certainly after this Bill is enacted they will become less attractive, in fact distinctly unattractive.</P>
    <P>The First Report of the Commission on Taxation, which is all we have had to date, dealt with general equity and efficiency. In that they pointed out the disincentive to investment arising out of the higher rate of tax on shareholders' income.  I wonder did the Minister read that portion of their report when he selectively drew on one small item this morning. Now that his proposal is to be adopted and ours refused it will not have anything like the same impact on the investment climate in our economy.  Did the Minister read that section of the commission's report?  Incidentally, they also pointed out that the effective inflation created by artificial book profits on which companies and hence shareholders must pay was a very serious disincentive to investment.</P>
    <P>We have an elaborate system of grants, incentives and allowances available for different purposes but the intention of any incentive is to attract additional investment.  This can work only if the benefit of the incentive can somehow be passed to the investor; otherwise it is meaningless.  Firstly, much of the depreciation in stock allowances is merely to offset the effects of inflation in generating artificial profits.  Capital allowances against tax also provide an important incentive to investment.  But the effect of allowances eliminating taxable profits by providing a tax credit on dividends allowed companies carrying out major capital investment is to provide a reduction <Col N="2243" /> in the tax rating on their shareholders. This, then, was a real and meaningful incentive.  Shareholders were encouraged to make funds available or re-invest profits in major investment projects because, quite frankly, they were subjected to a reduced tax liability in return.</P>
    <P>At least one can say this much about the Minister: he is being consistent.  In his budget speech &mdash; and this was a significant pointer to all of us and an indication of which road he was going to travel &mdash; he indicated that the availability of a reduced tax liability in return for investment is, to quote himself, a defect in corporation tax.  He indicated then that the introduction of advance corporation tax &mdash; about which he has had some change of heart since he introduced it originally &mdash; would ensure that that could no longer arise.  Consistent with that philosophy the only other incentive to manufacturing industry &mdash; the 20 per cent income tax relief on dividends to shareholders in certain publicly quoted companies, which was introduced in 1932 to promote the development of indigenous industry &mdash; is also being abolished.  I mention 1932 because we are going through various stages of our economic development. It was quite clear then that with a view to developing indigenous industry, we had to have not only protection but also encouragement or inducement, as is evident from that provision for investment in aid of industry.  That was the climate at that time, a climate in which there was a considerable response from native entrepreneurs who might not have had much capital but who had a degree of commitment and, could one be pardoned for saying, a degree of patriotism. We went through the bad period of the forties and fifties.  Then we entered the second cycle, in which we attracted foreign capital, foreign expertise, a degree of technological development we did not have here before.  We attracted all of these with one purpose in mind: with a view to generating capital at home, to generating know-how and expertise, in the hope that some of what came in would rub off on the indigenous sector, as indeed it did.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2244" /> That was the story of the second stage. Now we are at the third stage where it has been recognised by all that the international climate is such that the possibility of maintaining the level of external investment is poor, to say the least.  Just when we are at the beginning of that third stage when we need to encourage investment at home we have this short-sighted measure.  I forgot to ask the Minister the amount he will save by this.  If investment in industry is penalised by higher effective tax rates it may sometimes be offset by the effect of grant payments which raise the level of profitability. It can be seen, however, that the costs of production are now so high that rates of return on investment are completely inadequate before and after tax.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister have shares in any Irish companies?  If he has, what return is he getting?  I have some shares in small indigenous industry in my home place and for the past few years they have not paid any dividend.  The question is not whether shareholders like me get dividends but rather whether there is an incentive to invest.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not rely on me for evidence of the climate in which we find ourselves.  It has been pointed out by a number of objective observers.  Professor Neary and Dr. Ruane have clearly shown that the rate of return on investment on the Dublin Stock Exchange in 1980 before and after tax was well exceeded by investment in a selection of relatively risk-free and non-productive assets.  If the Minister is in contact in any way with the Dublin Stock Exchange he must know that it is a fairly heavy pitch.  The play on that pitch is very sticky.  If we are to get out of it and not only survive but succeed efforts such as the Minister is now penalising must be rewarded instead.  Could the Minister tell us in response to our case how much he expects to save the Exchequer in this proposal, which I believe will take a lot from the development potential of this country over the next few years?</P>

      <P>Having listened to Deputy O'Kennedy I would remark in response <Col N="2245" /> to his final question that if the situation were as dramatic as he says, one would expect the saving or extra revenue that would arise from this measure to be a very substantial figure, and if it were not a substantial figure one could conclude that the situation was not anything like as dramatic as the Deputy has painted it.  It is expected that the additional revenue to the State from this measure this year will be virtually nil and will be about £0.5 million next year.</P>

The general thrust of economic policy now is such as to raise the level of confidence of foreign investors and lenders in our economy.  If we do not have that to begin, there is no point whatsoever in having a panoply of measures inside our economy to help venture capital because they would produce very little result.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be led by you.  Deputy O'Kennedy was making a point in relation to the overall investment climate and the provisions of the section.  I am entitled in my reply to refer to the overall investment climate and the place of this measure therein.  That is exactly what I am doing, talking about the overall investment climate on the one hand and the scope of the measure on the other, to draw the conclusion that it is not going to have significant effects.  That is the point. Though Deputies on the opposite benches may not like it, the conclusion is inescapable.  As Deputy O'Kennedy pointed out, this dates back to 1932 and its history is very interesting.  Deputy O'Kennedy this morning accused me of being like the devil who cites scripture for his own purpose and he said the Commission on Taxation would not support what I am doing here.  I would like to remind him that in paragraph 11.44 of the First Report, which refers to relief to individual shareholders in certain Irish companies, the commission states:</P>
      <P>This relief has served the purposes for which it was introduced and is now unnecessary. Today, the demand for investment opportunities in publiclyquoted Irish companies exceeds the market supplies.  We recommend that the relief be abolished.  This would improve both the equity and simplicity of the tax system. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2248" /> That is singularly germane to this discussion.</P>
    <P>The relief was instituted in 1932 and the conditions were fairly restricted.  It applied to dividends and interest paid on stocks, shares and securities issued for public subscription in respect of which the certificate of the Minister for Finance provided that these moneys must be devoted to the establishment or extension of Irish industry and no part to be used to acquire an existing business or company for an existing debt and the relief applied only to individuals resident in the State.  There was an amendment to that in 1935 imposing additional conditions concerning the nationality of shareholders and the nationality of those holding voting rights.  In 1956 a further amendment was made.  There was a further amendment in 1957 which changed the conditions again.  There was a still further amendment in 1960 and the last amendment was in 1976.  That shows the provision was modified over the years to fit in with the current climate of the day. During that period from 1932 until today, a period of 51 years, we have seen a very considerable development and expansion in the range of measures applied in order to encourage investment in one way or another.  We have had a very substantial change in direct incentives and direct assistance for industrial development and very substantial changes by way of tax relief, accumulated capital allowances and all the other measures that are part of our system.  It has now got to the point, as the figures I gave at the beginning illustrate, when all of these things have a far greater effect than the measure we are talking about now.  I find it very difficult to improve on what the commission said about this measure.  It is one which has served its purpose, outlived its usefulness and, in the context of the total picture surrounding investment, it is one we do not particularly need at this stage. It is for that reason I propose its repeal.</P>
    <P>A number of the other points made by Deputy O'Kennedy gave me to wonder whether or not they were really relevant on this section.  He made some points about differences in philosophy between his party and mine.  I shall be guided by <Col N="2249" /> the Chair as to whether such differences are relevant on this section.  Experience over the last few years where investors are concerned has not been particularly happy.  I do not rejoice in that.  Perhaps we have a different idea from Deputy O'Kennedy as to what industrial development and promotion mean.  I know he will object to this but the policy of his party has landed us in the situation in which we have to increase the burden of taxation.</P>

      <P>I am replying to the point made by Deputy O'Kennedy in what he regards as the different philosophies. Perhaps they are not relevant but, since Deputy O'Kennedy was allowed to make them, I infer that I will be allowed the same latitude.  Deputy O'Kennedy talked about disincentives.  That party has used phrases like doom and gloom.  In this debate we can have this kind of confrontation point of view but Deputy O'Kennedy is really exaggerating the effect of this measure and the more he talks about alleged disincentives to investment the more he runs the risk of people acutally believing there are disincentives which do not in fact exist. People have particular cases to make and they make them very sincerely and with a great deal of energy.  I think they feel that if they do not go for overkill the problem will never be dealt with.  I believe Deputy O'Kennedy had his tongue in his cheek in this discussion.  As I said at the beginning this is limited in scope and, as the commission has said, it has outlived its usefulness and its abolition in the context of this Bill will give rise to none of the problems the Deputy claims it will.</P>

That is very little indeed.  Foreign companies here with foreign finance &mdash; and they are very welcome &mdash; escape all this.  It does not apply to them.  I am convinced now that the Finance Bill should not have been tampered with in any way.  The Commission on Taxation was set up to recommend but it was never intended that they should fill the role of legislators. That is our job.  I resent their trying to legislate for us or anyone else trying to do it.  There is an attitude on the part of people outside this House, I am not saying you, Sir, but commentators of all descriptions are trying to teach us and lecture us.  I resent that.  In view of the Minister's reply he should decide before the Report Stage to drop this provision.</P>

      <P>This measure, while it was in existence, provided additional relief for Irish shareholders.  It was an addition to the other tax reliefs that now exist on distributions which are dealt with in section 26 of the Bill.  The withdrawal of this relief from those shareholders is a small measure and one which will have no great <Col N="2251" /> effect.  It does not affect one way or the other foreign shareholders or foreign companies because they never had the benefit of this relief in the first place.  It is not something that can have any scare effect in relation to foreign investment nor, given the size of what is involved, is it something that can have a scare effect in relation to domestic investment.</P>

      <P>The Minister has made the best possible case for not having this section in the Bill.  He speaks in what appears to be an offhand manner about total assets in 82 companies of the order of £115 million, when companies in this country are falling like nine pins at the moment.  It involves 10,000 shareholders who have the confidence to invest in these companies.  This is another example of this philosophy of countering the incentive motive within our company structure. The Minister speaks in terms of &ldquo;only&rdquo; half a million pounds being involved.  In fact, I think these figures are pulled out of the air and cannot be substantiated.</P>

      <P>I would very much appreciate if the Minister would seriously listen to what I am saying.  It is important and it is something we cannot just treat in an offhand manner.  At the moment private initiative is under siege.  The Minister should understand that.  He seems to be living in a cocoon of bureaucracy without any understanding of what the real life out there is like, with companies struggling.  Workers within these companies may have invested in the companies to give them confidence during the economic blitz we are experiencing at present.  The Minister should show some positive concern for private investment. All the measures in this Finance Bill are spearheaded against private investment.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister has a very difficult task.  I know that as a nation we have been living beyond our means and our borrowings <i>et cetera</i> have left us in a very difficult situation.  That is just one side of the coin but on the other side we have to recharge our economy at every possible opportunity and in this Finance Bill the Minister has a duty to give private investment some ray of hope.  No initiative and no incentive is being given in these sections as they tumble through.  Here the Minister speaks of &ldquo;only&rdquo; half a million pounds.  This is a small part of the fiscal budget.  Why not make that gesture now? Why not agree that the 20 per cent should not be rubbed away?  Why not do that now as a gesture to give us some hope for the future?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first Finance Bill to which I have had the doubtful privilege of contributing and the more the debate goes on the more confused I become.  I thought I might learn something about how to participate and how to table amendments that would be accepted, but as it goes on it becomes more difficult.  The Minister, presumably, has been preparing the Bill since the budget four months ago but he is introducing amendments every couple of hours.  That makes it very difficult to deal with the Bill in a logical way.  Surely he could have completed his business by now.  I do not know if Deputy Haughey's intervention earlier meant that he is <Col N="2253" /> reconsidering the agreement between the Whips in regard to time.  Certainly if the introduction of amendments by the Minister continues, that agreement should be reconsidered.</P>
      <P>This section represents a parting of the ways between The Workers' Party and Fianna Fáil.  Though not agreeing with some of the amendments Fianna Fáil tabled, because we could not get our amendments accepted we supported the Fianna Fáil proposals as the best of a bad lot.  At least they were endeavouring to do something for the PAYE workers which we have been trying to do for some months.</P>
      <P>If you are endeavouring to ease the PAYE burden you must be prepared to put the burden somewhere else.  Now we have an indication that Fianna Fáil, though talking about easing the burden on PAYE workers, do not want any tax whatever put on the owners of wealth or property.  I do not think they can sustain that position because if they want to ease the burden on one sector they must put in on somewhere else.</P>
      <P>At the beginning, this section was very confusing to me because of the reference to some companies.  It seemed to me that some small area was being eliminated, and that still appears to be the case.  It amazes me that Fianna Fáil put up such a long and bitter fight on this section which apparently covers 82 companies, the names of which we still have not got. I suggest that the Minister tell us the names of those companies.  There are only 10,000 shareholders involved and the provision would bring in only £500,000 in a full year.  It would seem there is some anomaly, that those companies had some special privilege in regard to this 20 per cent relief which other companies did not have.  Only these 10,000 shareholders had this.  This section is eliminating that and putting them on a par with every other company and shareholder. In other words it is not putting any new taxes on shareholders.  It is not doing anything drastic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no question of there being any difference between the philosophies of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael in this area. <Col N="2254" /> After listening for one-and-a-half hours, that seems to me to be the position, that there is some anomaly being removed but the section is not imposing any new taxes.  If this is to be a move to eliminate relief and to put new taxes on businesses or shareholders or later on property, and if that is to be opposed, how is the burden on the PAYE workers to be eased?  It is up to Deputy O'Kennedy to explain that. How does he propose to do that?  Yesterday Fianna Fáil supported the proposed change in the tax bands and holding on to the £312 rather than reducing it to £286.  That would have helped the PAYE worker.  The Minister pointed out that the change in bands would cost the Exchequer £87 million.</P>
    <P>That accounts for my opening remarks, but I am still confused as to why some amendments have been thrown out because they would cost the Exchequer money, while others that will cost the Exchequer money, like this one which will cost £500,000 in a full year, are allowed.  I will be raising that issue again when some of our amendments come up. I should like to get an explanation as to why some amendments have been thrown out and others have been accepted.  Nobody I have spoken to understands this.  I want to make it quite clear that I will be opposing the amendment and supporting the section, but I hope the Minister will explain who these companies are and why they have this privilege over all other companies.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla expressed the feeling that a number of special companies were picked out, as well as a number of shareholders.  That is not the case.  This provision was introduced in 1932.

      <P>I should like to explain for Deputy Mac Giolla why we are opposing the section so strongly, and I will illustrate the town from which we both come.  There is one such company which was launched by shareholders around the town of Nenagh which is now giving employment to 200 people.  It has been doing that for about 50 years.  Many of those involved are very small shareholders who get little or no dividend. Simply because they are publicly quoted on the Stock Exchange they have the benefit, if one could call it that, of this provision.</P>
      <P>As I have said, this represents no benefit at all.  Those shareholders are penalised by anything from 1.7p to 3.1p on their dividends.  Deputy Mac Giolla can be assured that at present they will not make any killing in any circumstances. They would be much better off investing, as some of them will probably be tempted to do, in non-productive assets.  It is a commitment to their own trades, to employment, that encourage them to do this.  There are 82 companies involved with capital of approximately £115 million. We are not talking about just those that are there now.  A bigger issue arises of the disincentive to invest from now on. They would be better putting their money into the Post Office or anywhere else.  As the Minister properly said, this does not apply to named companies but to companies that comply with the provisions of that Act.</P>

      <P>I realise Deputy Mac Giolla is very concerned about employment and we are all concerned that there is a risk of this acting as a disincentive to employment. The Minister mentioned 82 companies. With an average employment of 50, and probably over 100 in most cases, we are talking of roughly 8,000 jobs.  We have to be very careful before we put at risk that number of jobs in our present economic climate.  The risk is there and the Minister has suggested &mdash; I use my words carefully &mdash; that I am raising scares that are unwarranted, that I have dreamed up myself and that can do damage.  If the Minister has been listening to the views I expressed today and the views Irish industrialists have been expressing for some time, he will have found they are not the views of foreign bankers, such as those he was consulting at lunch time who were telling him about the climate for domestic investment in Ireland.  If one were interested in getting a view on the climate for domestic investment in Ireland, the last people one would go to would be foreign bankers.  The people whose views I listened to are Irish industrialists and shareholders.  I am surprised if these people have not already conveyed those views to the Minister because it would be very unusual for them to convey them only to the Opposition spokesman on Finance.  I presume the Minister has heard from them.</P>

      <P>I am concentrating on this issue.  We are all concerned about the level of taxation.  That has been the central theme of this debate.  The deletion of this section would have no impact on increasing the burden on the PAYE sector. The Minister said that this year there will be virtually no cost involved and over any future year the figure involved would be approximately £500,000.  If more companies are put at risk, fewer people will be at work and those at work will have to pay more.  That is the issue.  The Minister tells us what he is doing will have no significant effect on revenue.  If so, I cannot understand why he is doing this.  I can understand his concern to collect extra taxation but to do it this way is another matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This has great relevance for shareholders and the 8,000 employees involved.  It is important that we encourage investment in Irish industry, which we have been doing since 1932, a landmark in terms of self-reliance.  Now we are turning <Col N="2258" /> the other way.  Instead of having lunchtime discussions with foreign bankers the Minister should be discussing the situation with our own industrialists.</P>
    <P>If the Minister cannot accept my views I suggest we put it to the vote.</P>

      <P>This relief is commonly known as the Part XX relief.  What the Minister says is true.  This relief has probably outlived its usefulness because it has been superseded by other reliefs down the years, such as export sales relief and so on.  I do not consider that the removal of this relief will have a very damaging effect on investors.  There is a very small number of companies involved.  The Minister said there would be no revenue implications this year.  Am I correct in saying the relief will no longer apply to dividends paid after 9 February 1983?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 12, before section 8, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>8.&mdash;Section 344 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, is hereby amended, as respects the year 1983-84 and subsequent years of assessment&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2261" /> (a)  by the substitution in subsection (1) (inserted by the Finance Act, 1980) of `£100' for `£70' in each place where it occurs, and</P>
    <P>(b)  by the substitution in subsection (2) (inserted by the Finance Act, 1980) of `£100' for `£70'. </P>
    <P>This is the section which deals with the reduction in the allowances for bank interest, proposing to reduce the figure from £70 to £50.  At this time it is our opinion that the Minister should be moving in the opposite direction.  We say this because of the need to encourage saving and investment in all of our financial institutions.  The arguments against what the Minister is proposing are so well known that it is hardly necessary for me to elaborate on them here.  The Minister must have received numerous letters from small investors regarding this proposal. It is not my intention to become involved in any lengthy discussion by way of attempting to persuade him to change his mind.  He knows all the arguments already.  The present level of the allowance is an encouragement to people to save, but the Minister's proposal can only be damaging in the area either of saving or of investment and, taken in conjunction with all the other proposals that we will be discussing later in respect of our financial institutions, the Minister is not helping in this regard.  For that reason we are asking him to reconsider the proposal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>This section proposes to reduce the tax free amount of interest on deposits from £150 to £120 in the case of the Trustee Savings Banks and the Post Office and from £70 to £50 in the case of the commercial banks.  The interest rate <Col N="2262" /> paid on deposits of less than £5,000 has not increased beyond 11½ per cent in recent years.  The present rate is 9 per cent but I understand that it is to be reduced shortly.  During the same period inflation has been running at the rate of more than 20 per cent, the present level being between 11 and 12 per cent.  At all times in recent years there has been a loss on savings for the small saver.  The after-tax real loss suffered by savers with deposits of up to £5,000, be they small savers, redundant workers or retired people who have invested lump sums, has been severe.  Indeed, this is a national scandal.</P>
      <P>During this time people who have invested large sums of money have been earning substantial returns by way of various legal, semi-legal or illegal devices. For example, capital tax free gains of up to 40 per cent have been earned on Government stocks in the past year.  The dividend stripping on Government stocks is a common practice in the interest of avoiding income tax.  The provisions of section 23 of the 1981 Finance Act, whereby rental income up to the capital cost of a flat is free from tax, has been availed of widely by wealthy people.  Unit funds operated by insurance companies have produced tax free rates of returns which are consistently far in excess of the rates of interest payable on small bank deposits.  The capital gains legislation whereby the value of an investment is maintained at a rate in line with inflation after which there is a tax free capital gain of £2,000, or of £4,000 in the case of a married couple, highlights the position of people with relatively small savings and who under this section are taxed on income which does not even maintain the value of their savings.</P>
      <P>The revenue that will accrue to the State if this measure is passed will be minimal. I appeal to the Minister to consider leaving the rates at their present level so as to encourage small savers to save.  In addition, this could go some way towards redressing the tax position of the small saver <i>vis-à-vis</i> the small investor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief on this section.  The proposal if accepted will <Col N="2263" /> have a severe effect on those with small savings in financial institutions.  If we take the area that I come from, the Midlands, this change will have an effect on workers in the ESB, Bord na Móna, CIE and other companies who provide pensions and lump sums.  In the case, for instance, of a man retiring at 65, the State pension for himself and his wife would be about £74 per week and in the case of a person retiring from a State body, such as Bord na Móna, a pension of £100 per month. Such people are brought into this tax bracket.  The savings will be at the expense of people who have given a lifetime of service to the State.  They are now at the end of their day and from now on will be taxed in this manner.  When Fianna Fáil were in Government I strongly advocated raising this amount, but the Ministers did not see their way to acceding to my request.  The people I refer to like to keep a certain amount by for funeral arrangements and so on.  I am not speaking in favour of the banks and financial institutions; I am speaking on behalf of small depositors who make up the vast sums of money in the financial institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A person building a new house must get a bridging loan from his bank and the banks get the money from the depositors to pay out for productive purposes.  Many people have asked me what this is all about.  Some people are not aware that money deposited in a bank is subject to tax if it goes over a certain amount.  They only find this out when an assessment comes in the post.  I do not understand why this provision has been brought in. The Minister in his budget speech said that there was a spread of deposits.  In the present financial climate I do not see how anyone could spread money around. I am not aware of a spread of deposits in order to avoid having to pay interest. Small depositors generally bank in their own area where they can get money on demand.  Even allowing for a spread of deposits, this money was being made available to borrowers especially in the housing construction industry.  The bank deposit ratio and the lending ratio must go hand in hand.  If the banks do not have <Col N="2264" /> the money from depositors they cannot lend money.  This provision will affect the level of savings and I have been led to believe that there has been some withdrawal of money from the banks.  That is a worry.  The Minister might say that there is a tax exemption of £4,800 but even so the people I refer to will be caught here.  The law as it stood was a little help but the lowering of the amount will have a detrimental effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum in relation to section 8 says:</P>
      <P>Section 8 amends, with effect for 1983-84 and subsequent years, section 344 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, so as to reduce the amount of interest on deposits with certain financial institutions which is exempt from tax in the hands of individuals.  The amount of interest on deposits with the Trustee Savings Banks and the Post Office Savings Bank which is exempted is being reduced from £150 to £120. </P>
      <P>This is a retrograde step for several reasons.  People involved with the Post Office Savings Bank are mostly rural families who would have put their money there before the bank's campaign in recent years to attract more and more ordinary people.  The number of rural families who have had this kind of relationship with the old Post Office savings system is amazing, and also the number of workers on small incomes who have their own modest investments in the Post Office Savings Bank.  The workers have already paid tax on the money they put into the Post Office Savings Bank.  It was a retrograde step to reduce the amount of interest which could be of benefit to them from £150 to £120.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose that the Minister should make the interest from all savings in the Post Office Savings Bank completely tax free.  Ultimately this would be of tremendous advantage to the State.  Quite apart from the injustice which I contend is being done to savers in the Post Office, it would have merits on another scale.  It would have the effect of attracting wholesale investment.  Perhaps it would attract <Col N="2265" /> moneys invested at present in the commercial banks sector.  That would be a tremendous boost to the State.</P>
    <P>It would provide far more money for social use, especially since the Post Office will be going into the semi-State sphere. It is hoped that the savings bank activities of the Post Office will be brought up to an efficient and viable commercial level. I understand that at the moment&mdash;and I have this from a bank official&mdash;the banks are very concerned at the outflow of very significant amounts of money&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to places such as the Isle of Man.  I do not know whether investors are doing this on the advice of the banks.  The Minister should look at that aspect very closely and take whatever steps may be necessary to stop the outflow and keep that money in our own economy.  I do not know what arrangements the commercial banks here have with their foreign outlets in Britain and in other places for an accommodation of that kind.  I am not making any allegations. I am merely asking the question: are they facilitating their customers to the determent of our economy and our balance of payments?  The Minister should look at this very closely.</P>
      <P>The Lord have mercy on the late and great Seán Casey who was a member of my own party and Lord Mayor of Cork in the sixties.  I understand that on one occasion in the early sixties the Cork Savings Bank made an offer of £1 million to Cork Corporation at a nominal interest rate of 2 per cent to build houses for newly weds.  This was killed at source by commercial banks who moved in to stop it.  I have given the source of that information. He is dead now.  It may or may not be true, but it was told to me in good faith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commercial banks are not fulfilling a wide social role.  I suppose in fairness to them they never professed to be obliged to do so.  In the present climate we should do everything in our power to attract public money into the State sector, notably through the Post Office Savings Bank, so that it can be used for wider <Col N="2266" /> social purposes.  I ask the Minister to look very seriously at that whole concept. Unquestionably the country as a whole would benefit from that approach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very mean and negative measure in the Finance Bill.  I ask the Minister to reconsider it.  I thought the Minister, as a bright young man coming into the Department of Finance with a very distinguished career behind him, might show some imagination in this area.  This measure has remained unchanged since 1967.  It is about time somebody improved the position. In his budget statement the Minister said:</P>
      <P>While our own ability to borrow is, so far, unimpaired, the international climate of uncertainty underlines the need to reduce our dependence on foreign funds.</P>
      <P>We must, therefore, rely increasingly on our own resources.  Saving is an aspect of that self-reliance and it is a habit which must be encouraged. </P>
      <P>It is not particularly encouraging to savers to reduce the amount of interest which can be earned from £70 to £50.  At today's interest rate, £50 can be earned on a capital sum of £600 which, as Deputy Connolly said, is hardly enough for the funeral expenses of an old age pensioner. It is going a bit too far to penalise these people further.  In the vast majority of cases they have paid more than their fair share of tax on their incomes.  To hound them further by going after them into the financial institutions is particularly mean.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer the Minister to the first report of the Commission on Taxation of July 1982 at page 159.  It states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We consider that the overall balance of the income tax system in Ireland is heavily weighted towards borrowing and against saving.  This arises because, in determining income for income tax purposes, little or no account is taken of the effect of inflation on the underlying asset... or liability... .  We recommend that this be rectified.  This would <Col N="2267" /> reduce the discrimination against saving in the income tax code. </P>
    <P>In the same report the point was made that, since the rate of inflation is higher than the rate of interest, the taxpayer has received a negative real rate of interest on his deposit.</P>
    <P>On page 162 of the same report we read:</P>
    <P>We recommend that the income from all interest-bearing deposits should be charged to tax to the extent only that the rate at which it accrues exceeds the rate of inflation during the period of accrual. </P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to take that recommendation into account.  Taxpayers are sufficiently taxed on their incomes already without going after their savings. I agree with my colleague, Deputy Connolly, that young people who are trying to save to build their own houses and older people who have a relatively small amount of money set aside for a particular purpose are scared that there will be further taxation and a lowering of this limit.  In the case of non-contributory old age pensioners there is the additional penalisation that very often their pension is reduced apart from the additional tax. I hope the Minister will have another look at this and increase the figure to at least £100.  At 10 per cent the capital sum involved would be £1,000 which is not a great deal of money today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concern of a number of speakers about the various reductions in the case of savings and particularly small savings.  Basically I am concerned about the small savers.  I am sure the Minister had good and significant reasons for resorting to this action. We are all conscious of the difficult economic circumstances prevailing.  There has been a fair amount of evasion in this respect and not necessarily by small people who will be most severely hit and about whom I am concerned.  There has been mention of the old age pensioner. I reckon that £50 would be the interest that would accrue on a £500 investment <Col N="2268" /> which would be scarcely sufficient nowadays even to provide for a person's burial.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The Opposition might like to see significant increases here.  I might point out they did very little in this respect over the years.  We are all concerned about and would welcome any measure which would attract investment. While I disagree with the proposal from the point of view of these small investors, nonetheless there are compensations introduced by the Minister in his budget. I am certain that perhaps next year or the year after the Minister will be in a position to examine this situation again and possibly take account of the various points that have been made on both sides of the House.  But there is no point in the Opposition shedding crocodile tears for small investors because their commitment in this respect was significantly wanting in the past.  Neither would I like to think that they consider they have all the answers now.</P>
      <P>I support the submission of the Minister. However, I would ask that, when formulating his next budget he would devise some way of compensating the small investor because every effort must be made on their behalf.  I am concerned like everybody else that while money is taxed at source people who save are further taxed at the investment stage.  That will create in the minds of people a disincentive or feeling that there is no point in saving.  It is the objective of all of us to ensure that as much money as possible is saved in this way and it must be remembered at the end of the day that small accounts make up the large ones.  There has been significant evasion &mdash; because people are able to circumvent the law by holding a number of small accounts &mdash; and presumably that is what was at the back of the Minister's mind when he saw reason to reduce this.  I should like to hear what the Minister has to say in respect of the reduction from £70 to £50 and from the £150 to £120.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Funds invested in the Post Office Savings <Col N="2269" /> Bank or Trustee Savings Bank generate the necessary finance to enable social reforms to take place.  Equally the commercial savings banks provided a necessary level of finance and service over a long time.  I am not so sure that the distinction between the two should be of the order it is in this Bill.  I am anxious to know the Minister's reason for so doing.</P>
    <P>The overall budgetary provisions have been particularly severe in many respects but it is absolutely necessary at this time. Let nobody in this House or outside be under any misapprehension in that regard.  In fact it is possible it will not provide the wherewithal to improve our general financial state.</P>

      <P>People contend that, because of this provision, money will be moved from one savings institution to another.  That may be so but, in the long term, it will level itself out.  I would ask the Minister to review the situation under which a small saver can be compensated because of having made a significant effort to put something aside for the rainy day.</P>

      <P>Like other Deputies, I have had scores of elderly people come to me about this measure, generally confused, frustrated and upset.  I should like to hear what are the Minister's reasons for this proposal because its effects on those people have been particularly severe.  Therefore the Minister would need to have very good reason.  If his reason is that he feels there are some smart people in our society who are evading, doubling-up or making extra use of this facility, then he should devise some other way of tackling this rather than penalising the thousands of very small investors, many of whom are elderly.  As has been pointed out by others, generally these are people with very small savings, for example, like the old folk, for funerals or expenses in connection with impending death.  Even the figure of £1,000 <Col N="2270" /> advanced by our spokesman at present would just about cover funeral expenses in Dublin unless it is desired that people go for cremation which would cost something less.  I calculate that savings of, say, £1,000, at 9 per cent would reap about £90 and that would be covered by the figure of £100 advanced by our spokesman. We really need to know what is the Minister's intention in this respect. Indeed his reason for so doing needs to be very good.  I do not really believe he understands the impact of this on ordinary people who feel very hurt by his proposal. It may have sounded like a smart measure to somebody: that we will catch somebody else while we are trying to catch everybody out.  But we need to be careful lest, in trying to catch a few, we badly hurt very many others, particularly the old folk.  Here I must disagree with Deputy Dowling.  I believe that under the provisions of this latest budget they did not do well; they still have not got their old age pensions and will not until the end of June or beginning of July.  In fact they have done very badly.  They have been asked to accept a bad situation with this additional provision now being imposed.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to tell us clearly what are his reasons and how much he expects to save as a result of this measure.  I would ask him to say also what plans he has to protect these elderly people who have given so much to our society and deserve better treatment than this will afford them.</P>

      <P>I hold very busy constituency clinics.  Not only have I not had scores of people calling on me or writing to me but I have not had even one person call or write to me about this section. There are 111 sections to this Bill and, if we are to spend as much time as we have to date on the first seven, we shall not get through some very important ones later this evening or tomorrow.  Indeed very important parts of it may well be nodded through when people are very tired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A lot has been said about people who have put away £1,000 for the rainy day or for burial purposes being caught for tax.  But it should be remembered that, <Col N="2271" /> under the Minister's proposal, they will be caught for tax on the difference between £50 and £70 if the account is in one name only.  If they are paying tax at 25 per cent then they will be caught for something in the region of £4 per year.  If they pay tax at the standard rate they will be caught for something in the region of £6 per year.  There is an awful lot of fuss being made about this £4 and £6.  I do not know what £4 annually amounts to on a weekly basis but it must be something very small.  The point has been made that perhaps it should not be imposed on certain categories of people, but they do have other options open to them, particularly if they are elderly people.  For instance, they can invest in index-linked bonds with the post office &mdash; which is a very attractive form of investment &mdash; or divert their small holdings from banks to building societies where they need not pay tax unless it exceeds the standard rate and where the money they invest can be used for very productive purposes.  A lot of the emotive things that have been said&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Given the state of public finances it is no wonder this House is being derided so much when so much time is being spent on a section which will have the effect of taxing some people at the rate of £4 per year.  It will have no effect on others and many will not even notice the difference.  Therefore, I feel a lot of this is much ado about nothing.  I do not really want to see people have their exemption limits reduced but, given our current economic circumstances, the Minister is in difficulty and we must accept that funds must be raised in some area.  I should like to know how much will be raised by this section and whether there are economic objectives in introducing this reduction.  Is it intended to reduce it further over a number of years?</P>

      <P>We will be opposing the amendment put down by Deputy O'Kennedy but I would begin by trying to get some explanation why some amendments are deemed to be out of order while others are deemed to be in order.  We put down two amendments to this section and we are informed that both of them are out of order.  I still do not understand the reasons for this and I would appreciate it if it could be explained to me now.  In amendment No. 15 we were asking that tax on interest paid on deposits in commercial banks, merchant banks, Trustee Savings Banks and the Post Office Savings Bank should be deducted at source since tax on PAYE <Col N="2273" /> workers is deducted at source.  It is one of the major items of controversy in the current tax protest that PAYE workers have no choice but to pay tax.  Many others decide not to pay tax and get away with it.  This question of deduction at source is a major point of controversy and it seems to us that in any areas where it is possible to deduct at source this should be done.  We thought the Minister would be glad to look at this matter.  In the case of interest paid on deposits it would be a simple matter to deduct at source.  The banks would pay over interest to depositors less tax and forward the tax to the Minister, just as every employer has to do.  The Ceann Comhairle declared this amendment out of order.</P>

      <P>On the question of amendments being in order or out of order, I wrote a personal letter to each Deputy who had an amendment ruled out of order explaining why it was ruled out of order.  There were quite a number of them.  If Deputy Mac Giolla would like to come to my office we could have a friendly chat about it.  The vast majority have been ruled out of order because they would be a potential charge on the people or a potential charge on the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 16 was to include building societies after commercial banks.  I will accept your invitation because I would very much like an explanation as to how that would add a charge to the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would make the same remarks on this section as I made on the previous section. If we are to do anything to relieve the burden on PAYE workers, which everybody including the Minister has accepted must be done because the burden is much too heavy and has removed the incentive <Col N="2274" /> to work, then taxes must be imposed elsewhere.  That will remove the incentive to something else.  It will remove the incentive to invest or to entrepreneurial activity.  Every tax presumably removes the incentive for something and increases the incentive to evade it if loopholes are left.  The Minister has said that in this case he is not particularly after the people who are availing of these loopholes.</P>
    <P>A case was brought to my attention where a total of £800,000 was invested in sums of £5,000 in 160 different accounts using a list of names taken from the telephone directory.  When one hears of that type of thing one wonders about the crocodile tears shed for the small investor who has a few hundred pounds put aside for funeral expenses.  That does not come into this.  The people who are really scared about this small change are the large investors, those who have all sorts of methods of evading tax using every loophole in the tax system.</P>
    <P>Someone referred to people who receive redundancy payments which they invest in banks.  I do not think many of them invest that money in commercial banks.  Many will invest in the Post Office or in Trustee Savings Banks.  It is the bigger investors who are worried.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to look at the question of deducting tax at source, even though our amendment is not being accepted.  The idea should be examined by the Minister and there should be deduction at source where possible in all areas of tax collection.  We deduct that from the worker's pay packet without considering whether or not at the end of the year he would have had to pay any tax at all.  One works for five or six months.  Tax is deducted at the end of that period and at the end of the year it is discovered no tax should have been paid at all.  Why then should tax not be deducted from the farmer's creamery cheque or the depositor's interest? That is the system that should obtain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed at this section but it is quite obvious to me why the Minister will not concede the point. No allowance is being made for the effect of inflation.  Compare the value of £50 in <Col N="2275" /> 1967 and its value today.  Possibly £5.  The minimum increase should be £100.  Here the Minister is turning the clock back.  I am talking now about the size of the national cake to be put away in the savings cupboard.  The way we are going at the moment not only will there be no national cake but the Minister will have difficulty in finding flour to bake a cake.</P>
      <P>There is a nationwide savings campaign designed to inculcate a savings habit.  But if people save the Minister will penalise them.  That is what he intends to do.  It was interesting to hear a Labour Deputy promulgating the idea of no tax at all being paid on savings.  I would love to see that happening.  Since the suggestion emanates from the Labour Party the Minister should take it to heart as he has taken so many other suggestions.  I am not sure whether they were suggestions or gun-to-the-head propositions put forward by the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>He should remember too that many members of his own party are totally against the philosophy in this Finance Bill.  There is no doubt about that.  We should endeavour to be constructive and our amendment is designed to offset to some extent the erosion caused by inflation. Our young people must not be exploited in this celluloid society of credit cards.  They must be encouraged to save. That is what the Minister wants, but in this section he is running counter to that idea.  There would be no loss of face were the Minister to accept the amendment.  It would be just another encouragement instead of hammering people all the time. I would be interested to know how many savers would be involved in this.  It may be difficult to produce the figure but I believe Post Office savings form a great proportion of savings generally.  In good faith I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalOrmonde" hpid="Dr. Ormonde Dr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 8 provides for the substitution of £120 for £150 and of £50 for £70 in each place where it occurs. This is a sad reflection on the Government particularly where Post Office savings are concerned.  We are talking about small depositors, people who are determined <Col N="2276" /> to save something for their funerals or their retirement.  Many claim this budget is an economist's budget in which certain figures were set down and every effort then made to achieve those figures at any cost.  It is a typical example of a total lack of consideration.  Deputy Mitchell talked about much ado about nothing.  This is an indication of the uncaring and unfeeling attitude of the Government where small depositors are concerned.</P>
      <P>There is a fundamental principle the Minister and his Government have missed.  A person who saves is one with a sense of responsibility and hope for the future.  This section will penalise totally that person.  What incentive is there to save now first with inflation and then taxation? These militate totally against savings.  Instead of taxing interest on savings we should be giving tax incentives to those willing to save.  The level of personal savings is a measure of stability of the community.  When it is high the citizen is in effect lending to the State and investing in the community's business life and so on.  When we prevent people from saving by applying, as we are doing here, penal taxation we are effectively stopping them from saving for the future and throwing them on the mercies of the State instead of allowing them to provide for themselves.  The same tax incentives which apply to insurance should and could be applied to savings.  Will the Minister reconsider this and drop this section from the Bill?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise the situation in regard to group water schemes.  The trustees of these schemes have received big tax demands because they have savings in deposit accounts.  In starting these schemes the first step is to put some money in a local finance institution.  In one case the demand received has been for £3,000.  That money is there for maintaining, servicing and repairing schemes. I am concerned that the Minister is reducing the limit while at the same time the demands will become greater.  If the Minister will not accept our amendment then he should inform the trustees that they <Col N="2277" /> should transfer their money into tax free securities.  He should also allow late appeals which have been sent to the Revenue Commissioners by the trustees upon whom these demands are being made.  It is easy for the Minister to say that the group schemes should invest in tax-free securities but I am still concerned about the fact that these bills are outstanding. I would ask the Minister to ensure that these appeals are accepted and dealt with immediately so that these non-profit making committees who are providing a social service that the local authorities should provide in rural areas will be helped by him and by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to reply in detail to Deputy Kitt.  I answered the question that he put down some time ago but the rest of what he is saying, with respect, does not arise on this section. The relief would not apply to group water schemes anyway because it is available only to individuals.</P>
      <P>The reason for this section is a very specific one.  I shall quote what I said in my budget speech:</P>
      <P>Interest on deposits with certain financial institutions is exempt from income tax up to certain specified limits. This exemption has led to considerable friction: in particular, those institutions which enjoy no concession argue that it is discriminatory.  As a first step towards putting the tax arrangements on a more equal basis, I propose to reduce this exemption. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, the first reason for this is to even out the imbalance between the various financial institutions.  In doing that, taking Deputy Brennan's second question, the difficulty is that if we were to bring everybody up to the same level a very substantial cost would be involved. The Deputy knows, as well as I do, that this is not the year when we can incur extra costs of that nature except for reasons of very high priority.  However, I intend to bring forward an amendment on Report Stage to extend the £50 exemption limit that is now provided for in the Bill to depositors with the Agricultural <Col N="2278" /> Credit Corporation.  I am doing this for the ACC because it was set up to cater specifically for farmers and to provide them with loans specially designed to meet their particular needs.  For this reason the ACC is less competitive than the other institutions and is much more restricted in its lending opportunities.  I hope that the application of this measure to the ACC will reduce this imbalance, strengthen the ACC's deposit taking position and, therefore, benefit the farming section generally.  So it is a question of reducing the disparities that exist between the financial institutions.</P>
    <P>On Report Stage I will be taking the opportunity of proposing some technical changes in the definitions of commercial banks in section 344 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  The list of qualifying banks needs to be amended to take account of some amalgamations and name changes that have taken place since the passing of that Act.</P>
    <P>I take the point that a number of Deputies have made about the importance of developing small savings.  One of the difficulties we have is that we do not save at a level that would support the level of investment we feel is desirable. It is for that reason that we find ourselves obliged to engage in fairly large-scale foreign borrowing.  I would remind Deputies of a number of measures which I announced in my budget speech specifically designed to encourage small savings. I refer particularly to what we have done in relation to index-linked bonds where the maximum amount that a person aged 55 or over may hold is increased from £5,000 to £10,000 and the maximum amount which a person may invest in national instalment savings is increased from £100 to £150 a month with a reduction from two years to one year in the deposit period required to earn an index-linked return on amounts saved under the scheme.  In those two areas I have taken very clear straightforward steps to favour small savings.</P>
    <P>I accept that there are difficulties facing savers today.  Deputy Doyle mentioned the difficulty that arises from the comparison between the interest rate on deposits and the inflation rate. I think <Col N="2279" /> that by far the most effective way of dealing with that problem is to take the kind of action we need to take in order to bring down inflation rates.  Interest rates are not by any means entirely within our control. They are influenced very largely by events outside our own borders so there is a limited amount that we can do to influence the level of interest rates. Curiously enough, as long as we have the need to import capital in order to support the level of investment we need, we are going to have a situation where, other things being equal, interest rates will be rather higher here than they are elsewhere. Otherwise the funds would not flow in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  It is something that we have to take into account and as long as we have that situation and if we can be successful in keeping down our inflation rate then we will be creating the conditions under which it is possible and profitable and attractive to save.</P>
      <P>Not all of the people who hold the accounts we are talking about are small savers.  I appreciate that there are people in the situations mentioned by a number of Deputies and, of course, Deputies always pick the most emotive examples. The old age pensioner saving for a funeral is the one that most often comes to mind. A number of Deputies asked how many people are involved.  This is information I have got rapidly and it may not be completely up to date, but the total number of depositors with banks, the Post Office Savings Bank and Trustee Savings Banks is in the region of 162,000.  The total number of people who would be affected by this measure would be approximately 127,000.  There are about 35,000 who will be unaffected.  They are the small savers who do not earn £50 interest on their deposits.  I do not know why Deputy O'Kennedy is so amused by that.  It is a fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not all of the remaining 127,000 people are in the circumstances stated by Deputies. We are talking about a portion of the interest earned on a deposit that is <Col N="2280" /> regarded as being not liable to tax, like tax free allowance.  The remainder, to the extent that there is a remainder, is declared in the normal way and is assessed under the general rules of taxation. If a depositor's total income, including the balance of interest automatically regarded as tax free, falls below the exemption limit or does not exceed his total tax free allowance, he will not pay income tax on that part of it.  In order that this measure will have effect, the depositor must have a taxable income.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer the questions I have been asked.  I am not being sarcastic. Deputy Mitchell put the whole business in its proper context by looking at the effect of this on individuals. Income in the form of interest on deposits is income like any other income and therefore falls to be considered in the amount to be assessed.  One other point that is relevant is that if there was a greater demand for borrowing from banks I do not think the banks would have any great difficulty in meeting a higher level of demands from borrowers. I understand they are holding various forms of Government paper substantially in excess of their liquidity requirements. Therefore, the measures we are talking about are relevant.  Deputies opposite spoke of the effects of this on the level of bank deposits.  There is no solid evidence on this point.  Deputy Woods asked if the reason for this was to get around evasion. That is not the reason and that is dealt with in another section.</P>
      <P>The total estimated yield from this provision in 1983 is expected to be £1 million. The total cost of the current exemption limit in 1982-1983 is estimated to have been £5 million: that was the total amount of revenue foregone by the operation of the tax concession.  I hope I have replied to the questions that Deputies wanted to get replies to, notwithstanding Deputy O'Kennedy's impatience.</P>

      <P>We have heard a lot of reasons given from various parts of the House, from the Minister's party, the Labour Party and from members of my party. as to why the Minister will not support the amendment.  The Minister has now given his reasons for opposing it.  Before we divide I will go back on some of the reasons he has given.  He has told us this is not to deal with evasion.  It is not only in this House that it is considered to be a device to deal with evasion.  It is also <Col N="2282" /> considered to be so by bank depositors, not necessarily the small savers we have been talking about.  Many others apparently have a degree of apprehension about the purpose of this and other sections. The Minister expects us and them to be naive because he told us it has nothing to do with evasion.  Obviously I do not wish to question the Minister's bona fides.  When he tells us that the reason for this is simply to introduce the same scheme and the same treatment here as for others, we would regard that as being fair enough if he was not at the same time, as he has just now told us for the first time, about to give the same facility to the ACC, who have been very short on liquidity in recent times.  Their customers, the farmers, know that, because so many of them are being pressed for repayments.  Indeed, it is unprecedented.</P>
      <P>I welcome what the Minister is doing in respect of the ACC.  He has also indicated what he is doing in respect of index-linked bonds and national savings bonds.  He has almost covered the disparity that he says he wants to correct in reducing the level of interest free deposits. If it was the main anomaly, it is now being corrected.  That being so, the need for this action is not as urgent as the Minister has suggested.  One can recall the comments that have been made by Deputies, by Deputy Dowling, Deputy Prendergast and Deputies from this side, all reflecting views that have been expressed to them by constituents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I proposed this amendment I spoke very briefly because I suggested the Minister was fully aware of the situation, brought out in correspondence which he himself must have had &mdash; all of us have had such correspondence.  Therefore, I think the only argument the Minister has given does not hold up, particularly in regard to the actions which he proposes to take.  From time to time there have been different treatments for different institutions to serve different purposes. The banks, particularly, and the Trustee Savings Banks fulfil a very special role in respect of service to customers who draw on their facilities in terms of normal current facilities as distinct from <Col N="2283" /> the ACC with whom one cannot have the same current facilities &mdash; you get loan facilities of a different nature.</P>
    <P>The same would be true of some of the other banks to which he referred.  There is, there has been, and there always will be a good reason for giving a special interest allowance in respect of the banks and the trustee savings banks.  While we welcome what has been done for the ACC, there is still a difference between them and the other banks.  The Minister cannot be unaware of what is being widely spoken about, and I do not think it is all rumour.  Bank managers and customers talk to Deputies.  They say there have been significant withdrawals from banks and I am sure the Minister can confirm that.  That is a matter of very serious consequence and runs counter to what the Minister said in his Budget Statement when he referred to the incentive to promote savings at home.  All these arguments are in favour of at least retaining what we have and even increasing it marginally, which is what we propose in our amendment.  The yield would be of the order of £1 million in 1983.  This is not a significant sum having regard to what the deposit base means to our banks and the trustee savings banks.</P>
    <P>I listened very carefully to what the Minister had to say.  Out of a total of 162,000 depositors, all but 127,000 are unaffected.  It has been said that we are talking about young people who save their confirmation money and who will be caught in the future.  I do not know if they will be, but I am concerned about the majority of the 127,000 people.  They are making a substantial contribution not just to their own security &mdash; it is important for them to provide this independence and to know they have provided for their old age and burial expenses &mdash; but they make a very considerable contribution to the economy.</P>
    <P>A short while ago the Minister mentioned &ldquo;tongue-in-check&rdquo; but he has his tongue in his cheek because Deputy Brennan touched on the real reason for this measure.  The Minister is not concerned about this £1 million or the equal treatment of the ACC and the other <Col N="2284" /> banks.  In my time in Finance that was mentioned but it was never of such concern to the officials in the Department of Finance or the Revenue Commissioners to take action like this.  The Minister proposes to introduce later very stringent new powers that will get at people who are hiding money in the banks.  No matter what arguments we put up, he will probably give these powers to the Revenue Commissioners.  This is something I regret.  He does not need to utilise this instrument to penalise small savers.  If the Minister cannot accept our amendment he should leave matters as they are.  We are talking about very little money and for the Minister to argue that his intention is to have equality of treatment for the ACC and the other banks, that does not hold up.  This will have a considerable impact on the small depositors, the banks and the trustee savings banks.  The Minister produced very empty arguments and if he is not in favour of our proposals let us put it to a vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister says he is not doing this to catch the multiplicity of accounts, I accept that.  He says one of his main reasons for taking this action is that there is discrimination between institutions and he would have to extend it. There is another option: he can leave it alone.  The real reason emerges, which is to collect £1 million from 127,000 savers. This is a very small amount and I doubt if the administration involved would warrant the time and effort being put into it.</P>
      <P>Taken in conjunction with section 17, this adds up to a massive onslaught on Irish banks and accounts held there.  The Minister must be aware that one of the most mobile commodities has to be deposits, savings and wealth &mdash; one is almost afraid to use that word for fear of having a picket put on &mdash; and that is at present under siege.  This section, section 17 and a host of other sections get to the heart of the Irish banking system.  I wonder if we are killing the golden goose.  I think we are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to think about correcting the impression that this onslaught is taking place.  Last night one of my constituents who has a few pounds in the <Col N="2285" /> bank said one would want to get the money out of Irish banks because that fellow Dukes is after us all.  While that is comical in one way, it is also frightening. The Minister knows it is not always the detail of legislation that affects the movement of money, the price of a share, or whether one buys or sells stocks, but it is very often the impression, the rumour, the atmosphere, which moves large sums of money around.  This country needs large sums of money and investments now.  If the Minister cannot change the legislation, at least change the atmosphere or there will be no money left in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reason for taking this action is very lame.  He says it is to reduce friction between the financial institutions, even the rates and reduce disparities.  After the budget the tax-free allowance on deposits in the associated banks and some of the nonassociated banks was reduced from £70 to £50; for the building societies the situation was amended, and now the Minister has decided to put down an amendment to change the situation for the ACC from nil to £50.  What about the Industrial Credit Corporation? Will there be another anomaly between the ACC and the ICC? The amount in the Post Office Savings Bank has been reduced from £150 to £120, and the trustee savings banks from £150 to £120.  In other words, the situation is in total disarray and there is no improvement whatsoever.  This further penalisation of those who save will have a very deleterious effect.  What system do the Government propose to use to penalise those who save with credit unions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two points to make.  I do not want to delay on this section because there are many sections and many who want to contribute.  Everyone decries the reduction of this allowance from £70 to £50.  We should, however, be asking, has this allowance justified itself recently?  For instance, some wealthy person with £10,000 on deposit can get the first £70 of his interest free if he is with one of the established <Col N="2286" /> banks, or if it is a joint account, he will get the first £140 free.  That 65 per cent to him is worth a lot more than it is to a person paying 25 per cent tax and this is just one more disincentive.  We should be asking should this allowance have been let continue at all.  We as legislators have adopted a defensive attitude on everything and instead of legislating on the basis of policy, we are looking to see what pressure groups will cry most.</P>
      <P>If Fianna Fáil were really sincere, they would have increased this allowance when they were in Government only some months ago.  They have not increased this allowance on any occasion when they were in Government.  Now that they are in Opposition and have no hope of doing so, they are asking that it be done.  Nobody on the Opposition benches has justified this amendment, in economic or reasonably cogent terms, particularly given the very difficult circumstances in which the Minister finds himself and given this Government's economic policy.  No speaker has put a reasonable case for this section being unacceptable.  Presuming that somebody on 25 per cent tax is benefiting from the full £70 interest allowance he or she will be caught for £4 a week.  This is the difference between £50 and £70 at that rate of tax.  We have spent something like an hour on this section, which is nonsensical. No wonder people look with contempt at this House.  So much time has been spent on this section purely to get the names of the Members into the paper tomorrow to circulate among their constituents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The case has been well made by the Minister and by the people who spoke on the lack of reason for this change.  The real reason behind this section is, as Deputy Brennan pointed out. anti-tax evasion.  The Minister has attempted to stand logic on its head by saying that there are other reasons.  He has said that this is dealt with in another section and the section to which he refers is section 17.  The first action of section 17 is to make retrospective the disclosure requirements of a reduction from £70 to £50 from 9 February 1982, the date on <Col N="2287" /> which the Minister made the budget announcement of the reduction.  The effect of section 17 is that the banks will have to make a retrospective declaration of interest and those whose interest exceeded £50 and £70, who thought that they were safe, will be caught.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real reason is not the amount of money in question, as referred to by Deputy Mitchell.  That amount does not warrant the length of time spent on it. The proposal put forward by our spokesman to increase the limit to £100 should have been done many years ago.  That would have gone a little way towards encouraging people to save more.  The <Col N="2288" /> real reason is not to bring about equity between the financial institutions; it is just another anti-tax evasion device.  If we were serious about encouraging small savers, we would not agree to the amendment put down by this side of the House.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 14, line 20, to delete &ldquo;earlier&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;later&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2291" /> These amendments are to ensure that the right of appeal which the Minister proposes to severely limit will be protected having regard to the needs of the Revenue Commissioners and to the rights of taxpayers.  We recognise that existing appeals procedures have been abused to delay payment of a tax liability.  We do not suggest that there is not a need to streamline the procedure to avoid abuses. However, the Minister in moving to correct these anomalies has gone too far. The purpose of our amendments is to ensure that where discretion should arise it will be used fairly and objectively as between the taxpayer and the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>On page 14, line 20 we propose to substitute the word &ldquo;later&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;earlier&rdquo; in relation to the appeal procedures. It says here:</P>
    <P>Where on the hearing of an appeal against an assessment&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) no application is or has been made to the Appeal Commissioners before or during the hearing of the appeal by or on behalf of the appellant for an adjournment of the proceedings on the appeal or such an application is or has been made and is or was refused (but such an application shall not be refused before the expiration of a period of nine months from the end of the year of assessment to which the assessment appealed against relates or from the date on which the notice of the assessment was given to the appellant, whichever if the earlier).</P>
    <P>This new restriction should be operated very carefully, as circumstances could arise where there would be genuine grounds for failure to submit the appeal on time.  For instance, the appellant could be ill and it may not be possible for him to submit his appeal on time.  Cognisance should be taken of such circumstances. Given the option between the earlier or later date we feel it reasonable to opt for the later date.</P>
    <P>The next amendment deals with the <Col N="2292" /> kinds of evidence that the appellant has to provide before he can escape from the restriction on his right to appeal.  On page 14 line 28 it says:</P>
    <P>such a return has been made but all the statements of profits and gains, schedules and other evidence relating to such return have not been furnished by or on behalf of the appellant. </P>
    <P>We feel it is already strong enough when it says &ldquo;statements of profits and gains, schedules&rdquo;.  The words &ldquo;and other evidence&rdquo; in the context of the restriction of this right is far too vague and general.  It would be hard for any appellant to prove reasonably, much less conclusively, that he had satisfied the terms of this and had produced such other evidence as might be required.  The section will be effective enough without the inclusion of such vague and general terms.</P>
    <P>In line 33 the Bill says:</P>
    <P>the Appeal Commissioners shall make an order dismissing the appeal against the assessment and thereupon the assessment shall have the same force and effect as if it were an assessment in respect of which no notice of appeal had been given. </P>
    <P>In certain circumstances there could have been bona fide reasons for not making the return of the appeal in time.  There are many such reasons, medical reasons and others, perhaps even an attempt to accumulate a whole range of evidence which it is not always easy to present at short notice.  At least the appeals commissioner should be the person dealing with it, and should be given the discretion to make a judgment rather than being bound by the terms of legislation we pass here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite obvious that the Government have maintained a wide range of incentives for house building and house improvements.  It has to be said that, in common with the building industry as a whole, house construction in the private sector was in decline right through 1982.  I accept that the building industry has been going through a tough time, and I also know that the boom times are not about to reappear around the corner, no matter what sort of financial scenario the Opposition may like to paint, or what kind of Alice in Wonderland solutions they come up with.</P>
      <P>This administration are not in the business of government by gimmickry.  I am satisfied the industry is well aware of that fact, and accepts that its problems are no longer susceptible to facile solutions. More than everything else what the industry needs is a period of sound economic management achieved through responsible government and realistic policies.  We are providing that kind of government.  It is in the real interests of the building industry as well as of other sectors that we should continue to do so.</P>
      <P>Sustained and staple development is the key requirement.  Contrary to what Fianna Fáil apparently believed in when in office, it is not just the current year that matters in the context of the building industry.  It would serve the industry not at all if, for example, ill-considered and <i>ad hoc</i> financial measures were to be applied this year and were later to compromise the Government's ability to apply necessary measures in the years ahead, not only in relation to the building industry but to the other sectors as well. I want a strong and staple building industry and I intend to plan for it through the medium term and into the long term.  No matter what the Opposition may say, there is no other option, and anything else is not on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased that, in his remarks last night, Deputy Molloy adopted a far more reasonable approach than he did when speaking on the Department's Estimate on 12 May, and that he did not repeat his allegation that the Government were setting out deliberately to destroy the construction industry.  At the same time, it is <Col N="2295" /> quite obvious that there was a definite inconsistency running through the attitude he adopted.  He indicated that no one on his side of the House was seeking to insulate the building industry from the effects of the recession.  Having said that, he proceeded to make a number of suggestions and criticisms which, if acted on, would undoubtedly result in the industry being treated as though the difficulties which are affecting all sectors of our economy did not exist in relation to the building industry.</P>
    <P>As an example of what I mean, he called for a further £320 million to be added to the Public Capital Programme. How can he reconcile this suggestion with the restrictions on public expenditure which affect all sectors and which he should know are a central element in rectifying the imbalance in our public finances and in putting the country back on the road to economic recovery?  To my mind the Deputy's suggestion in this regard is not worthy of serious consideration, given our present financial situation. I do not see how the Deputy can say he is not trying to insulate the industry from what is happening in the rest of the economy when he makes suggestions of this kind.</P>
    <P>The same point can be made about a number of Deputy Molloy's other suggestions and criticisms.  The essential point is that they all add up to the same old tired remedy of simply throwing money at the industry and hoping the problems will go away.  As I said last week when replying to the debate on the Department's Estimates, this may have served as an investment policy in the past when Fianna Fáil were in office but it is one of the main reasons we are now crippled with such a burden of past borrowings. What Fianna Fáil did in the past few years was to bring this country to the verge of bankruptcy.  We can be forgiven therefore for looking askance at Deputy Molloy's suggestion that we should look at what they proposed to do in 1983. What this Government did was to maintain public spending at the highest possible level consistent with the financial problems we inherited.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2296" /> I must say I was somewhat amused at the Deputy's suggestion about increasing housing grants.  As I said last night, the decline in the private housing sector was evident right throughout 1982.  Despite this, as far as I am aware the question of increasing housing grants was not even considered by the Fianna Fáil Government during that period.  In fact, the only change they made in the assistance available to private house purchasers was to spread the payment of mortgage subsidy over five years as against three years previously.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy referred to the reduction the Government made in the amount of the Public Capital Programme abolished by the Fianna Fáil Government. This reduction amounted in all to £220 million but, contrary to the impression conveyed by Deputy Molloy, not all of this money related to building and construction. A figure of £120 million related to the global contingency provision which was mentioned in the previous Government's capital programme.  Of course, while this money was undoubtedly mentioned in that programme, no indication was given as to how it was to be spent.  In fact, a statement was included to the effect that it would be allocated in the light of the budgetary outlook.  Those words are delightfully vague.  I have no doubt that this global provision was just window dressing and that it was never meant to be provided or indeed to be spent.  As regards the £100 million referred to in our <i>Programme for Government,</i> the simple answer is that when we came into office the money was not there and there was simply no possibility of providing it having regard to the financial constraints.</P>

      <P>I did not and could not. On the question of employment I did not, nor indeed could not, give an undertaking to maintain employment at the level then obtaining when I met representatives of the building industry in January. Such an open-ended commitment in a period of deep recession would have been unrealistic and irresponsible.  I said I would undertake to take initiatives to stimulate private investment and I made it clear that I could not give any indication of the level of budgetary support which would be available in 1983.</P>
      <P>What we need is an efficient, productive and responsible building industry capable of serving the needs of industrial and social development.  We also need the employment the industry provides, the output it gives, and the activities it generates in other sectors.  Since it is a service industry responding to demands originating in a wide range of different sectors, there are always likely to be periodic fluctuations in its level of activity. As far as possible our aim should be to anticipate those fluctuations and, within the constraints of financial and fiscal policies, to seek to minimise their impact.  When the swings in output are of the order experienced in recent years, and when they coincide with a period of unique budgetary difficulties.  With the best will in the world, no Government can hope to offset them completely.  The sooner the Opposition appreciate that fact and get down to some kind of constructive consideration rather than indulging in fanciful exercises involving the expenditure of moneys which are simply not available, the better it will be for the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that context, in the past number of <Col N="2298" /> weeks I have met the unions, the CIF, at both local and national level.  I think the people in the building industry itself have an understanding that the peaks in this industry are as dangerous as the valleys. As I outlined last evening, once peaks have been achieved the strains it places on the industry in terms of resources, available tradesmen and others, renders it very difficult to fulfil the demands made on it.  Some time later, we find ourselves, in terms of imports and materials being supplied to the industry, unable to keep up, as happened with the particularly high peak of 1979.  In fact, I think we are now suffering from the backwash of that peak.  The industry itself is now fully aware of the dangers of such peaking and would not want to see us putting the industry on such an insecure and false footing at any time in the future.  They more than anybody else realise that they want the industry to have a reasonable level of demand, of employment, rather than going into these unreal peaks, as happened in 1979.</P>

Let me say that, in regard to the 1982 Estimates for 1983, lest there be any misunderstanding about it, the Housing Finance Agency themselves are well satisfied that the sum of £50 million being provided will be more than adequate to meet the needs without causing any delays in meeting requests for payments of loans.</P>

      <P>The agency are at present meeting their demands for payments within a week.  So far this year payments by the agency averaged £4 million per month.  Therefore, on present forecasts the £50 million provided should be adequate. If the situation changes and it appears that more than £50 million will be required, certainly I shall have no difficulty in looking at the demand with a view to increasing the amount available, if necessary, to enable them to meet any further needs arising.</P>
      <P>I have already spoken on the Housing Finance Agency and their success story. It is now accepted that the agency fill a very important gap in the availability of mortgage finance and, furthermore, that they have succeeded in channelling funds into housing which hitherto went elsewhere. Yet it is not so long ago that it was quite obvious that it was being set up in the teeth of opposition, even ridicule at the time by Fianna Fáil.  Therefore the type of comment made now is difficult to understand.  On 30 April last the agency had approved about 3,000 loans valued at £55 million.  In the eight months since the first loan was paid a total of £32 million has been paid to borrowers.  It is important to clarify the facts in relation to the agency and to make it quite clear that the agency will have ample funds to meet any commitments they have for this year.</P>

      <P>4,000 since yesterday?  The real situation, which we must clarify, is <Col N="2300" /> that it is not as bad as this.  In fact there may have been an increase in the number of unemployed workers declaring themselves to be building workers but, as is generally known, this tends to be a residual category of general workers who do not fit into any of the other categories on the register.  In fact the present number employed in the industry is about 20,000 lower than it was during the peak employment period in 1979.  This is a far closer indication of the number of building workers who are unemployed rather than the figures we were given yesterday.</P>

      <P>In relation to the question of claw-back on stock relief &mdash; I think Deputy Molloy expressed his concern at this being the most pressing problem affecting the industry &mdash; as has already been clarified from the proposed amendment to the Finance Bill which has been circulated, the effect of this amendment will be to defer the claw-back for a further 12 months.  Through my contact with the industry over the past number of months I have known that this aspect was worrying them, particularly in a time of recession when builders' ability to pay the claw-back is severely curtailed.  This is also something that will have to be looked at in the context of the next 12 months to ascertain if it is the best method of providing what that sets out to do.</P>
      <P>The point was made in relation to the inflow of cash to the building societies. There are sufficient difficulties besetting the industry without dreaming up any new ones which do not exist at present. The situation is that the net inflow of funds to building societies is progressing at a very high level.  I would emphasise the word &ldquo;high&rdquo;.  The societies have adequate funds to meet demand.</P>

      <P>In the first four months of the year the net inflow of funds to building societies totalled approximately £65 million in comparison with less than £50 million in the same period last year, an increase of 30 per cent.  In the first two weeks of May net inflows were holding at an average of £4.2 million a week, which by any standards is a healthy trend.  Certainly there should be no difficulties encountered in relation to mortgage finance from the building societies because the cash is available and, as I have just stated, inflows are adequate to meet demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might refer briefly to the present state of the housebuilding industry, which obviously forms an integral and important part of the construction industry, and its future for the next 12 months or so.  The building societies account for 70 per cent of the loans paid by all the main lending agencies and so are a reasonable barometer to use when considering the state of the housebuilding industry.  In the first quarter of 1983 the five main <Col N="2302" /> building societies, who account for 95 per cent of all building society transactions approved loans for 4,600 houses valued at £105 million.  In the preceding quarter the number of loans approved by the societies was almost identical and was valued at £100 million.  That has to be contrasted with the equivalent period of 1982 when approvals by the five societies were for only 2,800 loans, valued at £60 million &mdash; much the same level of activity as in the final quarter of 1981.  Therefore, not only are the forebodings of Deputy Molloy without foundation but the position is brighter than it was about a year ago for the building sector.  Loan approvals by the main building societies were 3,500 more in number and £85 million more in value in the six months to 31 March 1983 than for the same period in 1982.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I might say that in the foreseeable future the outlook for the housebuilding industry, as far as the availability of adequate mortgage finance is concerned, is certainly promising.  It is important that that become known rather than any other impression that might be given through statements made in this House, because the evidence is there clearly to substantiate these facts.</P>

      <P>I support the motion moved last night by Deputy Molloy.  I speak on this motion not just to indulge in a political point-scoring exercise.  It is one of the most relevant motions to come before the House for some time.  There is no doubt that we have enormous problems and we would point out that the construction industry, which is experiencing the worst of the recession, is the sector which must be tackled by the Government in a positive manner in order to arrest the ills which afflict that industry and thus tackle the unemployment problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not pretend that the problems in the housing and construction industry arose during the past few months but they have been exacerbated by the recent <Col N="2303" /> budget.  A formidable figure of 10 per cent of the working population are directly or indirectly affected by the construction industry.  The unemployment level is 20 per cent compared to 13 per cent in the country generally.  There is no indication that any improvement can be expected in this area unless positive Government action is taken to direct resources into that industry.  No other sector of the economy can make a greater contribution to the reduction of unemployment based on increased investment.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of understanding of the cyclical nature of the construction industry on the part of the Government and the vicious decline in the home market can only be stemmed by the Government's abandoning their short-sighted approach and taking positive action to boost the industry.  Unless this action is taken now a number of construction companies will go bankrupt this year and next year.  Many accept that some kind of hairshirt is needed if we are to bring the economy back into shape but at the same time we have no wish to commit economic suicide.</P>
    <P>We deplore the decision of the Government to reduce the 1983 Public Capital Programme by £220 million and the failure to fulfil the promise by the Minister for the Environment to provide an extra £100 million for the construction sector.  That is the keynote of this motion. Government policy is not suited to the needs of the construction industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy referred last night to the Minister's promise to give an extra injection of £100 million to the industry. Certainly the people to whom he was speaking on 17 January last got the clear impression that this was what he was saying, although he is saying the opposite now.</P>
    <P>The Committee Stage of the Finance Bill is now being taken and this Bill has a very great effect on the construction industry.  Even at this late stage the Government could assist the industry by abandoning the introduction of advance corporation tax.  Above all, our stock relief legislation should be brought into line with UK standards.  Those matters <Col N="2304" /> could be catered for in the Finance Bill. I understood the Minister to say that he is giving a 12 months' lease of life to the stock relief situation.  One would hope that he would extend this beyond 12 months.</P>
    <P>It is significant that only last Thursday Mr. Ken Rohan, chairman and chief executive of the Rohan Group, in the course of his remarks to shareholders at the annual general meeting was somewhat critical of Government policy and he mentioned stock relief legislation.  In relation to advance corporation tax, he stated as follows:</P>
    <P>ACT will further reduce the chances of controlling unemployment as funds are taken away from the healthy tissue of industry and used for less efficient purposes by Government.  It is another example of political expediency taking over from practical common sense. Today a company needs every single pound of its hard-earned profits to hold employment levels and reinvest for future growth.  ACT will defer capital expenditure as cash resources become even more scarce through the continued depression in Irish industry.</P>
    <P>This is something which the Government can arrest in the Finance Bill.  We have put down a number of amendments and the Minister for Finance, in consultation with the Minister for the Environment, should seriously consider them.</P>
    <P>The plight of the construction industry is an enormous scar on the country.  We have official unemployment figures of 188,000 but there are always another 4,000 within the system who are not officially listed, as well as another 19,000 excluded from payment and 20,000 small farmers who are available for work.  The actual figure is about 230,000 and that does not include those who lost their jobs during the past few weeks as a result of the closure of Telectron, Dunlop, Ranks, NIKE and other companies.  The Minister disputes Deputy Molloy's figure but there is no doubt that there at least 40,000 people unemployed in the construction industry.  It is reckoned that one in every two persons in the industry will be out of <Col N="2305" /> work by the end of the year.  The same applies to the associated ancillary industries.</P>
    <P>The native raw material supplier to the construction industry is Irish Cement. Irish Cement has its Platin operation in my constituency.  It has its other operation in Limerick.  Before Christmas it operated on two units.  Since Christmas it has been operating on one unit. At the moment there are negotiations with Irish Cement for the purpose of reducing by 81 the numbers employed.  In other words in Platin 81 will go into voluntary retirement. In Limerick the figure is 169.  That is a total of 250 people in a basic native raw material industry which supplies the construction industry.  These can be added to the figure I quoted earlier.</P>
    <P>The situation is catastrophic.  Irish Cement had its problems because of the importation of cement.  Basically now the problem is the lack of demand in the building industry.  That lack is not due to bad weather.  The industry is going through a recession and it is not being helped in any way by Government policy and certainly not by the Bill we have been discussing today.  The attitude of the Government is wholly negative.  Cement sales are down 18.3 per cent from May 1982 to May 1983.  We talk about the indirect employment in the construction industry.  I live in a town which is called the home of furniture and, when the building industry is on the ground, my home town, Navan, is on the ground.  We liked to claim we furnished the nation with both furniture and carpets.  Never before in my lifetime have I seen the furniture industry with its back to the wall.</P>
    <P>I remember the recession in the 1950s. There was mass emigration out of Navan. Coincidentally that was during the Coalition Government of 1954-1957.  There is no emigrant ship today.  Today there is high unemployment because the furniture factory is laying off workers week in and week out.  They are under extreme pressure from the banks and the Revenue Commissioners.  The stores they supplied are no longer able to sell their products because of the recession.  They cannot sell because houses are not being built <Col N="2306" /> and so there is no demand for furniture or carpets.  Never has the furniture industry in Navan had it so bad.</P>
    <P>In February last the unemployment figure in Navan was about 930.  The latest figure on 29 April showed unemployment had soared to 1,274.  If the construction industry does not get off the ground there will no longer be a furniture industry in Navan.  That is why I tried to impress on the Minister the need for a positive capital injection into the construction industry in an effort to cure the situation before the disease gets any worse.  For the first time the carpet industry, which opened in 1938, has had to lay off 105 people. That was one of our saddest experiences in Navan.  It was the backbone of the town for many, many years and it meant a great deal to the economy of practically every family.  Now 105 workers have been let go and 105 families have been affected.  It has been a traumatic experience.  In the furniture industry the lay-off is reckoned at 50 per cent of the 800 work force.</P>
    <P>In this context one has to remember the subsidiaries, such as the joinery, the carpets, the fireplaces and so on and so forth.  These have all been affected adversely.  I have been speaking to those who were engaged in the building industry who now travel to Dublin to try to get work.  There is no work for them and they are becoming totally demoralised.  They never drew unemployment benefit before but they now have no other option.  After a meeting last night a man approached me a little diffidently to ask me if I could find him a job.  He had been in the building industry all his life and had never been unemployed before.</P>
    <P>Something must be done immediately to remedy the situation.  There must be some arrangement beneficial to the construction industry to help it get off the ground again.  I heard the Tánaiste here some time ago say he hoped to have 30,000 new starts in houses this year. Where will they be?  There is not much sign of them at the moment.  How they will be achieved before the end of the year is beyond my comprehension. Despite the injection in local authority housing a report this month predicts a <Col N="2307" /> downturn in local authority houses.  I refer to the report of the <i>Quarterly Economic Policy</i> published in May.  Summing up the situation the report says: &ldquo;It seems clear that there will be a very significant fall in local authority housing activity in 1983 in spite of the increased 12 per cent allocation and this implies a very large price effect for local authority housing. The answer in some respects is contained in the revised Public Capital Programme where it is stated that the cost of each completed local authority house this year will be in the region of £35,000.  That report would seem to indicate that despite the 12 per cent increase we are in for a downturn in local authority housing this year.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned last night that he was asking local authorities to be more flexible in their attitude to planning applications and that he intended to ask his new Bord Pleanála to be more flexible also.  It is hard to understand why local authorities in some counties have not been flexible and indeed have been difficult. They have been stultifying the construction industry.  A circular was sent to all local authorities a couple of weeks ago recommending that not alone should they not give planning permission on national primary roads but that they should not give it on national secondary routes either.  I would suggest to the Minister of State that when An Bord Pleanála is being formed it should not consist entirely of architects and engineers. There should be some lay people on it to give their opinions as well.</P>

      <P>I rise in support of the amendment to this motion. I would like to try to make my contribution in the spirit in which Deputy Molloy said he would address himself at the outset of his remarks yesterday.  The Labour Party and Fine Gael in Government do not believe that the construction industry belongs to any one particular party nor are we prepared to go down the road of attempting to turn it into a political football. Having welcomed the initial remarks of Deputy Molloy, I found the <Col N="2308" /> tone of what he had to say subsequently &mdash; and, indeed, what Deputy Fitzsimons said &mdash; very counter-productive towards the industry which more than any other depends upon State assistance and private investment.  Deputy Molloy himself said that confidence was a key issue in the performance of the industry and its perception by the public and by potential investors.  I would respectfully suggest to the Deputies on the far side that they should carefully look at the way in which they have presented arguments over the last two days and test it against that particular correct assessment of this industry.</P>
      <P>The reason why confidence is so important is because accurate statistics are extremely rare in this industry.  I do not want to repeat the saga, of which Deputy Molloy is painfully aware, of events that took place in this House in the 1970s over allegations and statistics and the ongoing row that existed over house starts and house completions; but the fact is that the industry is woefully inadequate in factual and accurate statistics.  Therefore, arguments can be used grotesquely to portray the character of the industry at any time.  I will give a specific example. Deputies aligned on the other side of the House are quoting figures for unemployment in the industry based on the available statistics.  They do not include the fact that in 1979 at the height of the boom, when we were scouring the sites of England for trained and qualified workers, there were 19,000 registered unemployed workers in the building industry.  All of us would recognise that the statistics upon which any rational debate can take place are not as good as we would like them to be.  Deputy Molloy, as a former Minister for Local Government, is well aware of that.  I regret to say that when I took office less than 150 days ago with the Tánaiste there was not a substantial improvement in the quality of those statistics in a whole range of areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Confidence, therefore, in an industry which is not so clearly defined or clearly measured, assumes a disproportionate importance and anything that is said by anybody in a responsible position and <Col N="2309" /> particularly inside the national Parliament is extremely important, and I would like to refute totally what has been said by Deputy Fitzsimons in relation to local authority housing statistics.  They do not match up at all to the information that we have and I would be more than happy to make available to the Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party the figures we have. The Quarterly Bulletins which are made available to all Deputies would substantiate our case.  That kind of argument simply puts pressure on local builders by their creditors and bankers and that is in nobody's interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is still a commentary. The second point that has been made by the Fianna Fáil Party is that because the industry is in such a crisis we should throw more money at it, that because private investment has declined we should, disregarding every amendment they have down to the Finance Bill, find money anywhere and simply throw it at the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>They want us to throw money at the industry in some indiscriminate fashion in the hope that some of it might stick and in the aspiration that the bit that did stick would produce growth and in the dream that the bit that did stick and produce growth would at the end of the day produce tangible jobs.  If <Col N="2310" /> Fianna Fáil call that planning or responsible Government, we do not go down that road with them.  When Fianna Fáil won office in 1977 with the Santa Claus manifesto unemployment was at approximately 100,000 and the state of the national debt was approximately £4,000 million.  They threw money at the Irish economy &mdash; and in particular at the building industry &mdash; indiscriminately, without judgment, without planning, without any set of criteria that could be described as rational on the basis of providing jobs and growth.  When we came back into office before Christmas unemployment in round figures had virtually doubled to nearly 200,000 and the total national debt was £12.700 million.  They want us still to get money from whatever source and simply throw it at the economy.</P>
      <P>I worked in the building industry from 1977 to 1981 and I saw the chaos that their kind of planning produced on site after site.  I saw the chaos it produced in relation to builders' providers &mdash; the complete distortion of the market, the complete distortion of supplies and increase after increase in inflation rates for contracts and tenders.  That was bad enough, because it established costs which were not realistic; but it also opened the door for a rash of building construction imports which by their nature do not import easily because of their size.  But the magnetic force of Fianna Fáil's overheating of the economy was such that today Fianna Fáil's legacy is not just the level of unemployment, because after 150 days in office we will not accept responsibility for the mess we found, but we now have the monster of £350 million worth of building materials which could be produced all over this country &mdash; bricks, roof-tiles, basic cement, and even timber &mdash; being imported each year.  Some of them are being imported by active members of the building industry who today want us to find more taxpayers' money to invest in their industry because the level of private investment has dropped.  That is a road down which we can no longer afford to travel.  We simply will not go further and further into the quagmire from which we are trying to extricate ourselves.</P>

      <P>Throwing money at the industry has been the traditional recipe from Fianna Fáil.  Not only is it not a solution, but it makes the disease worse. It created artificial peaks from which the fall was inevitably deeper and more dangerous. Regrettably that is where we are now.  Our amendment recognises those difficulties.  It recognises the problems in the industry.  But the solution is not more of the same things which aggravated the problem in the first instance.  It is to attempt, with dialogue and discussion with the construction group of trade unions, the CIF and the Building Materials Federation, to get some form of even keel planning into an industry that never had it before.</P>
      <P>How do we propose to do that?  First of all, the PA Consultants Report, which is emerging, will give us a substantial picture of the industry and ways in which it can be managed.  Second, as was said at the meeting on 17 January, it is our desire that, following the publication of the report in its final form, in consultation with all sides in the industry to attempt to establish some form of planning council or group that will attempt to regulate the volume of State investment in the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say formally to Fianna Fáil, who described themselves as the guardians of private enterprise, as Deputy Molloy did yesterday, that the industry cannot have it both ways.  It cannot have 100 per cent State investment on the one hand and 100 per cent private control over its accounts, its performance and its standards. If the industry wants increased State investment above and beyond the 70 per cent we are currently funding &mdash; no other <Col N="2312" /> industry gets that kind of relief or that kind of direct investment that this and previous Governments have put into it &mdash; instead of talking to us through newspaper advertisements less than a month after we had taken office, we should have a proper serious dialogue on a continuing basis.</P>
    <P>Money is not the only problem in the industry.  Because Fianna Fáil saw it as a money problem they allowed numerous other problems to compound and get worse, aggravating a very bad situation. An Bord Pleanála have been responsible, directly or indirectly, for a substantial increase in delays within the industry, so much so that we found since taking office that delays within An Bord Pleanála could last between nine and 15 months. The impact of those delays was that a builder or a developer had his available working capital tied up in options and property that he had owned and had no available capacity to diversify to another site.  These delays were imposed on the building industry by maladministration and non-functioning of the entire system. As the Minister has indicated, we are moving to remove that type of delay.</P>
    <P>Nothing was done by the previous Fianna Fáil administration to remove delays.  Many other things were done in relation to that board but nothing to make it perform efficiently and effectively from the industry's point of view. All three Deputies across the floor know precisely what I am saying.</P>
    <P>Another delay was in the processing of building by-law applications in Dublin Corporation.  This is another area in which we are moving to have the situation improved and the processing of applications expedited.  The previous administration did nothing about this.  Even when a builder had a site which clients were ready to occupy, there were self-imposed constraints not related to money and which cost a lot of money if not rectified. We are moving on that.</P>
    <P>We are moving to improve building standards, safety standards and standards of insulation which would reduce running costs in relation to heating.  The draft building regulations which started in 1967 with An Foras Forbartha languished in <Col N="2313" /> the Custom House during four years of secure Fianna Fáil administration.  That was another delay in terms of getting value for money in the buildings we constructed.</P>
    <P>All of these delays will be removed as quickly as we can in the next four years. The House will very soon have an opportunity to debate the Bord Pleanála Bill and the building regulations legislation, which will contribute towards improving the operations of the industry and the value for money which the community must get if it is to continue to fund the industry to the extent of 70p in every pound spent in the industry.  We would be failing in our duty as people who allocate funds for the industry if we did not require and look for that kind of standard.</P>
    <P>Let me refer briefly to what Deputy Molloy repeatedly referred to last night as &ldquo;money allocated by Fianna Fáil&rdquo;.  I thought Fianna Fáil had financial problems. The newspapers and Mr. McKay indicated they had.</P>

      <P>In the middle of the election campaign.  They were impartial documents produced in the calm period of responsible Government.  I think most people, the kids in the street, recognised just what fiction Fianna Fáil turned out in columns of money in the last two years. Deputy Molloy uses the phrase &ldquo;money allocated by Fianna Fáil&rdquo;.  The inherent arrogance in that slip of the tongue is incredible.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, it is not.  I am dealing with the Deputy's claim that the Public Capital Programme was reduced by £200 million.  The election document published by the outgoing minority Fianna Fáil administration suggested a figure of £1,324 million for the Public Capital Programme.  It was like a cheque written against a blank bank account &mdash; there was nothing there to substantiate it.  The actual figure we provided for this year was £1,251 million for the Public Capital Programme.  I quoted earlier the figures in the Fianna Fáil election Estimates in 1982.  The figure for 1982, when Fianna Fáil were in office, was £1,278 million.  At the close of 1982 the election Estimates published by Fianna Fáil suggested that the figure they would make available if re-elected would be £1,324 million, including the global contingency fund, the figment of the imagination that did not exist.  We made available this year £1,251 million and that is a decrease in real terms of 5.5 per cent on what was actually provided and spent last year.</P>
      <P>The reason I am tortuously dealing with those figures is to nail a particular lie.  First, the election Estimates of November 1982 must be seen as that and cannot be quoted as anything else, but more important &mdash; I am not trying to score political points in relation to this &mdash; in terms of the perception of confidence by the industry, the capital sum available this year under the Public Capital Programme is 5 per cent less than it was in 1982.  I regret, and the Government regret, that it is less but there are real constraints.  To talk in terms of £200 million being taken from the Public Capital Programme is not factually correct and it simply fuels the flames of doom and gloom and lack of confidence in an industry that does not need that kind of talk.</P>

      <P>The context in which those Estimates were published in November is clearly understood by all.</P>
      <P>I want to tell Fianna Fáil, workers and employers in the building industry and the materials federation that we recognise the extraordinary difficulties the industry face.  Part of those difficulties would have been faced by the industry anyway, because of the cyclical nature in which it had been operating, and part of those difficulties are a reflection of the recession, as Deputy Fitzsimons said when he described the difficulties experienced by the furniture industry in Navan.</P>
      <P>The old solutions of throwing money indiscriminately at the building industry not only are not effective and do not produce the result for which Fianna Fáil hope, but they are options which are no longer open to us because in early days we spent all available capital and borrowed even more, and simply do not have that provision to fall back on.  Within less than ten days of being out of office, Deputy MacSharry, former Minister for Finance, before Christmas signalled in his speech that the Government would have difficulty borrowing money abroad to finance even minimal levels of public capital works and current account deficits. Every Fianna Fáil Deputy, every accountant and every child knows that option is not there.</P>

      <P>I am on very firm ground because I have the facts.  Fianna Fáil did not succeed in choking it to death.  In its first public issue, more than any other fiscal instrument it has been dramatically successful in attracting private pension fund money on terms the public can afford, and not on the giveaway kind of proposals Fianna Fáil were suggesting. We recognise that the pension fund, which are workers' savings for their retirement, can be constructively utilised in a manner that will provide not only secure pensions for the beneficiaries themselves but also make effective contributions, <Col N="2317" /> particularly to the construction industry.  We are actively pursuing ways in which those moneys can be channelled in a productive and economic manner into our industry.</P>
      <P>I reject the motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanWalsh" hpid="Mr. S. Walsh Mr. S. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he worked in the building industry; so did I. I was involved in the practical and administrative sides of the industry.  It is all very fine for the Minister to quote statistics here but is he in a position to convince the people engaged in this industry that this Government are doing everything they can to help?  I know from experience that the building industry is in the same position today as it was when the other Coalition Governments were in power. The Coalition were in power from 1948 to 1951 and from 1954 to 1957.  During 1957 many people in Dublin closed their doors and boarded the emigrant ship never to return.  The situation today is exactly the same as it was in 1981 and 1982 when we had a Coalition Government.</P>
      <P>The Minister and his Minister of State continually referred to statements made by Deputy Molloy.  This Government are comprised of two parties, Fine Gael and Labour, with the Minister and his Minister for State belonging to the Labour Party.  The building industry is in total chaos.  The function of this Minister is to create confidence in the industry.  Let us look at builders' suppliers &mdash; Chadwicks and other firms.  If the Minister rings these firms he will be told of the number of people who have to be let go each week.  There is no point in the Minister coming here saying the position will be all right when legislation is introduced in the near future.  The only legislation mentioned by the Minister or the Minister of State is that connected with a change in the planning board.  Do the Government believe that by introducing such legislation they will instill the necessary confidence in builders to invest their money in the industry?  The building industry needs an injection of money now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One need only read the press to become aware of the plight of that industry. <Col N="2318" /> Large amounts of capital have been made available to rescue Irish Steel, NET, Aer Lingus, CIE and Irish Shipping from mounting debt and demoralisation of their work force.  A great deal could be done in this case even, with a small amount of money.  However, the Government are not prepared to give this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what it is about. We have had crises in the building industry before, lay-offs and unemployment and some of our officers and tradesmen seeking work elsewhere but never before have we had a problem in the building industry which aroused so little concern in the Government of the day.  We read and hear of reports of some building organisation doing well.  However, we forget that the profits of these companies have been earned abroad.  If the building industry is to improve, can we expect the companies with considerable experience in that industry, who have played a major role in its development here, to return to this country?  Do we still believe, as <Col N="2319" /> Deputy Kelly has said, that there is virtue in emigration and the emigrant is better off for his experience abroad?  If we were still to subscribe to that, the social circumstances could be alarming.  In many instances it brings about serious family problems.  A reduction in apprenticeship is another consequence and this is something to which I have given considerable attention over the years.  There is a significant deterioration in the morale of the workforce and, worst of all, a real possibility that if and when the recession passes, the start-up in the building industry will be unnecessarily slow &mdash; and all because of lack of concern on the part of the present Government.</P>
      <P>During the election campaign of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties, they campaigned to be in Government and to do a better job.  They are now in Government and now is the time to do so.  There is no use blaming Deputy Molloy or Fianna Fáil.  It is now up to the Government to inspire those engaged in the building industry to have confidence in it.  I hope that the legislation which the Government intend to introduce will, as promised, play an effective role in improving the situation.</P>
      <P>The Coalition Government reduced by £220 million the capital allocation for building and construction in the Estimates prepared by Fianna Fáil while in office.  At Limerick before the election the Minister promised £100 million from the contingency fund to be used especially for building and construction work. This promise was reneged on in the budget.  The effect of the cutbacks on employment is felt not only among the builders but among the builders' suppliers and the furniture and electrical firms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil always had a reputation for showing interest in the building industry. That industry was in a healthy state under Fianna Fáil but Coalition Governments have not been helpful to it.  This fact has always been recognised by builders and builders' workers.  Fianna Fáil stood solidly behind the building and construction industry down through the years and have proved their attitude in providing <Col N="2320" /> £220 million more public capital this year than the Coalition Government are now providing.  That is what counts.  It is what ensures employment in the building industry.  I demand that the cuts in the public capital programme be restored and the promise in relation to the £100 million at the Limerick Labour Convention be honoured for the sake of those employed in the building industry and the thousands depending for their jobs on the industry, which jobs are now in jeopardy, I demand this for the sake of the people and our economy in general.</P>
    <P>The Government recently introduced fees for planning applications.  I ask the Minister to consider waiving these fees in relation to planning applications for community centres and halls.  The Minister and his Minister of State will realise the amount of good work done by these committees. Community centres play a very important role in the life of the parishes. Planning applications for these centres should be exempt from planning fees.</P>

I went to some lengths last night to detail the extent of the serious crisis affecting this industry in regard to jobs and future employment and the continuation of this industry as a viable national industry which, after all, up to now has been our second major industry.  We availed of the opportunity to have this debate in the House because it was the one place where one would expect the man who sits at the Cabinet table with responsibility for all our construction sector to listen to the debate.  Here is the reality.  It has been a matter of great disappointment to this side of the House and to the industry outside and those workers who have already lost their jobs or whose jobs are threatened that the man who has responsibility for their industry did not think it worth his while to hear the full argument put forward by the Fianna Fáil spokesmen. <Col N="2321" /> That is regrettable.

As an Opposition party, we are fulfilling our responsibility by highlighting the serious crisis in the industry.  The brief contribution by the Minister and the contribution by the Minister of State unfortunately did not show a clear admission that this industry is in a serious decline.  There is no use in talking about peaks and valleys in the industry. That has been standard Minister for Local Government-Minister for the Environment waffle for the past 20 years. We all accept that this industry is affected when there are peaks and valleys.  Last evening the Minister admitted that it was impossible to avoid that but we are talking here about the decline of the industry, its decline into a bottomless pit and into a situation whereby by December of this year half the operatives in the industry will be out of work.  At the moment 1,000 operatives are becoming unemployed per month in the building industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's answer is that the statistics are not accurate, that the industry is notorious for the unreliability of statistics relating to its activities.  If the Government must resort to criticising the collection of statistics, it must be clear to the country that they are not prepared to <Col N="2322" /> face up to the difficulties of the industry, that they are not prepared to take action to arrest the decline.  It is not our concern to say that everything is fine when Fianna Fáil are in Government while the reverse is the case when the Coalition are in power.  I have no intention of becoming involved in that simplistic type of argument, the type of argument which is reflected in the speech of the Minister for the Environment.  Instead of coming in here to read a script prepared by someone in the Custom House, I should prefer the Minister to stand up and tell us what he intends doing for the industry to pull it out of the serious decline into which it has fallen.</P>
    <P>If some of the measures the Government are taking in the Finance Bill are not changed, the building industry will go into further decline and if that happens no amount of money will save it.  We are not advocating throwing money willy-nilly at the building industry.</P>

      <P>When the Coalition were in Government previously the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Bruton, gave a commitment to have the Estimates for 1983 published in advance.  We welcomed that commitment but the Minister did not adhere to it.  However, we carried it through when we were returned to office. I trust that it will be the policy of the Coalition to continue to publish the Estimates before the commencement of the financial year.  We are now approaching the end of May and we are only at the stage of discussing the final stages of the Finance Bill.  Local authorities only got their information about allocations a few weeks ago.  We are all anxious to have that situation put right.  It is both unfair and facetious of the Minister of State to seek to make some kind of major debating point about that.  We published the Estimates in advance.</P>

      <P>There has been a deliberate Government decision to cut back on the capital allocations in the Estimates published at the time Fianna Fáil were in Government.  It would be facetious of me to say that Fianna Fáil allocated moneys because that would sound as if I were talking about 13 Upper Mount Street allocating the Public Capital Programme. If one's argument must fall to that level it shows how weak one's position is.  It indicates that the Labour Ministers who now control the Custom House are completely failing at Cabinet level to get any cash, any decisions or any incentives so far as the construction industry is concerned. Fine Gael have no say in the Custom House.  They control Government buildings.  The failure of Labour in this Government in regard to the building industry is something they will have to carry in speaking to their workers and supporters outside.  Labour will have to find answers to the questions that the families of those workers and supporters are asking about job losses.</P>
      <P>We have admitted that there has been a falling off in the building industry for some time but what we are crying out here for are measures from the Government to arrest the decline.  Instead, they introduced a budget which spelled further disincentives for the industry, which is catastrophic and which destroyed confidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are appealing to the Government to have sense and to withdraw some of the dreadful provisions in the Finance Bill, provisions that will result in driving money away from the industry and also in a big loss of moneys to the building societies.  Who will be prepared to invest money in the building societies knowing that there can be given to a tax inspector the facility to go in and examine all accounts?  The tax inspector will not have to produce any reasonable argument to support his case.  He need only go to the High Court and say that he is not satisfied about the returns in a certain case.  The Government by allowing for accounts in banks and building societies to be scrutinised by a tax inspector are destroying the confidentiality of the relationship that has existed traditionally between the <Col N="2324" /> banks and the building societies and their investors.  That confidential relationship was the cornerstone of building society growth.</P>
    <P>The Government boast about all the money that has been flowing into the building societies but by their policy announced yesterday, they are ensuring that this money will flow out now.</P>
    <P>In my constituency the number of houses built in 1980 was 440.  In 1981 the number fell to 360 while in 1982 it was 280 but for this year it looks as if it will be 180.  As I said last evening, one of the largest builders in my constituency was completing about 240 houses per year. His out-turn now is down to 45.  He used to have 35 blocklayers working for him. Now he has one.  A lot more is needed from the Government than the simplistic attitude of throwing cash at the industry and hoping some of it will stick.</P>

      <P>Why did the Government go back on their word to the building industry in regard to extending the provisions of section 23?  The Government did not tell the industry that there would be involved a requirement to increase from a two-bedroomed to a three-bedroomed the type of apartment that would be required in order to qualify under section 23.  That amendment is rendering meaningless the extension of the benefit under that section.  Very few builders will be able to avail of the incentive that the section provides because of the requirement that I have referred to.  The planning permissions that are in are not for three-bedroomed apartments.  It will take from six months to a year to get the permission but the demand is for two-bedroomed apartments.  The section 23 incentive which was introduced by Fianna Fáil was successful but the Government are negativing it.  Every step they are taking is destroying the industry. They are dismantling every incentive that we introduced and in addition are creating new disincentives.  Their actions are bringing nearer to despair those people who have spent their lives working in <Col N="2325" /> the industry.  These are people such as carpenters, electricians, plasterers, blocklayers and so on who took such pride in their work and who helped to build our housing stock, our factories and our schools.  It appears that so far as the Government are concerned the skills of these workers are no longer required, that they can be thrown on the unemployment heap.  The Government are ensuring that that will happen as fast as possible.</P>

Last evening I offered several suggestions and asked for some reaction from the Government.  Their reaction has been negative.  The Minister for the Environment was here for only half of my speech but this did not deter him from reading from a prepared script criticising what I had said.  That script was written before I stood up to speak.  All of this is an indication of how this Government regard the real problems affecting the people.  I regret that we have had no response from the Government.  This has been a no-joy debate.</P>
      <P>There is no indication that the Government are remotely aware of how serious is the problem in the construction industry.</P>

      <P>Deputy Michael O'Kennedy reported progress on amendment No. 17 to section 9.  We are discussing amendments Nos. 17 to 27 together.</P>
      <P>SECTION 9.</P>
      <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 14, line 20, to delete &ldquo;earlier&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;later&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In explaining the reasons for the various amendments in my name on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party I had got as far as amendment No. 20.  To facilitate the business of the House I do not intend to repeat anything I have <Col N="2329" /> said.  I will now proceed to the background to amendment No. 21.  If after all the procedures have been concluded the appeal commissioners determine that the assessment should stand, we are asking for a period of 28 days after the conclusion of the proceedings which, in our submission, is a very reasonable period, a very identifiable and limited period, to enable the matter to be reconsidered by the appeal commissioners as if it were adjourned for that period.  Our amendment suggests that in page 14, line 39, after the word &ldquo;given&rdquo; the following words should be inserted:</P>
      <P>Provided, however, that if within a period of 28 days of the making of such an order the returns and the statements of profits and gains and schedules, as requested by the inspector, relating to such returns are submitted to the Appeal Commissioners the appeal shall be deemed to have been adjourned for a period of 29 days from the date of the hearing and paragraph C of this sub-section shall not otherwise apply.</P>
      <P>The safeguard from the Minister's point of view is that if the returns and the statements of profits and gains and schedules as requested by the inspector are submitted to the appeal commissioners within a period of eight days, the appeal will be deemed to have been adjourned for a period of 29 days, that is, to the date following the 28 days, to enable the appeal commissioners to deal with the appeal.  This is to cover the possibility, which no one in this House can envisage at this point that for good, bona fide reasons, perhaps ill health or absence from the country, the appellant was not in a position to meet the timescale provided in this subsection of section 9. Because of that we limit the provision in our proposal to 28 days which is an indication of our reasoned approach.  I hope the Minister and his advisers will see the reason behind that and be able to accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>At this stage I do not think we need to proceed with the next amendment, No. 22:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2330" /> In page 14, line 40, to delete &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;may&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>At the moment it reads that this paragraph shall not apply if, on the hearing of the appeal, the appeal commissioners are satisfied that sufficient information has been furnished by or on behalf of the appellant to enable them to determine the appeal at that hearing.  At this stage we accept the wording and intention there, and we are not proceeding with the substitution of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; for &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I come now to two very important matters of substance in relation to the Bill, that is the provision contained in subparagraph (ii) of subsection (d).  I am talking now of lines 17 to 22, inclusive, and lines 47 to 54, inclusive.  Basically both of those provisions as they stand in the Bill impose what we regard as being potentially, if not actually in every case, a very unreasonable condition on the appellant before his appeal can be admitted. As has been stated already, in each case the tax charged by the assessment in respect of which the application is made has been paid together with any interest thereon chargeable under the provisions of section 552.  Then at subparagraph (ii) of subsection (f) we have a similar provision which reads:</P>
    <P>at the time the application is referred to the Appeal Commissioners the tax charged by the assessment in respect of which the application is made, together with any interest thereon chargeable under section 550, has been paid, and ....</P>
    <P>We have a very good, cogent reason for putting down those amendments.  We are at this point dealing with assessments. Those with which we are concerned obviously are not deliberate but occur through no fault of the appellant for one good reason or another &mdash; and there can be a wide variety of such reasons.  But whether deliberate or otherwise, he has not been able to submit the necessary returns.  Before he can proceed to appeal under these provisions, a section is being introduced here requiring him actually to pay the tax charged by the assessment <Col N="2331" />&mdash; that is the first point &mdash; and, in addition, any interest thereon chargeable under the provisions of section 550.</P>
    <P>All of us have experience of assessments. I might say that the Minister, in respect of the kind of people who might be covered &mdash; mainly the self-employed, people engaged in a trade or profession &mdash; indicated in the course of a reply in the House in March last, and confirmed later on the motion on taxation, that the figure of almost £1 billion which emanated from this House and, unfortunately, was misunderstood as being the amount of outstanding tax in respect of the self-employed, was not in fact the amount due.  The Minister went on to explain &mdash; almost two months later &mdash; that the actual amount probably due would be of the order of £80 million to £100 million.  That is the difference between an assessment and the amount actually due in the final analysis, a differential of ten to one.  If that is the case in respect of the reality as known to the Minister, what we are suggesting now is that it is unreasonable.  Quite frankly, it is penal and imposes perhaps an impossible condition on an appellant to meet requirements such as those to actually pay the tax due in either of these clauses &mdash; and they apply in different ways &mdash; plus the interest before his appeal can be admitted.</P>
    <P>Unless the Minister can produce very good reasons for this, I hope he would acknowledge the reasons behind our amendment in this as in the other areas. I do not propose to add anything to what I have said.  The case stands on its merits and no extra argument from me is necessary to support it.  It will be seen that there is not any provision for the repayment of interest, so far as I can see in this or any other section, to the appellant if he is successful. Other sections specifically exclude the repayment of interest to an appellant who has overpaid.  That should be balanced with a requirement in ease of the Revenue Commissioners at this stage.  I should like to hear the Minister on what might be called the consideration for this new provision, because there are always two sides and there <Col N="2332" /> should be a balance of relationship between them.  Even in the case of a very high assessment, which can and obviously has happened in some cases then at least an appellant who may have to continue his business, who may find in may cases that the assessment is of such an amount as to actually place him in extreme financial difficulty, should get the benefit of interest.  I am quite sure the Minister would not want that to be the outcome of an over-assessment which the Revenue Commissioners would have to make.  I am not saying that the Revenue Commissioners or an inspector of taxes would deliberately overassess.  But I am saying that experience has shown that assessments of their nature, as the Miniter's own statements bring out in evidence, are in many cases well above what will be the ultimate liability.</P>
    <P>I want to come now to the final amendment in the series of amendments on our behalf here, amendment No. 25, which reads:</P>
    <P>In page 17, lines 3 to 8, to delete sub-paragraphs (i) and (ii), and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(i) in section 416 (10) after `desires' in line 37, to insert the following words `and establishes to the satisfaction of the Court that a public hearing would be damaging to the appellant in his trade, business or credit,' &rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Sub-paragraphs (i) and (ii) read:</P>
    <P>(i)  in section 416 (10), by the deletion of &ldquo;, and every hearing by the High Court or the Supreme Court of a case stated under section 428 or 430 shall, if the person whose chargeability to tax is the subject of the case stated so desires, be held in camera&rdquo;, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  by the deletion of section 420,</P>
    <P>We want to add to this, after the word &ldquo;desires&rdquo;, because this is of particular importance, the following words: &ldquo;and establishes to the satisfaction of the Court that a public hearing would be damaging to the appellant in his trade, business or <Col N="2333" /> credit,&rdquo;'.  We say that because, first of all, the Circuit Court hearings have always been <i>in camera</i>, for good reason, not just tradition but also because matters of this sort, of their very nature, have been very confidential and have been so treated in the courts.</P>
    <P>This relates to the case stated, which remains.  As the Minister will know, a case stated only applies to the High Court or Supreme Court on a point of law.  It is not an appeal on the facts, it is not an appeal on the merits, it is purely limited to the point of law to be argued before the Supreme Court or the High Court. We feel that because it is a point of law only it should protect particularly the right of the applicant on the case stated to ensure that nothing needs to be disclosed. Because it is dealing with a point of law&mdash;not facts, not merits but simply a point of law &mdash; above all else we must protect the disclosure of anything that could damage the trading, professional or business interest of the applicant, be it a person, partnership or corporation. For that reason the Minister will be conscious of the fact that unnecessary disclosure in a court of law or elsewhere, of the trading position of a person, partnership or company unfortunately can damage the interests of that person, partnership or company.  One thing more than any other that is involved in business is confidence. Sometimes reporting which inevitably has to be a summary of what proceeds in court, can and, in our view, would run the risk of damaging that interest. It is for that reason we feel it would be not only in line with precedent, as in the Circuit Court, but also very much in line with the principles established under the hearing of tax cases in court, that cases stated only on points of law should be held <i>in camera.</i> We believe our amendment would guarantee that, if it could be proved that it would be damaging to trade, business or credit.</P>
    <P>Where the appeals commissioners dismiss the appeal the assessment should be final and conclusive without the right of appeal to the Circuit Court which has been there.  This is why we feel it necessary to put in the safeguards which we <Col N="2334" /> regard as minimal.  We are now entering new territory and the right of appeal to the Circuit Court is being terminated in these circumstances.  I have indicated that there may have been circumstances in which that has been used to delay payment but when we are moving into new territory then the amendments we propose are the very least the Minister should adopt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not support any of the amendments put down by Deputy O'Kennedy because they are entirely aimed at weakening the Bill in relation to tax evasion and avoidance.  The row about the whole question of taxation has developed because there is a clear understanding among PAYE workers that there is a large amount of evasion of tax and persons who avoid tax and owe money to the Revenue Commissioners can make deals quietly, surreptitiously and secretly and the odium of depriving the State of the resources necessary to pay its way does not fall on these people. In a situation where an ordinary citizen faces a court for non-payment of a television licence or road tax, I do not see any good reason why persons who are in business should not be encouraged to pay their way.  We are continually told about providing an incentive for the ordinary person to work, but we must also provide an incentive to people who may be inclined to dodge taxes to pay their way.</P>
      <P>The amendment put forward by Deputy O'Kennedy seeks to weaken that position rather than strengthen it. Amendments Nos. 26 and 27, which we have put down, seek to strengthen this section and to make it less likely that people will try to hoodwink the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a section to which the Minister should give some thought.  It is a little bit strong in some areas.  I do not support in any way people who evade tax or evade their responsibilities but it seems clear that this section has been drafted by people who are not tax practitioners.  I do not imagine that the advice of the Institute of Taxation, not a body of accountants but people <Col N="2335" /> interested in tax, or of the Commission on Taxation has been taken on the detail of the subsection.  Clearly, it has been drafted by one of the two sides involved in any dispute about taxation, that is, the Revenue section.  It has been given the <i>imprimatur</i> of the Department of Finance and the Minister, but I believe it will present more problems than it will cure. I hope that before Report Stage the Minister will take some impartial independent advice because I feel he is being walked into something which may suit the Revenue Commissioners very well but will not contribute positively towards bringing in outstanding revenue.</P>
      <P>The Workers' Party and others may feel they are doing everybody a great favour by supporting the amendment, but it is the small man who will suffer most under this section.  Most people feel that it applies only to Schedule D case 1 and 2 Taxpayers but it will also apply to Schedule E Taxpayers, into which category most salary earners and pensioners fall.  Since I have been involved in taxation, many constituents come to me with problems.  Older constituents are baffled and confused by the simplest of forms. They may fail to declare some small income or fail to return the form and a year or so later they are assessed for tax. The section will create great difficulty for these people who are not in a position to pay tax.</P>

    <P>The existing legislation provides that where, due to absence, sickness or other reasonable cause, a taxpayer was prevented from giving notice of appeal within the time limit of thirty days, he may apply to the inspector of taxes for the admission of a late appeal, and, if the inspector refuses to grant his application, the appellant may require the inspector to refer the application to the Appeal Commissioners.  This provision is being amended to secure that an application made later than twelve months after the date of notice of the assessment, which would otherwise be admissible, will not be admitted unless <Col N="2336" /> the appellant pays the tax charged in the assessment concerned together with accrued interest thereon and submits his return of income and such other information as is necessary to enable the appeal to be determined. </P>
    <P>That is all very well if a person is in business and has a good income but an old person will not be in a position to follow this procedure and appeal in this way and such a person may be assessed to tax which he or she is not liable to pay. In trying to crack the nut the Minister is using a sledge-hammer and it will hurt many people needlessly.  I have no problems with this section in so far as it relates to people who are able to pay but there are many people having very little income who may be badly affected.</P>
    <P>There has been much erroneous talk about arrears of tax.  Certainly there is a very substantial amount of tax outstanding but the original figures for taxes outstanding given in this House were, to anyone who knew anything about tax, incorrect and this caused a wave of concern and understandable anger arising from the necessary fiscal policies.  I wonder why that it information was given in the first place.  I do not believe it was very helpful.</P>
    <P>I wish to express my concern about the use of confidential information by inspectors of taxes for political or organisational purposes.  In other words, I object to the inspector of taxes using information obtained confidentially to make speeches on the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; on television programmes or on radio programmes.  If people like that want to come into politics they can stand for election and make their speeches in this House and communicate the matter to the Minister as Members of this House.  I feel very strongly about this.  I have very strong objection to confidential information being used by people in this way.  It gives rise to questions as to the political impartiality of the people involved and, if it continues to happen, the matter will have to be raised very formally in this House.  It is worth noting on this particular section.  There is a great deal of concern about the matter.</P>

      <P>I should like to support the last point made by Deputy Mitchell and the general tenor of his arguments. We have to be very careful about something that is happening in our society today.  There seems to be an increasing desire on the part of those whose job it is to implement the law to actually make the law.  I find this emanating particularly from Garda Síochána sources.  They are expected to implement the law but now there seems to be an increasing wish on their part to make the law.  I find an increasing desire on the part of civil servants in the Revenue Commissioners in particular, whose job it is to administer the code, to make the code.  If we get into that situation then we cease to be a free democratic society.  We become a totalitarian society, a police State.</P>
      <P>It is important we should all realise in everybody's interest that someone should make the law, namely, this House, and someone else should implement the law so made.  The Minister should note that. The Revenue Commissioners down the years have been above reproach and suspicion in regard to their impartial administration and implementation of the revenue laws which have increased year by year.  There has been that tradition of one group of people making the law and another group at arm's length impartially administering the law.  If we start eroding that principle we are heading for a very different type of society from that in which people today wish to live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am surprised at Deputy De Rossa's attitude to our amendment.  With all respect, I think he is under a misapprehension about this particular section and what our amendments are all about.  This is not only about the slaughter of tax evaders, tax avoiders or anything of that sort.  This deals with the appeal system and it is fundamental to the appeal system of taxation.  We could have a system whereby the Revenue Commissioners would simply decide Citizens A, B, C and D owed so much tax and that is that.  That would not provide any great problem of administration.  But we have a system whereby the Revenue Commissioners try to ascertain what each individual should pay and then there is an appeal system. <Col N="2338" /> I should have thought The Workers' Party would be very much in favour of this system and I want to disabuse their minds of the idea that the appeal system is something used only for the benefit of a number of tax evaders or tax avoiders. The appeal system is there for every taxpayer. It is there for PAYE taxpayers and it is a very important part of the system so far as they are concerned.  Very often the PAYE taxpayer has cause to go through the appeal system and he is entitled to have some such system where his case can be objectively and impartially decided.</P>
    <P>First of all, it has nothing to do with the publication of settlements or fines or anything of that sort.  It is almost exclusively here dealing with the right of the individual taxpayer, whatever category he fits into, to have some system whereby he can have his right decided impartially. The problem has been, of course, that some people have availed of this system to delay the payment of taxation.  I am not sure that anybody can really ultimately avail of the present system to avoid or evade the payment of tax, but people can certainly delay paying tax.</P>
    <P>I want to make the point &mdash; I am quite certain what I am saying is true &mdash; that very often these delays are as much the fault of the Revenue Commissioners as they are of the taxpayer or his advisers and I think any reasonable group of tax consultants, accountants and so on would confirm what I say.  The delay in bringing assessments to a final conclusion through the appeals system is as often as much due to tradiness on the part of the Revenue Commissioners as it is on the other side.  I do not blame the Revenue Commissioners for that because one thing that has always amazed me is how they and their staff have stood up to the enormous accumulation of laws we have piled on to them in recent years.  It is not so long ago that the whole system was a fairly simple one and could be administered in a reasonably leisurely fashion by a relatively small establishment, but in recent years we have just piled on complex laws one after the other on the backs of the Revenue Commissioners, new system after new system of taxation, and <Col N="2339" /> they have had to absorb these very complicated systems and administer them. They have succeeded in doing that and it amazes me how they succeeded in doing it.  So when I say the delay very often in bringing the appeal system to finality is as much due to the Revenue Commissioners as it is to the appellant I am not casting any blame on them.  I attribute it largely to the enormous workload and the complexity of the workload the Revenue Commissioners have to face.</P>
    <P>It is against that background that we, on this side, are asking the Minister to consider very carefully the case we have made.  We must have an appeals system. In the interests of every taxpayer we must have such a system.  The impression has been conveyed that there is a large group of tax evaders and tax avoiders.  In fact we have a kind of identity kit &mdash; the self-employed, the professional men, business people who are constantly evading their responsibilities in this regard. That is not the true picture.  Indeed, it is a slur on a very, very large number of people.  The majority in our community meet their commitments and want to do so.  They do not want to avail of sharp practice or loopholes and we should not deny simple, common, ordinary, natural justice to the vast bulk of taxpayers because a small group evade their responsibility by using the system to avoid their responsibility and that is what we have to address ourselves to here.</P>
    <P>Whatever about the system itself, this whole statutory elaboration of the system is pretty well disastrous because I think very clever and intelligent lawyers will read through this section and not really be very sure what it is doing.  There is a very real obligation therefore on the Minister in everybody's interest to put together a composite statutory provision governing appeals, and not have it as it is now, original sections amended away back, re-amended, re-amended and re-amended, so that we now have what amounts to a code of legislation made up of bits and pieces.  The Minister should undertake that task of consolidating all the provisions governing appeals.</P>
    <P>As to the merits of our different <Col N="2340" /> amendments what we want to ensure by these amendments is that the appeals system is what it purports to be.  If we are not to have an appeals system then abolish it and I think the Minister is getting very, very near abolishing any realistic and meaningful system by what is set out in section 9.  That provision amounts to almost a complete negation of appeals in the real meaning of the word &ldquo;appeal&rdquo;. As far as I can see, the appeal commissioners now will have only an automatic function and I do not think it is necessary in order to get rid of the misuse of the system there is at present, to completely disembowel it in the way that the Minister proposes to do here.</P>
    <P>Our amendments are very reasonable, very responsible and they are an endeavour by us &mdash; and it is not very easy to do it from the outside &mdash; to leave some element of genuine appeal in the system so that the taxpayer will at least have the satisfaction of the knowledge that he has gone through some reasonably just system of appeal even if, in the end, the decision is given against him.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy O'Kennedy, has gone through our proposals one by one and indicated to the House our reasons for them.  We are particularly keen on the idea that the appeals commissioners should be left with that discretion which our amendment, to substitute &ldquo;may&rdquo; for &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in line 33 on page 14, would provide, because if there are to be appeals commissioners at all, if they are to have that name, surely they must be entitled to the capacity to decide or not to decide and not to make it mandatory on them by these provisions to come to only one decision.  If it is mandatory on them to come to only one decision then it is not an appeals system at all.  We, on this side of the House, would be very glad to co-operate fully with the Minister on Report Stage if he can come forward with a revised version of section 9 which would go some way to meeting what I think should be the genuine desire of everybody in this House namely to make sure that the system is not used to defeat the Revenue Commissioners in their legitimate attempt to raise the right amount of tax from every taxpayer and, at the same <Col N="2341" /> time, that every taxpayer is fairly treated, and I am talking here very much in terms of the type of person Deputy Mitchell was talking about, the small person whose tax bill might not be very much in the year but for whom it is just as important that justice should be done as in the case of the large corporation where there is £5 million, £6 million or £20 million at stake.  I would ask The Workers' Party Deputies in particular to advert to that aspect of it.  We are not just dealing with the identikit self-employed tax evader here.  We are dealing with a system which should be available to every taxpayer and very often a taxpayer can have a legitimate case to put whether it is a case of expenses in his trade, travelling allowances or 101 different things.  If we just have an implacable revenue machine grinding on, with no appeal, in effect, then we will do an injustice to many people and I do not think that is what anybody in this House wants.</P>
    <P>The usual tradition is that the executive, in the form of the Minister, comes in here and seeks all sorts of draconian powers for the Revenue Commissioners. In fact, I will go a step further.  The Revenue Commissioners usually come to the Minister and say they want X, Y and Z powers.  The Minister, as a political person, very often exercising his own particular judgment decides that some of them are too draconian and too unfair to the taxpayer and he only brings a certain number of them here.  Then in this House Deputies from all sides are always very vigilant in the interests of the individual taxpayer whereas the Minister presses the case for the extra powers for the Revenue Commissioners.  That is an honourable role that we in this House should discharge.  We should be vigilant here to defend the rights of the individual taxpayer and leave it to the Minister, with all the big battalions he has, to ensure that the revenue case is put effectively to the House and I suppose in the end carried through the House.</P>
    <P>I want again to put to the House and the Minister our case in this regard.  We are not seeking in any way to buttress a system which can be used by unscrupulous people to delay payment of their tax. <Col N="2342" /> We are, on the contrary, trying to ensure that there is a realistic, genuine and fair appeal system available to all taxpayers. For that reason I would appeal to the Minister, even if he does not accept our individual amendments now as they are put to the House, at least to take them in the spirit in which we are putting them forward and see if he can make any concessions to the ordinary taxpayer on the Report Stage because once we pass this law here and it goes into the machine the small individual taxpayer thereafter is a very miniscule and unimportant person when the mills of the Revenue Commissioners start to grind and when, as appears to us, there is no effective appeals system left to him or her.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I was delighted to hear what Deputy Mitchell had to say because much of what he said I wanted to say myself.  The stated purpose of the section is to prevent taxpayers from delaying the collection of their tax by using the appeals system.  What the Minister seems to have overlooked is that the delays are as often on the Revenue Commissioners' side as on the taxpayers' side.  Any of us who have experience of dealing with the Revenue Commissioners can testify to that. There is also the fact that the appeals system itself is grossly overworked. In 1920 there were 100,000 taxpayers and two appeals commissioners.  Now there are more than 1,000,000 taxpayers and only three appeals commissioners.  In the tax year 1973-74 the appeals commissioners had a great deal of extra work to deal with, including inheritance tax, capital gains tax gift tax and some cases of valuation.  Therefore, all the delays are not on the side of the taxpayer, but the whole tenor of this section is to suggest that all the delays are on the side of the taxpayers and that it is the taxpayer who must be dealt with, who must be pushed to eliminate those delays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to clarify one point.  Section 9 provides that in the case of an appeal that has been delayed, when the appellant does not furnish sufficient information to the appeals commissioner to determine the appeal, the commissioner will dismiss the appeal and the <Col N="2343" /> taxpayer will not have a right to have a rehearing in the Circuit Court.  The section goes on to state that the taxpayer will still have a right of appeal to the High Court on a point of law.  Will the Minister say if a person can appeal to the High Court on a point of whether a certain type of information will be allowed in an appeal to the High Court?</P>
    <P>The section contains some draconian provisions when a taxpayer has not submitted an appeal in a certain period due to a mistake or illness.  In that situation the section states that the taxpayer must hand over the entire amount of tax assessed to the Revenue Commissioners, plus interest, until the appeal is determined. I can recall a case in the last 12 months in Limerick city when a person who was working full time in a PAYE job and doing some part time work on a self-employed basis at night was assessed for £20,000 tax.  He had been let down by his accountant, the appeal did not go in in time and the taxpayer eventually brought the point to a head.  Eventually I settled that case with the tax office in Limerick for £250 &mdash; that was the admitted liability.  If this section becomes law that man would have to pay £20,000 in order to have the appeal determined and he would lose the interest on that.  Surely that is draconian.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Mitchell and all other Deputies, I do not condone tax evasion. I appreciate the Minister's position because he has to do certain things.  The Minister has to take certain measures, as do the Revenue Commissioners, to combat tax evasion; but when people have to pay over tax, to part with money which they do not owe, the Minister has crossed the line.  People should not have to pay over enormous sums which they do not owe in order to combat tax evasion.</P>

      <P>On the provision to abolish the hearing of such cases <i>in camera,</i> Deputy Haughey argued cogently about trade secrets possibly being revealed.  I would make another point on that provision. The taxpayer who contests his assessment, however legitimate his case, has his name publicised.  People tend to read headlines and they say &ldquo;Did you see such and such a person's name in the paper &mdash; he was trying to dodge his tax?&rdquo; That would be said regardless of how legitimate the case might be because people tend to read such headlines and to jump to the wrong conclusion.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to tell me the reasoning behind the part of the section which states that when a case has been heard by the appeals commissioners and when the taxpayer requires it to be heard in the Circuit Court the appeals commissioners have to make out a certified form and present it to the Circuit Court.  The right to a rehearing in the Circuit Court appears to me to mean just that: the right to have a case reheard from start to finish. This section presents a busy Circuit Court judge with a statement of the entire hearing before the appeals commissioners.  It might say: &ldquo;This is the way we decided the case&rdquo;.  That must have a prejudicial effect because in many cases the Circuit Court judge will take the view that the appeals commissioners are used to dealing with tax cases and he might ask why he should feel any differently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not casting any aspersions on the appeals commissioners when I say that people tend to put the case in their own words.  When people are asked to write cases in a specified form they tend to justify the conclusions they have reached, however much they might try to guard against that tendency.  I agree with Deputy Mitchell's point about the danger of people acquiring information in their capacity as tax inspectors or as other employees of the tax office and using it for political purposes.  In the last two days it has been brought to my notice that people have gone on the media in the past three months, representing tax officials' union, etc, and have pointed out that there are crocks of gold at the end of <Col N="2345" /> the rainbow and saying that the appeals provisions would have to be tightened up.  They were politically involved, members of a certain political party.  They came across on the media as being totally objective revenue commentators when in fact they are members of a political party and that party are opposing our amendments tonight.  That should be exposed, and I can tell the Minister that I will be exposing it.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to look again at section 9.  His attitude on the earlier sections has been simply to bulldoze all our amendments and all our suggestions out of the way.  There has not been any compromise whatsoever, no consideration for reality.  We are trying to make the Bill work.  We are not supporting tax avoidance or evasion.  I appeal to the Minister to remove some of the more draconian provisions from this section.  As Deputy Haughey has said, there is an appeals system, there is a good reason why it should be there, but we must keep it as a real appeals system.  We do not want the Revenue Commissioners or the appeals commissioners to be the final arbiters of the fate of the Irish taxpayer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to go over the ground covered by previous speakers but I want to ask one question. It refers to a late appeal which is not accepted by the inspector.  The section provides that if the conditions for an appeal are not complied with within 15 days the appellant may require the inspector to refer the application to the appeals commissioners.  The appeals commissioners may allow the application if the tax is assessed and the interest paid. How long will it be before the appeals commissioners will have to look at the appeal?  People who come in with 1981-82 assessments will be caught by this provision. Will they have to wait until the thing goes into the hands of the sheriff before they can make late appeals?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to point out our attitude to this section and to reply to some points made by Deputy Haughey. I agree entirely that an appeals procedure <Col N="2346" /> is very important for PAYE workers as well as others because they are often caught, through neglect or lack of knowledge, owing hundreds of pounds.  I submit that this section does not deal with an appeals procedure for PAYE workers. Their appeals procedure usually consists of shouting through a hatch with a queue around them trying to argue their case. It usually ends up in a shouting match and if they argue loudly enough a supervisor may talk to them and they may get a hearing.  The situation is that the more tax you owe the better reception you will get.  If you owe up to £1,000 you are shouted at through a hatch; if you owe a up to £10,000 you might be brought into a room by a supervisor, and if you owe £100,000 you might even get to see a commissioner and you might be brought in and given coffee, gin and tonics, and what have you.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The procedure is then to try to make a deal.  It is only when the assessments are completed and the appeal has been made through the Revenue Commissioners that one has to go through the courts &mdash; the Circuit Court, the High Court and the Supreme Court. There is very little prospect of any PAYE worker having to go through the courts procedures.</P>
      <P>The amendments put down by Deputy O'Kennedy indicate fairly clearly that he is dealing with a different area when he says in his amendment:</P>
      <P>Provided, however, that if within a period of 28 days of the making of such an order the returns and the statements of profits and gains and schedules, as requested by the inspector, relating to such returns ... </P>
      <P>He is thinking of something other than the PAYE workers.  His amendments are emasculating the purpose of the Bill when he uses &ldquo;may&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;shall&rdquo;. &ldquo;May&rdquo; has no legal meaning.  Another amendment says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;...insert the following words &ldquo;and <Col N="2347" /> establishes to the satisfaction of the Court that a public hearing would be damaging to the appellant in his trade, business or credit,&rdquo;'. </P>
    <P>Any public hearing, whether it be by a public health inspector or the Revenue Commissioners, will damage a person's business, trade or profession.</P>
    <P>This section is intended to deal with those who owe higher amounts of tax than ordinary workers &mdash; at least thousands of pounds &mdash; and it is intended to strengthen the hand of the commissioners against them.  I agree with Deputy Haughey when he says that giving more power to the Revenue Commissioners is not an answer to the problem.  They are not capable of using the powers they have at the moment because of insufficient staff, and the existing systems and bureaucracy tie them up.  This section probably will not have any great effect. I recognise that there are many other things required to give it effect and to enable taxes to be collected.  As far as it is an indication of a commitment, we support the section and oppose the amendment.</P>

      <P>I am not sure if the last speaker was engaging in fantasy when he spoke about entertainment of that kind in the tax office, but this is far too serious an issue to be speaking in those terms. From representations I have made regarding cases with the Revenue Commissioners I have not heard of people having been shouted at through hatches.  On constitutional rights alone, the Minister should take a very hard look at this provision because a very strong case can be made concerning a person's rights within the Constitution, and whether they can be obliged to pay money and interest without a case being proved against them.  If it were proved to be against the Constitution this in itself would not invalidate the entire Finance Bill, but it could erode the credibility of legislation being passed in this House.  In recent years we have seen legislation being challenged and legislation which had not been sufficiently thought out and debated has also been challenged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2348" /> Like the appeals system which has been treasured by the Revenue Commissioners as well as the people who sought sanctuary of appeal, this is an integral part of our democratic process and it is wrong to be tampering with that process, as is happening now.  There are an enormous number of issues at stake. People find it very hard to understand the volume of literature coming from the tax office.  They may have arrived at a stage where, in a free and open economy, they are incapable of managing their affairs without the assistance of accountants, solicitors and so on.  This is a strangulation of a free working economy, getting it tied up continuously.  I am not for one moment casting any doubts on the ability of accountants to assist us in our management of book-keeping affairs, but there are many people who find it impossible to pay accountants' and solicitors' fees to go through this very lengthy and costly system of appeal.  I want the Minister to consider whether he is going against an individual's rights enshrined in the Constitution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla would be surprised at who is drinking gin and tonics these days.  I offer that as an opening remark.  The purpose of section 9 arises from the concept that there is an enormous delay in the appeal system because of everybody using it and that it should be speeded up.  That is the philosophy behind tackling the appeal system, particularly the watering down of the Circuit Court appeal.</P>
      <P>If the reason is delay could the Minister tell us, if he has the information, what percentage of tax cases actually go to the Circuit Court?  That would give us an indication of the size of the problem with which we are dealing.  Does the Minister know if they tend to be large or small cases in general?  To see if this amendment is really necessary, would the Minister tell us the approximate average waiting time in these cases?  That would give us a clear picture as to whether section 9 was needed in the first place.  The Minister's figures may demonstrate, as I think they will, that it was not needed at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No matter how one looks at this attack <Col N="2349" /> on the Circuit Court availability and no matter how one reads this legislation, at the end of the day it denies access to the Circuit Court to a substantial number of people.  That seems to be the intention of the legislation.  We should think long and hard before removing from any group of people the right of access to the Judiciary. As has been mentioned by other speakers, there is a feeling that the Revenue Commissioners get absolutely nothing while this lengthy procedure is going on and that they are very much out of pocket.  The reality is that taxpayers whose cases are under appeal are required to pay to the Revenue Commissioners, on account, 80 per cent of the estimated final tax liability and also interest. The most the Revenue Commissioners can be out of pocket by allowing people to use the Circuit Court is 20 per cent of what will ultimately be due.  If that is the price that must be paid, if the number of cases is not that large and the amounts are not enormous, then it is a small price to pay for retaining for a group of taxpayers the right to go to the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>A previous speaker spoke about the PAYE person having rights in this regard.  I accept, as Deputy Mac Giolla says, that the person on PAYE cannot dash into the Circuit Court and say that he or she is paying too much tax; but many PAYE people have gone to court on the subject of benefit-in-kind and expenses and other areas which are more discretionary.  However, most of the people who will be caught by this section on the right to appeal will not be big business.  Big business will engage big accountancy firms which will ensure that the documentation is presented in time and they will have no difficulty.  The small people will be caught &mdash; shopkeepers and those who own small businesses with a couple of employees and perhaps some second or third cousin trying to put the books together.  That is not far from being a small farmer or a small shopkeeper. These people are certainly worthy of being called workers.  They will be hit by this and it will not help the PAYE person to remove from our Statutes the right of access to the Circuit Court.  That is a dog <Col N="2350" /> in the manger approach.  This right has existed since the middle of the 19th century. If the number of cases is not substantial and the average waiting time is also not substantial, why remove the right to go to the Circuit Court in the first place?  It does not make any sense.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to repeat what has already been said.  The right of appeal should be protected, otherwise the PAYE worker and small businessman will be hit.  What is the alternative? Deputy De Rossa said that among PAYE workers there was a feeling that quite a share of money is due to the Revenue Commissioners by way of tax.  That is a fallacy which has arisen because of unfair assessments by the Revenue Commissioners. These look good on paper but bear no resemblance to the amount actually due.  I urge the Minister to give serious thought to this section as it gives unlimited power to the Revenue Commissioners and will affect the wrong people, especially the small man.</P>
      <P>The Minister should introduce a simplified system of taxation which will appeal across the board.  I agree with Deputy Mitchell in his objection to the statements made by inspectors of taxes on recent radio and television shows. They divulged confidential information which they obtained privately.  In doing so, they must be breaking the code of ethics within the public service and especially within the Revenue Commissioners. Let the taxpayer see that the system of taxation is fair.  It is in that context that I ask the Minister to consider our amendments.</P>

      <P>Having listened to what the Deputies have been saying with close attention, two things have struck me in particular.  One is the obvious concern felt by Deputies in avoiding a situation where ordinary people are put to unnecessary trouble to show that they are paying their due share of taxes, complying with the law and acting in a responsible manner.  I appreciate that point.  That is what we all are worried about.  Of course, we all want to make sure that our laws, whatever their objectives, are applied <Col N="2351" /> and can be applied without undue interference in the ordinary day to day business of the citizen.</P>
      <P>Another point which I have noticed about many Deputies' contributions is the degree of exaggeration about the effects of the provisions of this Bill, and a certain amount of misunderstanding about what the current provisions of the law actually are.  I will develop those points in a moment.</P>
      <P>This section of the Bill is not in any sense a measure aimed at any particular group of taxpayers &mdash; nothing of the kind. It is aimed at simplifying the operation of the law and ensuring that the law will bring about the intended result.  What we have at the moment in some cases is a series of provisions which, as Deputy O'Kennedy mentioned, having been put together in many ways willy-nilly over a long period and in many Finance Bills, has a series of loopholes.  The end result is that the law is not applied and perhaps not entirely capable of application in the manner intended.  As one illustration &mdash; and I will not mention the actual figures because Deputy O'Kennedy has some allergy to these figures &mdash; we can look at the figures set out as being taxes outstanding as at 31 December 1982.  We will take one category of taxpayers, making all the qualifications that are needed to take account of the fact that a large part of this is based on assessments, a very large part of which turn out not to be due.  Of the figures outstanding&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the figures which the Minister is going to give us now include assessments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to give the Deputy any figures.  I am speaking about the amount classified as outstanding on the basis of the assessments that have been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was careful to qualify that.  It is the point that Deputy Mitchell and others as well as myself have been concerned about.  The Minister is about to give figures that are based on assessments in respect of outstanding tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2352" />
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend giving figures but if the Deputy will bear with me for a moment I will illustrate the point.  Of the figure outstanding on the basis of assessment &mdash; and we all know that a large proportion of that would be discharged as not being due &mdash; about 60 per cent was under appeal or inquiry.  About 5 per cent was awaiting demand while about 20 per cent was under demand and about 2½ per cent was being dealt with by the arrears branch of Revenue.  The balance of just over 10 per cent was under enforcement.</P>
      <P>It is part of the difficulty we have that at every one of those stages it is possible to go back to the appeals procedure.  That creates a situation where appeals can be replicated time after time.  First, that renders it extremely difficult to operate the system and, secondly, it creates loopholes for people who are trying to delay payment of their taxes.</P>
      <P>The second illustration I would give is by way of a series of examples based on profiles built up of actual cases.  These are not actual cases but profiles as to the kinds of circumstances that can arise.  In one very straightforward type of case the time span between the making of an estimated assessment and a final adjustment of that assessment was 13 months. Another typical profile arising from the necessity for repeated listings of appeals can produce a time span of 29 months between the time of the estimated assessment and the final adjustment as being the amount actually due.  In a third type of case where the late appeal was admitted with a series of previous appeals, there was a time span of 34 months between the making of the estimated assessment and the final adjustment of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what is the view of Deputies on the other side of the House but I do not regard that kind of situation as one that should continue.  It is certainly not a situation that produces a very effective administration of the system.  In discussions like this there is always a temptation to lay blame but there is never any case of this kind in which the blame rests <Col N="2353" /> only with one side.  Undoubtedly there are cases in which taxpayers deliberately spin out the process.  We all know of such cases.  Equally, there are cases in which the delay is due to the fact that the Revenue Commissioners or the appeals commissioners have a backlog of work so that it requires some time to take the next stage in the process.  There are cases also in which the advisers to taxpayers are not as rapid in their movements as they ought to be.  That produces a situation in which there are delays in dealing with cases but we are dealing in this section with the structure of the appeals system and with drawing up a system that will bring about the more effective implementation of the tax system without &mdash; and I insist on this &mdash; destroying or taking away the appeals system.  I would not contemplate a proposal by which we would rob the appeals system of its reality but what I want to do is to circumscribe the possible use of the appeals system as simply a means for delaying payment of taxes.</P>
    <P>There are some areas in which problems have been adverted to but where problems do not arise.  Deputy Mitchell among others referred to the difficulties that might be experienced by Schedule E payers as a result of the provisions of the Bill.  Normally these taxpayers are not in a situation where assessments are made. The PAYE taxpayers certainly are paying their tax by way of deduction.  Normally, therefore, they are not concerned either with assessments or with appeals. The problem that arises in most cases in relation to this category, particularly in relation to PAYE payers, is establishing that the proper allowances are made and that the proper deductions are made from salary but that is not dealt with normally in the appeals system we are talking of.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not mean that it could not be dealt with in the appeals system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that the normal cases are dealt with quite apart from the appeals system.  The system is designed to allow for this and where an error is made in the estimation of allowances, the <Col N="2354" /> case can be taken up and the adjustments made in the normal course of events.</P>
      <P>The remarks made by Deputy Haughey about the history of our tax system were very much to the point in some respects.  As I have said, we have a system that has developed over a period. I would be prepared to give serious consideration to the Deputy's suggestion that we look at the whole system and study the kind of rationalisation that it might be possible to make in order to render the system more transparent and easier to apply.  In the section we are talking of now we are trying to streamline the appeals system and remove from it some of the defects that we have experienced. The kinds of cases that give rise to most of the abuse of the system are similar to that mentioned by Deputy O'Dea, that is, where there is a certain amount of negligence on the part of accountants, a certain amount of delay on the part of taxpayers and then the operation of the appeals system, all of which produce a combination of circumstances that lead to delay and lead in many cases to a considerable degree of frustration for the taxpayer.  Once they realise what is going on and that they are behind, many people who are then involved in the system, after it has been churning on for a while as it can churn on through the system, begin to feel that the whole thing is becoming a bit ridiculous, and come to a point sooner or later where they begin to put pressure on their advisers or their accountants to get the case settled and out of the way.</P>
      <P>A question was asked about the submission of a report by the appeal commissioners to the Circuit Court.  We are providing that this will be in a prescribed form and will set out the terms of the decisions of the appeal commissioners, not the reasons for their decisions. In that sense they will not be stating a case to the court and, therefore, it will not be prejudicial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to look briefly at the question of the confidentiality of these proceedings. There is an important background point I should like to make before coming to the specific points in the amendments. The hearings of the appeal commissioners <Col N="2355" /> are <i>in camera.</i> They are confidential, as is the case in the Circuit Court. There we are dealing with the amounts involved, with the quantities involved, with the actual business of the person concerned.  The provision we are making here is that cases will be stated to the High Court or the Supreme Court only on a point of law.  In a case concerned only with a point of law, we will not be dealing with the actual amount of tax due.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>No. We will not be dealing with the amount of tax due.  We will be dealing with the interpretation or the meaning of a provision or of a statute to determine whether the circumstance in question was covered by the statute, for example.  It would not be a point of fact to determine how much tax was due by the individual or taxpayer in question, but as to whether tax was properly due on foot of whatever the statute was in relation to that case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Minister, but the amount of tax could depend on a question of law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>First, it has to be determined whether tax is properly due on foot of a particular section or statute. That is the point which will be referred to the High Court, not the amount due.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make the point to Deputy O'Kennedy that that is just the kind of case that is of particular interest to the general public, to tax practitioners, to people in business and to taxpayers in general, because normally it would produce a new definition on some point on the basis of which people would then act in terms of organising their tax affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I oppose the amendments put forward because their effect would be to draw back in every case from the provisions I have in the Bill.  The provisions in the Bill <Col N="2356" /> are put there because the Government consider they are a reasonable way to reorganise our appeals system, taking account of the necessity to protect the rights of the taxpayer to reasonable appeal, and taking account also of the necessity to ensure that our tax system works in a reasonably efficient manner.</P>
    <P>I want to describe the effects of the provisions we have in this section.  Where an appeal is lodged, given the terms of this section, and a point has been reached where a further adjournment of the appeal is not allowed by the appeal commissioners &mdash; and this would not happen before a period of nine months after either the date of the making of assessment, or the end of the year of assessment to which the tax appeal relates, whichever is the sooner &mdash; and the appellant has still not furnished a return of his income and other information necessary to enable the appeal to be determined, the appeal commissioners would dismiss the appeal.  In such cases the appellant would have no right to a rehearing in the Circuit Court, but would have the right on a point of law to go to the High Court.</P>
    <P>We have there a series of conditions which would mean that the right of the person concerned to the appeal would be safeguarded, and would become inapplicable only because the taxpayer in question did not provide the information within a reasonable period of time after the making of the assessment, or after the end of the tax year to which the assessment related.  One of Deputy O'Kennedy's amendments asks me to substitute &ldquo;later&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;sooner&rdquo; in the case of the timing.  The effect of that would be to go back nearer to a situation where substantial delays could occur before we would get to the point where an appeal would be determined.</P>
    <P>Existing law provides that where, owing to absence, sickness, or other reasonable cause, an individual was prevented from giving notice of appeal within the time limit of 30 days, he can apply to the tax inspector for the admission of a late appeal.  If the inspector is not satisfied that the application should be granted, the applicant can request the inspector to refer his application to an <Col N="2357" /> appeal commissioner.  This provision is being amended to provide that an application made later than 12 months after the date of the notice of assessment, an application which would otherwise be admissible, will not now be admissible unless at the time of the application the applicant has paid the tax charged by the relevant assessment, together with any interest due thereon, and has submitted a return of income and the other information required in order to enable the appeal to be determined.</P>
    <P>These conditions would arise only where the taxpayer or the applicant had not furnished the information required in order to allow the appeal to be determined. It can reasonably be said that this would be a case where the taxpayer, or his adviser, or his accountant, had not taken the kind of steps normal care and prudence would dictate that he should take in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>I already mentioned the reason why I am proposing that hearings in the High Court should not be held <i>in camera</i>&mdash; because they are on points of law.  I have already mentioned that, on a rehearing in the Circuit Court, there would be, under this section, provision for making available to the Circuit Court judge the terms of the determination of the appeal commissioners but not the reasons therefor to ensure, amongst other things, that the Circuit Court Judge had the kind of information that was useful and not prejudicial to his hearing of the case.  In this connection Deputy Séamus Brennan asked what proportion of cases went to the Circuit Court and what was the average waiting time in relation to an appeal. Quickly, I cannot give a proportion of the cases but it would appear that there could be up to 50,000 cases on Circuit Court appeal during the course of this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's admiration for the capacity of the courts.  But the Deputy knows as well as I do that one does not have to go very far to find substantial numbers of appeals coming before a Circuit Court in the course of a morning and being discharged fairly rapidly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have to have notice of that question but we can get that information for the Deputy.  The point I am coming to is that we do have a substantial number of appeals going to the Circuit Court, and a substantial number of appeals arising at every point in the whole system which means that it gets quite clogged up and leads to the large amounts of assessments apparently outstanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Colley has really got to the nub of it.  Perhaps the Minister, later on, could give for the latest year for which information is available how many cases were actually heard on appeal in the Circuit Court, last year and <Col N="2359" /> the previous year, which would be more relevant and when we would get a better picture.  I presume that information would be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I can get that information for the Deputy but it does not take away from the fact that we do have a very substantial number of appeal cases both before the appeal commissioners and in the Circuit Court, many of them representing cases where there are long delays between the first assessment for tax and a final determination of the amount of tax due.</P>
      <P>For those reasons generally I oppose these amendments.  The changes that this section would bring about in the system will speed up the appeals process while retaining the essential right of the taxpayer to an appeal.  I might make the point that we are asking the taxpayer to co-operate in speeding up this process because the appeals system will continue to operate on the basis that the taxpayer himself provided information that was required in order to enable an appeal to be determined.  That is a perfectly reasonable request to make of a taxpayer.  After all, there are two parties involved who need to be satisfied.  One is the taxpayer himself who, like the rest of us, does not want to pay any more tax than he is liable for.  On the other hand, we have the Revenue Commissioners who want to collect the amount of tax that is due on foot of the existing provisions.  Therefore, there is an effort to be made on both sides.  That is what is built into this section.  If safeguards the continued right of the taxpayer to make appeals, in reasonable conditions, on the condition that he provides the kind of information necessary in order to enable an appeal to be determined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure if there are other specific questions I have skipped over in replying. A question was raised as to what is the delay between an application for a late appeal and a decision on whether or not to allow it.  In the normal case the appeal commissioners would give a decision fairly quickly, within a matter of days or, at most, weeks.  It is not the kind of <Col N="2360" /> decision requiring a prolonged delay on the part of the appeal commissioners to make up their minds whether or not a late appeal would be granted.</P>
    <P>The final point I might make on this is that, in putting forward this section of the Bill, it has been my concern to ensure that our tax system can work more effectively and safeguard the right of appeal of the taxpayer.  A concern with making the system work more effectively is something which is not dictated only by a consideration of how much we will collect, or a consideration of the desirability of collecting the total amount that should be collected. There is also an advantage for the taxpayer in having clarity in the system, in having the procedures he may use clearly set out, in having the requirements that he must fulfil in order to use those procedures clearly set out also. There are quite a number of Deputies here who get involved in one way or another with the tax collection procedures, not personally directly, but in a different capacity.  They would all agree, I think, that in the operation of the system the tax inspectors and indeed the appeal commissioners, on the whole, display a degree of contact with reality we would always expect an administration to show.  It is not always the case &mdash; and perhaps this is part of our problem &mdash; that they would stick rigidly to the requirements of the system, as laid down in statutes, in deciding whether or not an appeal would be accepted and when it would be heard.  That is not the case and neither do I think it would always be the case in the future.  Our system is administered with a degree of humanity which of course gives rise to cases where people feel rather hard done by because humanity has its good sides and more difficult sides.  I know Deputy Mac Giolla has one particular kind of circumstances in mind when he said that the opposite applies also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should let us know where the gin and tonic facilities are to be found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say I have never myself come across a case of a taxpayer <Col N="2361" /> being greeted with a gin and tonic by his tax inspector or by a Revenue Commissioner in the hearing of his case.</P>
      <P>For those reasons I oppose the amendments put forward and commend the section to the House.  I should conclude by saying that that, of course, is not the absolute end of the matter.  As I said earlier, in response to something said by Deputy Haughey, we do need constantly to look at the operation of our system.  I would not think that any Finance Bill in any given year would necessarily represent the final word on the system itself, or on any part of it.  Indeed I referred to some other concerns of mine in that connection yesterday.  I think they would apply just as much to the appeals procedure as to the rules on the basis of which we calculate the amount of tax actually due.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>While it may be true that any particular Finance Bill is not the end of the line, that perhaps each succeeding Finance Bill introduces new amendments to existing legislation, if this section is enacted in this form it will lay a base for something entirely new and entirely different from anything we know already and it may not be possible for some time to repair the damage that may be done as a consequence.  That is why we must spend so much time on it now.</P>
      <P>The Minister felt he had dealt with most of the points raised and since so many points were raised on various issues it is perhaps understandable that he may have forgotten some of them.  I would refer him to the points covered in our amendments and to two points on which I would lay great stress which the figures given in his reply support rather than reject.  The appellant is being required to pay the amount of the assessment plus interest before consideration can be given to the appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I made that point at some length.  It has been reinforced by the practical example given by Deputy O'Dea and by the very information given by the Minister as to the difference <Col N="2362" /> between the amount assessed and the amount due, a factor of a fraction of one-tenth of the amount assessed being actually due.  Does the Minister think it is reasonable to insist on maintaining the provisions being introduced without taking account of that obvious inequity?  He did not deal with it in his reply.  It is a point which is underlined by the figures the Minister gave.  He has given us a breakdown of the position as of the 31 December 1982 and of what is called &ldquo;outstanding tax&rdquo; which is what gave rise to the original fire and fury&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not matter which category.  Even though I have made the point myself so often, I have never heard it so well expressed as by Deputy Mitchell and henceforth I hope the Minister will not confine his criticism to me.  He said that the information given by the Minister was incorrect, although not deliberately so, and was the main cause of the whip-up of protest outside this House regarding the amounts outstanding.</P>
      <P>The Minister has told us that on 31 December 1982 of the amount outstanding 60 per cent was under appeal, 5 per cent awaiting demand, for which the appellant is not to blame, 20 per cent was under demand and 2.5 per cent was arrears.  Of all the amount outstanding only 10 per cent is under enforcement and would not be open to appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It can still be open to appeal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole of the amount outstanding notionally could be under appeal.  That strengthens my case, certainly in respect of the 90 per cent either under demand, awaiting demand, under appeal or even after an appeal under enforcement.  In the light of all that, the Minister is still adamant in his insistence that before the right to appeal in the circumstances envisaged here is granted we will have to have payment of the full amount of the assessment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I said in the circumstances envisaged here.  We are talking about late appeals; that is accepted. There would be payment of the full amount of the assessment plus the interest due since the assessment date.  Does the Minister really think that is just, fair and equitable?  Do The Workers' Party think it is just, fair and equitable?  If so, let them be heard.  Once the assessment is made by the commissioner or the inspector and there is a late appeal the State can do no wrong and the assessment must be paid in full plus interest.  Let it be known that is what The Workers' Party stand for, although they appear to be supporting the rights of the individual against the State.  All the talk about gins and tonics for the wealthy will not help this debate.  It is the old <i>argumentum ad hominem</i>, the pleading to emotion, which does not do much to support the case of The Workers' Party.</P>
      <P>If it is sauce for the goose, why not sauce for the gander?  If it appears at the end of the day that there was an over-assessment and that the appellant had been required to pay much more than is finally determined to be due, plus interest, is there any reason why this should not apply equally on the other side of the scale?  Is there any reason why the Revenue Commissioners who have had the use of the money should not be required to repay the interest?  Would the Minister like to explain the principle in equity which justifies that?  Is it that equity only favours the Establishment, the big as against the small?  Are those fundamental facts to be ignored in what the Minister would like to pretend is another important stage in dealing with evasion?  Of course we are as concerned as anyone to deal with evasion.</P>

    <P>Those points cannot be ignored and perhaps this section is the one on which we will best discharge our responsibilities. We can argue afterwards about the 1 per cent levy and make cases on a whole range of topics but we are dealing here with a very fundamental matter.  I acknowledge that we are talking about late appeals but I would like to hear why <Col N="2364" /> the penalty applies one way and not the other.  Those are two fundamental elements in the case we made on our amendments and the Minister ignored them in his reply.  I had presumed that something as fundamental as this would have been brought to the attention of the Minister much earlier.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley asked a very pertinent question in relation to the number of appeals.  When we are dealing with this vexed question of late appeals and rights of appeal to the Circuit Court, I protest that the Minister has not obtained from his advisers the precise number of Circuit Court appeals in the latest year for which information is available.  Whether it was last year or the year before it would be very relevant to this debate to have that figure.  I cannot imagine how the advisers, with all the facilities available to them, do not know.  Whether they thought of giving it to the Minister before this point, they must know.  If they do not know they should know how many appeals there were to the Circuit Court in 1982 or 1981 or whatever it was.</P>

      <P>I am saying that his advisers will have it available to them and the Minister should have insisted on having <Col N="2365" /> the information.  It is not enough tomorrow morning when we have gone on to another section to find that we did have a certain number of appeals.  As one who practised in the Circuit Court the figure that the Minister gave here this evening really knocked me over.  I attended the Circuit Court for years on end and I saw the way these appeals were dealt with <i>in camera</i> and I know they were dealt with on the morning of the Circuit Court.  The productivity ratio of a Circuit Court judge is higher than anything I or my colleagues ever appreciated, if there were anything up to 60,000 of them under appeal at a particular time.  A figure like that trotted out here does nothing to deal with the reality we are trying to cope with.  I insist that the Minister should get the precise figures so that we know where we stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister makes the point that we are just dealing with points of law.  The Minister will have heard of what are called mixed points of law or points of law in fact.  They do not always distinguish themselves as conveniently as that in terms of a nice cosy little argument before the High Court or the Supreme Court purely on facts because it must relate in many cases to the fact that the assessment, whether that assessment and the amount of it could possibly arise under this or that section, will be necessary in some cases.  It would tie the hands of the High Court and the Supreme Court completely if you were to tell them: &ldquo;You are only engaged here in telling us what is the meaning of that section of that Act&rdquo;.  It would be a nice academic dissertation but the Supreme Court and the High Court do not work that way.  They are there to vindicate the right of the citizen or to establish the right between citizens and the establishment, and they will not, properly, allow themselves to be blindfolded by saying: &ldquo;In those circumstances can we have information on the facts, not on the merits of the case as to whether or not the appeals commissioner dealt with the amount correctly?&rdquo;.  In many cases they will want to know roughly the amounts involved, they will need to know at least the nature of the business involved and they will need to <Col N="2366" /> know why it is under that business it is claimed that certain liabilities arise.  In the course of that, matters could emerge that could be damaging or prejudicial to the trading or professional interest of the appellant.  The Minister is proposing to delete that provision from cases stated in the High Court where it does exist with appeal commissioners.  The Circuit Court has it for a very good reason but when it comes to the High Court and the Supreme Court the Minister is going to tell them that this will be held openly.</P>
    <P>The Minister has perhaps made one point in support of his case and that is that of course there will be a lively interest in the judgments of these cases as they affect other cases.  He must know that many cases heard <i>in camera</i> are reported in the law reports without giving the names of the people concerned.  They are there for all the experts to consult.  The case that the Minister makes that hearing it <i>in camera</i> would mean that it could not be reported for the professional people who would be involved and interested falls because the precedent is there to demonstrate that you can have hearings <i>in camera</i> and still have them recorded.</P>
    <P>We ask the Minister in relation to the appeals commissioners at least to allow them discretion in determining whether or not they should dismiss the appeal.  He did not reply to that.  The provisions here make it mandatory that they shall make an order dismissing the appeal.  If they are people of high standing and qualification why is the Minister tying their hands?  We are not asking too much considering that appeals commissioners are people of experience and qualifications. I do not know how many Circuit Court judges there are &mdash; perhaps 12 &mdash; and we have three appeals commissioners.  This will increase the load on them.  We will certainly need more appeals commissioners. Otherwise the whole system will clog up.  The Circuit Court judges will be greatly impressed by the figure given in respect of them this evening.  I am sure they will return to the Minister by the back door looking for an increase in their allowances or their salaries as a consequence of this burden of work and it is only a small element of their total work. <Col N="2367" /> We will need more than three appeals commissioners and we will need to ensure that they will be people of the kind of standing, experience, qualifications and judgement that will fit them fully for this office.  Judges have that and have such a role in our Constitution that we have a right here in certain circumstances to deal with judges if certain circumstances arise. We will need more appeals commissioners and also to ensure that they will be sufficiently experienced, qualified and balanced in their judgment to deal with the cases that come before them.</P>
    <P>I should like to support Deputy Mitchell in what he said about the tendency that has arisen for representatives of unions in the public service, particularly in this area, to go public with the implication that they have knowledge that no one else has.  I doubt that they do have that knowledge.  Some of those who go public would probably not be allowed within the structure of the revenue commissioners to have access to that level of knowledge.  In many cases the people who are ready to go public are at a lower level of authority within the structure than inspector of taxes who would probably have that knowledge.  Because they represent unions within the public service they can disclose things for what can be acknowledged to be political reasons, sometimes to create a certain amount of confusion in respect of Members of this House or for party political reasons.  Perhaps things have changed a lot since I was Minister for Finance.  It happened then, too, and the person engaged in that type of publication was brought into the office and spent two-and-a-half hours with me there.  That is a precedent I could bring to the Minister's attention.  As a consequence of that discussion, much of what he had been saying publicly could not be supported by hard evidence and he was warned that he would have to be careful in future when he took that role on himself.</P>
    <P>I have heard many arguments from all sides of the House, on this section in particular, and I have a fear that this Minister is creating a unique distinction. He will probably be the first Minister who <Col N="2368" /> will go out with a Bill exactly as he came in, apart from his own amendments.  I have heard many reasonable arguments but it seems that the Minister, on the basis of the advice given to him, will plough only one furrow and he will stay in that furrow no matter what is argued here, though at least three amendments in my name &mdash; that dealing with discretion, the one dealing with assessment plus interest and the alternative obligation on the Revenue Commissioners to do the same, and the amendment dealing with appeals <i>in camera</i>&mdash; would not have stretched the Minister's discretion if he had accepted them.  It seems that we must go through the process of making our arguments in the knowledge that we will not convince the Minister of anything.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add briefly to what I said earlier.  I accept the basic thrust of what the Minister is trying to do but I think the legislation is a bit onesided. I have reservations because the consumer, the taxpayer, has had no input whatsoever.  It does not mean that there will be additional tax cases for the Circuit Court.  It will mean that there will be fewer, because the procedure will become much more autocratic with people being asked to pay bills whether they owe them or not, and in many cases they will not be able to afford to appeal.</P>
      <P>I want to make a few general comments. Deputy Mac Giolla said that there are too few in the tax office.  My belief is that there are too many.  One can ask any worker who has occasion to visit the tax office and he will confirm that.  As somebody who represents a big PAYE constituency, I do not agree that my people do not consider there are too many people in the tax office.  In any given year taxpayers can get balancing statements, P45s and perhaps amended P45s, perhaps two P60s if they happen to have pensions, assesment forms, appeal forms, tax free allowance forms.  Part A and Part B, forms 11 and 12.  There are a dozen forms that a person can get, but old age pensioners get the most.  I know because I deal with many of them in my clinics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister the number of people in the Schedule B <Col N="2369" /> category, mainly PAYE people, involved in tax appeals.  I suspect that there are particularly a large number of retired people who unknown to themselves may have income under Schedule D, Cases 3 and 5.  Perhaps a lady has a pension and a part-time job as a cleaner.  Perhaps because she is a widow she has a lodger, a nurse, staying with her.  It often happens in my constituency when people live near hospitals.  She thinks that because she is liable for PAYE that she has no other tax liabilities.  I wonder what will happen to such people when they are presented with assessments which are incorrect but which they will have to pay.</P>
    <P>There are quite a number of people who will be caught by this appeal procedure. I accept that people have been using the system to their own advantage and that steps had to be taken to improve the situation, but I believe we should be careful with this.  It is not in the public interest that people with small incomes who have not got the wherewithal should be caught in this position.  They are people who cannot afford tax avoidance. Perhaps the Minister would consider an amendment on Report Stage putting a ceiling on the amounts that would be in this machinery.  Perhaps certain amounts could be left outside the machinery, particularly involving people who would be liable for PAYE on their main income. They should not be liable to be caught in a trap they could not get out of.</P>
    <P>This is called the Committee Stage, but I think it is a pity it is not being dealt with by some form of committee.  Though ideologically there might be a big difference between Deputy Mac Giolla and me, I know from working at local authority level that when we were in committees we were able to send for reports.  We should be able to do that, particularly on this section of the Bill.  In that situation I think Deputy Mac Giolla and I would be able to satisfy ourselves about some of the problems that exist.  If we are able to tease out the pros and cons in a genuine way, send away for a report and have the information before making decisions, we could come to an agreeable decision on this section.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2370" /> Perhaps there are some unnecessary fears, but I am afraid there will be a lot of hardship for people with small incomes purely to facilitate a Revenue service which is inadequate and archaic in its administration and bureaucratic in its approach to taxpayers.  Perhaps it is time we looked at the way assessments are made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with only two points.  We have been eight hours on section 9 and the two previous sections, none of which deals with the main problems attached to this Bill. Deputy O'Kennedy dealt with the dictatorial methods of dealing with people's assessments and of assessing people for money that may not be due.  He said that that is totally undemocratic and dictatorial. He is out of touch with what happens to the PAYE taxpayer.  If he does not fill in a form or fills it in incorrectly a penal tax is imposed and the money is deducted from his wages.  There is no question whether the money is due or if he is going to appeal&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>He has the right of appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the penal tax is imposed and the money is taken from his pay packet.  After filling in the necessary forms or going through the appeals, after six or eight months the overpayment is refunded but he does not get any interest. If it is found that these people have overpaid, the money is refunded plus interest at 1½ per cent per month.  I have heard of two cases where business people overpaid their tax last year because it was the best investment available.  The PAYE taxpayer has no say in this whatsoever.  If this system which Deputy O'Kennedy objects to is dictatorial, how much more dictatorial and undemocratic is the deduction of taxes from a person's wages before he gets it into his hand?  There is no comparison between the tax paying and tax deduction systems and this system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is endeavouring to get a tighter grip on the appeals system.  This <Col N="2371" /> is where I want to get the truth in this House because this matter has been tossed around this House for the last four or five weeks.  In reply to a question by Deputy De Rossa and Deputy R. Bruton, the Minister gave detailed information, which is available in tabular form in the Official Report, from which it appears that while there was approximately £1,500 million estimated to be outstanding, when appeals were taken into account there was still £500 million due. Deputy R. Bruton and I mentioned this in this House.  A few weeks later there were demonstrations in Dublin which, Deputies said, were the result of this information given by the Minister. Deputy O'Kennedy said on a number of occasions that the Minister was responsible for giving this information which inflamed people to march.  Then there was a debate in this House on the tax system and the Minister spent most of his speech playing down this information about this crock of gold.  He said it did not really exist and that only £80 million or £90 million was properly due.  That figure is still being tossed around by Fianna Fáil Deputies.</P>
    <P>I want the exact truth from the Minister. This is the time to give this information but the Minister refuses to give a figure.  He gives percentages but nobody can understand them.  He gave a percentage of 60 per cent under appeal. Does that mean under appeal through the courts?  He said there were 5 per cent awaiting demand.  What does &ldquo;demand&rdquo; mean?  The next figure is 20 per cent under demand.  Is that 20 per cent under demand before appeal or under demand after appeal?  Has that 20 per cent already gone through an appeals procedure and payment is now being demanded?  Is the next 10 per cent the number of those who have gone through this demand, still refuse to pay and are now under enforcement? If my interpretation is true it means 32½ per cent, one-third, have gone through an appeal and are either under enforcement, which means court summonses, sheriff's orders or whatever, and 20 per cent under demand but not yet under enforcement.  If the figure of the <Col N="2372" /> total estimated amount outstanding is £1,500 million &mdash; and I ask the Minister to confirm it &mdash; then one-third would be £500 million and the Minister's reply of six weeks ago is confirmed.</P>
    <P>If Deputy O'Kennedy's interpretation of the figure is correct, how did the Minister give such false information six weeks ago?  Deputy O'Kennedy's interpretation says that 10 per cent is under enforcement and the remainder is either under appeal or about to go under appeal.  The Minister says that even that 10 per cent under enforcement could still be appealed. Where do we stand?  Will we ever hear the truth?  We must learn the truth.  The Minister can tell us tonight exactly what the position is.  How much does he estimate is outstanding?  Is it £1,500 million? How much of that has gone through the appeals system?  How much of that money have people been asked to pay and refused?  Are they being brought to court?  In other words, what is the total amount actually due but cannot be collected?</P>
    <P>We have discussed the section on appeals and court procedures since 3.30 p.m. today &mdash; we discussed the tax bands for about one hour &mdash; and it is now after 11 p.m.  Even after those eight hours we still do not have that vital information which everybody is looking for.  What is the truth?  Where is the truth?  If the figure is only 10 per cent, where did the £500 million figure come from?  Could the Minister explain precisely what &ldquo;under demand&rdquo;, &ldquo;under enforcement&rdquo; and &ldquo;awaiting demand&rdquo; mean?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy raised the question of the difference between amounts assessed and amounts due in connection with the requirement of the section where a late appeal was to be accepted and the assessment would have to be paid before the appeal would be admitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of reasons why there would be a considerable difference between the amount of tax assessed and the amount actually due.  This is part of the wider problem to which Deputy Mac Giolla has just been referring.  This difference arises because the tax inspector <Col N="2373" /> does not know a great deal about the taxpayer in question.  The difference can be caused by a substantial change in the income position of that taxpayer since the last tax year &mdash; for example, because that taxpayer has had either a substantial increase or a substantial reduction in his or her income.  Each of those circumstances gives rise to a particular difference one way or the other in assessing a person for tax.  This is much more a difficulty in relation to the self-employed who fall to be assessed in that manner than in the case of the regular PAYE payer.  That is one of the reasons it is important, in order to operate the system effectively, that taxpayers should as far as possible produce the kind of information about which we are talking in this section.  It is in the interests of the taxpayer himself or herself and of revenue collection that that information should be produced.  That is one of the reasons this section is written in the particular way in which it is.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy raised the question of interest on overpayment of tax.  It is provided in this section that an overpayment of tax revealed on the determination of an appeal would be refunded together with any interest included in the overpayment.  However, it is provided that interest would not be payable in respect of the period between payment of the tax and the repayment of the overpayment. That is a reasonable approach. The interest paid by the taxpayer in that case is the amount of interest due on the amount of tax for which he or she was assessed.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy also raised the question of the number of appeals to the Circuit Court.  As I said earlier, I have undertaken to provide him soon with the maximum possible information.  I must make the point, however, that there is no system of central recording of appeals in the Circuit Court.  Also, it is not necessarily the case that every appeal to the court is heard by a judge in that court. The fact that the appeal is made is in itself a cause of delay in the tax collection system and a number of cases are settled at the point when the appeal is listed for hearing or gets to the court.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also made a point, which <Col N="2374" /> was adverted to earlier on, about statements made in the media recently by an officer of the Revenue Commissioners. That matter has been taken up in the appropriate quarter and I am not in a position at the moment to say anything more on it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell made one point which struck me particularly, and all of us in this House would have a great deal of sympathy on this point.  He spoke about the number of forms which have to be filled in and the different types of forms which a taxpayer may receive during the year.  It is one thing to speak about the number of forms and quite another to look at the reasons for the issue of those forms.  It is interesting to note that a number of forms to which he referred need not be filled in by the taxpayer, but provide information to the taxpayer as to what his or her tax position is or has been in the year immediately preceding. Nevertheless, they are forms which are made necessary by the operation of our system.  I said earlier on, and Deputy Haughey referred to the same point, that we have built up an accretion of pieces in our tax system, some of which give rise to forms and some of which give rise to the need for more forms.  We need to examine that position.  It is a wider question than the section with which we are dealing at the moment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell also adverted to those who are being asked to pay tax bills whether they are owed or not.  This is not exactly the position.  There are people in various professions who are assessed for tax and numbers are assessed for tax which turns out not to be due.  There are various reasons for that, some of which I have explained.  People in that situation then have the means of showing to what extent their assessment is exaggerated and of giving evidence to support their contention that they do not owe so much tax.  Again, the procedure which we have set up in this section preserves the availability to that taxpayer to show that.  In addition, it asks the taxpayer to do it within a reasonable length of time and in a fairly complete form.  It is in the interests of the taxpayer and the revenue <Col N="2375" /> collection system that this information should be made available.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy raised the question, under his amendment No. 20, of making the power of the appeal commissioners to dismiss an appeal against them discretionary rather than mandatory in the circumstances with which we are dealing in this section.  The particular part of the section in question provides that where no application for an adjournment is made by an appellant before or during the appeal hearing or where such application is made and refused by the appeals commissioners and the applicant has not completed his return of income and furnished the other documentation necessary to enable the appeal to be determined, the commissioners shall dismiss the appeal.</P>
    <P>A close reading of the text will show that a number of safeguards are built into this system.  There are two conditions that must be fulfilled before the appeals commissioners would be obliged by this section to dismiss the appeal.  The first is that no application for an adjournment of the appeal should have been made or if such an application has been made that it was refused.  Invariably a refusal in these circumstances would have been preceded by a number of adjournments of the appeal.</P>
    <P>It is provided also that an application for an adjournment may not be refused before nine months have elapsed either from the date of the assessment or from the end of the year of the assessment, whichever is the earlier.  In normal circumstances this would give the taxpayer enough time to submit a return of income and the required evidence in support of his appeal.  All of that comes under the first condition.  The second condition that would be satisfied before it would become mandatory for the appeals commissioners to dismiss would be that the return of income for the relevant year of assessment had not been submitted or if it had been submitted that the necessary statement of profits and gains and other evidence relating to the return had not been submitted by the applicant.  It is only where these two conditions are fulfilled <Col N="2376" /> that it would become obligatory for the appeals commissioners to make an order dismissing the appeal.</P>
    <P>These provisions do not take away from the appeals commissioners their discretion in relation to the granting of an adjournment or of a number of adjournments before they reach the point where the appeal would be dismissed.  Therefore, taking all these matters into consideration, there are a number of safeguards retained in the system before the point would be reached where the appeal would be dismissed, before we reached the point where we restrict the further operation of the appeals system.  Those are all safeguards which allow the taxpayer the opportunity of making his case, of showing his situation within a reasonable time.  It is for that reason that I would keep to the provisions as set out in the Bill as a means of tightening up the appeals procedure to the point where, without damaging the right of the taxpayer to appeal, we would avoid the kind of replication of appeals and adjournments that now cause so many delays in the operation of the system.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla raised again the subject matter of questions that have been dealt with in the House.  They are somewhat outside the scope of the section but I would make the point that some of the questions he raised cannot be answered finally until we have received tax from the taxpayers in question because, as I said when I adverted first to that information, at all of the stages I mentioned &mdash; the appeal or inquiry stage, the stage of awaiting <Col N="2377" /> demand where an appeal has been determined and so on &mdash; appeals are possible. Therefore, it is not until a cheque has been paid over to the Revenue Commissioners that it becomes possible to say with any precision how much of any assessment is due and payable.  That is an area of imposition that arises directly from some of the characteristics of the system and which we are attempting to deal with in proposing this section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is in the nature of a hypothetical question because in most cases the assessments would be made during the year of assessment.  The second point is that in a case like that the taxpayer has 30 days in which to appeal the assessment, 30 days in which to say whether he disagrees with the assessment.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section in which the Minister proposes to reduce the mortgage allowance from the existing figure in respect of a married couple of £4,800 to £4,000.  I will be very brief on this because the points we would make have been made on many of the other sections.  We must take account of the obligations faced by young married couples in the early years of marriage. The Minister for the Environment is here and he will be very conscious of another aspect, that is, the incentive to the building industry.  This Government say they are determined to encourage and promote the building industry but this change will have the opposite effect.  We want to encourage young married couples not to be a burden on the State in terms of the overloaded local authority housing lists but to provide their own housing.</P>
      <P>The existing provision of £4,800 mortgage interest relief would cover a mortgage of about £32,000.  Much has been said about the high cost of housing in our cities and towns and anyone purchasing a house costing £32,000 will not be living in palatial splendour.  The Minister proposes to reduce the figure to £4,000. which represents the interest payable on the purchase of a house worth about £26,000 and one would travel a long way to find accommodation at that price suitable for a married couple with a young family.  The Minister's action is niggardly and in many ways anti-social and it is certainly anti-employment.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment is here and he is also concerned about the building industry, at least in his public statements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <P>It is quite clear that despite all those protestations of interest in the building industry and despite their concern for young married couples and for employment this provision will ensure a move in the wrong direction.  From the point of view of the Government words are more important than actions but the contrary is our view.  We cannot understand why in this climate the Minister proposes to reduce rather than increase the mortgage interest allowance against tax.  No doubt the Minister in this as in everything else has one answer &mdash; that decisions of this kind must be taken to <Col N="2385" /> ensure that tax revenue is on target.  We have indicated already that he will have an excess in some areas.</P>

      <P>The provisions of this Bill give effect to the measures announced in the budget statement on 9 February last. Those provisions were drawn up after careful consideration, although as I have said on a number of occasions I would have wished for a greater amount of time to consider those matters.  Nevertheless they were drawn up after the most careful possible consideration and they represent what the Government believe to be the appropriate and most feasible mix of policies to respond to the situation in which we find ourselves.  I will not expound on that situation or how we got there because Deputy O'Kennedy seems to be rather sensitive on that point and I would not like to run the risk of being ruled out of order because it is one subject on which I can get rather carried away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy O'Kennedy forms his opinions as he seems to do much of the time simply on what he reads in the newspapers, I do not think he can expect to be taken too seriously when he voices those opinions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I yield a bit to the weakness because the reaction is good from the other side.  Deputy O'Kennedy is not doing any great favour to himself or the building industry when he makes the point about the building industry in the <Col N="2386" /> way he has just made it.  I do not know whether he really believes it or not but he appears to join that group of people who seem to believe that if we get the building industry right the economy will be right, whereas in fact the causation is the other way around.  When the economy is right the building industry will be right, as will many other industries. When the economy begins to recover one of the first sectors to show signs of recovery is the building industry, to the point where in this and other countries the detection of a pick-up in the building industry is one of the first signs that an economy is turning around.</P>

      <P>Deputy Madeleine Taylor-Quinn requested permission this morning, and indeed yesterday, to raise on the Adjournment the closure of the Kilrush Pottery.  After Question Time today Deputy Brendan Daly sought permission to raise the same matter on the Adjournment.  The Chair thought the reasonable thing to do was to allow both Deputies to raise the matter on the Adjournment.  As Deputy Taylor-Quinn requested permission to move it yesterday and again today I propose calling on her first.  I do not know whether the Deputies have got together and made any arrangement but I think the reasonable arrangement would be to split the time. I am suggesting that; I cannot enforce it. Deputy Taylor-Quinn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, you will be aware, Sir that I have had a question on the Order Paper in relation to this company since Easter and that because of the fact that circumstances changed in the concern involved in the last day or <Col N="2387" /> two I sought permission to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  It is, in my view, a precedent for the Chair to adopt this stance and I should like to find out under what Standing Order or by what precedent this decision has been arrived at.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is matter entirely at my discretion.  If there are a number of matters sought to be raised on the Adjournment and they are all qualified, the Chair decides which will be allowed.  It is also a matter at the discretion of the Chair, if a number of people seek to raise a matter on the Adjournment, which of them he will allow.  In this case I would have been perfectly justified in allowing Deputy Taylor-Quinn alone to raise the matter because she requested it yesterday and again this morning. Deputy Daly did not request permission until after Question Time today.  I thought the reasonable and equitable thing to do was to allow both Deputies a bite of the cherry and I suggest that they get on with it.  Deputy Taylor-Quinn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of raising this matter on the Adjournment and I agree to give to Deputy Daly ten minutes of the time allocated to me.  I am not happy that the matter has arisen.  It is very unfortunate for the south west Clare area that there are 105 jobs at serious risk.  In 1961 a group of very enthusiastic Clare businessmen, with a group of German businessmen, set up a pottery plant in Kilrush. That was extremely successful. There was great hope at the time in the south west Clare area because at that stage the Kilrush pottery factory was seen as something that would replace the emigrant boat to England and America. It operated very successfully and in 1976 it was taken over by Rosenthal.  Between 1979 and 1981 the number of workers was reduced from 110 to 60.  Problems arose in the factory.  At the time a study was done and it was found out that part of the reason for the failure then was that the plant was not re-equipped with modern machinery, that there was an inability on the part of the plant to manufacture the type of product that was being produced <Col N="2388" /> previously in the traditional style and indeed there were very serious promotional and marketing defects.  There was also a lack of commitment and management from the German plant and that affected the work force in Kilrush.</P>
      <P>In 1981 the IDA arranged a further takeover.  It was taken over at the beginning of 1982 by a consortium of UK businessmen. This got off to a bad start because there were very serious problems in relation to leasing.  The result was that delays were experienced by the group who were taking over.  However, they overcame those and after a few months in production their output increased by over 300 per cent.  They had order books which were full right through the year 1982 and up to the end of March 1983. Unfortunately, they again started to experience some difficulties and finally Fóir Teoranta sent in a receiver.  The receiver made his report last Monday.  It is not too optimistic.  The Minister could be of great help and I hope he will be in a position to request the Minister for Finance to ask Fóir Teoranta at once to direct the receiver to commence operations there immediately.  From talks I have had with the receiver I know that there are still many people in Britain who have substantial orders with the company and are still prepared to accept them. They are waiting for the stuff to come from Kilrush and it is up to us to get it out there.  While orders stand we have a duty to see that the supplies are forwarded. The problem can be met by the receiver going in immediately and managing the company while a takeover is being negotiated.  When the receiver visited London a week and a half ago he was quite impressed with the reaction he got from the people who had ordered from the factory previously.</P>
      <P>From inquiries I have made with the IDA I gather that about 15 inquiries in all have been made and 15 brochures have been sent out to interested parties. Of those interested parties four or five seem to be very serious and two of those have in fact visited the factory.  The IDA must be directed to pursue with vigour the serious inquiries that are being made by interested companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2389" /> South-west Clare is an agricultural area.  It has experienced very little industry. A loss of 105 jobs there would have very serious social and economic repercussions. There could be serious social repercussions affecting the fibre of society. There could be serious economic repercussions for the towns of Kilkee and Kilrush and the villages of Kilmihil, Cooraclare, Doonbeg and Carrigaholt. The next largest employer is 30 miles east in Ennis and 70 miles north in Galway. This factory is the largest employer for 70 miles along the west coast of Clare and for 30 miles east.  We cannot allow the loss of those 105 jobs.  It is important that action be taken.  Redundancy payments plus social welfare payments that would be made from the Exchequer in the future would take up very quickly the amount of money necessary.  There is a very good and skilled work force there, a work force that has co-operated in every way with the management and with the receiver and has foregone various rises.  We in Government must show our commitment to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to get the opportunity to contribute to this debate and to raise the question of the future prospects of Kilrush Pottery.  This company has been known for its outstanding performance, producing first quality products.  It has a highly skilled work force dedicated and committed to the ceramics industry. Everyone in the Kilrush area and throughout the west Clare peninsula has expressed grave concern for the workers and their families.  Many of the work force were young, in their first jobs, but several employees had been with the company since its establishment.  Concern and anxiety have been expressed by the various organisations in the area, the Kilrush UDC, the Kilrush Chamber of Commerce and the Kilrush Development Association, as well as many other organisations associated with the town.  The news of the closure comes as a major disappointment in the entire west Clare region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will refer briefly to some of the unsatisfactory circumstances associated with <Col N="2390" /> the closure.  During Easter, an indication was given that there would be an extension of the holidays.  There was a complete failure to clear the air locally and this led to speculation and rumours because of lack of communication of information as to what the situation was. Various statements were made, many of which could not be substantiated.  Very little information came from the company and those involved in its operation. That can often happen but I was gravely disappointed that one of the State agencies involved, Fóir Teoranta, were not more forthcoming.  They should have made the work force and their families more fully aware of what was happening rather than have the unsatisfactory situation developing over three or four weeks.</P>
    <P>The impact of the closure will be disastrous for Kilrush.  As I said during the debate on the SFADCo Bill the closure of the company with a loss of 110 jobs is equivalent to a loss of 10,000 jobs in Dublin and one can imagine the protests and demands that would be made if that happened in this city.</P>
    <P>This project could be made viable in the long term if action were taken by the State agencies Fóir Teoranta, the IDA and SFADCo.  SFADCo owned the plant and they, in conjunction with other State agencies such as the Youth Employment Agency and AnCO, should intervene.  It is now necessary, under the aegis of the county development team, to prepare an emergency scheme to back up the receiver and to enable him to run this project as a viable proposition and to get the people who have been made redundant back to work.  They are all skilled operatives and there is a demand for the product they have been producting &mdash; the order books are full.  That has been checked out with the companies whom they supplied.  With the financial backing of Fóir Teoranta it should be possible to keep this project going until a new industry has been found for Kilrush.  With small investment and the completion of the new plant which has already been installed in the factory, and with the addition of some new modern equipment it is possible to run the factory as a viable <Col N="2391" /> propostion.  It may not be possible to reemploy all of the work force, but employment could be found for between 80 and 90 people.  It would be a mistake and indeed a shame if the State agencies did not make an effort to support the factory until a new industry can be got to purchase the undertaking.</P>
    <P>The receiver has been most helpful since he took up his position.  He has got the wholehearted co-operation of the workers, something which has not been forthcoming elsewhere.  The receiver has indicated that a number of companies are interested in the project but the best prospect of selling to new people would be by keeping the operation in production as a going concern.  It would be tragic if the receiver had to continue to dismantle the plant and to sell it off.  If that situation were to come about it would be most difficult to get anyone to take over the plant.  If the IDA were to finance the bringing of a local industry into the town the cost would be enormous.  As it stands, the undertaking is not viable but it can be made viable with a small investment so that the industry will be kept as a going concern.  The amount of money that would be required to keep production going would not be large by comparison with the good it would do for the entire area.</P>
    <P>There is also the social aspect.  In Kilrush there are a number of advance factories already unoccupied and it is almost impossible to get existing industries to expand.  Taking into account the vast social implications for the area of this closure, the Government should act immediately to provide the necessary finance for the receiver.  If necessary, a workers' co-operative could be established there with the help of Fóir Teoranta and the other development agencies.  I know the Minister will be meeting a deputation of local interests during the week and I appeal to him to ensure that the financial backing will be there to enable the plant to be re-opened.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Energy (Mr. E. Collins) Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Energy (Mr. E. Collins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Energy (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Even at this witching hour of midnight I <Col N="2392" /> am glad of the opportunity to reply to this important debate.  I share the concern expressed by Deputy Taylor and Deputy Daly about this problem in the Kilrush and surrounding areas.  My Department fully appreciate the employment that company have given for over 20 years in that area.  Deputies can be assured that I will do everthing to ensure the continuation of the Kilrush Pottery in a new form at least.</P>
      <P>The company have weathered four storms and unfortunately this is the second time in the last three years that they have been in difficulties.  In the late seventies the company began to make losses and the owners, Rosenthal AG who owned the company since 1966, made the decision to withdraw.  The IDA took an immediate interest and succeeded in having the enterprise taken over by new investors &mdash; a consortium of UK business interests &mdash; early in 1982.  At that time it appeared that the takeover was successful. However, the early prospect of an increase in trading was not justified.  The increased trading never materialised although initially it appeared to do so, and the reason was the serious contraction of the market as a result of the recession.</P>
      <P>The drop in the market led to an over-capacity in many plants making competing products, especially in England.  In the second half of 1982 the IDA, in conjunction with Fóir Teoranta, took further steps to ensure the company were put on a sound financial footing. These efforts included a substantial loan from Fóir Teoranta of £150,000 which was made in January 1983.  At that point it seemed the position had again stabilised but unfortunately, due to the continuing weakness in the market demand, it led to further serious losses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once again the IDA and Fóir Teoranta examined the situation, but upon advice they received they were forced to conclude that the company as constituted was not viable.  On 27 April last a receiver was appointed at the request of Fóir Teoranta.  Fóir Teoranta are not the responsibility of the Minister for Industry and Energy, but of the Minister for Finance, but neither Minister is in a <Col N="2393" /> what they can or cannot do.  They are a statutory body established to act independently and must make their own decisions.</P>
    <P>Needless to say, Fóir Teoranta did not appoint a receiver lightly and took the decision only as a last resort.  It is unfortunate that the financial position of the company is such that the receiver has been unable to continue production at the factory.  The IDA in conjunction with the receiver, are actively trying to find a new investor to take over the assets of the company and to resume production at the plant.  In the present difficult international climate I must add that this will not be an easy task because we are in the grips of a serious recession.</P>
    <P>I understand two possible investors have already come forward, but discussions with them are at a very early stage, and I am precluded from making any statement as to the likely outcome of the negotiations.  The IDA will do everything they can to ensure a take-over of the plant and Fóir Teoranta &mdash; who have a special remit with regard to employment in areas around the country &mdash; will be associated if possible with the take-over. It is a fact that the receiver has no money to ensure continued production but that does not in any way damage the future prospects of the company.  The appointment of a receiver may make the way clear for the resumption of production under new ownership.  I would not like to say what would be the outcome of the negotiations, which are at an initial stage, but the action the receiver has taken will not damage the prospects of a takeover by a new company.</P>

      <P>Let us hope so, and let us hope that this Government and the action of our agents, the IDA and Fóir Teoranta, will ensure that a package can be put together for a new investor to take over the plant and assets and resume production in Kilrush.</P>
      <P>I fully appreciate the concern expressed by the Deputies.  As Deputy Reynolds knows, the Department of Industry and Energy are not lacking in their commitment to provide funds for rescue operations, in particular where there are major structural problems involved regarding employment.  Every effort will be made by the IDA and Fóir Teoranta to ensure that the funds required for a successful take-over will be made available.</P>
      <P>Down the years both the IDA and particularly Fóir Teoranta have not been lacking in providing funds for the company. It was Fóir Teoranta who provided the last major loan of £150,000 in January 1983.  That indicates their concern for the continuation of that company.  Every Deputy can be assured that this matter will be kept under continual review.  As Deputy Daly mentioned, I am receiving a deputation in regard to this factory in a couple of days.</P>
      <P>We are all concerned about the decrease in employment levels, particularly in rural areas, and we appreciate the significance of a factory closure. Hopefully, with the goodwill of everybody concerned, especially the workers, we will be able to find a new investor and get production going again in Kilrush. This is our prime objective and I can assure Deputies that no effort will be spared by this Government to ensure a successful take-over of the company.</P>

The error was made due to failure to comply with approved procedures.  This has now been corrected.</P>

      <P>Equipment was recently seized from three illegal broadcasting stations on foot of court warrants.  The stations in question were operating in breach of the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926.</P>
      <P>Pirate radio stations caused extensive interference to ambulance services in Dublin, Meath and Louth for a period last month.  As a result the ambulance services were unable to send or receive any intelligible messages.  This could have had the most serious consequences in any emergency.  It was established that this interference was caused in large measure by Radio Nova/Kiss FM.</P>
      <P>Twenty-two separate incidents of interference to radio frequencies at Dublin Airport were recorded during a recent period.  This interference affected frequencies used by aircraft when taxiing and immediately after take-off and frequencies used by airport fire and emergency services and frequencies used by the Defence Forces.  It was not possible to establish the source of the interference in every one of these cases but in any case where it was established it was found to be Radio Sunshine.</P>
      <P>The potential consequences of interference to emergency services and aircraft movements cannot be overstated as they involve the safety of life.  The interference to Garda and Army communications has serious implications for State security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Radio and television reception in very many areas has also been affected by illegal broadcasting as has the normal usage of radio frequencies assigned to RTE.  Harmful interference has been <Col N="2208" /> caused to authorised broadcasting stations in Britain which have been subject to considerable disruption due to the activities of Radio Nova in this country. This interference has been the subject of a formal complaint under the Radio Regulations of the International Telecommunications Union.  Ireland is required under its international obligations to act on foot of the formal complaints which have been received.</P>
    <P>The North Eastern Health Board have reported formally that the board's radio system for the accident and emergency ambulance service was rendered useless for a period of four days (from 16 to 19 April 1983) due to interference from an outside source.  This was the case also with the Drogheda and Dundalk Fire Services and with the Meath Fire Service.</P>
    <P>The interference was reported to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs on Tuesday, 19 April by the North Eastern Health Board.  A similar complaint of severe interference to the Dublin City Ambulance Services was reported on the same day by the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>The Department of Posts and Telegraphs monitored the Fire and Ambulance bands (74.05-74.6125MHz) on receipt of the complaints and found interference typical of sideband splatter.  Following further tests the emission was perceived to be a mixture of Radio Nova (on 88.19MHz) and KISS FM (102.7MHz).</P>
    <P>There are now estimated to be over 50 illegal radio stations and this proliferation threatens chaos on the airwaves and potential hazards to safety.</P>
    <P>Very clearly we cannot allow this situation to continue and, as I announced at the beginning of this year, it is my hope to bring to an end illegality in broadcasting this year.</P>
    <P>I very much recognise the enjoyment a great number of people, and especially young people, derive from many of these stations.  My aim is to phase out illegal stations as I phase in legal ones so that any interruptions to the enjoyment of listeners is kept to a minimum.</P>
    <P>However, where serious complaints of interference arise it will be necessary to act against offending stations speedily.</P>
    <P>At my request a Minister of State was <Col N="2209" /> specifically appointed to give all aspects of broadcasting the priority it had not got in recent years.  As a result after only three months proposals for the development of legal local radio and other broadcasting matters are now before the Government and a decision is imminent. Legislation will be introduced as speedily as possible and I expect all stages will be passed within months.</P>
    <P>Pending the enactment of the necessary legislation I am proposing to set up in the immediate future a local broadcasting committee to</P>
    <P>(i)  invite submissions from interested parties, especially youth organisations, on their concepts of local services;</P>
    <P>(ii)  to make such plans of administrative and technical nature as are possible </P>
    <P>to facilitate the speediest possible introduction of legal local radio after the enactment of legislation.</P>

      <P>The person concerned with an address in Australia had a holding in the 8½ per cent Funding Loan 1981 which matured on 1 March 1981.  In order for repayment of his investment to be made, it was necessary for him to complete certain documents. These were sent to him by the Central Bank approximately three weeks before the redemption date.  In the absence of a reply the Central Bank sent reminders in April, June and October 1981.  When nothing was heard, the Central Bank wrote to the person's bank in Ireland in February 1982.</P>
      <P>Contact with the person was made at that stage and the redemption documents together with a request for a return of the register certificate were issued by the Central Bank in March 1982.  The person's bank wrote in June 1982 saying that the redemption form had been mislaid and a new one had to be issued.  When it was returned the register certificate was not enclosed and the Central Bank had again to make contact with the person's bank.  Finally payment was made in September 1982.</P>

      <P>The waiting period for orthodontic treatment in Galway is up to 3½ years at present. However, in complicated cases involving the use of fixed applicances some persons are waiting up to 5½ years for treatment.  For nearly two years the Department of Health have been actively seeking to get agreement on a scale of charges for this particular type of treatment <Col N="2221" /> with the private orthodontists who provide the service on behalf of the health boards.  The absence of an agreed scale of charges has led to a hold up in the issue of authorisations for fixed appliance treatment.  As a result of recent discussions with the private orthodontists I am hopeful that agreement will shortly be reached so that treatments can again be proceeded with without delay.</P>
      <P>Applications will be invited soon for a new full-time post of consultant orthodontist for the Western Health Board. The filling of this post should greatly reduce the waiting period for orthodontic treatment in the area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>An increase of unemployment benefit is paid to a husband in respect of his wife if she is living with him or is wholly or mainly maintained by him. By definition, a deserted wife would not meet either of these criteria and the husband would not therefore qualify for an increase in respect of her.</P>
      <P>An increase of unemployment benefit is paid to a wife if her husband is unable by reason of physical or mental incapacity to maintain himself and she is wholly or mainly maintaining him.  A husband who was in full-time employment would not meet this requirement and an increase of benefit would not be payable to his wife in respect of him.</P>
