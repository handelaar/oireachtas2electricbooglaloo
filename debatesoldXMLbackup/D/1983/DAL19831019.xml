      <P>Will the Deputy bear with the Chair for a moment?  I am of the opinion from what I have heard that it would not be in order for Deputy Andrews to raise this at any time but to try to raise it when the Chair is calling Question No. 1 is grossly out of order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have explained that the long-standing practice in this House since I came into it nearly 20 years ago &mdash; I have never seen this happen before &mdash; is that when the Ceann Comhairle takes the Chair Question Time proceeds. Perhaps after Question Time notice is given of the desire to raise matters on the Adjournment and other attempts are made to raise things which are not always in order.  At the same time that is the time to try to do it, not now.</P>

      <P>When the Presidency has been under considerable scrutiny and discussion in recent times, that is an extraordinary answer for the Taoiseach to give in relation to the constitutional provision which I am sure the Taoiseach will agree&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that the importance which the public attach to the Presidency is in direct ratio to the importance which the Government attach to it?  Would he not agree that this provision of the Constitution is one way in which the Government could show the importance which they attach to the Presidency, whether the Taoiseach has adhered to the principles enshrined in the Constitution by consulting with the President?  The Taoiseach has a responsibility to let the House know if he has adhered to that constitutional provision and in what way he has done so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have adhered to the constitutional provision.  My predecessors, when asked this question, have given a similar answer, that they have adhered to it, but they have always refrained from giving details of such visits which are not matters appropriate for discussion in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach understood the question?  Does he agree that I have not asked what he discussed with the President?  I have merely asked on how many occasions since 14 December last he has visited the President in accordance with the constitutional provision. There is no disclosure of information in that other than to say on how many occasions the Taoiseach visited the President in accordance with that provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been a uniform practice not to answer questions of that kind relating to the number of such visits, but Taoisigh have given, as I have given, <Col N="5" /> an assurance that they have carried out their duties in respect of the President under this Article of the Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, in any review of the Constitution, the Government will consider the present constitutional provisions for nominating candidates for the Presidency with a view to possible amendments to allow for nominations by a wider range of groups and individuals; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have no proposals to amend Article 12.4 of the Constitution, although in any review of the Constitution, questions of this kind could, of course, arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach consider the present provision in the Constitution to be restrictive in regard to the election to the Presidency?  Since the nominations are closing this week and it is a matter of very great public concern, would he indicate if the Government and the Taoiseach consider that wider powers of selection of candidates for the Presidency should be given in the interest of democracy and the public demand which exists at the moment for such wider selection?</P>

      <P>It has been the intention that the Forum would report before the end of the year.  Every effort is being <Col N="6" /> made towards this end and it is hoped that any overrun, should it occur, would be of short duration.</P>
      <P>The question of laying the Forum's report before the D·il for debate will not arise until the report is available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he was invited by the Indian Prime Minister to attend a meeting of Heads of Government in New York to discuss peace, disarmament and development; and, if so, his reasons for declining the invitation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the New Delhi Summit last March of the Non-Aligned Movement the Prime Minister, Mrs. Indira Gandhi, invited heads of State or Government of the members of the UN to a meeting which was held in New York last month <i>en marge</i> of the current session of the UN General Assembly.</P>
      <P>In my reply to Mrs. Gandhi's invitation I indicated that I had hoped to accept but found with regret that, because of pressing domestic commitments here, this just was not possible.  I went on to say that the issues which she proposed to have discussed were ones which are of fundamental concern to the entire world and that these were being examined here by Ministers directly concerned in consultation with, as appropriate, our fellow member states of the European Communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Due to the fact that the <Col N="7" /> Taoiseach has always attached great importance to cultivating our international friends, does he not consider Mrs. Gandhi a friend and would it not have been a valuable opportunity to make useful contacts with heads of Government, particularly from the Third World?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is always a problem to balance different commitments, and in the circumstances and under the pressures of the time my judgment was that it was better for me to carry on with my duties here rather than to travel specially to New York for this purpose.  The meeting was attended by a number of states but I think only two other members of the EEC were present at one or other of the two meetings that actually occurred.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that an urgent initiative is needed which could be best undertaken by neutral and non-aligned countries to try to stop further dangerous escalation of the arms race and to switch badly needed resources to development?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that such an initiative is desirable and indeed is one of the matters to which the world as a whole and all member states of the UN should be giving priority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he now feels it necessary to make extensive corrections to the assessment he gave to D·il …ireann of the European Council at Stuttgart having regard to the Commission's proposals on the super levy which have been published since then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I stand fully over what I said in this House on 22 June last when I indicated where we had been successful in getting agreement to certain specific matters to be taken into account in the review of the CAP.  This has, for example, placed the Government in a much more favourable position to defend, on Community principles, the interests of this <Col N="8" /> country and to express their fundamental opposition to the whole idea of a &ldquo;super levy&rdquo; applied to Irish milk supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that he claimed in the D·il in his statement on 22 June that the outcome of the Stuttgart Summit was strikingly positive and that the Minister and he, with gratifying support from colleagues, were successful in preventing damage to Irish interests in the Common Agricultural Policy?  Would he accept that he misjudged totally the situation and that Deputy Haughey was right when he said it was necessary only to read the list of questions which were to be examined under the heading of the CAP to realise that they constitute a major onslaught on the CAP?  Did the Taoiseach not put his name to conclusions which invited the EEC Commission to bring forward revised super levy proposals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not put my name to anything which invited the Commission to bring forward revised or unrevised super levy proposals.  I am not sure where the Deputy got that information.  At the Stuttgart meeting a number of proposals were made and prior to it a number of proposals had been made with regard to the criteria to be applied in reviewing the CAP.  It was our concern to ensure that these criteria should be favourable to us in a positive sense and that we would avoid as far as possible unfavourable criteria. We had significant success in that respect, which has placed us in a much more favourable position in the negotiations now taking place, which are and were bound to be very difficult negotiations, but the criteria as finally agreed in Stuttgart have been extremely helpful to us in our viewing of our position by comparison with what they would have been had they not been adjusted before and at the Stuttgart meeting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that he positively invited the super levy proposals?  He stressed explicitly on 22 June &mdash; I quote from his statement to this House as reported in the Official Report, column 2691, Volume 343:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="9" />&mdash;the acceptability of any proposals that would be directed towards freezing existing production levels in member states where these are well below the Community average. . . .</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Far from inviting such proposals, I was putting down a marker that any such proposals would be unacceptable to the Irish Government, as was my duty at that time and remains my duty as Taoiseach now in the present negotiations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>During my recent visit to Belgium on 19 September last I had separate discussions with the Belgian Acting Prime Minister, Mr. J. Gol&mdash;the Prime Minister, Mr. W. Martens, was ill&mdash;the Belgian Foreign Minister, Mr. L. Tindemans and State Secretary for Foreign Affairs and Agriculture, Mr. P. de Keersmaeker as well as with the Commission President, Mr. Gaston Thorn. The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to disclose details of what were confidential discussions at a time of intensive and critical negotiations in the European Community. To clarify the point more precisely, I met Mr. Gol and Mr. de Keersmaeker together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach say that during the course of these discussions he made it very clear to those whom he met and to the media afterwards that this country was prepared to use the veto?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I made it very clear in the discussions I had and in a public address at the college at Bruges that proposals involving quotas or super levies interfering with the natural growth of our dairy industry would be unacceptable to this country, and by so doing laid the groundwork for the negotiations now <Col N="10" /> taking place in which our position is much more widely appreciated than previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach say whether during the course of the discussions he indicated clearly that this Government were prepared to use the veto to protect our national interests?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, having been Minister for Foreign Affairs, knows enough about the &ldquo;veto&rdquo; to know how inappropriate the question he is posing is.  The issue does not arise in that form. The issue that arises is that the proposal for a super levy applied to our dairy products would be unacceptable to this country because of its impact on our economy and because it would undermine the benefits of EEC membership in respect of which we have already paid a considerable price on the industrial side. Our job is to clarify with other member Governments the unacceptability of this proposal, so that in the negotiations it will be understood and accepted that it would not be appropriate to attempt to settle this issue by a majority voting procedure but that discussions would have to proceed until agreement is reached, which is a method by which the Community has proceeded, as the Deputy knows, for many years past.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made contacts with certain Heads of Government and will make other arrangements as and when they may be appropriate.  Perhaps the Deputy will appreciate that the time scale of this negotiation is not totally certain.  Certainly it is our hope that the matter will be resolved at Athens because very considerable problems will be created for the Community as a whole and <Col N="11" /> for this country in particular if a solution is not reached there, and we are not totally certain that it will be reached at that time.  The question, therefore, of the timing of the contacts with other Heads of Government will have to be considered in the light of that somewhat uncertain situation.</P>
      <P>I shall be meeting by invitation the President of the European Council, the Greek Prime Minister, Mr. Papandreaou, in Athens shortly.  During the month of November we shall be meeting the British Prime Minister and there will be, of course, the visit of the German Chancellor later in November.  Those meetings are arranged, and the question of other meetings is for further consideration as the situation develops.</P>

      <P>It is some time since I have asked supplementary questions, so I trust that the Chair will bear with me if I get a little out of order.  Could the Taoiseach tell us a little more about this National Planning Board, apart from his happiness with them?  Have they been meeting frequently?  Have they submitted any reports to the Government?  If these reports have been submitted, have they been adopted?  Could they be published? Could the Taoiseach flesh the thing out a little for us?  This National Planning Board is a very mystical sort of <Col N="14" /> body as far as we are concerned.  We do not see any action resulting from their meetings.  In fact, the truth of the matter is that the economy is collapsing around the Taoiseach's ears while this Board is still in existence.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that I want to indulge in that kind of banter about ears.  On the position of the National Planning Board, the primary function is to prepare a medium-term national economic plan.  The board are working on that and have been working on it very intensively indeed.  This is a body the members of which are doing the work themselves, and this involves their giving up a good deal of time to that work.  The deadline which they have set themselves in agreement with the Government is the month of April for preparing a document to submit to the Government.  In the meantime they have provided the Government with useful advice in relation to the more immediate issues which I have mentioned with regard to 1984 within the context of their broad approach to the medium-term situation. Obviously, the preparation of a medium-term plan requires a good deal of time.  It is right that the board should have until next April for that purpose.  It would be a mistake to attempt to rush something of this kind and get a document which would be inadequate when there is so much to be tackled over the next three or four years to get our economy right.</P>

      <P>I cannot pretend to be reassured by what the Taoiseach says.  I gather that there is a nice, leisurely economic investigation going on somewhere, and that in due course some time next year we will get the results of that.  Would the Taoiseach bear in mind, in the meantime, as I said, that the economy is collapsing, investment has practically dried up, unemployment soars and all these <Col N="15" /> other indicators are there which lead to a call from this side of the House for immediate action?  Could I direct the Taoiseach's attention to the fact that in the Labour and Fine Gael Agreement for Government the National Planning Board were supposed to identify at once the areas of defective infrastructure so that £100 million extra could be spent immediately on providing productive employment?  That was a very specific objective set to the National Planning Board in that document which Labour and Fine Gael all signed so that they could come together and form a Government.</P>

In that agreement for Government by the parties now in Government the National Planning Board were set a specific objective of identifying the areas in the infrastructure where £100 million could immediately be spent on providing productive employment. Would the Taoiseach care to comment on that and also on the fact that because the Government immediately on coming into office cut £220 million off the capital programme, they thereby rendered totally inoperative that objective for the National Planning Board?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They are the priority of the Government.  By constituting a task force of this kind of the relevant Ministers, an additional impetus can be given to the work of the Government who have <Col N="18" /> to concern themselves with matters other than this most primary issue of unemployment. Many other Government decisions are required.  To have a body which can concentrate exclusively on this subject and make recommendations for action to the Government for actions which have been pre-prepared by the key Ministers in question is a useful innovation and is so proving itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing to diminish the magnitude of the appalling character and distress caused by unemployment which is a major problem we face.

      <P>I do not want to make much out of that because frankly these trends are not susceptible to short-term Government action.  I do not claim for a moment that the slowing down over this period is the result to any significant degree of actions of this Government or will necessarily continue in the same way. Factually the situation is as I have stated it.  It is the primary objective of this Government to deal with it.  We are hamstrung <Col N="19" /> by the situation we have inherited, by the accumulation of debt and repayments and by the levels to which taxation has been forced in order to keep up with the increase in expenditure under our predecessors, which increased from 36 per cent of GNP to 50 per cent of GNP in five years.  The burden of interest payments and capital repayments, and the burden of taxation required to cope with them make it impossible for the Government to tackle as effectively as any Government would wish to do the problem of unemployment.  We have to face that fact.  We have to tackle it as best we can, but with our hands tied behind our backs by five years of mismanagement.</P>

Next year alone the Government will have to find £1 billion in order to pay interest on the foreign debt and to repay foreign debt incurred in the period of office of the preceding Government as a result of that increase in public expenditure.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach told us about the entertainment he offered to Dr. Kissinger on a Thursday.  Would he please enlighten us about the Friday?  A lunch was given on Friday for Dr. Kissinger in Iveagh House.  Could the Taoiseach give me some details about that lunch?  Who was the host?</P>

      <P>Could the Taoiseach enlighten me on two matters?  Was this <Col N="22" /> the first time ever that Iveagh House was made available to some outside body to provide what purported to an outsider at any rate to be an official lunch?  Secondly, would he be in a position to confirm my information that the Council of the Royal Irish Academy were not aware that this was happening?  Could he further confirm my information to the effect that at a recent meeting of the Council of the Royal Irish Academy it was clearly stated that the Academy did not pay for that particular lunch?  Could he give us some information because it is of considerable importance if Iveagh House were used for a luncheon not given by the Taoiseach or a Minister and not, as far as we are aware, paid for by the Taoiseach, a Minister, or by the Council of the Royal Irish Academy?  Who paid?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>From my own personal recollection I can recall when Iveagh House was made available to Lord Iveagh to host a dinner on the occasion of a conference of brewers some years ago.  I know it is made available to the National University of Ireland for honorary conferrings. At this moment I cannot recall other precedents, but those precedents exist and I presume the Deputy is aware of them.</P>
      <P>With regard to the host on that occasion, if the invitations were issued on behalf of the Royal Irish Academy, anybody invited could not have been in doubt as to who were their hosts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will ask the Taoiseach to look into this matter because there is some considerable disquiet caused by the fact that the luncheon was given for Dr. Kissinger who has a private, commercial appointment at the moment and by the fact that Iveagh House was ostensibly used for this purpose by the Royal Irish Academy, but, apparently, was not specifically <Col N="23" /> authorised by the Royal Irish Academy, and that it has been clearly stated that the Royal Irish Academy did not pay for that lunch.  I hope the Taoiseach will look into this matter and tell us if this lunch was paid for from an official source.  If it was not, and if it was not paid by the Council of the Royal Irish Academy, who paid for it?  It is important that we know if Iveagh House was used for a private purpose and we should be given full details.  I am giving the Taoiseach the opportunity to look into this and report to the House some time later.</P>

The matter of the arrangements the Royal Irish Academy make for the funding of their activities, other than the grants they get from the Government, is a matter for the Academy, as for any private body.  I have not the slightest intention of looking into this matter because it would be improper for me to do so.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the operation of the Housing Finance Agency loan scheme, including the conditions of eligibility of applicants, rests with the agency in the first instance.  I understand that, with effect from April last, the agency have modified their scheme to allow a person who has previously owned a house either solely or jointly with another person to be considered for a loan in certain exceptional circumstances.  This change was made mainly to cater for the housing needs of separated persons.  In the case of such applicants, at least two years must have elapsed since previous ownership of a house.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister <Col N="30" /> agree that two years seems to be an unfair length of time and that it would be better if there was a continuity of an immediate purchase rather than a two year gap? What happens in many cases is that the wife has to get out of the house, which is sold.  She gets her share but if she wants to buy a house she has to wait two years before she can get a Housing Finance Agency loan.  Will the Minister consider the matter again and discuss it with the Housing Finance Agency with a view to removing that two year waiting period? Where will a woman live for the two years?</P>

      <P>I was under the impression from circulars issued by the Department and the Minister to local authorities and Dublin City Council that a separate discussion was taking place in regard to the structures in Dublin city and county.  I am sure the Minister will agree that there are special administrative difficulties in Dublin city and county concerning housing, roads, water and sewerage schemes and that they are creating great problems.  Has the Minister made any special study in regard to the administrative difficulties of Dublin city and county and D˙n Laoghaire?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point in regard to the need for reorganisation in the Dublin area; the same need does not exist in rural Ireland.  We are looking at the question of reform in the Dublin area.  Due to the rapid growth in the city we are considering such matters as the unsatisfactory nature of the existing boundaries between the three main authorities, the need for effective coordination in the provision of services throughout the metropolitan area, and the need to establish a local government presence in local communities, particularly in the three western towns of Tallaght, Clondalkin and Blanchardstown.</P>

      <P>I accept the Deputy's comment that it is an attractive scheme but I am sure I do not have to remind the Deputy, a former Minister for the Environment, that the scheme is being operated in conjunction with the Housing Finance Agency.  The schemes are working side by side and they seem to be meeting the demand for loans adequately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is that the limits have not been increased since 1981&mdash;I was the last Minister to increase the limit&mdash;and I am sure the Minister will agree that the SDA scheme is a fairer one.  Will the Minister accept that he should consider raising the limits?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">

      <P>It was with great and sincere regret that Members of the House learned during the summer recess of the tragic death in London of Deputy George Colley.</P>
      <P>George Colley served this House and this country well.  From the time of his election to the D·il his presence in this House was marked by the high calibre of his work, his unfailing warmth and courtesy and his dedication to the service of the democratic system.  His patriotism and his devotion to the Gaelic culture of our land were patent to all.  Although we differed on many occasions about our approach to economic policy, this never impinged in any way on our personal relationship outside the confines of the D·il Chamber.</P>
      <P>The many tributes already paid to him testify to the exceptional regard in which he was held by people of all parties and none.  On my own behalf and on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I wish to convey to his wife, Mary, and the members of his family, the sympathy of all of us in this House at his tragic and premature death away from the land to which he was devoted.</P>

      <P>The untimely death of Deputy George Colley on Saturday, 17 September, shocked and saddened us all.  Respected on all sides of the House, George Colley, as the Official Reports of our proceedings here over the 22 years of his membership of D·il …ireann show, was a parliamentarian of the highest calibre, whose contributions to our debates and deliberations were listened to carefully and attentively.</P>
      <P>Serving with distinction in successive Ministries during the greater part of his parliamentary career, George Colley displayed the highest degree of administrative skill and political achievement.  It is widely acknowledged that his period in office as Minister for Energy especially was an outstanding one.  Through his tragic death, his family, our country and the Fianna F·il Party have suffered a grievous loss.</P>

He was a man of real courtesy and charm, a dignified and substantial contributor to debates in this Chamber. Even his disagreements with this side of the House were always on matters of policy and were expressed in a manner calculated to persuade rather than to offend.  Other speakers have referred to his integrity and to his achievements.  Perhaps his greatest achievement was the character, discipline and commitment he brought to every task he undertook.  He will be long remembered with affection and respect in this House.  Our sympathies <Col N="189" /> again go to his wife, Mary, and his family and to the party he served so well.</P>

Naturally, we feel it is our responsibility <Col N="190" /> to co-operate with the Government. Some Members of our party have expressed the wish that there would be more time devoted to Committee Stage of the legislation rather than a Second Stage type of debate.  The situation is such that that arrangement would be more helpful to the House.  Perhaps the Taoiseach or the Chief Whip would indicate that the House might give perhaps one hour to a Second Stage debate and perhaps two hours to Committee Stage?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill, which is of general application, is to amend existing insurance legislation by adding to the range of actions which can be taken to deal with situations arising in the event of uncertain solvency of non-life insurance companies.</P>
      <P>In 1964 the Oireachtas accepted the principle that the State should not be responsible for the failure of private sector enterprises engaged in the non-life insurance market.  At the same time it decided that it would be desirable to establish a Compensation Fund, to which all companies would contribute in accordance with their share of the market, and out of which eligible claims could be met in full.  The details are set out in the Insurance Act 1964.  Subsequently the United Kingdom Parliament introduced legislation to much the same effect and similar arrangements now exist in other parts of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While leaving the basics of the 1964 legislation unchanged, and it has worked quite well in the case of the collapse of the Equitable Insurance Company, we are now proposing a number of significant amendments.  The House will recall that at the time of the Equitable episode, the view was accepted that, while arrangements should be made to compensate people who had claims for injuries or damage to property, those who had simply paid premiums and were going to be out of pocket only in respect of the unexpired period covered by the premium, could be left to fend for themselves. With the greatly increased cost of insurance I feel that a different view ought now to prevail on this question and that people who have paid premiums should, in the case of a company being <Col N="196" /> wound up, be entitled to present claims in respect of the unexpired period of their policies just the same as other claimants on the Compensation Fund.  That principle is now enshrined in this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is, however, an even more important consideration which arises in this connection and, again, Deputies will recall the experience of the winding up of the Equitable Insurance Company.  At that time my predecessor secured an order of the High Court for the winding up of the company as it was clear that their affairs were beyond all hope of redemption.  I do not think that any other solution would have been possible at that time.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless we must recall what the effects of the winding up order were.  The position is that as soon as such an order is made, the policyholders, leaving aside entirely the position of persons having claims against the company for accident, etc., are no longer effectively insured and are thrown upon the insurance market to do the best they can in seeking replacement cover.  Even in the case of a small company like the Equitable Insurance Company this caused considerable dislocation, and in present market circumstances, it is clear that the consequences of the winding up of an insurer would be very serious indeed.</P>
    <P>Nowadays insurance of certain classes is not something which is immediately available for the asking over the counter. Members of the insuring public are often, because of the cost and other considerations involved, obliged to make diligent enquiries to secure the best deal for themselves. We cannot contemplate the possibility of very large numbers of people, including many whose livelihood depends on having insurance cover, left without insurance through no fault of their own, being sent from Billy to Jack with, possibly, the consequences that a significant increase in the number of uninsured drivers on our roads is brought about, a situation which, as the House is aware, places intolerable demands on all concerned.</P>
    <P>It is primarily to deal with this problem that the present legislation has been designed.  Its object is to ensure that while <Col N="197" /> the affairs of a company in difficulty are brought within the purview of the High Court in much the same way as those of a company being wound up, their business can nonetheless be continued without interruption on a going concern basis by an administrator appointed by the court.</P>
    <P>It is a basic principle of company law that in an insolvent winding up the board of directors becomes defunct and its powers are assumed by the liquidator.  This is in recognition of the fact that it is those in control who have the power to do harm.  Their removal is therefore almost invariably an essential preliminary to any remedial action and such removal automatically occurs on liquidation.</P>
    <P>In this Bill we are proposing to apply this and other winding up principles to the case where an administrator is appointed by the court, and it follows therefore that, for so long as an administrator stands appointed, the powers of the directors will cease.  In applying the winding up principles we have been very conscious of the scope for conflict between some of them and the discharge by the administrator of his main duty to maintain the business as a going concern with a view to placing it on a sound commercial and financial footing.</P>
    <P>There are obviously certain winding up provisions which would impede the administrator in such a task, and these are being adapted or repealed to remove any doubt there may be about the commercial credibility of an insurer under administration.  I think it is important to refer specifically to one particular adaptation the effect of which will be that, contrary to the automatic consequences of a winding up, contracts of employment, transactions, debts, proceedings etc., will not, by virtue only of the appointment of an administrator, be avoided, cancelled, stayed or otherwise affected.</P>
    <P>The underlying rationale &mdash; and it is important that this should be emphasised and accepted &mdash; is that the administrator of an insurer from the outset should be able to carry on business with as much freedom as is reasonable and that as far as possible only normal commercial rules <Col N="198" /> and procedures apply, subject of course, to the entire proceedings being within the domain of the court.</P>
    <P>To further facilitate the attainment of the main objective of this Bill, the Act of 1964, as we now propose to amend it, will give the administrator access to the Compensation Fund so that he will have the resources to meet claims on the company and to place it on a better financial footing for the future.  The general mechanisms of the 1964 Act will continue to apply, with the Fund's resources being provided as before by way of levying contribution on all non-life insurers.</P>
    <P>The limit of £1 million on the size of the Fund established in the 1964 Act is being removed.  This removal has been dictated firstly because its significance has been almost completely eroded by inflation in the intervening years and, secondly, it is considered inadvisable to pitch the Fund at a particular level in general legislation when the circumstances in which the Fund would be drawn upon could vary substantially from case to case.</P>
    <P>In order to facilitate insurers in their task of providing for their liability to the Fund the Bill proposes that the contribution by insurers will be limited to a ceiling of 2 per cent of premium income in any year.  The House will appreciate that a contingent liability of this size could create some difficulties for insurers. It is only right therefore that the insurance industry should not be prohibited from providing for any liability to the Fund in the premium rates which they charge.  This is a principle which has already been well established.  I think it appropriate at this point to record that the behaviour of the insurance companies in regard to their obligations under the Act of 1964 has been exemplary.</P>
    <P>The net result of the new provisions to which I have referred is that policy holders will not need to scramble around looking for alternative cover, as their insurance will be continued, and the rescue of the enterprise can be put in hand under new management with the least disruption to its ongoing commercial activity.</P>
    <P>Many non-life insurance companies <Col N="199" /> have connections with other entities, whether by way of subsidiary or dependent companies for property and other investment purposes or by way of other associated entities within an overall group structure.  In endeavouring to deal with the fortunes of an ailing insurer it would be inconceivable that the administrator should not also be in a position to exercise control over the affairs of any such entities.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides, therefore, for the exercise of such control by the administrator as is considered necessary for the purpose of successfully discharging his primary duties.  The ability to act in relation to such companies and the degree of control to be exercised will be subject to the sanction of the court.</P>
    <P>The Bill also defines the connection in such a manner that action could only be taken in relation to a body which is significantly linked with the insurer under administration. I must emphasise, however, that the inclusion of this element in the Bill is not to be seen as a vehicle for the extension to such bodies of the appointment of the administrator, with a brief to maintain them as going concerns and return them all, if needs be, to a sound financial footing.  That would be totally impractical and unrealistic, and it would be unreasonable to expect policyholders to provide funds to rescue enterprises outside the insurance sector. On the other hand, it seems safe to make the general assumption that where the main enterprise in a group is being rehabilitated, the effects on connected enterprises must be beneficial.</P>
    <P>A series of other consequential amendments is being effected to the Act of 1964 for the purpose of facilitating the successful application of the scheme I have outlined.  The opportunity is also being availed of to repeal certain provisions of the Act of 1936 relating to the ownership of shares in, and the nationality of directors of, insurers.  The existing provisions are discriminatory in the light of our obligations under the Treaty of Rome, and while they have not been applied against nationals of other member states <Col N="200" /> in recent years, their continued presence in the Statute Book is not warranted.</P>
    <P>I think it only right at this stage to inform the House that it is my intention, as soon as this Bill becomes law, to petition the High Court for the appointment of an administrator to take over the management of a certain insurance company whose affairs are in a state of considerable disarray.  Since these proceedings are imminent and the relevant petitions have already been prepared, it would be inappropriate for me to go into further detail at this stage, but there will, presumably, be other occasions on which this matter can be debated in the House.</P>
    <P>When one looks at the recent history of insurance business in Ireland, one is, I think, entitled to ask certain questions. Indeed, events now happening in other countries also have their relevance.  In our own case we had in the late 1930s the mismanagement of a number of life companies whose funds, on actuarial valuation, were shown to be inadequate to meet future liabilities to policyholders. To deal with that situation the Irish Life Assurance Company was established by the State and I think we are entitled to say that it has been a resounding success. In 1963 the Equitable Insurance Company collapsed and it was clear that the most serious offences had been committed in carrying on its business.  The 1964 Act resulted from this.  We are now faced with a third problem.</P>
    <P>To be fair, I am obliged to say that the affairs of insurance companies are, generally speaking managed by responsible people who are fully cognisant of their duties to the insuring public.  They co-operate fully with the Department in filing the returns required by law and in answering any questions which arise in connection with them.  This is all very well as far as it goes, but it has to be recognised that, so far as the supervisory authority is concerned, the system still depends largely on the competence and honesty of those who prepare these returns and, even more so, on those professional people who certify the returns.  Unusual vigilance is called for and, partly because of the complexities of Irish law, the process is not an easy <Col N="201" /> one.  Directly and indirectly, the various powers provided by the Oireachtas in regard to the supervision of insurance companies have been availed of relentlessly by myself and my predecessors in office and the case which is now pending is the end result of the exercise of these powers.  One can, I think, take it as a certainty that if the supervisory powers had not existed and had not been used, we would in due course have been confronted with a disastrous situation which would have been extremely difficult to deal with.  What we need now is effective remedies to deal with certain situations brought to light by the supervision process.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before the House provides a very desirable addition to the range of options available to the insurance supervisory authority.  It provides an option which avoids the disastrous consequences of winding up and, although confined to a large extent within existing winding up law, it creates an environment which should allow of the resuscitation of an insurer while carrying on business in a normal fashion.</P>
    <P>I would now ask Members for their co-operation in carrying this Bill through the House.  Although it is a Bill that is not large in physical dimensions, a great deal of work has been put into it and I think that it meets the requirements and aspirations of all parties in the House. There are people out there to be looked after and the object of this Bill is to do our best for them.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to thank the Opposition for facilitating the speedy passage through both Houses of the Oireachtas of this very necessary provision. Because there has been some speculation in the media and some gossip, I would like to reassure the public that, irrespective of which company may be involved, if this Bill passes both Houses of the Oireachtas and the application to the court for the appointment of an administrator under the provisions of this Bill is successful, people who are covered at the moment will continue to be covered and they are in no danger.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>In facilitating the Minister <Col N="202" /> in this business it was established to us that it was of a very urgent nature.  In fact, it was stated to be a matter of something of an emergency, and, while I might not be too familiar with the precedent for emergency legislation in the House, I would venture to say it is a pretty rare occurrence in legal terms to have emergency legislation brought in to deal with any aspect of life.  Consequently, we take this to be of very significant importance. While this Bill is framed in general terms for general application, there is no doubt at all from the reading of the Explanatory Memorandum and from listening to the Minister that he has one particular insurer in mind.  He refers in his Explanatory Memorandum on at least two occasions to an insurer, therefore we take it that this legislation is being framed to deal with one insurer operating in the field of motor insurance in this country now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can conclude from the Minister's speech that a very large number of persons are involved.  I take it that they are the insured.  He makes reference also to uninsured drivers.  Therefore, irrespective of what other business the insurance company are involved in, it is obvious that this is a major motor insurer.  Indeed, while there might be some restriction on the Minister, because of his involvement in court proceedings which he has suggested in the latter part of his Second Stage speech, naming any insurance company &mdash; he says the matter could be debated here at another time &mdash; I take it that the same restriction is not on me, and I can only draw the conclusion that this insurer is a well-known motor insurance company in this State.  I would like to know if it is possible, without the Minister breaking any rules that might apply to any subsequent action he would take in his imminent court action &mdash; obviously tomorrow &mdash; for him to state what insurance company he has in mind.  It is very important today when considerable agitation and uncertainty prevail outside this House to know what company is involved, what the responsibility of the Minister will be subsequent to his imminent court action and what fate awaits those who have paid insurance premiums <Col N="203" /> to the company involved.  Obviously, if the Minister is taking this action against an insurer he must base it on certain reports that have been made available to him.  Perhaps he would be good enough to indicate to the House what reports he has which necessitate this action on his part and whether it is a report or reports. Would he be agreeable to indicate to the House in this emergency situation what access those people who prepared the reports for him had to the computer print-outs and the necessary information which they needed in preparing their submission to him?  We on this side of the House would be very interested to know the names of these companies who carried out these investigations and if they had the proper experience and expertise to deal with matters which concern motor insurance.  What was their remit and what were the details of their job specification in bringing forward these reports?</P>
    <P>Could the Minister indicate to us, before he takes this imminent court action to appoint an administrator to carry on the work of a major Irish insurance company, if he considered any other alternatives, what options were made available to him and if he gave them due consideration before taking this penultimate step?  Were the insurance company contacted since the decision to take court action and appoint an administrator who will, according to the Minister, relieve the board of directors and others of their position in the company?  I would be particularly anxious to know if the Minister, in considering any other option which might have been available to him in dealing with this emergency matter, contacted other insurers in the same way of business to see if they had any options which might prevent the necessity of the Department of Trade, Commerce and Tourism virtually nationalising an insurance company to-day?  My main concern at this stage would be for the policyholders, and I agree with the Minister that it is very important that they be left in no doubt this evening from this House that they are going to continue to be in cover, that there is no risk to their insurance cover and that they will not, as the Minister <Col N="204" /> said, have to run about looking for an alternative in order to drive their cars home from work this evening.</P>
    <P>I understand that there are many insurance companies operating here in so far as motor insurance is concerned.  There are nine Irish companies, all told &mdash; this is information from the famous Blue Book &mdash; and in 1981 of those nine Irish companies two were controlled from outside the State, and there were 14 foreign companies companies operating as well. The Minister refered to a very large number of insured people, which narrows the field considerably.  It is obvious that the insurance company which must be in the Minister's mind and with which he is concerned in the imminent legal proceedings tomorrow morning must, in fact, be the PMPA.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I would like to make this point quite clear. As I explained in my opening speech, this Bill has a general application It could apply to all or any insurance company. For reasons which should be obvious to everyone, as I have indicated also in my opening speech, it is my intention to apply to the courts for any company to be named, and possibly for the hearing to start here in the Oireachtas could be prejudicial to the outcome of that case. I am talking on this Bill in its general application.  I cannot be responsible if others wish to speculate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister's position.  Of course, this legislation is for general application, but there would not be an emergency situation unless it was intended to apply the legislation to a particular insurer in the immediate future.  It has been confirmed by the Minister that he intends to use this legislation in the immediate future to deal with an insurer. Obviously, the Minister will be moving in the court tomorrow against an insurance company and seeking a petition to have an administrator applied.  I believe that the company which the Minister has in mind in dealing with the immediate as against the general application is the PMPA.  For that reason, I am particularly concerned that the 300,000 people who hold insurance cover by way of motor <Col N="205" /> insurance with that company are protected, and that they are left in no doubt this evening that they will continue to be covered today, tomorrow and for the foreseeable future.  I would also be very concerned about the staff of any company involved under any court action which the Minister might take nor of in the future.  The particular company to which I refer has a general staff of about 2,000. This also will have tremendous implications for the financial and commercial activity of the country and for other insurers. That is what makes it a very serious and important matter.</P>
      <P>The Bill itself deals with considerable powers which will be available to the administrator once the petition has succeeded. He will also be in a position to deal with related companies and subsidiaries which the company have under their control, which further reinforces my belief that we are talking about the company of PMPA.</P>
      <P>The amendment of sections 7, 8, 9 and 10 of the Insurance Act, 1964, will give the administrator access to the insurance compensation fund.  The Minister states that that fund now stands at £1 million. It would be interesting to know if that money will enable the administrator to deal with any difficulties which have arisen concerning the company against whom he intends to move.  Obviously not, and that is why the limit has been increased and we are talking now about considerable sums of money being drawn from other insurers.  If we take the total motor insurance premium at roughly £500 million, one per cent would be £5 million, so that the 2 per cent maximum limit at £10 million would have to be passed on to other insurance policyholders. This will have a considerable impact on the insurance rates which will be applied by other insurers subsequent to the administrator getting his hands on the fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The nine Irish and 14 foreign companies operating here in the field of motor insurance are conducting other forms of non-life business as well.  It is important to remember that the seven Irish based and controlled companies correspond to about 65.9 per cent of the total premiums <Col N="206" /> paid in 1981 and the two active foreign controlled would amount to about 3.3 per cent.  When one considers the importance of the position of the major wholly Irish owned motor insurance company, the PMPA, we see the impact which this will have on insurance generally and on an enormous number of policyholders. We must understand that an insurer, whatever the name, cannot carry on business without a licence issued by the Minister. The licence has certain requirements attached to it concerning minimum capital, the question of registration in Ireland or in other EEC countries.  For the company to operate, they must operate under the closest scrutiny of the supervisory authority, namely the Minister's Department, and any company dealing in insurance must submit detailed annual returns of their business and before they get the licence initially must have a scheme of operation which satisfies the Minister.  I take it that this company, when it got its licence, had a scheme of operation which then satisfied the Minister, but when the reserves fall the insurer is entitled to bring forward a scheme of operation to restore the position. I would be very anxious to know if the Minister has confronted the insurance company involved with the task of bringing forward a scheme of operation which would restore their solvency, if insolvency is the reason for taking the imminent court action against them.  How did the company maintain here their technical reserves corresponding to their underwriting liabilities here?  Was this done unknown to the Minister?  How long has this matter been left unattended?</P>
    <P>The Minister's responsibility is clear. He sets down the administrative rules under which insurers carry on their business. He prescribes the nature of the spread of the assets the company must have.  They must accommodate themselves to an adequate solvency margin. While the Minister may not be able to answer these questions this evening, we are being asked to accommodate him with emergency legislation to enable him to go into court tomorrow morning to move the directors of a major insurer and surely the Members of this House and <Col N="207" /> the public are entitled to know what basis, what reports, what insolvency, if any, exist and to what extent, and whether the matter could have been dealt with under a range of options other than the one he now proposes.</P>
    <P>Were the company given an opportunity to restore their solvency, if it needs restoration?  We do not know.  We accept the Minister's good faith and that he has certain reports, but we have to know who made the reports, and what experts compiled the facts which led the Minister to take this very grave step which requires emergency legislation in Leinster House.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, the solvency of an insurer depends on the transfer of some of the liability to reinsurers.  Over the years if there was a shortfall in the assets available to a company, to their technical reserve and to their cover by reinsurers, this must have been known on an annual basis to the Department, and what steps they should take to rectify that matter. Insurers must lay off a proportion of their risk.  That is common practice with all insurers.  Has that been complied with in this particular company against which the Minister is to move?  Obviously the Minister is of the opinion that this company are capable of continuing in business and carrying the cover and the risk for their large number of insured people.  Otherwise the Minister would be moving, as happened on a previous occasion, to a winding up situation.  That is not necessary on this occasion, which suggests to me that there must be options in the Minister's mind which would accommodate the carrying on for the foreseeable future of the business of this insurer.</P>
    <P>Why were not these steps taken in advance of emergency legislation being brought in here to accommodate the Minister? If the Minister is satisfied that all these things have been considered he has an obligation to put matters right.  Instead of the House being rushed into an emergency situation he should have considered other available options.</P>
    <P>Management will be displaced.  There is no doubt about that.  Large numbers of people will be displaced.  There will be considerable inconvenience.  The <Col N="208" /> reassurance given by the Minister that nobody covered at this time by the insurer need have any fear of their cover this evening or for the foreseeable future is welcome.  At the same time, there will be continuing unease in the market place until the full facts are known.  There is no doubt in my mind that, if reports were prepared at the Minister's insistence, they form the basis of his reason for seeking court action tomorrow.</P>
    <P>Did he discuss the details of those reports with the insurer?  In common justice and equity one would expect that the insurer who had been giving insurance cover in good faith over a long number of years would have been contacted on the question of what steps the Minister proposed to take against the company. Perhaps nothing could be done. Obviously if the company have been engaged continuously for the past while in the insurance business, they will resist the petition, and if they resist the petition successfully what is the situation for the hundreds of thousands of insured people?</P>
    <P>My first concern is for the policy holders and, after that, for those in employment in the insurance company.  I am deeply concerned about the implications on business generally.  While the Minister might be restricted in naming the company, he should be able to put us at ease about many of the other matters I raised.</P>

      <P>I will not take too long, because the manner in which this Bill has been introduced has given me no time to prepare a considered response to it.  I welcome the fact that the House can respond to an emergency situation like this quickly.  To expect a Deputy who gets the Bill at 1.30 p.m. today to respond to it in any realistic way at 4.30 p.m. is not reasonable.  Can the Minister let us know at what point he became aware that this crisis was about to arise?  Was it in the past few days?  Was it during the recess, or before the recess?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because the Bill was brought in at such short notice we must accept at face value the assurances the Minister has given us, and also to some extent the explanatory memorandum.  Unfortunately, previous <Col N="209" /> experience has shown that an explanatory memorandum often hides as much as it explains.  For that reason I will be anxious to hear the debate on the various sections of the Bill to see precisely what they will entail for the future.</P>
    <P>I am particularly gratified that the Minister tells us he is ensuring in the Bill that those who are insured at the moment will remain insured and those who have contracts with the company he intends to move against will be protected.  I wonder has the Bill been fully considered.  The D·il was in recess for about three months and would it not have been better to recall the D·il for one day or two days to discuss this very important matter of insurance?</P>
    <P>Introducing the Bill the Minister said that in the thirties the Irish Life Company was established and that it has been very successful, which is true.  I understand that company is owned as to 97 per cent by the Minister for Finance, that is, he holds the shares for the State in that company.  Has the Minister given any thought as to whether the State should adopt a similar approach to the question of general insurance?  Motorists are required by law to be insured, and would it not follow that the State should ensure that the cover which motorists are bound to have by law is provided by the State?</P>
    <P>As I said, it has not been possible to go into the Bill in too much detail.  I hope the time available to us will be spent in discussing the details of the sections.</P>

      <P>Anything one might say about this unhappy Bill before us now should be headed: &ldquo;The chickens have come home to roost&rdquo;, because they have. It is no harm, in the course of the necessarily brief remarks I will be in a position to make here this evening, to give some of the history of the long, drawn-out and tangled events that have led to this unhappy day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing that should be said is that while this is described as emergency legislation, the House should carefully note that it is permanent legislation.  It does not relate to just one company; it relates to every non-life company established in the State now or to be established <Col N="210" /> at any time in the future, both motor and non-motor.  It will form part of our legislation for all time, or for as long as it remains unrepealed.  Without any reference to individual companies or their difficulties, it is major insurance legislation.</P>
    <P>While I can understand the Minister's difficulties and fully sympathise with him, I must say it is a great pity that circumstances are such that this major legislation has to be debated in a rushed way. It will be impossible for anybody in this House, including the Minister, to put down amendments.  This legislation is technical, difficult and hard to read.  It has to be read in conjunction with three or four very complicated Acts to understand it properly.  I doubt if there is anyone in the House who had an opportunity since the Bill was published at 10.45 a.m. today to collate this Bill with all the other Acts referred to.  Even if we had the power, which we do not have, to put down amendments today, I doubt if we could put down meaningful amendments, and certainly not without consultation with people outside who are experts in this complicated field.</P>
    <P>This is permanent legislation, unlike emergency legislation which has been brought into this House from time to time.  I remember doing it myself when there was a riot one night in Mountjoy and I had to produce a Bill the following day.  We had a time limit of 12 months in that case and, if I recall correctly, that expired within the last 12 months.  This shows that things done in a hurry often tend to last for a long time.  We are doing something in a hurry now which will last for a long time.  This is permanent insurance legislation to cover all companies and ideally, it should be catered for more satisfactorily than this.</P>
    <P>The extent of the emergency can be gauged from the fact that we got our Order Paper in the post in the normal way this morning, and there is no reference to this Bill on it, although it is the first Bill with which we are dealing, but we got a Supplementary Order Paper with the Bill typed on it.  This is obviously of the greatest urgency because, as the Minister said, he proposes in respect of <Col N="211" /> one company to make an application to the High Court early tomorrow morning, assuming this House and Seanad …ireann pass this Bill and that sometime tonight the President will sign it, which, I presume, in the circumstances he will.  We are in a very unsatisfactory position because the Minister is the principal person involved in this debate and because of his position has felt constrained from naming the company concerned.  Deputy Flynn, quite properly, does not feel subject to the same constraints, but the Minister is a party to the proceedings which will be taken tomorrow morning and no other Members of the House is.  Therefore, other Members have reasonable freedom.</P>
    <P>The first thing that should be pointed out is that this is not a State rescue in financial terms.  This is not being paid for by the State.  This &ldquo;rescue&rdquo; is being paid for by every non-life policy holder in the country, and at great expense.  It is not just motor policy holders; every non-life or general policy holder will have to pay a levy of 2 per cent on his premium, on top of the levy of 1 per cent he is already paying to the Exchequer, making a total of 3 per cent.  That includes people who do not have and never had a motor car. It includes people who want to insure their houses or to take some other form of general insurance.  They are being penalised and will have to pay a levy of 2 per cent which, at current rates, will amount to £10 million a year.  This will be paid into a fund which the administrator will use, in conjunction with the cash flow he hopefully will generate, to pay the claims that are, or will be, due by the company in question.</P>
    <P>The House should advert to the fact that this is open-ended.  There is no date of cessation in this Bill.  It may go on forever, and that would not be fair.  The Minister has not yet given any indication if it is his intention to instruct the administrator when he gets the affairs of this company under control, to wind it down as opposed to winding it up.  Does the Minister consider that it would be advisable to wind it down, or is he prepared to see the situation go on indefinitely? <Col N="212" /> Alternatively, if the administrator is lucky enough to be able to put the affairs of this company back on a sound commercial and financial footing, will it be handed back to the owners or the present management?  That would be very unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>These matters need to be spelled out, because I do not think it is proper or appropriate to have this huge imposition hanging over policy holders or insurance companies for an indefinite number of years, or perhaps forever.  This is going to do considerable damage to the Irish insurance industry.  Unfortunately, because of the difficulties now encountered by this company, the Irish insurance industry is damaged severely.  It is six of one or half a dozen of another as to the manner in which it is damaged.  It is better that proper control is seen to be exercised in relation to the affairs of the company concerned.</P>
    <P>In relation to the company mentioned, there has been concern for a number of years.  I first became Minister in July 1977 and towards the end of that year I had reason to begin, in a very limited way, to feel certain concern.  During 1978-79 my concern deepened and arrangements were made by my Department to have the provisions which were made in the accounts of this company for claims to be examined by an expert.  It was found necessary to do that in three successive years. In the third year the expert drew my Department's attention to the fact that he was unhappy.  That caused further inquiries to be made and that culminated in the situation we find today.</P>
    <P>There was a major change made by the company in the presentation of their accounts in 1978.  Unlike other companies, from that year onwards they ceased to make annual revisions of their provision for claims.  Instead, they provided in their accounts what they described as a global float.  That gave rise to concern by officials in the Department and people in the industry and caused further and more careful examination to be made.  The situation did not improve.  I found it necessary on a number of occasions to have interviews with the managing director of the company concerned and they were <Col N="213" /> not among the friendliest of social chats I have had in my life.  I expressed the opinion that many of the investments which that insurance company were making were unwise and unsuitable for an insurance company.  I was told, as indeed were officials of the Department and other people who were advising experts from outside, that we did not know anything about the business and we should mind our own business.  I was faced, as the Minister is, with the difficulty that I was the supervisory authority for insurance here and as the situation developed I found myself in the unhappy position, as did the Department, that there were certain fairly drastic steps open to me but if I took them I was going to precipitate the very thing I was trying to avoid.</P>
    <P>It was unsatisfactory that under the 1936 Act it was, to a great extent, all or nothing.  One could wind up the company by bringing in a liquidator but short of that one was dependent on the co-operation of the company concerned.  It must be said that in my five years in that Department the co-operation of the company concerned was not forthcoming.  I have no reason to believe that it was forthcoming before my time, nor have I any reason to believe it was forthcoming afterwards.  In the Minister's position one is faced with a serious difficulty: does one precipitate the very crisis one is striving to avoid?  In the absence of co-operation it is not easy to avoid precipitation.</P>
    <P>One other power that was open to the Minister for Industry and Commerce under the Insurance Act, 1936 was to appoint inspectors but I was advised &mdash; I accepted the advice as realistic &mdash; that even to appoint inspectors for a large insurance company here would itself precipitate a crisis because it would be seen as belief on my part that the company was insolvent or heading for insolvency. In June 1982 I appointed inspectors in all but name.  They were not formal inspectors under the 1936 Act, they were not called as such and they did not have the statutory powers as such but they acted as such.  They were asked to go in and report on the claims provisions estimates of the company concerned.  Unfortunately, they took a long time to report. <Col N="214" /> I am not blaming them for that because they did not get any co-operation.  From the time they were appointed they took until August 1983 to produce a report which they felt was detailed, accurate and which they could stand over.  I am not privy to what was in the report but I believe it expressed considerable concern about the situation.  I believe the findings of the report were cross-checked by another group of expert consultants from outside the country and I understand that in recent weeks they came up with what was essentially confirmation of the original findings.  After that I believe the Minister acted quickly and produced the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister needed to wait for a second report but, on the other hand, perhaps if he did not he may be accused of rushing the gun.  I am not going to argue about that now.  The Bill before the House is by no means ideal and is obviously unsatisfactory in many respects.  However, the situation underlying it and causing it is grossly unsatisfactory. It is one way of dealing with a dreadful problem that is no more unsatisfactory than any other one.  If we had some weeks or months to debate this measure I am sure we would be in a position to come up with alternatives for the Minister but, in all honesty, at a few hours notice on a matter as urgent and as fundamental as this, I am not in a position to suggest detailed alternatives.  The obvious alternative is to let the company concerned go into liquidation but the consequences of that are pretty horrendous. If the worst consequences of liquidation can be avoided by this procedure then I wish the procedure well.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that the company concerned is part of a group that is very much more than just an insurance company. I believe that is part of the root of its trouble.  The basic root of its trouble is bad management over a long number of years and failure to take advice, but that is accentuated by the extent of the group of which it forms a part.  I understand that in that group there are at least &mdash; the number may be higher but it is certainly not lower &mdash; 74 different companies. They are all intertwined or interlinked <Col N="215" /> one into the other to one extent or another but all 74 of them are interdependant in one way or another, some totally so and some only partially so. Among those companies there is an industrial and provident society which has operated since about 1973 or 1974 as a bank.  When it came to notice in 1977 that there were 15 or 20 such industrial and provident societies operating as banks the Government decided that this was very undesirable and there was a loophole being used to circumvent the Central Bank Act, 1971 whereby very strict controls were put on the issuing of bank licences.  Unfortunately, that Act did not apply to industrial and provident societies because nobody at the time, the Department of Finance or the Central Bank, foresaw that industrial and provident societies would endeavour to carry on banking.  They were intended as small operations for local or co-operative effort.</P>
    <P>They were carrying on business as a bank, and quite a substantial one.  They held about £15 million in deposits from the public and other companies.  There were other industrial and provident societies at that time but their deposits and assets were smaller and their liabilities to the public were smaller.  I introduced in the House in 1978 a Bill to run those down gradually.  It was passed in November 1978 and gave a five year period for the running down of such banking type industrial and provident societies.  As I recall from my time in the Department most of the societies made a genuine and fairly speedy effort to run down their affairs and most of them did so without any difficulty.  There were difficulties with one or two and I believe one of them had to be sorted out in court but, as far as I can recall, the depositors did not lose out.  However, there was one society which defied the will of the Oireachtas for five years and continues to defy it to this day.  It has refused to make any effort to run down its industrial and provident banking society.  That society is directly related to the insurance company we are talking about today.  As I understand it it continues to defy the will of the Oireachtas <Col N="216" /> in this respect.  That type of attitude is typical of my experience &mdash; I know it is typical of the experience of others &mdash; in dealing with the group generally.</P>
    <P>If a co-operative and reasonable approach had been taken by the principal people involved in the company, and in the group, this difficulty would never have arisen.  The Department, and various Ministers, gave advice and made suggestions from time to time, and outside experts gave advice and made suggestions. They were not just rejected but were rejected in angry, peremptory and arrogant tones.  One of the disturbing features of this is the fact that property investments have continued to be made over a number of years which were clearly undesirable from the point of view of any company but particularly undesirable from the point of view of an insurance company, with its necessity to have a fair degree of liquidity and to have property of which it was relatively easy to dispose.  We have seen in the public press some of these property investments and their consequences.  One was, of all things, an investment in a newspaper which is not generally regarded as a goldmine, certainly not if it is not long established, as was the case here.  Another was a drapery store in this city that nobody else wanted, and which I understand nobody else still wants.  Another aspect was investment in garages all over the country, many of which have been closed for some time and are unsaleable.</P>
    <P>Another aspect that gives me grounds for concern and which has caused me concern for some time past but I was partly powerless to deal with it, although I dealt with it up to the point I could, was the fact that the group concerned has continued to sell shares in the group to gullible members of the public.  I understand the Stock Exchange removed the listing of the company about a year ago, and quite properly so, and of an associated company that was also quoted as a public company.  Nonetheless, the group concerned, through its industrial and provident society, continued to peddle shares to gullible members of the public. They have been selling them up to the past week or so at 40p or 42p each when, <Col N="217" /> of course, it is now clear that the shares were valueless.  It was clear to prudent investors over the past few years that the shares were valueless.  The unfortunate people who invested in them were not institutional investors or others who were in a position to take institutional or professional advice.  They were very small people buying a few hundred shares at the time because they were offered gimmicky cut-price offers on their insurance policy.  Presumably that is outside the jurisdiction of the Stock Exchange and presumably it is outside the jurisdiction of the Department also but it is something that should not be allowed to continue.  In calmer days when this is all over, the Minister should consider introducing legislation to prevent share offers of that kind.</P>
    <P>It gives me no pleasure to recall this, but in fairness to myself &mdash; and often I am a bit less than fair to myself &mdash; I should recall that in July 1982 there was a week's sustained abuse of me printed in the newspapers by the managing director of this company.  I could have quietened him and put an end to it in ten seconds flat by coming out and telling the truth but in interests of the company I could not come out and tell the truth. This is a difficulty a Minister finds himself in from time to time.  I just had to grin and bear it, or not grin and bear it.  It was very unsatisfactory that in the short-term the public were being given the impression that this company was everything it should be and that this unreasonable and terrible Minister was interfering in a most untoward way with it and trying to damage it.  I could have put a stop to that in ten seconds.  The answer to what was said in July 1982 is the existence of this Bill today and the fact that it has to be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas and signed by the President tonight, although it was only published at 10.30 a.m. today. That is the answer to what went on in July 1982.</P>
    <P>I noticed, as did others who were interested in these matters, that the 1982 accounts of the company concerned have not yet been published although it is a public company and they are obliged to publish them.  In itself that is a very significant <Col N="218" /> matter.  Since we had not seen the accounts by mid-October, I was expecting that something was going to happen.  Whether we will ever see the accounts now is another matter, because I presume the administrator is not under an obligation to publish them.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned many things that are relevant to this whole affair.  There are many other matters of which I am aware that are equally relevant but which I have chosen not to refer to because I do not think it appropriate to do so at the moment.  However, I can refer to them on another occasion if the necessity arises.</P>
    <P>While this Bill is all right as an emergency reaction to a drastic situation in the very short-term, it is not really satisfactory for the longer-term regulation of companies.  I agree with the point made by the Minister that up to now it was a case of the whole hog or nothing and that what was needed were some intermediate steps, that this is an <i>ad hoc</i>, intermediate step that is only appropriate to the situation of one company today.  In quieter times perhaps this Bill could be repealed or repealed in part and a more elaborate Bill, showing a series of intermediate steps and not just one intermediate step, should be enacted.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier I was very conscious of my relative powerlessness.  I disliked what was going on and I knew it was going to end in disaster but if I took the only step open to me under the law I would have caused the disaster.  It is better that the disaster happened in October 1983 than if it happened in 1980 or 1981.  I used to have limited problems when I was in the then Department of Industry and Commerce, much less than I had in other Departments and one of them was this company.  I once said to an official of the Department, &ldquo;when X insurance company goes under, please God I will not be sitting in this seat&rdquo;. Thank God I am not.</P>

      <P>I do not have the benefit of ministerial experience but I should like to give a contribution based on some information I picked up from the press and the last two reports on the motor insurance industry.</P>
      <P>I should like to commend the Minister on the decisive way in which he has intervened in this problem.  He has done so in the interests of the motorists who may be in a vulnerable situation and the staff of the particular insurance company that I do not choose to name.  I agree with Deputy Flynn that many people will be affected by the decision that will be taken tomorrow.  From reading the Bill it appears that one insurance company is involved.  The Bill is designed to cater for the needs of people who may be affected, both the staff and the motorists.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately it has taken emergency legislation to deal with the problem.  It continues to amaze me that on a serious matter like this people still resort to scoring political points.  It does not take an expert to state that the motor insurance industry is in a quagmire.  Recent reports of annual general meetings of some of the British-based motor insurance companies indicate that the motor insurance market here is in a state of chaos and is totally unattractive to these companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill will make the market even less attractive.  I must say that conscious of the fact that the Minister in his short nine months in office has done more in that time than any of his predecessors.  He acted recently on the 1982 report on the motor insurance industry by bringing forth 17 proposals on top of a previous decision to reduce the VAT and tariff area, which was one of the recommendations in the report.  I presume that, being the kind of man he is, he will act on the other recommendations in the 1982 report.  He will have to work on a great many sacred cows and a great many vested interests in order to implement some of the proposals.  As I said in a submission made to him earlier this year, there has been a lack of political commitment and will down through the years <Col N="220" /> in relation to implementing the long overdue reforms necessary.  I made this submission in the belief that he would carry out the necessary reforms, and I am awaiting further proposals from him. However the whole sad affair poses the question as to whether we would be having to introduce emergency legislation here now had the recommendations of the 1972 report been implemented.  We had ample opportunity to introduce those recommendations but that report was totally ignored.  None of the recommendations was implemented.  Coupled with this Bill there is now an added responsibility on the Minister to ensure that the Irish motor insurance market becomes attractive once more to major companies.</P>
    <P>I am not one normally in favour of the nationalisation of industry.  Neither do I like giving off the top of my head solutions to problems.  This problem has arisen overnight and it is because of that we are here now dealing with this Bill.  In the third last page, paragraph five of Appendix five of the 1982 report it is stated, dealing with profitability of motor insurance, that &ldquo;nonetheless we submit that it is evident overall that the 12 companies included in their calculations&rdquo;&mdash;they are named&mdash;&ldquo;did make a profit in 1979, 1980 and 1981&rdquo;.  As I said earlier, the whole business is in a state of chaos and I would ask the Minister seriously to consider the position.  The debate today is very limited. This is a major issue and time should be allowed for a more comprehensive debate on the whole motor insurance problem.  We looked for such a debate earlier but due to circumstances we did not get an opportunity to have such a debate.</P>
    <P>In connection with the 2 per cent levy, will that be on all insurance companies or will it be levied just on motor insurance?</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill. It is both necessary and timely.  I commend the Minister's concern in introducing the Bill.  I am particularly gratified that it is a Labour Minister who is introducing a measure designed to protect, in <Col N="221" /> the first instance, the policy holders in a company which may find itself in the unfortunate position adumbrated in the Bill.  The Bill is also designed to protect the jobs of workers who could be thrown out of employment at 12.00 on a given day in a situation in which their rights would be ignored, rights given under earlier legislation introduced by Labour Ministers in the Coalition Government from 1973 to 1977 &mdash; for example, the Minimum Notice in Terms of Employment Act, 1973, the Protection of Employment Act, 1977, the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977.  Were an insurance company to collapse at a minute's notice not alone would the policy holders find themselves in a position in which they might not be able to drive their cars home from wherever they happened to be but the accumulated rights of the workers would be negative and the workers would be naked before the law.  It is precisely to remedy that kind of catastrophe that this Bill is introduced.  It is a most timely measure.  While these matters were talked about in the past nothing was ever done.  A loophole is now being filled.</P>
      <P>There is a third category of people who would be involved.  I refer to those who invest their savings in ancillary companies attached to an insurance company. It has been said that the biggest investing element in the insurance industry is what is described as the lower middle class.  It is that type of socio-economic group who are most vulnerable in the event of a collapse.  With regard to the 2 per cent levy it must be pointed out that this is not just a tax.  There are those who might be tempted to man the barricades and say that this is just another form of taxation. Quite categorically it is not.  It is a fund set up under the 1964 Act designed to meet the type of contingency we are trying to cater for in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have here a press release which was issued in conjunction with the Minister's recent statements on his proposals to implement recommendations of the advisory committee of inquiry into the cost and methods of providing motor insurance on 30 December 1982.  He said then, relating to the general problems of <Col N="222" /> the motor insurance industry in the country, that the incidence of uninsured driving creates a direct loss for insurers and the insuring public in terms of premium income and through the need to compensate the victims of uninsured drivers by means of the insurance industry funded mechanism of the motor insurance bureau.  He said the Government will examine the means of having a proportion of the increased fines for uninsured drivers paid direct to the MIB.  He also went on to say that he recognised that the problems of the motor insurance industry required ongoing consideration and he proposed to establish a representative board to advise him on matters including premium rates, loadings and the availability of insurance cover.  He said he was also conscious of the need for adequate and up-to-date statistics to be kept by motor insurers to assist in the task of framing measures to meet problems which arise and he intended to take up this matter immediately with the industry.</P>
    <P>The question of uninsured driving is a very serious problem in this industry.  The figures we have available to us suggest that in France the figure is only 2 per cent of all drivers, in Sweden it is 1 per cent, in Italy, Spain and Switzerland the figure is practically negligible and in Germany, out of a total of 30 million drivers only 3,000 have been established as being uninsured.  In Ireland the situation is vastly different and amounts to a scandal, where there is an estimated 4 per cent of the total number of vehicles on the road uninsured.  It is difficult to verify those figures but the industry believes the figure is in that region.  I believe motor insurance should be compulsory and it should be a social insurance like occupational injuries where people are covered automatically.  We have very good examples in other countries where there is so much put on the price of a gallon of petrol to cover all accident victims. This means that all motorists are obliged to make a contribution.  Even uninsured drivers are caught in this net. That might be one way of ensuring that the criminals who are evading the law by driving uninsured vehicles make some <Col N="223" /> kind of contribution to offset the damage they cause.</P>
    <P>People will object to a 2 per cent levy being required from the other companies in the industry.  We will all be involved to some degree in this.  Is it not better to introduce that type of insurance to protect the hundreds of thousands of policy holders and the thousands of workers who could be caught in the collapse of a company and the small-term investors who would also be caught overnight?  It should be pointed out that the administration envisaged by the Government will have greater advantages than a liquidator or a receiver.  As a trade union official I have often been involved in cases where we were told that workers were out of jobs at a given hour on any one day without any prior notice.  A receiver was sent in and he was obliged under his mandate to put the company back into profitability.  That did not protect the workers.  In a liquidation situation areas of a company can be disposed of or sold off quickly to meet the obligations of the liquidator without much regard for the workers' rights in terms of employment. I am not talking about their rights as preferential creditors in such a situation.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank the Minister for his foresightedness in this situation and for moving in to protect policy holders, workers and small shareholders or investors in insurance companies and their ancillaries in the country.  It means that those people can sleep easy in their beds tonight or any night because of the results of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank the House for the very responsible manner in which they have reacted to this Bill and for their understanding of the necessity for this somewhat unusual procedure with regard to having all Stages taken in both Houses today and the request to the President to sign the Bill before the normal, five day lapse takes place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flynn in his opening remarks referred to the urgency of the Bill and questioned it.  He stated that it was <Col N="224" /> obvious that the Minister had some particular company in mind.  I clearly indicated in my opening speech that it is my intention on the passage of this Bill through the Oireachtas to move immediately in respect of one particular company. I am glad to say that it is appreciated by the House, and spelt out in clear terms by Deputy O'Malley, that as I will be a party to that application to the courts, it would be, to say the least, inadvisable and inappropriate that I should name the company or follow others down the road in the speculation that has been engaged in.  All my remarks on the discussion that has taken place are on the basis that the Bill as presented to the Oireachtas has general application.  Naturally, what applies to one company under the present law applies to any other company engaged in this type of business.</P>
    <P>My primary concern, when faced with this situation, which necessitated the introduction of this Bill to the House with the request that it be dealt with urgently, was the following: Under the law as it stands now and as Deputy O'Malley, very fairly, in a very balanced way and without attempting in any way to take political advantage of this situation, pointed out, the options open to me as the Minister responsible are very limited indeed.  Not only are they very limited but they can have disastrous effects on a large number of people who are absolutely blameless in this situation.  That is what I was faced with when this matter arose.  Over recent times we have all seen people being the victims of liquidations who had absolutely no hand, act or part to play in the policy pursued to bring them to that point but they paid the piper, and I was quite determined, and the Government agreed with me, that as far as humanly possible that situation would not apply in the case that I will be putting to the court tomorrow or in any other case that may arise that is covered by this proposed legislation. The result of operating purely on the basis of the present law would be that a large number of people who in good faith had paid their premiums, who had coverage, whether car coverage or other types of non-life coverage, and may have paid them only last week or last month, <Col N="225" /> would find themselves overnight without cover.  As I said in my Second Reading speech, one of the difficulties that has confronted this society and the insurance industry is the large number of people who are driving uninsured cars and that has a direct relationship to the cost of the premiums of motor car insurance, and the Government on the recommendation of a committee set up by the National Prices Commission adopted a considerable number of measures in the recent past to try to cope with that situation. Can we envisage what the circumstances would be if people were to find themselves overnight, through no fault of their own, without coverage?</P>
    <P>On the other aspect of insurance companies depending on the volume of business, there is a considerable amount of employment.  By the approach which I am proposing to the House now it is more than likely that that employment can be saved &mdash; not guaranteed but the prospects of it being retained increase immeasurably if this legislation is passed and if the courts see fit to appoint an administrator under the terms of this legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn asked the valid question, if an administrator can go in and operate this company and bring it back to a healthy, viable position, why cannot the present administration of the company that I have in mind do the same thing?  There are two reasons.  If they were doing the right thing we would not be in the position we are in now, and also surely there is no suggestion that we should create a compensation fund levy up to a ceiling of 2 per cent on all non-life policy covers and make that money available to a management of a company for whom I, under the obligations placed upon me, see fit on the basis of the information available to me to go into court tomorrow and ask that the administrator be appointed.  Surely that would be to take an unreasonable approach.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn also raised the question about what kind of investigation was done, who was informed and whether I approached other insurance companies and discussed this matter with them.  I would like to make it quite clear beyond <Col N="226" /> all doubt that I have had no discussion of any kind or nature with any other insurance company.  There is continuing contact between the officials in my Department and all insurance companies in day-to-day business, and in respect of certain insurance companies there are meetings at ministerial level depending on the degree or the nature of the matter to be discussed, and Deputy O'Malley as a former Minister gave indications of his relationship with a particular insurance company.</P>
    <P>I emphasise again that I am talking in general terms as this Bill applies generally to the whole industry.  If Deputy Flynn &mdash; rightly, and he would have a responsibility to be so &mdash; is concerned that the rights of any individual or any groups of individuals were not being given proper cognisance by me, as Minister, he can rest assured.  I have not the power to appoint an administrator.  I have not the power to put a company into liquidation.  All I can do is make an application to the court, who will take everyone's interest into consideration before they decide on this matter.  I think we can all safely rely on the courts in considering any application which may be made in respect of a company to take everyone's interest in a fair and equitable way into consideration.  I am sure that all Members of the House would agree with me that if I am told that a company is in a state of insolvency and if there is clear expert evidence to that effect, for me to take any action before having this type of legislation passed in both Houses which would minimise the effects of such an event would be irresponsible in the public interest in so far as all sorts of things could happen between that event and the application and the hearing by the court, and to my mind none of these happenings would be in the best interest of the Irish public.</P>
    <P>Also on the question of what I did and what other people did in the past to ensure that proper supervision of insurance companies was carried out, again speaking from his own personal experience, although he was relating it to a particular company and to general terms, Deputy O'Malley pointed out that <Col N="227" /> there were very definite inhibitions on any Minister taking certain courses of action which might be open to him by virtue of the fact that in taking such action what he was trying to avoid as the final outcome would be precipitated.  This proposed legislation is necessary to avoid total disaster for very many people in the event of matters going beyond the point of recovery.</P>
    <P>There is also another extremely important aspect.  While the Department and the Minister have responsibility for supervising the solvency of insurance companies, that responsibility can only be discharged effectively and properly if the professional people who are charged with making returns to the Department on behalf of these companies do so in both a competent and an honest manner. This may not always be the case.  Because it is such a crucial chain in the supervisory process in which the Department must engage, we must take a very close look indeed at those charged with this responsibility, to see how they discharge their obligations.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that my Department get co-operation from the vast majority of people in insurance with whom they have to deal and a sense of responsibility and a compliance with the necessary rules and regulations.  However, there are exceptions, and these could lead us into the difficulties with which the House is faced.</P>
    <P>I wish to convey to Deputy O'Malley my appreciation of his forthright, honest approach to this legislation.  He said quite rightly that it is regrettable that this form of legislation should have to be dealt with in such a short period of time.  It does not give a full opportunity for the normal debate and querying that one would like in respect of legislation of this nature.  I agree that this is a major, radical change. However, it is not possible under these circumstances, without possibly doing untold damage, to have a full debate at this time.  I do not regard this as the ultimate in legislation to deal with the whole insurance field.  There will be further opportunities in the not too distant future for the House to have a less hurried <Col N="228" /> and urgent discussion of the many difficulties existing with regard to the insurance business.  I would be only too happy to facilitate such a debate.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked about the position with regard to subsidiaries or businesses connected with the main insurance body. I shall quote what I said in my speech on Second Stage in connection with the administrator using the funds for other than non-life business&mdash;</P>
    <P>That would be totally impractical and unrealistic and it would be unreasonable to expect policyholders to provide funds to rescue enterprises outside the insurance sector.</P>
    <P>The following is the part I wish to emphasise:</P>
    <P>On the other hand, it seems safe to make the general assumption that where the main enterprise in a group is being rehabilitated, the effects on connected enterprises must be beneficial.</P>
    <P>One of the dangers of having to take hurried measures like this, particularly when one cannot go into the entire background of all the factors in relation to a particular company at this stage, is that the city is rife with rumours.  I heard many while going along the corridors.  My main objective here is to ensure that the policyholders will not be affected in any way, irrespective of what company it is that I am seeking to deal with in the courts, if the appointment of an administrator is accepted.  The purpose of this approach is to ensure that they are not affected and are not only not affected now but that they can reinsure with confidence with the same company because it will be run by the administrator answerable to the courts and will have available to it the resources of the compensation fund.</P>

      <P>The court may consider that they would not want to appoint an administrator for a long period of time, and there is provision in the Bill for the court to appoint a provisional administrator for a period of time which would allow them to hear other interested parties and to have a full presentation of the case, before making a final decision.  On the legal advice available to me, I am confident that the court will adopt the course embodied in this legislation when passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>I sympathise with the Minister and commend him for what he is doing here.  However, in deference to existing companies who have not come under his notice, is it wise to be searching for anonymity when everybody knows that we are speaking about a specific company? Would it not be better, so that the rumours to which the Minister refers and the uncertainty that may occur would not extend to genuine, bone fide companies, that the statement, if it is the case, might come from the Minister himself?  Otherwise all other companies would be tarred with the same brush.</P>

      <P>Personally I find it frustrating and inhibiting in dealing with this subject that I cannot do as the Deputy requests.  I accept the validity of the point he is making that it is somewhat up in the air for a limited period of time and that that is very unsatisfactory.  That is why I am at such great pains to say that, irrespective of what company it is, the chances of the retention of employment and the assurance that the policies of policy holders will continue to be honoured must be emphasised.</P>
      <P>I am advised that, because I will be a party to the application to the court, it could be a factor that would militate against a successful court application were I to name a particular company at this point.</P>

If the application for the appointment of administrator is delayed by the company involved, if they contest the appointment of an administrator and this is debated in the court for a number of days, what is the legal situation?

In those circumstances would the Minister not be so openly confident of the outcome of the application, particularly as there is a possibility &mdash; I do not know &mdash; that the application will be contested?  The courts would like to feel that the ultimate decision by them is a matter on which they would make up their own minds.  There can be no certainty in advance as to how they might decide.  The suggestion put forward by Deputy Burke is a possibility. It is not an impossibility.  It would be a pretty horrendous one.  The Minister would be well advised to have some contingency plan to cope with it.</P>

      <P>I accept entirely that the final decision as to whether or not to appoint an administrator or to accept the application made in my name is strictly a matter for the court.  I was explaining to the House in reply to Deputy Burke that the legal opinion available to me, having gone into this thoroughly, is that this application, on the basis of the presentation made, would be conceded by the court.  As the Deputy said, this is a matter for the courts, and I would not attempt <Col N="233" /> to usurp their jurisdiction or authority. That is the advice available to me.</P>
      <P>As Deputy O'Malley points out clearly, the alternative would be to approach the court for a winding up.  That would be a disaster, in my opinion.  I do not anticipate having to do that.  As far as contingency plans are concerned, I can assure the House that when I was presented, not very long ago, with the present situation, after a great deal of thought and a tremendous amount of work by the officials of my Department in particular and by legal people, we came up with this legislation which would diminish very greatly the catastrophic effects of just proceeding along the lines open to us under the present law.</P>

My reply was that there were two reasons I did not believe that could happen. First, the company must accept some responsibility for the present situation, and second, they would not, should not and could not have access to the compensation fund which would be available to the administrator, which would be an essential element in restoring the company to a viable position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this section the Minister will petition the court.  I take it that in petitioning the court the Minister will have to produce evidence of a case against a particular company to convince the court that the petition will succeed. Do I take it that the recommendations of the various reports which lead the Minister to take that step will be available in the court tomorrow morning?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 (1) refers to the appointment of the administrator.  The general public would be concerned to know what kind of administrator the Minister has in mind. Will he have considerable experience and expertise in the motor insurance field, or will he be a member from an accountancy firm, or what?  Section 2 (1) says &ldquo;notwithstanding <Col N="235" /> that there is or may be another remedy or course of action available to him in relation to such insurers.&rdquo; That being the case, and irrespective of whether the Minister believes today that there was a possibility that an alternative option might have been successful, he still has power to proceed in this way.  I take the view that in the petition to the court if the insurer can establish that he has assets capable of dealing with any commitments he might have to face, this section could not succeed.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that this matter could not have arisen overnight.  In my Second Stage speech I referred to the question of supervision which is directly under the control of the Minister.  The great disparity between the commitments now facing that insurer did not happen overnight.  It might be difficult to convince the High Court that the petition should succeed in those circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Flynn raised a number of points.  First he asked if the course of action open to the Minister was the only one, and, if there were other courses open to him, would he still adopt this one and look for an administrator to be appointed by the courts.  He also asked about the presentation that would be made to the court.  As I said in my Second Stage speech, a petition which will include affidavits will be made to the court tomorrow and any relevant information the court requests to enable it to make a judgement will be made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not appoint an administrator.  I apply to the court on the basis of evidence I have that a company is no longer solvent. I have direct responsibility under law to do that, but it is for the court to decide if my assertion is valid.  After considering the petition, the affidavit and other relevant information it may request, the court will make that decision. If it decides to concede that the application is justified, under the present legislation it can do so by appointing a provisional administrator for a limited period which would enable him to go further into the matter and allow other <Col N="236" /> interested parties to make their presentation. In the ultimate it is the court that will decide.  If the court decides to appoint an administrator that person will not be answerable to the Minister but to the court.  That administrator will also be answerable to the court and have, under certain circumstances, to go back to the court for permission to exercise certain of the rights he may have, if the court decided to make the appointment.</P>

      <P>This being the key section of the Bill I should like to avail of the opportunity of complimenting the Minister on bringing in the legislation and his officials for tackling the matter in this way.  I should also like to congratulate Deputy O'Malley who as Minister suffered considerable abuse from a set of directors in one company.  I was Minister of State in his Department and I am aware of many of the details of the company, assuming it is the company involved.  I congratulate all concerned with bringing in the legislation to protect the interests of the policy holders.  The Minister told the House that the administrator would be responsible only on the insurance side.  If the company concerned is the one I am thinking of it is a deck of cards in that there are 74 different companies involved.  They will be key to the success or otherwise of the task of the administrator.  How can an administrator separate the operations of the companies bearing in mind that they are all financially interlinked?  Will the Minister explain that?</P>

      <P>We are hopping from one section to another and I am doing my best to cope with the questions raised although the relevant sections are not mentioned.  As I understand it a number of insurance companies have subsidiary and related bodies.  They can have property <Col N="237" /> and other businesses.  There is provision in the Bill for the administrator to exercise control over subsidiary bodies but there are other related bodies.  In the case of them it depends on the degree of relationship between them and the insurance company, on the type of operation involved.  It is important to note that the administrator would have power in the event of any subsidiary body, or any other body, doing anything detrimental to him in the exercise of his main function of carrying on the business as a going concern on a day to day basis, or trying to prevent him doing something, to apply to the court for an order.  If I read the relevant section it would be more helpful to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I am looking for an assurance on this section.  In dealing with an insurance company of a large size there may be thousands of court proceedings in existence at any one time where the company is indemnifying the defendant in such proceedings.  I should like an assurance from the Minister that there is not any question of those proceedings being affected.  I should like an assurance that where judgment is obtained by a <Col N="238" /> plaintiff in such proceedings there will be no difficulty presented to the plaintiff in executing.  There is a prohibition against execution of a judgement written into section 3.  Some provision will have to be made to cover this, but I am concerned that the courts will be blocked up with people making applications under this section to cover, perhaps, a personal injuries action worth, perhaps, £500 or £600.  I would be grateful if the Minister would reassure me on that point.</P>
      <P>Other applications can be made to the court.  I believe that under section 76 of the Road Traffic Act 1961, where there is a difficulty or a question raised by an insurance company over their policy of insurance it is open to an aggrieved or injured party to make an application to the High Court to nominate the insurance company concerned as defendant in the proceedings.  How will situations like that be dealt with?</P>

That administrator will conduct the business without any restraint except the normal restraint imposed by commercial and business practices.  I do not foresee any difficulty in that regard.  I have pointed out that any obligations in regard to contract of employment, transactions, debts and so on will not be affected by the appointment of an administrator. There would be no change in their liability with regard to normal debts or business practices in the carrying on of the day to day business of the company.</P>

I am worried that in ordinary running down actions, of which there are thousands in relation to the biggest insurance company in the country, it may be necessary for plaintiffs to make a particular application under this subsection.

      <P>The same thought that occurred to Deputy Molony occurred to me.  If one reads the subsection carefully one will see that the reference to attachment, sequestration, distress or execution is against the property or effects of the insurer, the company.  One cannot distrain against it, but one does not need to distrain against it if the administrator pays the judgment, which he will do in the normal course of business.  It would only be a case where the administrator thought it inappropriate that one would have to apply to the court for consent to levy distress.</P>

I realise the Minister is constrained in his freedom to discuss the affairs of the company in respect of which he proposes to make an application tomorrow.  The organisation is massive.  Could we have an assurance from the Minister that he is confident the administrator will be in a position on the day he is appointed by the court to say that everything will roll on without any stopping, or will the administrator have to examine the affairs of the company to any extent that would cause delay?  That is the reason I see the danger of the problem to which I have referred.</P>

      <P>As I explained earlier, a very large section of the Companies Act that would apply to a liquidator would also apply to the administrator, but there are certain modifications in that that would militate against him performing his main function, which would be to carry on the business and not to wind it up.  In that regard, certain sections of the Companies Act do not apply.  That would <Col N="240" /> leave the situation as Deputy O'Malley has explained it.</P>

      <P>The section deals with the powers of the administrator.  Once this emergency legislation is passed it can be applied to any insurer, solvent or insolvent without further reference to this House.  That being the case, it seems to me that these powers are quite extensive. While they may be necessary to deal with one particular case the Minister has in mind for the petition tomorrow morning, it might not be necessary to have global powers like this to deal with all other petitions.  The range is quite extensive.  It allows the administrator to sell off real and personal assets of the company without restriction on him as to the best time to do that.  When one considers that the company I referred to would rely to a substantial degree for its realisable assets on its diversified interests and subsidiaries over the years &mdash; I cannot quantify what they might realise in hard cash now &mdash; it is giving an open hand to the administrator to do as he wishes in liquidating many of the assets of a particular company. While it might be acceptable in dealing with one isolated case named here, with the back-up of the reports before the House which will form the basis of the submission of the petition tomorrow morning by the Minister, at the same time these powers can be amended by order of the Minister without further reference to this House.  It must be realised that this section is very extensive.  It might lead to an attitude by another administration or another Minister that would be contrary to the attitude of the Minister present in this House.</P>

      <P>Quite frankly, I find it difficult to follow the point made by Deputy Flynn.  Surely he is not suggesting that we will zoom on one company?  This legislation has general application.  The fact that there is a company to which I think the legislation would be applicable is another matter.  There has to be a clear distinction between the role of the Oireachtas and the role of the courts. The role of the Oireachtas is to frame <Col N="241" /> legislation as a guideline, setting out parameters within which the court may operate and interpret the legislation.  It is suggested that this legislation could be applied to any company, but I would refer the House to the closing remarks of Deputy O'Malley.  I emphasise that he was speaking of a particular company but I am talking in general terms.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be amazed at the number of things I have neither denied nor confirmed.  Deputy O'Malley said that he told a senior member in the Department that when this bomb exploded he hoped he would not be in the Department.  Is Deputy Flynn seriously suggesting that a Minister would initiate these kind of proceedings in the courts against a company just for the sake of doing that?  It is not something one relishes having to do but it is necessary. Any fears that a Minister would do this because he felt bored and had nothing better to do are, to say the least, extremely remote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously the Minister misunderstood me.  I was saying the Minister can apply the provisions of this legislation. The ideal way to deal with legislation of this kind is for the Minister to bring it in in a normal way and allow it to go through in the normal way and apply the terms of the legislation at a future date if that should be required.  It seems to me that the Minister can utilise this legislation without reference to the Oireachtas in dealing with any company. Emergency means exactly what it says. The Minister wishes to have the legislation framed in this way to deal with a company that I named and which the Minister has not confirmed or denied. While we must, in principle, have legislation to deal effectively with matters, at the same time we must not be rushed into giving powers that can be varied by ministerial order without reference to the D·il and without giving the matter due consideration.</P>

      <P>It is worth drawing attention to section 3 (6) (a) which is extraordinarily wide.  I should like to have some understanding of the Minister as to the extent to which it could ever be used.  The subsection allows the Minister by order to modify any provision of the Companies Acts, 1963 to 1983, and any instruments made thereunder or any rules, or any rules of court relating thereto, which is just about everything conceivable and, of course, it has the effect of allowing Acts of this House to be amended by order of the Minister in private and without debate.  In principle that is objectionable.  That has been said in this House many times.  If the House or the Oireachtas, generally after long debate, enacts certain Acts of the Oireachtas such as the Companies Act 1963, which took a very long time, it should not be lightly amended.  It should be amended only by a further Act of the Oireachtas.  I can see that there could be short-term emergencies as in the administration of this Bill, but will the Minister give an assurance that this power will only be exercised in relation not just to the Bill generally but in relation to a company which is the subject of an application under section 2?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as I would not envisage having to use the powers conferred on me except in relation to a company that was under administration, I think the Deputy will agree this is not an unusual provision in legislation.  It is already in existing legislation.  It is modelled on section 395 and section 396 of the Companies Act, 1963.  It also has the safeguard that any regulation made under this Bill must be placed before both Houses of the Oireachtas and it can be annulled by the Oireachtas at any time within 21 sitting days after being made. There are safeguards.  The provision is not an unusual one.  What I would envisage is a major radical change in insurance law.  These are uncharted waters to some extent and there can be certain teething difficulties in its initial application on the appointment of an administrator which render it necessary to have these powers in order to overcome difficulties that <Col N="243" /> might arise.  I can assure the Deputy it is not my intention to use these powers except in cases of companies actually under administration.</P>

      <P>While others can speculate as to which company they have in mind I am not in the business of speculation. I cannot afford the luxury of speculation. I am talking about a Bill that is of general application.  In reply to the Deputy's question in relation to any company that might find itself the subject of a successful application to the courts for the appointment of an administrator, in my opinion it could not be successful and could not restore itself to solvency except under the provisions of the Bill which would, first of all, change the management <Col N="244" /> and, secondly, would make available to it very considerable sums under the proposed compensation fund.</P>

      <P>Lest the impression be given that the State is stepping in &mdash; I am referring to the question asked by Deputy Flynn about nationalisation &mdash; let it be clearly understood that the State is not stepping in here.  This is being paid for by every insurance policy holder in the country. It is a considerable imposition on them and it will be very expensive.  It talks of a minimum of £10 million a year for God knows how many years, and that is one of the reasons why I expressed hope of some termination date.  This is going to be very expensive.  It is not being paid for by the policy holders of a particular insurance company now in trouble but by those who were wise enough to go to other companies and, what is worse, it is being paid for also by non-motor policy holders.  It will put up the cost of home insurance, personal accident insurance, fire insurance, theft insurance and all the other things which have nothing whatever to do with motor vehicles at all. There is great variety of insurance.  We agreed pretty readily today that this is some kind of manna that has come down from heaven to solve the problem.  The fact is that ordinary policy holders will have to pay through the nose because of the consistent mismanagement of one company.  It is very regrettable that that should be so but, in all circumstances, I suppose it cannot be avoided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept it will impose an additional burden on policy holders in the non-life sector but, quite frankly, I could not go along with the disastrous imposition implied by Deputy O'Malley. Let us look at it realistically.  The maximum will be 2 per cent on the premium. I discussed in general terms the provisions of the Bill with a colleague today and he told me his insurance was costing him £320.  He was with this particular company for six months.  As the law stands the only course open to me is to put a particular company into liquidation. In that case this man's policy is gone.  The unearned premium has still six <Col N="245" /> months to go.  If the maximum is applied it would cost him approximately £6 for the year.  If the Bill does not go through it will cost him £160.  That is that aspect of it.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, talking about non-life, there are also advantages in so far as the maximum an insurer can be asked to pay is 2 per cent on the premium; but, if you are placed in a similar situation, you have access to the compensation fund not only for motor insurance but for other non-life insurance which may be covered.  It is not all losses.  There must be a certain degree of security in the minds of insured people if this legislation goes through.  While I accept that there would be some imposition on the insuring public in the non-life area it is not as dramatic or as draconian as has been suggested.  There are certain pluses involved in that also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is reasonable that the administrator would have the powers.  Is it envisaged that he will exercise the powers for the benefit of the insurance company solely?  Will he run down or sell off the assets of some of these connected bodies like industrial and provident societies, building societies, friendly societies and other bodies of various kinds that are the owners of properties of various kinds?  Will he sell those off, run them down and pay the funds back into the insurance company for the benefit of the policy holders and the third party claims in order to reduce the amount by which the administrator would otherwise have to have recourse to the compensation fund?  Surely his obligation is to minimise his calls on the compensation fund and he has no obligations, moral or legal, to seek to benefit the connected bodies?  It is the insurance company that this legislation is about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the legislation the administrator would have very wide powers that would normally be given to a liquidator.  He could in certain circumstances sell off property that was subsidiary or connected with the company. When I was speaking on the Second Stage I mentioned the question of related companies. I made it clear that while the primary responsibility of the administrator would be to run the business on a day to day basis with a view to restoring it to solvency &mdash; that is his main responsibility &mdash; and that the funds from the compensation fund could not be used in respect of related or subsidiary companies or businesses, that it was only reasonable <Col N="247" /> that while the parent insurance company was secure and was being managed prudently, that that would have a beneficial effect on other related companies that might be in danger.</P>
      <P>It is conceivable that because of the inter-relationship between a number of insurance companies and other subsidiary companies that they have, property companies and so forth, that one of these companies could owe the insurance company a considerable sum of money.  The administator would be in a position to demand the immediate return of that sum of money and pursue it, but he would also be in a position to take the view that if he did that it would put that related company out of business and cause unnecessary hardship and unemployment. This would be a matter he would have to determine.  He would also, in relation to these matters, have recourse to the courts.  He may find that there are certain circumstances which arise in which he would like the guidance of the courts and that he could apply to the court for such guidance.  The main thing is that he would have free scope to act as he determined in the best interests of his primary consideration, the insurance company, and that the only restraints that would be put on him would be the normal restraints that would operate in a prudent commercial enterprise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to grant to British citizens resident here the right to vote at D·il elections, presidential elections and referenda on conditions identical to those applying in the case of Irish citizens.  Under existing law, British citizens are already entitled to vote at local elections and at elections to the European Parliament.</P>
      <P>Section 1 of the Bill proposes that a British citizen shall be entitled to be registered as a D·il elector in a constituency if he has reached the age of 18 years and if, on the qualifying date, which is 15 September, he or she is ordinarily resident in that constituency.  Once registered as a D·il elector, he will will be entitled under section 26 of the Electoral Act, 1963, to vote at D·il elections in that constituency.  In accordance with sections 51 and 70 of the Electoral Act, 1963, he will also be entitled to vote at presidential elections and referenda.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a short and simple one consisting of a single operative section.  It is, however, a significant measure having important constitutional and political implications.</P>
      <P>Taking first the constitutional question, Article 16.1.2∫ of the Constitution provides that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every citizen without distinction of sex who has reached the age of eighteen years who is not disqualified by law <Col N="250" /> and complies with the provisions of the law relating to the election of members of D·il …ireann, shall have the right to vote at an election for members of D·il …ireann.</P>
    <P>In the past, the view was sometimes taken that the grant of the right to vote in a D·il election under this Article was exclusive to citizens and that it was not open to the Oireachtas to grant a similar right to others without first amending the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Recent consideration of this matter has led to the view that where the Constitution guarantees certain rights to a particular category it does not necessarily follow that the Oireachtas is inhibited from granting similar rights by law to other categories.  Two previous Attorneys General had advised the then Government that the Bill would not contravene the Constitution.  Their advice was summarised by the then Taoiseach in the D·il on 10 April 1981 &mdash; Official Report, Volume 328 Column 710 &mdash; as follows: &ldquo;There is a fairly clearcut legal opinion which I am inclined to accept that the referendum would not be necessary&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We are proceeding on the basis that the appropriate legal advice available to the Government indicates that what is proposed in this Bill is compatible with the provisions of the Constitution.  The present Attorney General has referred to the clear fact that there is no express restriction of the franchise conferred by Article 16.1 of the Constitution.  However, he has also drawn attention, as have his predecessors, to the fact that this question of the exclusivity or otherwise of the rights granted to citizens by the Constitution has never been authoritatively decided by the Supreme Court so that it is not possible that any advice given in the absence of such a decision would be authoritative and completely conclusive.  In such circumstances, should the President &mdash; in the exercise of his absolute discretion, of course, which I emphasise &mdash; see fit to refer this Bill to the Supreme Court, such a reference would have the very considerable advantage of removing all possibility of doubt <Col N="251" /> from such a vital area as the validity of our electoral law.</P>
    <P>The aim of this Bill is to give a further measure of practical expression to what has been referred to as the unique relationship which exists between this country and our nearest neighbour, and to acknowledge and reciprocate the voting rights enjoyed by Irish citizens in Britain. It is my hope that measures such as this, reflecting close ties between neighbouring peoples, will make their contribution to promoting peace and reconciliation throughout these islands.</P>
    <P>This Bill, if enacted, will confer voting rights on every British citizen ordinarily resident here who has reached the age of 18 years.  There is no official information as to the precise number who will benefit from the measure but it is estimated that it will be in the region of 10,000 to 12,000. In this connection, some British citizens already have voting rights by virtue of the fact that they hold both Irish and British citizenship.</P>
    <P>A brief word about British citizenship may be appropriate.  Formerly the expression used tended to be &ldquo;British subject&rdquo; which covered a very large number of people indeed.  The British Nationality Act, 1981, distinguished three different classes of British citizenship &mdash; British Citizenship, British Dependent Territories Citizenship, and British Overseas Citizenship.  The benefits of the present Bill will apply only to the first named category, that is, to British citizens.  In effect, this means to citizens of the United Kingdom.  There is no question of extending the franchise to nationals of Commonwealth countries or of British territories.</P>
    <P>By conferring on British citizens living here a right which Irish citizens have enjoyed in Britain for a long time, this Bill will redress an imbalance in the voting entitlements as between the two countries.  I believe that most people will consider that this is in itself a sufficient justification for the Bill.  In addition it is to be hoped, as I have already mentioned, that this gesture by the Oireachtas on behalf of the Irish people will be seen as a worthwhile contribution <Col N="252" /> towards improving relations and understanding between all the people of these islands.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I would like to say that the Fianna F·il Party support the principle that British citizens resident in Ireland should have the legal right to vote in D·il …ireann election.  The House will recall that the leader of the Fianna F·il Party, Deputy Haughey then Taoiseach, informed the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher, at their Summit meeting in 1980 that he would agree to reciprocate the voting rights enjoyed by Irish citizens in British parliamentary elections by the extension of the same rights to British citizens living in Ireland. The Fianna F·il Party, therefore, welcome this Bill inasmuch as it fulfils the commitment of the leader of our party. We in Fianna F·il recognise that the British citizens who have settled in Ireland have made a valuable contribution to the social and economic development of the State and believe that they should now enjoy the same voting rights as Irish citizens living in Britain.</P>
      <P>However, in considering why and how it should be done and how it is being done, many questions arise.  In considering why we should extend voting rights to British citizens, we might usefully look back at the background to the voting rights enjoyed by the Irish in Britain.  It is not for any brotherly love of thy neighbour that the Irish are allowed to vote in British parliamentary elections to this day.  In the United Kingdom, foreigners &mdash; or aliens as they are known in British law &mdash; have been debarred for centuries from voting in elections for the House of Commons or from sitting as members of the House.  An alien is disqualified, both at common law and by statute.  As far back as 1698, the unaminous vote of the House of Commons debarred aliens from voting in elections or sitting as members. This is the law to the present day, where their right to vote or sit as members of the House of Commons is debarred by statute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Traditionally, the policy reasons for excluding foreigners, or aliens, from having <Col N="253" /> voting rights in the United Kingdom is to restrict the influence of foreigners in their national affairs.  Prior to 1922 no question could have arisen, as far as the British were concerned, as to whether an Irishman was a foreigner or an alien because of the colonial status of Ireland. Even after 1922, this question again could not arise because of the legal status of Ireland as one of His Majesty's dominions. Between 1922 and the passing of the Republic of Ireland Act, 1949, the State was, in British law, as much a part of British territory for the purpose of nationality law as the United Kingdom itself.  Since 1949, citizens of Ireland are not, in British law, aliens or foreigners and Ireland is not a foreign country.  The British Parliament in all relevant enactments has steadfastly refused to recognise, or avoided recognising the state of, as British statute law describes it, the Republic of Ireland as a foreign country. While the statute law in Britain recognises the citizens of the Republic of Ireland or citizens of Eire, as a distinct group or classification, they are still not aliens or foreigners for the purposes of British nationality law, or electoral law.</P>
    <P>Have the Government considered these matters and the reasons for the decisions which they have taken with regard to them?  I would also like to know if the position of Irish citizens born in the Republic and living in the Six Counties, Northern Ireland, is concerned here.  At present they can vote in Westminister elections, in European and local elections but not in parliamentary Stormont or Assembly elections.  Therefore, the situation in Northern Ireland is different from that in Britain, where there are no such restrictions.  Have the Government had discussions with the British on these matters and if so, what has been the outcome?</P>
    <P>The Bill, in its terms, does not simply seek to grant a right to British citizens to vote in D·il elections but rather entitles them to be registered as D·il electors in the constituency in which they reside. Therefore a British citizen who is registered as a D·il elector will be entitled to vote in D·il elections, in presidential elections and at referenda on amendments <Col N="254" /> to the Irish Constitution.  The Minister referred to the voting rights being granted on a reciprocal basis.  However, the right to vote in the election of a Head of State is obviously not reciprocal because, of course, the electorate of Britain have no say in who becomes their Head of State.  Similarly, while British citizens will have a right to vote on amendments to the basic law of the State at constitutional referenda, there is no corresponding right to Irish citizens in the United Kingdom.  Therefore Irish citizens in the United Kingdom have no say, directly or indirectly, in the membership of their Upper House, the House of Lords.</P>
    <P>Of course, the status of Irish citizens in the United Kingdom was never governed by any consideration of reciprocity since it stems directly from the colonial status of the country over centuries and even as part of His Majesty's dominions until 1948.  Coupled with this political status, there were undoubtedly socio-economic considerations where, for example, Ireland was always considered part of the United Kingdom labour market and treated, indeed, as a source of cheap labour, which also helped to keep down the price of labour in the United Kingdom. The large number of settled Irish communities in the United Kingdom at the time when we pulled out of the Commonwealth made it impracticable as well as politically impossible for the United Kingdom Government to treat Irish citizens as foreigners or aliens for the purpose of the electoral law, or indeed otherwise. For these and many other reasons of self-interest, Irish citizens retain the right and have it to this day, not because the UK Government has given the right to foreigners, but, as pointed out, because it refuses to acknowledge Irish citizens as foreigners, or Ireland, indeed as a foreign country.</P>
    <P>Because Ireland and its people have been considered, in British minds and British law, as a vassal state and its denizens accordingly allowed to vote, there is the danger that the proposed Bill will be seen as an acknowledgement on our part of that status by singling out British citizens only as being entitled to receive <Col N="255" /> allegedly reciprocal rights under our electoral law.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister given consideration to the extension of voting rights to all foreigners living here?  Indeed, a case for granting foreigners resident here a right to vote could be approached in two ways, firstly on the ground that it would be just to do so in respect of foreigners who have been resident here for a specified number of years and paying taxes or, secondly, that we should grant reciprocal rights to the nationals of a foreign country in which Irish citizens have the same rights. Neither approach would justify the passing of a Bill confining the right to vote to British citizens by legislative enactment. Neither approach would justify in principle a singling out of Britain from all nations of the world as a country which should be given special status by legislation in this context.  Certainly, one could justify confining such legislative reform so as to affect EEC countries and their nationals only.  On the basis of the first approach, the legislative reform would involve simply giving voting rights to nationals of all EEC countries resident in Ireland for a minimum number of years or simply resident in the country without any such qualifications.</P>
    <P>If voting rights are to be granted on a reciprocal basis, then such legislation should provide that citizens of any member state of the European Community may be granted reciprocal voting rights in parliamentary elections where Irish citizens have substantially corresponding rights to vote in the parliamentary elections of that State.  The actual application of the Bill to the citizens of an individual State resident in Ireland could be left to ministerial order.  Once the Minister was satisfied that Irish citizens had voting rights in parliamentary elections of a member state as referred to in the Act, he would be empowered to make an order applying the provisions of the Act to citizens of that State who are resident in Ireland so as to enable them to be registered as electors for D·il …ireann elections only.  Such an order would be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and come into effect within a specified <Col N="256" /> time unless annulled by a resolution in one or both Houses.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister given any consideration to these points, and, if so, would he explain to the House why they have been rejected?  The House is entitled to know the Government's views on these matters before agreeing to the selective proposals contained in this Bill.  Also we in Fianna F·il are anxious to have a very firm assurance from the Minister on the constitutionality of the proposal before the House.  The Minister stated in his opening address that he believes that the Bill is compatible with the Irish Constitution. There remains a very large question mark as to whether that belief will, in fact, stand up in law.</P>
    <P>Article 16 of the Constitution provides that every citizen who has reached the age of 18 years and who is not disqualified by law and complies with the provisions of law relating to the election of Members of D·il …ireann shall have the right to vote in an election for membership of D·il …ireann.  Article 16 further provides that &ldquo;subject to the foregoing provisions of this Article&rdquo; elections for membership of D·il …ireann shall be regulated in accordance with law.</P>
    <P>Article 12 of the Constitution provides that &ldquo;Every citizen who has a right to vote at an election for members of D·il …ireann shall have the right to vote at an election for President&rdquo;.  The Article goes on further to provide that &ldquo;Subject to the provisions of this Article elections for the Office of President shall be regulated by law&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Again, Article 47 provides that &ldquo;Every citizen who has a right to vote at an election for members of D·il …ireann shall have the right to vote at a Referendum&rdquo;. The Article further provides that &ldquo;subject to the aforesaid, the Referendum shall be regulated by law&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The question must arise as to whether the proposed Bill in granting, <i>inter alia,</i> voting rights would be considered invalid, having regard to the provisions of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>It is not proposed to deal here at length with all the considerations that arise in connection with this issue.  The net issue <Col N="257" /> is whether the relevant provisions of the Constitution simply guarantee voting rights in question to citizens so as to prevent them being taken away or qualified by legislation while, at the same time, leaving it open to the Oireachtas to make provision by law for the granting of the same or similar voting rights to non-citizens, or whether the Constitution envisages that such voting rights are confined to citizens and citizens alone.  That is the kernel of the issue to which the Minister has referred.</P>
    <P>It certainly can be said that the relevant Articles of the Constitution recite the right of the citizen to vote and then go on to provide that, subject to the provision in question, the elections or voting shall be regulated by law.  It is clear that in each case the only discretion given to the Legislature is to regulate elections or, in the case of a Referendum, to regulate it.</P>
    <P>Regulating elections for the D·il or the Presidency does not, in my view, mean regulating who may or who may not vote, but rather the manner in which votes are cast.  The right to regulate is specifically subject to the preceding provisions of the relevant Article, including the provision creating the right of the citizen to vote. It certainly can be argued &mdash; and I think the Minister will agree &mdash; that if the Constitution intended that the Legislature should have the power to extend voting rights, there would have been specific provision for doing so, for example, providing that &ldquo;subject to the foregoing provisions of this Article . . . the right to vote shall be determined by law&rdquo;.  The Constitution did not say that.</P>
    <P>In other Articles where specific rights or duties are created, there is provision for additional powers to be conferred by law, as for example, in the case of the President where Article 13.10 provides: &ldquo;Subject to this Constitution, additional powers and functions may be conferred on the President by law&rdquo;.  Again, while the right of pardon and the power of punishment is vested in the President, the Constitution specifically provides that the power of commutation or remission may, except in capital cases, also be conferred by law on other authorities.</P>
    <P>Again, Article 33 which sets out the <Col N="258" /> powers and duties of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, concludes by saying: &ldquo;Subject to the foregoing, the terms and conditions of the office of Comptroller and Auditor-General shall be determined by law&rdquo;.  The Attorney General has such duties as are conferred on him by the Constitution and by law.  In short, where the Constitution envisaged that rights or duties could be extended, it specifically provided for this.</P>
    <P>The comments I made are made in passing at this stage.  The Fianna F·il Party are anxious that full consideration should be given to the serious implications contained in the Bill before we move on to Committee Stage.  I am putting forward these points for general discussion and consideration before final decisions are made by the D·il on the adoption of the Bill.  As I said at the outset, we favour in principle this extension, but we question whether it is being done in the correct manner by the Government.  There is a strong possibility that it might be challenged.</P>
    <P>For the present it is sufficient to say that, in my view, there is a serious and substantial doubt as to the validity of the Bill if it is passed.  It is likely to attract constitutional challenge from any one of a number of quarters, even if it is accepted by all the major political parties in the D·il.  Such proceedings obviously could be launched at any time after the Bill has become law.  This could occur in sufficient proximity to a general election so that there could be widespread uncertainty before, during and in the aftermath of a general election as to the validity of the election, with all the consequences that would have.</P>
    <P>While one cannot say with certainty that the Bill would be held to be unconstitutional, one can certainly argue that it is a strong possibility.  It is one, therefore, which if not withdrawn should at the very least be referred by the President under Article 26 to the Supreme Court. The Minister made reference to that, and we would support reference to the President to have the Bill tested on constitutionality grounds.  We feel very strongly about this.</P>
    <P>It will be recalled that an amendment <Col N="259" /> to the Constitution was introduced and passed in order to give votes to citizens from the age of 18 years instead of the previous provision of 21 years.  Any argument that can be advanced to say that the Electoral Bill does not conflict with the Constitution could have equally applied to a Bill extending voting rights to persons of 18 years and upwards, and thus have rendered unnecessary the holding of a Constitutional Referendum.  I was Minister at that time, and the view was expressed by some individuals that an amendment of the Constitution at that time was not necessary, since the right of 18 year olds to vote could be introduced by legislation.  We did not act on that view and we proceeded to hold a Referendum to alter the Constitution with regard to the voting age.</P>
    <P>I was Minister for Local Government at the time and I well recall the debate and consideration given.  We took the course which we thought was the correct one, that it was necessary to have a Referendum to change the Constitution to do what we did.  It is not that we do not wish to agree with this Bill or what is in it, but we are concerned that somebody may decide to take a constitutional case and bring the Bill to nought and cause havoc at the time of a general election. The whole thing could be over and then declared null and void.  Neither side in this House wants to see that happening. It is essential that we tread very warily and very carefully about putting this Bill on the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to query the reference in section 1 to a British statute and also the reference to a British citizen which is a designation defined in British law.  I may have more to say about this on Committee Stage.  I do not want to delay the House on it now.  Would it not be better to extend voting rights to citizens of the United Kingdom?  More about that on Committee Stage.  We should not give special statutory definition to the term &ldquo;British citizen&rdquo; by reference to a British statute which may be altered.  I understand that at the last general election in Britain the SDP, the Liberal Party and Labour Party all had it in their election <Col N="260" /> manifestos that they wanted to alter the Nationality Act in Britain.  If it is altered in the future I should like to pose the question: What will happen to the Irish legislation?  Will we have to introduce further legislation to amend this Electoral Bill which makes reference to that statute?</P>
    <P>Our main concern is the constitutionality of the Bill, and I am asking the Minister to give the House very definite assurances before we proceed to Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with some reservations that I welcome this Bill.  I agree in principle that we should give British citizens resident in Ireland the reciprocal vote.  I find it hard to believe that we are not defining what resident in Ireland means.  If you arrive tomorrow and intend to stay six months, are you immediately resident?  Are you resident if you are here for three years or five years? What is the definition of resident?  Is it somebody who has been here long enough to be included on the register of electors?  I should like to have this clarified, because it is important.</P>
      <P>There is another area of reservation which was referred to by Deputy Molloy concerning the constitutionality of the Bill before us.  My peers have insisted that all is well and all augurs well, but I have my doubts.  Whether it is in line with the letter of Article 16 of the Constitution is one thing, but I feel it is not in accord with the spirit of our Constitution which evolved after years of asserting ourselves to expel an alien party.  I am glad to say we live in harmony and accord with them now and many of them have contributed immeasurably to the social and economic well-being of our country in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted to extend the franchise to British residents, but I appeal to the Minister to go further.  Let us lead the way in Europe by extending the franchise to all our European colleagues resident in Ireland.  There is little we can lead in when it comes to European matters.  We always appear to have the hand out.  The reasons for that are obvious.  I do not need to document them.  If we give our jealously guarded franchise to anyone, <Col N="261" /> let us give it to all our European brothers and sisters who are residents in Ireland. If they are living here, contributing to the economy, married to an Irishman or woman, rearing Irish children, they are entitled to have a say in our affairs, provided they are well and truly rooted here and making Ireland their home for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to consider this.  It is most important.  I do not think there is any danger of losing any political advantage by amending the Bill.  Let us leave the British in the Bill but include the rest of Europe in an amendment.  Let us show Europe that we can lead and contribute.  I do not even demand reciprocity from Europe.  At the moment we have not got a vote in any European country except Britain.  If they want to reciprocate, well and good.  If not, let us lead in this field.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note, and history tells its own story, that while we are discussing extending the franchise to non-nationals today not so long ago in most countries &mdash; even in what were considered democratic countries &mdash; women did not even have a vote, negroes and coloured people could not vote, illiterates were not allowed to vote and people without property or land were not allowed to vote.  How fortunate we are that we can argue about small details like who in the non-national arena should get a vote here.  Our problems in this area are minimal compared to many other nations.</P>
    <P>Another point to reflect on is that Canada removed the right of British subjects to vote from 1975 onwards, even though Canadian citizens, who are still subjects of the Commonwealth, voted in Britain after that date.</P>
    <P>My two main fears are on the constitutional issue.  In my view this is not in the spirit of the Constitution and the Supreme Court will be the final arbiter. If it is not even in the spirit of the Constitution should our people be given the say as to whether we should proceed in this manner?  I worry a little about this because I do not have a definitive answer. Why give this right to the British alone, even though they have always given it to us?  We must reciprocate, but let us lead <Col N="262" /> in this area and give this right to all our European colleagues.  Admittedly, we will have an opportunity to consider this point later, but let us show Europe what we can do and how we are truly European at this stage of our development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as Fianna F·il are concerned we agree with the principle enshrined in this Bill.  We agree with the idea of giving British residents the right to vote here, but we should also look at the suggestion made by Deputy Doyle to extend this right to residents of other EEC countries who are making a very real contribution to Irish life.</P>
      <P>We live within the framework of our Constitution, a very valuable instrument safeguarding our personal rights, enshrining our institutions, providing our system of election and guaranteeing fundamental rights.  The emphasis in the Constitution from the Preamble to almost the last section is placed on the people, the citizens.  In other words, it is a democratic Constitution.</P>
      <P>Article 16.1.1∫ says:</P>
      <P>Every citizen without distinction of sex who has reached the age of eighteen years who is not disqualified by law and complies with the provision of the law relating to the election of members of D·il …ireann, shall have the right to vote at an election for members of D·il …ireann.</P>
      <P>The basic principle enshrined in this section is that every citizen over the age of 18 years shall have the right to vote at an election.  In my view that subsection will be given a literal interpretation by the courts.  In a judgement of the Supreme Court in the case of Aherne 1982 <i>Irish Reports</i> Mr. Justice Walsh said that in the construction of our Constitution words which in their ordinary meaning import inclusion or exclusion cannot be given a meaning other than their ordinary literal meaning, save where the authority for so doing can be found within the Constitution itself.  There is no authority in the Constitution to support departing from the principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nowhere in the Constitution is there any attempt to take from the concept of <Col N="263" /> citizenship, to define the word &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; or to imply that the word &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; can be interpreted in another way.  In the absence of any insertion in the Constitution that the word &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; can be interpreted in another way, according to Mr. Justice Walsh the ordinary literal meaning of the word &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; must be taken, save where the authority for doing otherwise can be found within the Constitution itself.</P>
    <P>Section 16 confers the right on a citizen over 18 years to exercise the right to vote at an election.  The Preamble starts with &ldquo;We, the people of Eire&rdquo; and Article 6 states:</P>
    <P>All powers of government, legislative, executive and judicial, derive, under God, from the people, whose right it is to designate the rulers of the State and, in final appeal, to decide all questions of national policy, according to the requirements of the common good.</P>
    <P>Here all the emphasis is placed on the democratic Constitution vesting power in the people.</P>
    <P>Section 12.2 reads:</P>
    <P>1∫ The President shall be elected by direct vote of the people.</P>
    <P>2∫ Every citizen who has the right to vote at an election for members of D·il …ireann shall have the right to vote at an election for President.</P>
    <P>The power is vested in the people and the people use their power to vote for the President, thus transferring their power to the President.  The same applies to the elections to the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Article 15.3.1∫ says:</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas may provide for the establishment or recognition of functional or vocational councils representing branches of the social and economic life of the people.</P>
    <P>Again, there is the emphasis on people. With regard to the referendum process there is provision to refer Bills to the people under Article 27 which is entitled, <Col N="264" />&ldquo;Reference of Bills to the People&rdquo;.  Article 40, the fundamental rights section, states that all citizens shall, as human persons, be held equal before the law. With regard to the referendum process the Constitution states that every proposal for an amendment to the Constitution shall be submitted by referendum for the decision of the people.</P>
    <P>The Constitution states that every legislative and executive act, whether it is the election of the President, Members of D·il …ireann or the election of functional councils by the D·il, the exercising of fundamental rights or the referendum process, rely fundamentally on Article 6. That Article states that all powers of Government, legislative, executive and judicial, derive under God from the people.  There is a basic chain running through our Constitution which declares that the power of the people is transmitted under Article 6 to the legislative, executive and judicial institutions.</P>
    <P>In emphasising that this matter was for the President to decide the Minister indicated that the President in the exercise of his absolute discretion can see fit to refer the Bill to the Supreme Court, and such a reference would have the considerable advantage of removing all possibility of doubt as to the validity of our electoral law.  I agree with the Minister and welcome that indication.  If the step he has suggested is not taken we may be treading on dangerous ground.  If this measure is not accepted by the Supreme Court as appropriate constitutional legislation there is a real possibility of an election being held up or, possibly, being rescinded.  If this matter is not resolved quickly we could drift into a severe constitutional crisis.</P>
    <P>I am certain that the Council of State, the initiating authority, will examine the debate in the House before consulting the President.  This is an urgent matter because a difficulty may arise in a by-election. I am not anticipating a general election as a matter of urgency, but the same principles I mentioned in the case of a person challenging the result of a general election obtain in the case of a by-election.  If it is stated that residency does not qualify a person who is not an <Col N="265" /> Irish citizen to vote and the validity of an election is challenged an election result could be upset.  I suggest that the matter is urgent and should be submitted to the Supreme Court through the channels I mentioned.</P>
    <P>It is important that we act in accordance with the document of rights which exists here.  There is a duty on us as legislators to do so.  The Constitution states that we are precluded from passing any legislation that is repugnant to the Constitution, and for that reason there is a duty on us to consider the seriousness of this matter.  Without making a definitive judgment I believe that a <i>prima facie</i> case can be made that this is unconstitutional. That argument may be rebutted, but the place to hear such arguments is the Supreme Court.  The responsible thing for us to do is to pass this measure because we all subscribe to the principle of it, and permit the appropriate steps to be taken to ensure the legislation is considered by the Supreme Court.</P>

      <P>This is not in any sense a question of conscience, and even though one might disagree with one's side on a question which is not one of conscience one is bound by the majority wisdom. The majority wisdom transmitted by the Government from their law advisers is to the effect that the Bill is constitutional. The Minister has said that the Government, not being in an arrogant way certain of their own correctness, will be happy if the President should decide in his discretion to refer it to the Supreme Court.  However, as Deputy Lenihan has said, we are obliged not to enact legislation which is repugnant to the Constitution. It puts an onus on every party and on every Deputy, even though he may defer to the majority wisdom of his side, to voice reservations if he entertains them on that score.  I should like to do so as briefly as I can by way of adding to the reflections which Deputy Lenihan has put before us and with which I agree in the broad sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be no harm if I began with a point on which I disagree with Deputy Lenihan.  I do not think this is the right way to do the job.  There is a good deal <Col N="266" /> to be said for allowing resident aliens of whatever nationality who live here, who obey our laws, who pay our taxes and contribute with their skills to our economy to exercise the franchise in order to provide the government of the country.  It is a strong case although it is not recognised in many states.  I would have preferred it if the Government had promoted instead an amendment of Article 16 which would have added to the existing section 1 of Article 16 another subsection reading roughly as follows: &ldquo;the Oireachtas may by law extend the D·il franchise to appropriate categories of resident non-citizens,&rdquo; perhaps on the basis of reciprocity &mdash; by this I mean non-citizens who are nationals of a country in which Irish citizens resident there would also have a parliamentary franchise. Even without that condition, I think a strong case could be made for according the D·il franchise to bona fide resident aliens or at least for giving the Oireachtas discretion to accord that franchise by legislation even without reciprocity. It should not matter to us that other countries are not able to see the logic of letting resident aliens participate in the government-building process.  If they are not able to see it, that is too bad. If we can see it, the fact that our citizens do not get fair play over there should not worry us.</P>
    <P>I should have preferred a section like that to be promoted by this or any Government by referendum to amend the Constitution.  If the matter came before the D·il then, on the whole, I would be disposed to accord in the first instance the D·il franchise to all resident nationals of EEC member states, without prejudice to whatever other categories may have a claim.  The major number of residents of EEC countries are the British but I can see no reason why a resident German, Frenchman or Italian should not be accorded the D·il franchise.  There are hundreds of such people in my constituency, although there may not be so many in other constituencies.  These people can be numbered as substantial minorities, with their wives and families, throughout the country.  I cannot see any reason why a resident German, Frenchman, <Col N="267" /> Italian or other nationality should not have the same rights as the British, apart from the admittedly powerful argument that the British do not exclude resident Irish people in Britain from voting. I know that is a powerful argument and I give it due weight, in saying that if the Oireachtas were to have a constitutional power to extend the D·il franchise by ordinary legislation I would not think it would be unreasonable &mdash; personally, I would not be eager to do it &mdash; but it would not be unreasonable to limit it to people whose own countries afford the same right on a reciprocal basis.</P>
    <P>In that context it would have been possible for us to enact a simple law admitting British residents or other European residents &mdash; I am not aware of any other countries which allow our nationals to vote when living there &mdash; by the same Act.  That would have been a method. Presumably that principle would be politically non-contentious and would have the support of all.  It would not be a red-hot urgent matter as was the referendum about adoption in 1979.  At that time many families looked like being at risk of being disturbed in their arrangements through what appeared to be a gap in the law.  We could have passed all Stages of the Bill in this House and all Stages but one in the Seanad.  We could have let the final Stage in the Seanad rest on the Order Paper until such time as a new national poll for a local election was pending and then have a referendum at no extra cost except for the green voting papers.  That would have been as inexpensive as it is possible for a constitutional amendment to be, it would have been rational and non-invidious.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to say that the Government I am glad to support have, in their collective wisdom, taken a different view and I want to say briefly why I think they are wrong.  I have explained what I think would have been preferable but I think they are wrong on a few points.  First, a parliamentary franchise is a privilege. Self-government means the right of the Irish people themselves to decide for themselves about all matters affecting their welfare.  Necessarily and by implication <Col N="268" /> it excludes the right of any other national to do it for them.  Our nationality is founded on an historic rejection of the right of British people to decide anything for us.  In the context in which I am speaking that is not relevant and a resident British person should be naturally entitled to take part in electing a Government if they are bona fide residents here, paying their taxes, obeying the laws and helping our economy.</P>
    <P>A parliamentary franchise is a privilege. It has latent in it an element of excluding everyone else.  When the Constitution says that every citizen, without distinction of sex and so on, on reaching the age of 18 years and who is not disqualified by law shall have the right to vote, it means that is a privilege.  It is a privilege given to us here because we were born of Irish parents but because of weak human nature we may tend to exclude others from that privilege. Deputy Lenihan spoke about the Constitution and I will not add to his effective expressions.  A person is entitled to rely on that and to take for granted that nobody who is not sovereign&mdash;the only sovereign here is the Irish people&mdash;can dilute that privilege by extending something which the citizen values, regards and esteems because he shares it only with a visible, limited number of people or extend it arbitrarily to many people whose numbers he cannot estimate, whose immigration he cannot control. Perhaps I am putting in exaggerated terms the matter we are dealing with here.  I know we are only dealing with 10,000 or 12,000 people and I do not mean to inflate the matter.  I have said already that I accept fully that these people should have votes here and also all other resident aliens, and certainly EEC nationals.  However, a franchise is basically a privilege and one has to bear that in mind in interpreting Article 16.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lenihan was right in saying that the Oireachtas cannot extend this constitutional category by itself.  He is modestly keeping open the possibility that he might be wrong and I suppose I had better do that also but I think it would have been safer to make sure of being right by going the referendum <Col N="269" /> route.  If the argument that one can arbitrarily extend the franchise to other national categories is correct, equally it must be correct that this House by an ordinary Act could extend the vote to people under the age of 18 years.  If it is possible by an Act to add in a new category, namely, non-nationals, albeit resident British people if it is possible to do that, why cannot we say that, in addition to the people given the vote by Article 16, section 1, the D·il and Seanad will give it also to 16 year olds and, if 16 year olds, why not 14 year olds?  Surely the logic of one position is as strong or as weak as the logic involved in the other. That section seems to me too plain to labour.  I apologise to the House for spending really any time on it at all.</P>
    <P>In addition to the judicial precedent mentioned by Deputy Lenihan, the very recent case of <i>The State (Aherne) v. Cotter,</i> I would like to read into the report of the House one about 20 years old, a judgment of Mr. Justice Kenny in a case called <i>Deaton v. Attorney General, 1953 Irish Reports</i>, page 170.  It was a case about the usurpation, as it seemed to the Supreme Court, of a judicial function by the Revenue Commissioners in a context I need not go into.  As it happened, on the ultimate issue the Supreme Court reversed the judgment of Mr. Justice Kenny, who was then a member of the High Court, and it is not on the issue that divided the two courts I want to comment, but on a dictum of Mr. Justice Kenny which is on all fours&mdash;in fact, it goes a great deal further, and is more explicit and it accords with what was always my understanding of the law&mdash;with the one cited by Deputy Lenihan from Mr. Justice Walsh.  He said at page 174 in regard to Article 34, section 1: &ldquo;Justice shall be administered in courts established by law by judges appointed in the manner provided by this Constitution&rdquo; and he says: &ldquo;If justice is to be administered in courts established by law by judges appointed in the manner provided by this Constitution the corollary is that justice is not to be administered by persons who are not judges appointed in the manner provided by the Constitution&rdquo;.  That I always thought was <Col N="270" /> beyond argument and it is as clear as daylight.</P>
    <P>I would have thought it needless to argue that point or even explain it except to a class of absolute beginners.  I may have been wrong all these years&mdash;that is not intended to arouse ironic laughter at the ridiculous idea that I could be wrong; I could easily be wrong&mdash;but I will be surprised if I am wrong about this. Deputy Lenihan, who is also a lawyer, would also be surprised.  I will not labour the point if it is going to be laboured in the courts, but let me remind the House of the pretty considerable expense, because the gentlemen of the profession to which both Deputy Lenihan and I belong will not do a case like this in the Supreme Court for anything under four figures a day and, depending on the number of days the discussion of this theme will take in the Supreme Court, the plain people will find that the straws added to their burden as the stoop doubled along the path of life under the load of taxation, are not a few.  I would be surprised if the net cost, counting overheads&mdash;heating, the salaries of messengers and runners of all kinds, the members of the Bar&mdash;by the time this thing is argued out, disposed of and judgment taken, again with counsel turning up in order respectfully to listen to the court, the cost will be anything under six figures, not much, I think you will agree, under six figures. Deputy Lenihan's face is a study over there&mdash;anxious to keep everybody happy with all corners of it, a kind of octagonal demonstration of variable goodwill.  At any rate this will be an expensive process, very well meaning no doubt, but I think it would be cheaper in the end to do what I began by suggesting.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude by saying&mdash;a very subsidiary point and really very unimportant compared with what we have been taking about so far&mdash;I am not aware that there is any precedent for an Irish statutory term&mdash;because &ldquo;a British citizen&rdquo; in subsection (1) (a) paragraph (a) (2) of this operative part will now be an Irish statutory term.  I am not aware of any Irish statutory term defined by reference to a current British statute.  That may seem a small, niggling lawyer's <Col N="271" /> point.  We do not know whether it is or not yet.  It could turn out to be a very tricky point.  I do not know what volume of litigation exists in Britain over their British Nationality Act, 1981.  Neither Deputy Lenihan nor I am qualified to lecture on the subject.  For all I know it may be a most controversial piece of legislation but I think it is a curious thing and absolutely unprecedented, subject to correction, that an Irish court should be asked, and not only asked but peremptorily directed, to interpret what is now an Irish statutory term, namely, &ldquo;British citizen&rdquo;, not by reference to any criteria we ourselves have erected as to British citizenship, but as to criteria the British themselves have erected and are interpreting under a different legal system, similar no doubt, one with the same rules as our own, but for the last 60 years one receding from us, diverging from us with every passing day.  I do not think there is a precedent for that.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is a very important point, but it is a point which adds another dimension of regrettability to this measure. If it passes into law&mdash;I want to point this out as yet another problem even if the Supreme Court do not advert to this&mdash;it will entitle a British subject to be registered as a D·il elector.  But unless the Supreme Court plainly say so in terms it may not necessarily give him the vote because it does not actually say that he shall be entitled to vote.  It only says he shall be entitled to be &ldquo;registered as an elector&rdquo;.  The Constitution does not mention the electoral register.  Plenty of people are on the register who should not be on it, and many more are not on it who should be on it.  It is again a niggling point and I am sure nothing will ever arise on it or could ever arise on it, but I mention it as another instance of the general infelicity of this Bill and of this way of doing what I would have thought a fairly simple job which might have been done in a much more comprehensive and satisfactory way, and a much more straightforward way.  Naturally, if it comes to a division, I shall vote for this Bill because I bow to the majority wisdom <Col N="272" /> of my party but I must register my belief that this is a mistake.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MyraBarry" hpid="Miss M. Barry Miss M. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I wholeheartedly welcome this Bill.  It is long overdue.  British citizens resident here will breathe a sigh of relief when this Bill passes into law. Because these citizens were not accorded full voting rights since 1927 they were prevented from voting in 21 general elections, four Presidential elections, and seven referenda.  That right was denied to them on 32 occasions.  I am very happy that we are now endeavouring to rectify this anomaly.  The British Act gave voting rights to Irish people residing in Britain. It is difficult to ascertain the number of Irish nationals residing there but it is said to be approximately one million.  Surely it is wrong to deprive 40,000 British citizens of voting rights here.  Giving them such rights does not alter the spirit of democracy.  I believe the Minister should go even further and give European nationals voting rights here.  The United Nations has stated that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights, are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.  In election after election I have found it utterly embarrassing and frustrating meeting British citizens and being told by them they cannot vote and I have to tell them once again they did not have the right to vote according to our laws. Speakers on the other side of the House have cast doubt on the constitutionality of this Bill.  That makes me very cynical because two previous Attorneys General have said it would not contravene the Constitution.  Their own leader stated on 1 April 1981, in Volume 328 of the Official Report, column 710, as follows:</P>
      <P>There is a fairly clearcut legal opinion which I am inclined to accept that the referendum would not be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I call that opposition for opposition's sake.  I hope the Bill will get the full support of the House and that we can continue to use the democratic process to the full.  After all, there are only 28 true democracies in the world, and we are <Col N="273" /> lucky not to be part of the 172 dictatorships who oppress civil rights and liberties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a brief contribution on this Bill.  There are approximately, with the new boundary, 120,000 people in my constituency and there are a few hundred people involved in this Bill.  Not all of them are British citizens.  In one particular case there is the daughter of an Irish mother and British father who was born in London but who came back here as a child and grew up here.  She had been denied a vote.  She has never known any other way of life but the Irish way of life.  There are a number of examples in my constituency. I know of a Scots couple who have lived here for the past 30 years, who pay taxes and abide by the laws here, but they have no say in electing the people who raise those taxes and make the laws.  That is a very unsatisfactory state of affairs.</P>
      <P>I welcome any change in that situation, although I do not think this particular change goes far enough.  There is a certain strategy behind bringing in this Bill to extend the vote to British citizens in the first instance, since there has been a suggestion across the water that Irish citizens who have been voting there would be denied the vote if there was not a reciprocal arrangement.  From a political point of view it is probably wise to bring in the vote here for British subjects on their own in the first instance to indicate that we are reciprocating.  I hope it will not be too long before we extend that to other European citizens, particularly on a reciprocal basis.  I do not see why we could not have a reciprocal arrangement with the Belgian Government that Belgians living here would have the right to vote.  The same should apply on a reciprocal basis to Italians or citizens of any other country living here.  While I would like to see this extended, I accept there is a certain strategy involved in the British-Irish situation.  That should be acknowledged.  I do not believe it was referred to in the Minister's speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the constitutionality of the legislation, I recall speaking sometime ago to a close relative of a former <Col N="274" /> Attorney General of a Government of some years back and he said that the Attorney General of that Government advised the then Government that much legislation going through the House would be unconstitutional.  The legislation went through and has never been challenged.  Even if it had been challenged, there is no knowing how it would have been interpreted.  If we looked at every Bill going through here on the basis of whether it was constitutional, I do not believe we would enact half the legislation we are enacting.  The constitutionality of the Bill should not be a great worry.  If it is, the President can always be encouraged to refer it to the Supreme Court before he signs it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly made the point in a very colourful and objective way that if at a later stage this Bill was to be contested in the courts it could cost legal fees going into six figures.  If we do not pass this Bill, what will it cost in terms of Irish-British relations?  It may be cheap for us to let it be contested in the Supreme Court.  It may be cheap for us to pay a six figure sum to lawyers, messenger boys and all the other people Deputy Kelly referred to.  If the outcome of our not passing this Bill, because of the fear of it being found unconstitutional, was that Irish people living in England were deprived of voting there, that would be a very big price to pay.  When we are looking at Bills of this nature we should not look at the price as much as at the value.  The value is there. If anybody wishes to challenge the constitutionality of the Bill let him do so and we will have to deal with that when the time comes.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the opinion of two former Attorneys General. That must count for something.  We should not get bogged down on every possible Bill brought before the House being contested on the grounds of constitutionality. The Minister should follow this up fairly speedily with legislation to extend votes to other Europeans who live here and to people from other parts of the world who are living here.  A person who is allowed to reside in the country for a number of years should have a say <Col N="275" /> in how the affairs of the country are determined.</P>
    <P>The Minister towards the end of his speech referred to the British Nationality Act, 1981, and said it distinguished three different classes of British citizenship.  He then went on to say he was only extending it to the first class.  What about a Pakistani or an Indian living here who falls into one of the other classes?  Why should such a person not be allowed to vote if that person is allowed to live here?  I know the Minister is not a racist and I would not like to give any indication that I am suggesting that is the case.  I do not believe we should get bogged down in relation to any legislation they have in Britain.  If there are three categories of nationality in Britain I do not see why that should concern us or why we should get into a definition of it.</P>
    <P>We should be very broad in our interpretation of this Bill.  People who are living here for a considerable time, who observe the laws and pay their taxes, should be given the vote, particularly if they have British nationality of one or other of the categories to which the Minister referred.  The Minister should arrange to get those people on the very next election register.  This is complied every year.  The Bill is going through in October so there should be plenty of time to get them on the draft register for January.  I suggest &mdash; it would not be a very big exercise &mdash; that the Minister through his Department or through local authorities write to all persons on the register who have &ldquo;L&rdquo; or &ldquo;LE&rdquo; after their names to point out to them that the legislation has been extended to British citizens and that he is considering extending it to other persons on the register to ensure that when the next election comes such people will not be excluded from voting and will be entitled to vote.  This Bill is a good day's work.  I understand the strategy behind what the Minister is trying to do and I hope he will soon follow it up with legislation extending it further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Like previous speakers, I welcome the intent behind <Col N="276" /> the Bill which the Minister has brought before the House.  Quite a number of people in this country have been awaiting this, people who will benefit by obtaining a vote at D·il elections with the passage of this Bill.  It is also welcomed by those of us who go around to houses at election time trying to explain to persons who have &ldquo;L&rdquo; or &ldquo;LE&rdquo; after their names on the register what the situation is and that while we had the intention of doing something about this for a number of years, we had not quite got around to doing it. I congratulate the Minister on being the person who at last has brought this overdue measure before the House.</P>
      <P>The intent behind it is quite clear.  British citizens who are ordinarily resident in this country will have a vote at all elections here.  Any election affects directly or indirectly all the people living in the country.  People who have been here for a certain length of time and have in most cases been paying taxes and contributing to the life of the country should have a say in how their affairs are run.  The Minister mentioned that about 10,000 to 12,000 people may benefit by this measure. That number may be even higher, but that is only a matter of detail.  Quite a number of people in my constituency of D˙n Laoghaire will welcome the measure.</P>
      <P>I hope that the Minister will consider at a future date extending the franchise to other non-nationals, residents from other EEC countries, and, as previous speakers have said, even from countries outside the EEC who are ordinarily resident here and who are involved in the workings of the community and contributing to the country.  Foreign businesses come in here.  People connected with those firms and everyone else who comes in should have a say in the affairs of the country, whether through local elections, general elections, Presidential elections or referenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has been said in relation to possible constitutional difficulties in regard to this matter.  While we want to make sure that what we are putting through is proper law and will stand up, there is, as the Minister indicated, the option that the President can at his discretion refer <Col N="277" /> the Bill to the Supreme Court.  That is one way to get around the matter.  The Minister indicated that there is no hard and fast principle to guarantee that this legislation will stand up, but there is every liklihood that it will do so.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will indicate, when replying, whether further extension is planned and if he will give consideration to extending the franchise to people from other countries in the future.  The point that Irish citizens resident in Britain have a vote there and that we are correcting the imbalance is a reason in itself for bringing in this legislation.  Anything we can do to improve and harmonise relations between North and South and between this island and the island next door is to be applauded.  People who live and work in this country and contribute to it in various ways by investment, business or other forms of work should have the franchise.</P>
    <P>Again, I congratulate the Minister on introducing this measure.  I welcome it. It is long overdue.  Perhaps he will keep my comments in mind when replying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to express my support for the measure before the House and to commend the Minister for taking this action as quickly as he has done.  I have been struck by the strength of the arguments on both sides even from the constitutional point of view and by the willingness of people to give the franchise to non-nationals.  I had hoped that the Bill would be extended to non-nationals. In my constituency a substantial number of non-nationals have contributed vastly to the economy of the mid-western region, particularly to Shannon in County Clare.  These people have paid their taxes and have helped the community in their efforts to form what is now a new town.  Many of them are aggrieved that in national elections they have not the right to vote whereas Irish citizens who go to London or other industrial towns in Britian have the right to vote there.  I am glad that this measure has been brought before the House and, with Deputy Mitchell, I believe that it will stand the test of time and that the people <Col N="278" /> for whom it is intended will benefit, as will the country itself.</P>
      <P>I have been struck in this debate by the lack of animosity in bringing forward this measure.  Across the water Paddy-bashing, as it is referred to, would probably be indulged in and I am glad that this House did not indulge in any Brit-bashing today.</P>
      <P>Other measures might have been contained in an Electoral (Amendment) Bill, such as details of compiling registers, whether we should have compulsory or voluntary voting and whether voting should take place on Sundays only.  The State should consider the best time to vote and also electoral preparations aimed at bringing about a proper Oireachtas and local government.</P>

      <P>Like other speakers, I welcome this Bill the purpose of which is to grant to British citizens resident here the right to vote in D·il elections, presidential elections and referenda under conditions identical to those applying in the case of Irish citizens.  However, like many other speakers here, one must ask oneself if the Bill has gone far enough.  It would have been good to have extended the franchise to all European citizens living in this country.  We would welcome such a provision very much and some speakers have made a very strong argument for it here this evening.  We are members of the European Community and look to Europe in many ways.  It would be nice to be able to extend the hand of friendship and to have these people included in this Bill.  Members of the House who are involved on the legal side made very strong arguments for and against the Bill.  It has been said that it may possibly be contested &mdash; perhaps prior to a general election.  That is possible, but I would hope that that would not occur.  Although I regret that the Bill has not gone further, I welcome it.</P>

      <P>I welcome the support and unanimity that the House has shown to this measure.  Anybody reading this debate should bear this in mind.  If doubts have been expressed <Col N="279" /> about the route which we are proposing to travel, there are no doubts about the principle involved but simply about the methodology and the constitutionality of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I would refer very briefly to some of the points raised.  Deputy Molloy, in a wide-ranging speech, raised a number of points and I shall try to deal with them as quickly as possible, remembering that it would be the intention and the spirit of the House to try to take all Stages of the Bill this evening.  The question of a British resident and the British Act was referred to, because the definition of British citizenship is itself a complex and complicated matter.  We can provide for any subsequent changes in any law in the United Kingdom.  However, upon mature consideration it was found necessary to be specific in relation to this matter, largely because of the itinerant activities of British people over the last 300 years across the globe, something which we share with them.  The question of constitutionality was raised by Deputy Molloy and also by Deputies Lenihan, Kelly and Doyle.  I want to reassert, as stated in my opening speech, that considered advice to the Government is that this measure is constitutional and that therefore we are in compliance with Article 13, to which Deputy Lenihan referred, when he said it behoved the House not to attempt to pass legislation which it might take or believe to be repugnant to the Constitution.  As some speakers have already said, this is also the advice of two previous Attorneys-General. We recognise that some doubt has been expressed here tonight and previously. The President, using his own discretion under the Constitution, may see fit when he and the Council of State read the deliberations in this and possibly the other House, to take whatever action he deems necessary and which is procedurally open to him under our Constitution. If the President should so choose, he could refer the matter to the Supreme Court to remove any doubts and consequently to remove any subsequent problems which may arise in relation to the validity of any specific election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="280" /> Deputy Kelly attempted to suggest that the cost of such a referral would be astronomical. I would point out that the cost of a referendum, even combined with the forthcoming local and European elections, would be in the region of approximately £Ω million, none of which would come back to the Exchequer by way of income tax returns which no doubt Deputies Lenihan's and Kelly's colleagues pay with the degree of responsibility which they display to the courts. The net cost of a referral to the Supreme Court would be far less than the gross cost referred to by Deputy Kelly.</P>
    <P>On the question of our not extending the voting right to other categories resident in this island, the FÌanna F·il Party and the Deputy Leader of that Party now in the House will recognise that there is a political dimension to this initiative.  It arose following the parliamentary meeting between the then Taoiseach, Leader of the FÌanna F·il Party, Mr. Haughey, with the British Prime Minister.  In the &ldquo;totality of the relationships&rdquo; coined by Deputy Lenihan, it was felt important that we as a nation should reciprocate on the existing situation in Britain and extend to United Kingdom citizens resident here the full franchise in relation to all elections which take place here.  That is the political motivation for this action, which has the support of the political parties on all sides of this House.  Because we want to highlight and uniquely define it at this point in time, we are not disposed to consider any other category of resident, including EEC citizens.  I would point out to the House that our legislation in relation to the franchise for local or European elections and indeed D·il elections, but particularly for local and European ones, is by far the most liberal of all of our European colleagues.  We have already given the lead to which Deputy Doyle referred.  I share the view with many Deputies that the best way to bring forward the extension of the franchise in the European framework would be in unison with other countries.  We cannot go much further than we already have.</P>
    <P>From the contributions made by the various Deputies, the House has fairly consistently expressed the desire that the <Col N="281" /> franchise could and should be extended. I shall convey that feeling of the House to the Minister for the Environment and to the Government.  We will thus ensure that this matter is looked at.</P>
    <P>On the question of a resident, quite clearly what we mean is that someone would qualify to go on the electoral register in the normal manner.  I do not have to spell that out to Members of this House.  They are quite familiar with the procedure of getting on to the register for any election.  Ensuring that one stays on the register remains the problem.  The accuracy with which the registers are maintained by various local authorities unfortunately results in some people who legally had the franchise in year one finding themselves not entitled to it in year two or subsequent elections.</P>
    <P>The problems which we have already debated in this House on the working committee's report on the franchise and the difficulties which have been experienced by political parties and political activists in the last referendum will be ones at which we will be looking. Deputy Mitchell will be familiar with the workings of that committee and will recognise, as a member of a local authority, that it is the local authorities who have responsibility for ensuring the accuracy of the register.</P>
    <P>For the benefit of anybody reading this debate who may not have the political understanding that Members of this House have, the register here is compiled on the basis of people who are ordinarily resident on 15 September of any one year.  The draft register is compiled from the residence established at that time and it is open to correction and available, usually in the public libraries or Garda stations, or alternatively with the local authority.  Provision is made in the subsequent new year for amendments, changes or corrections and the final register is concluded and confirmed on 15 April in any given year.  In theory, it is possible for a United Kingdom citizen as defined for the purposes of this legislation coming to this country in the month of August and establishing residence on 15 September in a particular place to be entitled to vote in any election fought on <Col N="282" /> the register which becomes valid after 15 April in any year.  There is no residence requirement in the legal sense of two to three years as suggested by Deputy Doyle.</P>
    <P>The whole thinking behind this is to attempt to cement the particular relationship we have with the people of the United Kingdom, and to ensure that the attempts at reconciliation by successive administrations will be reinforced by the actions we take here tonight.  Recently I had an opportunity to visit the United Kingdom in connection with matters related to local government.  The comments made to me by a large number of people I met there centred around the recent debate in the British House of Commons on the franchise.  The question of voting rights for Irish citizens was hotly debated, particularly by Tory Members of the House of Commons.</P>
    <P>There was a strong element of opinion in some sections of the British body politic that the franchise should not be retained by people of Irish descent or Irish citizens in Britain.  In the final analysis the House of Commons decided to let the present situation stand, and Irish people still have the vote in the United Kingdom.  John Biggs Davidson, a noted Tory backbencher, made the case that the argument by British MPs in favour of allowing Irish citizens in the UK to retain the vote would be strengthened considerably if the Irish Parliament were to reciprocate and extend the vote to United Kingdom citizens resident in Ireland.</P>
    <P>We are not just amending the law in this House this evening.  We are implementing a political commitment given by this Government and the previous Government.  Obviously from the contributions tonight there is still clear political support from the major Opposition party, Fianna F·il.  It is right and proper that the House should emphasise the unanimity with which we support the principle that the UK citizen resident here, as defined for purposes of legality by the UK Citizens Act of 1981, should have the vote in all elections in this State.</P>
    <P>In doing that, we recognise a problem which it is sometimes very difficult for <Col N="283" /> British citizens to understand &mdash; the constraints which a written Constitution provides. Deputy Lenihan and Deputy Kelly indicated that a formal written Constitution is the absolute guarantor of people's rights.  Deputy Kelly said it is the people who are sovereign in this State and not the Crown as in the case of the United Kingdom.  Any alteration to the Constitution requires a referendum.  Legislation cannot be enacted by the House if the House believes it to be unconstitutional. The Government have been very careful about the way in which they have sought advice and in their deliberations before bringing the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>As I said in my introductory statement, this is a short Bill but nonetheless a Bill of considerable importance.  Under it British citizens resident here will have the same voting rights as Irish citizens at D·il and Presidential elections and referenda, in addition to the rights they already have in relation to voting at local elections and European Assembly elections. The Bill reciprocates the voting rights Irish citizens have enjoyed in Britain over the years.  As the House is aware, the fact that our citizens resident in Britain possess these rights arises from the historical relationship between the two countries.  It is proper that we should acknowledge these rights by providing similar rights for British citizens living here.</P>
    <P>Over and above this, it is important that we should lose no opportunity to seek to heal any differences which may exist between the peoples of the two countries and particularly between people resident in this island.  The problems which face us today transcend national frontiers, problems of ensuring peace and security, reasonable standards and jobs for our people, the protection and improvement of the environment. These problems do not stop at the national boundaries and must be tackled on a European and world basis.</P>
    <P>As I believe in the concept of a common European citizenship I personally support the work we are doing in the EEC and in the Council of Europe to advance this ideal.  In the recent discussions <Col N="284" /> on the introduction of a uniform electoral system for elections to the European Parliament we strongly urged that the right to vote should be based on residence rather than on the concept of nationality or citizenship.  I am glad to say this view which has been argued by the Government representing the people of this country has found clear support on both sides of the House in the debate this evening.</P>
    <P>Strengthened by that belief, we will now continue to press this view.  In our own legislation we have already given all EEC citizens resident here the right to vote in elections to the European Parliament. I look forward to the day, which I think is not too distant, when we will be amending our own electoral law to enable EEC citizens to vote at elections at every level.  In every EEC country at present except Britain, the parliamentary vote is restricted to nationals.  Our role should be to work for a general liberalisation.  I do not think Deputy Molloy was in the House when I said that by comparison with our EEC colleagues our present franchise law is most liberal.</P>
    <P>Deputy Doyle suggested that we should give a lead in unilaterally extending voting rights to every EEC citizen. Deputy Kelly went somewhat further and suggested that we should extend it to anyone and everyone who lives in this island who is properly registered and is making a contribution to our society.  We have already given a lead in this area, and any further unilateral action would not necessarily have the desired reciprocal effect on a multilateral basis.  Consequently it might be more effective for us to press for the extension of the franchise on a uniform basis within the ten countries within the EEC and soon to be 12.</P>
    <P>I should like to return to the central theme of the debate and the political background.  Following the initiatives taken by previous Governments and commitments made by previous Governments, the Government are anxious to ensure that British citizens resident in Ireland will benefit to the full by having the full franchise for all elections.  That will be the effect of this Bill.  The Government have sought and obtained legal <Col N="285" /> advice which puts beyond all reasonable doubt, in the words of Deputy Haughey, the question of whether this Bill can be considered to be constitutional.</P>
    <P>I want to refer again to the point I made in my opening speech regarding the role of the President and the autonomy and the discretion of the President in relation to any Bill which, in his opinion, may not be constitutional and should be referred to the Supreme Court.  That position stands.  This is a necessary Bill. It is constitutional, but in view of the arguments which have been made in a constructive manner, we would like to ensure that all necessary steps are taken to remove any doubt about the constitutionality of the measure to avoid some of the consequences alluded to by Deputy Molloy.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Gaiety Theatre, Dublin.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to raise this very important matter, which deals not alone with the Gaiety Theatre but with the state of the theatre generally and the fact that the 23 per cent VAT on theatre tickets has an enormous effect on the theatre-going population generally.</P>
      <P>I want to say at the outset that I have no axe to grind with the Minister, Deputy Nealon, or with the Government, because I recognise that successive Governments have taken very positive approaches to the theatre.  I also recognise that Deputy Haughey intervened to save the Gate and that the Olympia, to some extent, has been supported by the Government.  Equity has had the support of my own family and of successive Governments also.</P>
      <P>My purpose in raising this matter on the Adjournment is not to criticise but to tease out the present situation of the Gaiety.  My purpose is two-fold: I believe that not only Dubliners but people all over the country have great affection for the Gaiety and appreciate the very high standard of the shows that have been seen in that theatre over the years.  Traditionally, the Dublin Grand Opera Society, the Rathmines and Rathgar Musical Society, Maureen Potter, the late Jimmy O'Dea and so on, have put on wonderful shows there.  The Minister will recall with affection, as I do, the old Theatre Royal.  We know what happened there.  Where that theatre once stood we now have an office complex.  My purpose in raising this question is not to wave banners for any particular type of management, but to ask the Minister to ensure that whoever is responsible for the Gaiety Theatre will continue to put on shows for the public.</P>
      <P>Consideration should be given to the 48 employees of the theatre, many of whom are in their sixties and seventies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="287" /> They have devoted their lives to the theatre and have given a very worth-while service for which we can feel very proud. At the end of the day, these people will end up without redundancy payments or pensions to tide them over the latter part of their lives.  Yet they are prepared to devote more of their professionalism to this theatre by foregoing four weeks' pay. If those 48 workers are prepared to do that, the Government and the Minister have an obligation to ensure the Gaiety Theatre is kept open for the Christmas period.</P>
    <P>The present owners are not seeking £40,000, which has been extensively reported in the newspapers, but simply the underwriting of £40,000.  That is not an enormous risk, although there may be a marginal risk, involved.  The present owners believe they can put on local shows, as well as the Dublin Grand Opera Society and the Rathmines and Rathgar Musical Society, which would repay the money if the Government were to underwrite it.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the difficulty the Minister finds himself in.  The Gaiety Theatre needs considerable renovation.  I was there recently with one of the Minister's representatives, talking to the owners.  I understand the Minister and the Arts Council have received assurances from the Gaiety Theatre (Dublin) Limited, the owners of the premises, that they want to close down for three or four months to renovate the premises.  This will involve spending a great deal of money.  That is fine if we can be assured that this theatre will reopen but I do not think the Minister can give such a guarantee.  As I said, I have no axe to grind with either side; all I want is an assurance that the Gaiety Theatre will reopen.</P>
    <P>The Olympia Theatre is one of the few theatres capable of accommodating a production of any size.  If the Gaiety closes down the Olympia have said they will accommodate the Dublin Grand Opera Society and the Rathmines and Rathgar Musical Society, but there are considerable costs involved for these two very worthy organisations.  In times of recession it is important that the theatre &mdash;<Col N="288" /> ballet, opera and so on &mdash; has the support of the Government, because at such times people are depressed.</P>
    <P>I hear complaints about buskers and actors performing in Grafton Street and so on, but I see nothing to complain about because I approve of street theatre.  In my view it adds colour to the scene and gives hope to the many spectators. People respond positively to this type of entertainment.  Every encouragement should be given to these people.  The Government have an obligation to support live theatre and should be prepared to intervene positively to save the Gaiety from closure over the Christmas period. The Gaiety Theatre over the years has had an enormous cultural and morale boosting effect on the nation.  We have been mean and mealy-mouthed enough about the theatre.</P>
    <P>The Government should remove the 23 per cent VAT on theatre tickets.  I should like to remind the House that in a similar situation VAT was removed from books.  A special case can be made for the theatre for the removal of VAT. The argument may be put up against that suggestion that the Olympia Theatre and others are commercial enterprises, but we must also take into consideration the voluntary theatres that are under severe threat.  Many of those involved in such theatres have told me that if there is not a change with great urgency in regard to VAT on theatre tickets we will not have any theatres in the city within 18 months. I am sure the Minister appreciates the urgency of this matter.  In fact I do not think any great amount of revenue accrues to the Government from this tax.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Theatre Festival, which has just concluded, was a great success, and that was an indication of the enormous support that exists here for good theatre.  The same situation exists in Belfast where a very effective theatre and music festival is held.  In Cork an excellent film festival and a jazz festival are held also.  If we depress them we destroy the morale of a lot of people and their feeling for things cultural.  I accept that the Minister of State has taken a great interest in the Gaiety Theatre and I sympathise with him having regard to the <Col N="289" /> circumstances he finds himself in.  However, he should meet the management of the Gaiety Theatre and ask them to set up a trust to bring them through the Christmas period.  I am sure they will respond positively.  He should try to ensure that if the theatre is closed down for five months money will be spent on the badly needed renovation.  The musty smell there indicates that some renovation is needed.  The Minister should enter into negotiations tomorrow morning with regard to setting up a trust.  I believe the management of the theatre are acting in good faith.  I have no reason to believe that the contents of the letter sent to the Minister of State and the Arts Council are not true, but I am worried that in these times of recession and great pressure, and with the development of the Gallagher site opposite the theatre, they may be encouraged to develop the site into an office block.  I understand the financial pressures that would be on the management to develop the site as an office block.  That would be legitimate business, but as leaders in our community we must make known our views about this matter.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Minister of State has taken a personal interest in this matter and I have no axe to grind with him on that score.  He is aware that the major commercial theatres in the city are as important as any other theatres.  They have all been hopelessly under capitalised and we are all aware of the reasons for that.  There have been a number of greedy people taking too much out of the theatre and not putting a lot into it.  However there are many people in the theatre world who have put a lot into it but did not get anything out of it.  Successive Governments have taken too much out of the theatre by way of VAT.  It would be wrong of me not to impress upon the Minister of State the urgent need to appeal to the Minister for Finance to reduce the penal taxation on the theatre. If the Gaiety Theatre does not survive the Christmas period the city, and the country, will be a lot poorer.  Even at a time when there is pruning in every Department it is vital that something is <Col N="290" /> done about preserving the Gaiety Theatre.</P>
    <P>I understand that, if I conclude before my time, the Ceann Comhairle will permit me to question the Minister later.</P>

      <P>My primary concern is to ensure that the future of the Gaiety Theatre as a theatre is assured.  Naturally, I am also concerned with the employment at the theatre both as regards the actors, actresses, musicians, those concerned with the on-stage performance and also the theatre staff.  I am aware that Deputy Andrews has the same concern that I have about the Gaiety Theatre and the theatre in general.  I can recall that when we were colleagues in another sphere Deputy Andrews was a regular patron of the Gaiety Theatre and others when he was surrounded by people who might be termed as relative philistines at that stage.  I am aware that his interest is not new.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of the House will know that the owners of the theatre, Gaiety Theatre (Dublin) Limited and the lessees, Eamon Andrews Productions Limited, are in serious dispute on a number of important legal questions on the future operation of the Gaiety as a theatre.  It is important that I should make that statement. In a letter dated 6 October from Eamonn Andrews Productions Limited, &mdash; the company which leases the theatre &mdash; I was informed that the company could no longer continue the management of the theatre, had informed their landlords of the position and asked them to take over the operation of the theatre.  In my statement issued on 7 October I stressed the importance of the Gaiety Theatre as a major municipal theatre of which Dublin should be proud.  As I said on that occasion it was heartening that the owners of the premises had given a public commitment to the continuance of the <Col N="291" /> Gaiety as a theatre, refurbished and renovated. We have the situation that if the lessees cannot continue the owner company said they will continue, refurbish and renovate the theatre at substantial cost and that they have the funds to do this.</P>
    <P>The company who own the theatre, Gaiety Theatre (Dublin) Limited, confirmed that commitment in a letter to me dated 12 October 1983.  They indicated in that letter that legal action was in progress regarding the dilapidations in the theatre, and they stated that if the theatre was closed by Eamonn Andrews Productions on 22 October and the lease surrendered they would immediately commence essential refurbishment of the theatre without any delay.  The theatre would be closed for four months to carry out that work and it would reopen in early 1984.</P>
    <P>In that letter they rejected emphatically any suggestion that they were seeking possession of the theatre in order to demolish it and they confirmed their intention to ensure that the theatre was properly maintained and operated by a satisfactory tenant or under their own management with a full commitment to its future operations as a theatre.  They also affirmed that they have the necessary resources to refurbish the theatre without calling on public funds.  The figures mentioned are quite substantial, ranging between £200,000 and £380,000.</P>
    <P>I had a meeting with representatives of that company and they have reiterated the understanding given in their earlier letter to me.  I have teased out all the matters that concern the Deputy.  I have sought as far as anyone could to get undertakings.  Three members of the board of the company were present at the meeting.  The undertakings I got were similar to those I got in writing.  We have no alternative but to take them at face value.  I put to them the various reservations made by people in the city and all those involved and they answered all those questions.  I was assured as far as anyone could be assured with regard to that matter.</P>
    <P>I also had a meeting yesterday with <Col N="292" /> representatives of Eamonn Andrews Productions who were seeking funds of around £40,000 and of the other interests involved in running the theatre, the various theatre managements and the unions.  The productions that would be affected by the temporary closure, if there is a temporary closure, would be those of the Rathmines and Rathgar Musical Society, Dublin Grand Opera Society and, after Christmas, the pantomime. From the discussion there seemed to be a distinct possibility that alternative venues could be arranged for at least two of these if refurbishing the theatre started immediately.</P>
    <P>Eamonn Andrews Productions indicated that they needed a guarantee against loss of £40,000 to enable them to continue on until next spring, but it was not clear what their plans were thereafter. As the House will appreciate, there are many calls on the State and specifically on the Arts Council for assistance towards artistic institutions and enterprises. It is very rare indeed that the position arises where a private firm is available to fall back on to provide the necessary facilities and carry out the enterprise out of their own resources.  We have very categorical assurances that this is so in this case and I have no reason to doubt but that the company concerned, Gaiety Theatre (Dublin) Limited, have got the resources and the commitment to do so.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, it would be a misrepresentation of the situation to describe this as the closing down of a theatre or the elimination of a venue in which the performing arts may flourish. This is a distinguished Victorian theatre which we must not lose and which forms a valuable base for our performing artists and for visiting performers as well.</P>
    <P>My primary concern is to ensure that the future of the Gaiety is assured.  It is not my job to adjudicate between managements. I accept the point made by Deputy Andrews regarding difficulties for all theatres.  Today I met a delegation of managements and trade unions who explained the difficulties created by the 23 per cent VAT rate.  They made that point very forcibly today.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="293" /> I know it is a difficult time.  The House will accept that it is very unfortunate that although it is a time of extreme difficulty for all theatres it is also an extremely difficult budgetary time for the Government. When theatres most need help, because of budgetary constraints we are in the worst position to help them.</P>

Legal implications <Col N="294" /> prevent me from going into some details that might be of interest and which would enlighten the Deputy.

      <P>The council were allocated £4,465,000 from the Local Loans Fund on 12 April last to finance existing commitments and a further £840,000 was provided on 22 June 1983 in response to their claim for the financing of new works which they hope to commence this year.</P>
      <P>I have no proposal before me at present from the council to make extra moneys available to them to provide a new housing scheme at Muff.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="48" /> In making this provisional order, I gave full and careful consideration to the evidence presented at the public local inquiry and the report of the person who held the inquiry, including evidence in relation to the Hope Castle Amenity Area, the effect of the proposal on farmers and the possibility of a future arterial drainage scheme for the River Fane.  I was satisfied from the evidence and report that Dundalk Urban District Council need a proper water supply as a matter of urgency, that the Lough Muckno/River Fane system is the only suitable source available to meet the Council's needs and that the proposal could be implemented without undue hardship to farmers or injury to amenity.</P>
    <P>It is not the practice to make available the report of the person who held a local inquiry into a proposal such as this and I do not propose to depart from that practice in this case.</P>
    <P>As to the question of costs, the position is that under section 91 of the Local Government Act, 1946, as amended by section 64 of the Local Government Act, 1955, I may certify that a contribution should be made towards costs and expenses reasonably incurred by any person (other than a local authority or other body) in relation to a local inquiry and direct payment by the local authority should I consider it reasonable to do so. Each application has to be considered on its merits and I cannot give any indication in advance as to whether such a contribution would be certified and directed to be paid in the event of a formal application being made to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Energy if, in view of the failure of approximately five per cent of motor cars in this country which are of the diesel variety, he will make an order regulating the amount of sulphur content so that it is in line with the maximum amount allowed in other parts of Europe since diesel with a high sulphur content is known to be very damaging to cars; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>The European Communities (Sulphur Content of Gas Oil) Regulations 1977 (S.I. No. 361 of 1977) were made by the Minister for the Environment to give effect to EEC Directive 75/716 to limit the levels of sulphur content <Col N="57" /> in gas diesel oils in the interests of public health and the environment.</P>
      <P>The levels approved for the EEC were 0.3 per cent by weight for general use and 0.5 per cent for use in zones, where the levels of sulphur dioxide pollution were low, as in Ireland.  Although the level permitted here up to October 1985 is 0.8 per cent by weight, the sulphur content of auto diesel oil on sale here is lower than 0.5 per cent overall and lower than 0.3 per cent in many cases.</P>
      <P>In practice therefore, the sulphur content of diesel oil on sale here is the same as that available in other parts of Europe so that legislative changes are hardly called for.  In view of the practical position which I have outlined, a change in the legislative position (which would not in any event be appropriate to my functions) does not seem to be called for at this time.</P>

      <P>Competitiveness in the marketplace for leather is the critical determining <Col N="58" /> factor of the extent to which native bovine animal hides can be processed in this country on a commercially viable basis.  The current difficulties being experienced by the Irish tanning industry are to some extent a reflection of the impact of market forces on the industry.</P>
      <P>The Industrial Development Authority and other State agencies are providing a wide range of incentives and services to encourage the processing, to the maximum extent possible, of native bovine animal hides in the country.  Recent substantial financial assistance by the State agencies to the Irish leather industry, which is based mainly on processing native hides, underlines the Government's commitment to exploit fully this valuable indigenous resource.</P>
      <P>The Government would prefer that a higher proportion of home produced hides were converted into leather in this country.  However, in the present-day circumstances of the tanning industry in Western Europe generally, it would be unrealistic to envisage that it would be possible to have all bovine hides tanned in this country.  Even if the capacity to do so were to exist, there would remain the problem of selling profitably the additional output.</P>

      <P>The IDA, in conjunction with the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, have recently commissioned the NIHE, Glasnevin, to prepare an economic profile of Tallaght and Clondalkin which will assist in the planning of the future development of these towns.</P>
      <P>The IDA are continuing to promote their 25 acres of industrial land and their 18,600 sq. ft. advance factory in Tallaght for new industrial projects.

      <P>A number of the areas mentioned by the Deputy, namely Swords, Malahide and Portmarnock fall within Dublin Gas Company's statutory supply <Col N="60" /> boundaries and the development of these markets is, therefore, a matter for that company.  I have been informed by the company that they expect to extend their supply network to areas located to the north east of Dublin City on a phased basis starting from 1985.</P>
      <P>On foot of the understanding concluded earlier this month between the Irish and British Governments on the supply of natural gas to Northern Ireland, I have instructed Bord G·is …ireann to commence a planning programme encompassing the design and routing of the proposed pipeline.  A range of factors will have to be taken into account in the final route selection, including the proximity of potential markets to the proposed route.  In this regard it is my intention that the design of the pipeline will include provision for offtakes at a number of points.  However, the prospects and timeframe for extensions to centres adjacent to the pipeline, including some of those mentioned by the Deputy, will depend on the economic and technical feasibility of such projects.</P>

It is my intention to adopt the same measures as those used in the successful Cork-Dublin pipeline project where an Irish content of approximately 70 per cent was achieved.  This was the maximum possible given that the principal materials involved, the pipes and fittings, were not available from Irish sources.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any dissatisfaction in relation to these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Matters relating to the rotation of UNIFIL contingents and any serious incidents occurring in Lebanon are notified to the media by the Government Information Services.  Moreover, the Army Press Officer frequently briefs radio, television and press correspondents on matters of interest occurring in Lebanon and all press queries on such matters are dealt with promptly.  Communications of this nature have been valuable in informing the public generally and, on occasion, in reassuring families <Col N="70" /> and friends in cases where there may have been cause for concern.</P>
    <P>The contingent serving with UNIFIL is kept well informed of events at home. A news digest is issued to them every day and newspapers, magazines and periodicals are issued at a rate of about 700 a week.  Video recordings are also issued weekly containing programmes on sport and current affairs which are shown in messes and canteens.</P>
    <P>I might add that postal communication between the troops and their relatives and friends is either free or very inexpensive and normally takes three days in each direction.  In the case of personnel with urgent domestic problems radio / telephone communication can be established at short notice.</P>

      <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General audits the accounts of certain statutory bodies either as the duly appointed auditor under the Companies Act, 1963, or by appointment of the Minister for Finance or other Ministers concerned.  Fees are charged for these audits and are calculated each year by costing the man-days of the officers engaged on the audits at the appropriate salary scales.  Also included in the fees is a percentage addition to cover superannuation and administration charges.  Travel and other costs are added where relevant.  Fees are revised from year to year to cover salary increases.</P>
      <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General also audits the accounts of a number of statutory bodies where he is the appointed auditor in the specific legislation setting up the bodies; no fee is charged for these audits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to State-sponsored bodies whose accounts are not audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General, the fixing of auditors' fees for those bodies which are limited liability companies is governed by section 160 of the Companies Act, 1963.  The normal practice under the terms of that section is that auditors' fees are decided upon at the annual general meetings of the bodies, However, there is provision under the section whereby auditors may be appointed by the directors of a company outside annual general meetings when a vacancy arises or by directors of a newly established company before the first <Col N="111" /> annual general meeting of the company. In both such cases the auditors' fees may be fixed by the directors.  The fixing of auditors' fees for State-sponsored bodies which are not limited liability companies but which derive their authority from the Acts under which they were established, and whose accounts are not audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General, are decided upon by the bodies themselves.</P>

      <P>The entitlement of an applicant to pay-related benefit with flat-rate unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that the sum of flat-rate unemployment benefit, pay-related benefit and income tax rebate may not exceed 85 per cent of his average net weekly earnings. The 85 per cent limit applicable to the person concerned is £29.62.</P>
      <P>The weekly flat rate of unemployment benefit payable from the commencement of his claim £31.65 weekly increasing to £34.80 from 30 June 1983, exceeded the 85 per cent limit and accordingly no pay-related benefit was payable.  However he did not satisfy the contribution condition for continuous payment at the maximum rate after exhaustion of 156 days of benefit and the rate of flat-rate unemployment benefit payable to him from 22 September 1983 was reduced to £28.90 weekly.  Consequently he qualified for pay-related benefit from that date at £0.72 weekly and combined payments of £29.62 weekly continue to be made to him as they become due.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 27 May 1982 and was paid to 16 February 1983. Payment was disallowed after that date following examination by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.</P>
      <P>The claimant appealed against the decision to disallow his claim to benefit and subsequently submitted a final certificate which certified him as fit to resume work on 24 February 1983.  The case was then referred to an appeals officer who decided that the claimant was not capable of work from 17 February to 23 February 1983.</P>
      <P>While the appeal was under review however he claimed supplementary welfare allowance and the amount advanced by the health board was recovered from the arrears of disability benefit payable.</P>
      <P>He subsequently claimed unemployment benefit from 28 February 1983 but the initial payment was not made until 11 March 1983 as a claim for separate payments was lodged by his wife.  While awaiting payment of unemployment benefit he again claimed supplementary welfare allowance from 28 February to 2 March 1983 and the sum advanced was withheld from the arrears of unemployment benefit payable and refunded to the health board.  Unemployment benefit was paid to 30 August 1983 after which date he ceased to sign the unemployment register.</P>

      <P>Portmarnock and Donabate/Portrane are but two of a number of areas in and around Dublin where there is a local demand for the establishment of a Garda station.  The difficulty about providing extra Garda stations, apart from the high capital costs involved, is that manning them absorbs Garda manpower which might be used more effectively on patrol duty in the areas concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities consider that the current arrangements whereby the Portmarnock and Donabate/Portrane areas are served from Malahide and Swords stations, respectively, make the <Col N="159" /> best use of available resources and there are no proposals at present for the provision of separate stations in these areas.</P>
    <P>In the year ended 30 September 1983, Garda strength at Malahide and Swords stations was increased by 17 and 14, respectively, and 24-hour opening was introduced at both stations in January last.  The extra manpower and extended opening hours have provided improved policing arrangements for all the areas served from these two stations and the question of further improvements in the Garda service for the areas in question will be kept under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East):</i> The embargo on the creation and filling of public service posts applied to the Land Registry.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the processing of applications for first registration, including the establishment of title by possession, in the Land Registry takes 12 months and more.  However, the number of applications in this category constitutes only about 5 per cent of the total number of applications for registration lodged annually in the Registry.  Those applications involve detailed and complex examination of title and often protracted correspondence with solicitors as well as the issue of statutory notices to interested parties, which usually gives rise to further correspondence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because in many cases delays are caused by incompleteness in the submission of applications to the Land Registry, the Law Society propose to hold a series of seminars for solicitors, which will be attended by Land Registry officials, with the aim of eliminating or at least reducing time-consuming correspondence.  The <Col N="160" /> first of those seminars are being held on 26, 27 and 28 October 1983.</P>
