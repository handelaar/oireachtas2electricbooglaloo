    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The existing legislation which governs the sale of local authority houses does not permit the cost of agreed pre-sale repairs undertaken by a tenant to be deducted from the purchase price of the house.  A tenant may, however, enter into an agreement with a housing authority that he will, within a specified time after the making of a transfer order, carry out or arrange to have carried out the works necessary to put the house into good structural repair.  In such cases the authority will recoup to the tenant the agreed cost when the work has been completed to the satisfaction of the authority.</P>

Because a tenant has signed an agreement to purchase his house, has 21 days and pays £5 to the Department of <Col N="1194" /> the Environment, it does not always follow that his repairs, as promised, are carried out?  In those circumstances, has that tenant any legal status to ensure that the work is carried out or can he insist that the work be carried out?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>From the £65 million it is proposed to get by way of extra charges for services this year from local authorities, it is estimated that about £2 million will have to be collected from ratepayers in County Mayo.  This would be in excess of the total amount received by rates on commercial properties and it would involve enormous charges.  Is the Minister aware of the exact level of charges that the sums he speaks about would entail?

This in turn is creating a problem in relation to employment in an area which has a very high unemployment record as was indicated by another Minister in answer to a previous question.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the sentiments expressed by Deputy Blaney.  However, nationwide the average cost of a new house is £35,000 and in our view a charge of £30 for each house application is not excessive.  It does not in any way cover the cost of administration.  An extension will not be built for less than £3,000 or £4,000 and a charge of £15 is not excessive. Even allowing for people building their own houses and a certain degree of co-operative construction in rural areas, a new house will still cost between £15,000 and £20,000.  We spent a long time considering this matter and do not feel that a charge of £30 is excessive but I would say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>The statutory powers governing the storage, movement and disposal of toxic and dangerous waste are vested in local authorities under the European Communities (Toxic and Dangerous Waste) Regulations, 1982, which came into operation on 1 January 1983.  The regulations provide for a number of controls including a permit system and a consignment note system which enable local authorities to monitor the movement of the relevant wastes from source to ultimate point of disposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The selection of sites for their own waste disposal operations and the approval of private disposal sites are matters for the local authority.  My approval is not necessary to the sites selected by local authorities and there is no list of such sites in my Department.  The role of <Col N="1209" /> the Department is mainly in the area of issuing advice to local authorities, and guidelines were recently issued to them on the factors to be taken into account in site selection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister renew the commitment given by the last Minister for the Environment that the Dunsink dump in the Finglas area will not be used for toxic waste?  As there are no official dumps at present will the Minister indicate what is being done with the toxic waste?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

If the Deputy tables a specific question about that matter I will get the information for him.  It is not that I am not answering the Deputy but I am not in a position to give him the information.  In reply to the second part of the Deputy's supplementary I should like to state that there is no clear policy in regard to the disposal of toxic waste throughout the country.  It is primarily a matter for local authorities to respond to EEC regulations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the proper fulfilment by the local authorities of the tasks designated by him under the legislation to monitor the control and disposal of the toxic waste will require expert staff in the employment of local authorities?  Will the Minister look favourably on applications that may be submitted by local authorities for the appointment of the necessary expertise to monitor and control the disposal of these poisons?</P>

Are regulations being prepared to ensure that such waste is transported safely?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>

    <P>1  Allocations under the Environmental Improvement Scheme, which commenced in 1977, are made by the Department on a county borough/county-at-large (excl. Dublin) basis.  The distribution of an allocation to sub-areas within a county is a matter for the appropriate County Manager.  The amounts in the table, therefore, are those portions of overall allocations notified to Cork County Council which were allocated locally to the authorities in question.</P>

      <P>It is accepted diplomatic practice for an ambassador to a given country to be temporarily assigned additional special tasks by his Government, which is what I understand to have been done in this case.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of ratification of these covenants has been under consideration for some time by interested Government Departments.  It is envisaged that both covenants will be ratified simultaneously, as has been the general practice followed by other states party to the covenants.  Before proceeding to ratification, the Government are anxious to <Col N="1214" /> ensure that our domestic legislation enables us to comply fully with the terms of the covenants.  In this connction, certain problems remain for us with regard to the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  My Department are actively seeking to resolve these outstanding problems so that we can proceed to early ratification of both covenants.  The question of ratifying the optional protocol to the UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights will be considered when any substantive difficulties in the way of ratification of the covenant itself have been resolved.</P>

We are now in the embarrassing position of calling on other Governments to live up to international standards which we have failed to ratify.  Given that that is an extremely embarrassing situation for any country I should like to know if the Minister feels that the matter will be expedited now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of embarrassment in not having ratified the covenants because we are fully in accordance with the European Convention.

      <P>This is tied up with the <Col N="1216" /> next question.  Obviously there have been studies with regard to this area.  The Deputy's question was specifically to know if the proposal had been sent to the Commission to designate the area as an integrated area.  My information is that no such proposal has been made to the European Commission.  Apparently this idea was talked about by the previous Government but nothing happened.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 and 34 together.</P>
      <P>From inquiries made of the US Embassy here I understand that the object to which the Deputy's question refers was not placed in Irish territorial waters nor on the seabed and that it had broken off a US vessel somewhere at sea. Consequently I have not made representations to the US Government in the sense suggested by the Deputy, nor do I plan to do so.</P>
      <P>The object in question was a trailing antenna.  This is simply a communications device, much like a car radio antenna, although considerably larger, which is trailed behind vessels, usually submarines, and is used to pick up any acoustic signals in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Together with a second such object which had been found at an earlier date, the object in question was returned to the US authorities as a normal courtesy and shipped from Cork on 8 April 1982 by an Irish civilian haulage firm engaged by the US authorities.  No reimbursement was sought from the US Government for the <Col N="1218" /> very small costs involved in bringing the object found near Dingle to Collins Barracks, Cork.</P>
    <P>I am not aware that any objects of the kind mentioned have been found in Irish waters since March 1982.  The Government have not received any requests for assistance in locating such objects in Irish waters and have not offered such assistance to other countries.  I would not accept that the finding of the object referred to carries any implications for Irish neutrality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that the Government were not asked for nor did they offer any assistance.  Can the Minister tell the House that there are no such devices off the Irish coast which are used either by the British Government, the American Government or any other Government for the monitoring of shiping off the coast?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in the reply, the apparatus in question was not, as the Deputy thought, an electronic device for monitoring submarine activities. It was a trailing antenna.  I have no information about electronic devices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated that the antenna, as he described it, is normally fitted to a submarine.  Presumably if it belonged to the American Government it must have been an American submarine that was operating off the Irish coast.  Can the Minister indicate for what purpose the American submarine was off the Irish coast?</P>

      <P>Could the Minister indicate if there is any sharing of information about movements of military shipping off the Irish coast in the Atlantic between America and Britain and ourselves?

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland's official development assistance in 1983 will amount to £30.076 million. This represents an increase of £5.468 million or more than 22 per cent over the expected outturn of £24.608 million in 1982.  The 1983 figure includes £3 million of voted monies in addition to those contained in the Book of Estimates published in November 1982.</P>
      <P>ODA in 1983 will amount to .23 per cent of GNP as against .21 per cent in 1982, an increase of .02 per cent.</P>
      <P>The Joint Programme for Government of 12 December 1982 states that the Government will adhere to the commitment to increase development aid by .05 per cent of GNP each year until the UN target of 0.7 per cent is reached.  However, in the present difficult budgetary situation, it was not possible this year to go beyond the increase to which I have already referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1221" /> As ODA in 1983 has, nevertheless, been increased substantially in real terms, the Deputy's reference to an assumed intention on the part of the Government to continue to decrease aid in the years 1984, 1985 and 1986 is not understood.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take both questions together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the unfortunate death in question is being investigated and, pending completion of the investigation, an official statement cannot be made as to the circumstances in which the death occurred.</P>
      <P>It is public knowledge, having been widely reported in the media, that there was a fire apparently involving bedding, but how the fire was started or the extent to which it contributed directly or indirectly to the death is not known as yet.</P>
      <P>The investigation will also cover the question whether the procedures governing the custody of persons in Garda stations were followed.  It may, of course, be taken for granted that there will be an inquest in which the circumstances will be the subject of sworn evidence given in public.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In my question I asked if the Minister was satisfied with the procedures that exist at present for ensuring the safety of persons, and will he answer whether he is?  Would he also say if a system of alarm bells could be fitted in cells in Garda stations so that if a person is in difficulty he can contact the sergeant on duty?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am happy with the procedures governing the custody of persons at present but, as I said in my reply, the investigation will also cover the question whether the procedures governing the custody of persons in Garda stations were followed on this occasion.  If the Deputy communicates to me views like those already expressed by him, I will look into them as well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister take immediate steps to look into this matter, apart from the investigation which will cover much wider aspects of the situation. The question of bedding was raised in the media and I ask the Minister to <Col N="1224" /> inquire if a polyurethane foam mattress was involved.  It was mentioned that the gardaí made brave efforts to gain entry to the cell but the very acrid smoke prevented them from doing so.  If a polyurethane foam mattress was involved, would the Minister take immediate action?  He should have that information now because it would not be very difficult to find out these facts.  Will he ensure that such mattresses are changed and the new mattresses are flame-proofed?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I do not want to say anything which might prejudice the investigation but in reply to a recent question by Deputy Gregory-Independent I pointed out that the greatest source of danger arising from deliberate or accidental fires in a cell here and abroad has been fumes from burning mattresses.</P>
      <P>My Department have been seeking specifications for safer mattresses and after long prolonged tests by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards specifications were prepared and the contracts placed.  The mattresses are now being delivered, and that applies to cells in Garda stations and prisons.  I am sure every Deputy shares the deep concern I feel at this tragedy, but the system of replacing existing mattresses by safer mattresses is in train.  It will emerge from the investigation if this was an old-type mattress or if it had been replaced.</P>

      <P>The Chair wants to run the business of the House in an orderly way in accordance with Standing Orders and well-established precedent. The Chair appeals to Deputies to co-operate. Deputies have the assurance of the Chair that he will be impartial in all matters.  He does not claim any bouquets for that &mdash; that is his duty &mdash; but he appeals to Deputies to co-operate with him.  If Deputies continue day after day to make the same points which they have been told are out of order, the Chair will not treat that as a fresh act of disorder but as a continuing act of disorder and he will deal with it very severely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Chair that I am anxious to be as orderly as possible and to afford the Chair every possible co-operation and respect.  However, the Chair is straining our credulity a bit far when he talks about precedent in regard to matters of Private Notice Questions.  All through last term, when we were on the Government side of the House, the Chair was a very skilful protaganist on the Opposition side of the House.  The matter of Private Notice Questions was raised here again and again and the rulings of the Chair at that stage were questioned from this side of the House on many an occasion.  With all due respect, we cannot leave the matter as the Chair has outlined.  I want to be helpful about this.  The Chair has a responsibility to come up very soon with some sort of agreed procedures covering this area.  We, as Ministers of a Government, have had to endure a certain state of affairs for a long time.  Now, on the other side of the House, we are being asked by the Chair to agree to a totally different state of affairs.  We will really have to get together with the Chair from all sides of the House to work out some new system for dealing with these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome what the Leader of the Opposition has said and particularly welcome the statement and promises of co-operation made by him on the day of my election.  I accepted those in good faith.  I know that what the <Col N="1227" /> former Taoiseach has now said is also meant.  At the same time, it is not a matter for the Chair to amend Standing Orders.  The Chair presides over the Committee on Procedure and Privileges which can recommend to the House that Standing Orders be amended.  The Chair certainly will co-operate in proposals for the amendment of Standing Orders if some member of the committee so proposes &mdash; whether a member of the Government, the Opposition, or an Independent Member if there is one on the committee.  It will then be a matter for the House to amend the Standing Orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect, we must go a little beyond that.  The Chair has an obligation here.  We are dealing with a totally unsatisfactory situation. Two areas have been the subject of protracted dissension in the House, which is not satisfactory from the point of view of the Government or the Opposition.  The two matters are, firstly, the whole question of a Private Notice Question being a matter of urgent public importance and secondly, the area of what may or may not be raised on the Order of Business. We have had much upset in the House over a long period in these two areas and I would ask the Chair seriously to consider taking an initiative about them. When I was in the Taoiseach's seat &mdash; and I am sure that he can confirm the experience &mdash; I was often put in the position where I wished to reply to matters raised in the House on the Order of Business and was prevented from doing this, rightly so in accordance with the rules of order.  Perhaps the Chair would take serious note of what I am saying, address himself immediately to these two aspects of our business and perhaps take some initiative in regard to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall look into the matter.  I will welcome an approach from the Government Chief Whip and the Chief Whip of the Fianna Fáil Party. However, I must say that, pending that, the very forceful point was made on the first day of the sitting of this 24th Dáil by the Leader of the Opposition &mdash; and I do <Col N="1228" /> not say that in any controversial way &mdash; that argument with the Chair would have to stop.  That is what I am appealing for pending a change in procedure &mdash; that we do not have wrangles and argument with the Chair.  The Chair must be respected, whoever the occupant be for the time being, if this House is to conduct its business in a dignified way.</P>

      <P>Might I intervene to say that, having had the same experience, I appreciate the sense of frustration of the Opposition.  We have shared the frustration of the times when we have not been able to reply.  However, it is a matter for the parties to bring forward to the committee.  It is unfair to expect the Chair to take the initiative.  We, on our part, will be more than happy to co-operate in modifying the procedures so that the frustration we all feel at present at not being able to raise matters of current interest can be overcome.</P>

I read a full account of that programme and an answer to my question in the <i>Anglo-Celt</i> of last Friday.  I am raising this question to protect the Chair, to see to it that it is above suspicion in all <Col N="1351" /> cases.  I put the question down in good faith to elicit information.  It went to the Ceann Comhairle's office because the Ceann Comhairle is in charge of questions which come before this House and I was a little fazed to read the full answer to my question in the <i>Anglo-Celt,</i> in a letter from the Minister for Health to the Ceann Comhairle.  I would like also to mention that when I checked this in the Ceann Comhairle's office, I discovered that a question which I had put down for oral reply had been changed to a written reply in the preliminary printing of the Order Paper.  I checked my original document, as put into the General Office and there is no indication on that that I wanted this by way of written reply.  I would, in all things, like to protect the Chair from all suspicion and would ask him to let me know the date of his letter to the Minister for Health covering the point of my question and the date of the letter sent to you by the Minister for Health in reply, which appeared in full in my local newspaper.</P>

I had no previous notice that Deputy Wilson intended to raise the matter here and make no point of that.  However, I cannot give Deputy Wilson exact dates.  However, I can tell Deputy Wilson that I did not write to the Minister for Health about the hospital but that I spoke to him about it.  I will gladly make available to Deputy Wilson a full copy of the letter which I received from the Minister for Health in reply to my query.

      <P>By way of clarification, the Minister asks that the word in brackets &ldquo;Amendment&rdquo; be deleted.  While I have no objection at all if one takes out the word &ldquo;Amendment&rdquo; from that section, would it not also be appropriate that one would remove the word from the Title of the Bill?  Also on the front of the document there is reference to amendment of an Act.  Indeed, on the last page also the same word, &ldquo;Amendment&rdquo; appears in brackets again.  It might be somewhat unusual to have the word &ldquo;Amendment&rdquo; taken out and still have the thing referring to &ldquo;as initiated&rdquo;.  Therefore its drafting might require further attention.</P>

      <P>This is an amendment put forward as a result of a suggestion of the parliamentary draftsman.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the amended version will now read &mdash; Insurance Act, 1982.  I note on page 2 it is cited that this is an Act to amend the Insurance Acts, 1909 to 1981.  How can one amend any of those Acts unless it is an amendment to the Act when this is a new Act in its entirely?  It would seem incongruous to me to do it this way particularly when the first section concerns an amendment of section 2 of the Insurance Act of 1953, and there have been quite a number of amendments of various Acts down the years, including section 2 of the Insurance Act, 1969.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did suggest at some stage that section 2 of the Insurance Act, 1969, did allow for insurance credit for design and planning services.  This is purely a further amendment of those Acts and <Col N="1355" /> it could not be regarded as the Principal Act.  Consequently, I am somewhat at a loss to understand whether we might again find that this matter will not be legally proper.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I had better read out the advice of the parliamentary draftsman.  The Deputy will appreciate that the proposed amendment does not affect the actual content of the Bill &mdash; it is purely a technical amendment in regard to which one normally accepts the advice of the parliamentary draftsman.  The note I have states:</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;Amendment&rdquo; has been used in the Short Title of only one previous Insurance Act, that of 1978. The Parliamentary Draftsman's Office has now instructed that the use of the word &ldquo;Amendment&rdquo; in the 1978 Act should be treated as an exception and the practice of using the Short Title &ldquo;Insurance Act, 19&mdash;&rdquo; without the word &ldquo;Amendment&rdquo; should be continued.</P>

      <P>If that be the case would it not be in conflict with section 1, subject to amendments to the 1950 Act?  You would have an amendment of another Act which in turn would be an amendment to a Principal Act but which could not be regarded <i>in toto</i> as the Principal Act itself.  This is very confused but I would not make any difficulty for the Minister about it so long as it is in accordance with proper drafting procedures and that these words, &ldquo;amendment&rdquo; in the front, the back and in the other three locations in the Bill will be adjusted accordingly.</P>

      <P>I have another difficulty.  I cannot appreciate why the Minister here is not removing the word from this Bill to accommodate the draftsman.  It is stated in simple terms that this is the Export Promotion (Amendment) Act and in the same way as the previous Bill it would serve to amend previous Acts, the 1959 Act in particular.  I cannot understand why if the draftsman is insisting on having the word &ldquo;Amendment&rdquo; deleted from the Insurance Bill he is not insisting that it be deleted from this.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In contrast, however, the Parliamentary <Col N="1357" /> Draftsman's Office has advised that since successive amendments to the Export Promotions Acts have included the word &ldquo;Amendment&rdquo; in the Short Title this practice should be continued.  The Parliamentary Draftsman's Office felt strongly that the custom of adhering to the existing Short Titles format should be continued in these cases.</P>
    <P>What they are concerned about is a technical amendment which they regard to be in the interest of good legislative practice and consistency.  That applies to the previous Bill which the draftsman does not think should be in the form of an amendment but he does not give the same advice in this instance because there are two different histories in regard to the two sets of legislation.</P>

      <P>I am not in conflict with the Minister in this regard but it is interesting to see the different attitudes of the draftsman in two individual types of Bills.  I regard it as proper procedure in regard to the Export Promotions Bill because it amends legislation from 1959 to 1980.  It simply extends the power of the Minister to deal with matters other than those included in the other amendments.

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Minister for Transport (Mr. J. Mitchell) Jim Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is essentially an enabling one which will allow the Minister for Finance to increase the State shareholding in the air companies by up to £60 million and to increase from £75 million to £150 million the State guarantee limit for borrowings by the companies.  State <Col N="1358" /> equity investment in the air companies at the present time is £43.6 million and, subject to passage of the Bill, it is the intention of the Government to subscribe an additional £30 million by way of equity over the next 12 months, £15 million before the end of the present month and the other half before 31 March 1984.</P>
      <P>The Bill has to be seen as part of a comprehensive package designed to bring the air companies back to profitability as soon as possible.  Action by the airline itself and certain cost alleviation payments by the Exchequer are other elements in the overall package.  I should, perhaps, point out that, apart from some timing changes necessitated by the fact that introduction of the Bill was interrupted by the dissolution of the 23rd Dail, the financial re-structuring package is along the same general lines as that announced by my predecessor in July 1982.</P>
      <P>It is over four years since legislation relating to the air companies last came before the House.  Since the Air Companies (Amendment) Bill, 1978, which also provided for an increase in the State's shareholding in the air companies, was discussed, the aviation industry has passed through traumatic times.  We have witnessed the demise of such well-known airlines as Laker Airways and Braniff, other major carriers such as Pan Am have struggled for survival, while the aviation industry world-wide has recorded losses of unprecedented proportions.</P>
      <P>The situation is still grim.  To put the position of Aer Lingus in its proper perspective, it is interesting to note what Mr. Knut Hammarskjold, Director General of IATA (International Air Transport Association) had to say about the state of the air transport industry in the course of the association's most recent annual general meeting.  Mr. Hammarskjold pointed out that preliminary estimates for 1982 indicate that the combined loss for IATA carriers in their international scheduled operations will be more than two billion dollars and that collectively these carriers had lost money every year since 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main factors causing serious financial problems for the world's airlines have <Col N="1359" /> been the severe economic recession, which in recent years has affected the entire western economy and caused a slump in tourism and in travel generally, the effect on airline costs of inflation, fuel cost escalation, high interest rates, volatile currency exchange rates, and general over-capacity, particularly on the North Atlantic, which has led to severe competition for traffic and unremunerative fares structures.</P>
    <P>In the year ended 31 March 1982 Aer Lingus returned a net loss of £9.2 million. This followed a net loss of £13.6 million in 1980-81.  These figures are in stark contrast to a net profit of over £4 million in 1979-80 and a general record of profits through the seventies.  Indeed, lest the profitable record of Aer Lingus be overshadowed by its current difficulties, I think it only fair to point out that in the 20 year period from 1960 to 1980, Aer Lingus made profits in all years except four.  This was a record matched by few national airlines.  However, this record could not be maintained due principally to a dramatic deterioration in the economics of the airline's North Atlantic operations.</P>
    <P>While the company's North Atlantic service has traditionally been a loss maker, profits from its European air transport operations and more particularly from its ancillary activities, such as aircraft overhaul work, helicopter operations, hotels, computer services etc., have over the years helped to cushion the results of the Aer Lingus-Aerlínte group as a whole.  The scale of the 1980-81 losses, coupled with an assessment that 1981-82 would be little better, changed that situation utterly and left the airline facing major problems.  At the heart of those problems was the question of continued operation on the Atlantic.</P>
    <P>Aerlínte has lost money in each year since 1971 on its North Atlantic operations and accumulated losses on those operations as at 31 March 1982 exceeded £63 million.  The problems of the Atlantic have now become endemic and all airlines are suffering from them.  Indeed, in the year 1981 total published losses incurred by the airlines on the Atlantic <Col N="1360" /> amounted to $400 million and a figure of much the same magnitude is estimated for 1982.  Excess capacity and uneconomic pricing have inexorably brought heavy losses in their wake.</P>
    <P>Governments on both sides of the Atlantic have for some time past recognised the need to bring a degree of stability back into the market and, while some steps have been taken along that road, in a situation of deep world recession and excess aircraft capacity it would be unrealistic to expect an immediate about-turn from the uneconomic pricing policies that have plagued the airline industry in recent years.  If anything, the events of 1983, as they are unfolding, suggest that the road to recovery will be a very long haul indeed.</P>
    <P>For Aerlínte the problems of an Atlantic operation are particularly acute.  The smallness of the market, affecting economies of scale; seasonality, affecting the ability to employ aircraft adequately on a year-round basis; and low average fare, arising from the dominantly tourist as against business nature of the Irish market, are factors which inescapably make the Irish carrier's role especially difficult. Against this background of continuing heavy losses and inherent difficulties in its operation, Aer Lingus concluded, following a review of its strategic position with the help of management consultants, that without some additional State investment it could not maintain Atlantic operations.</P>
    <P>The fundamental question, therefore, had to be faced: should Aerlínte continue to provide an Atlantic service or should the presence of the national carrier on the route be terminated?  An expert group, comprised of representatives of my Department, the Department of Finance, the Department of Trade, Commerce and Tourism and Aer Lingus addressed that question and the related financial implications.</P>
    <P>The review group looked at the main factors in the deterioration of Aer Lingus's financial performance, examined the scope for cost reduction measures within the company and reviewed the role of the ancillary activities and their contribution to the company's finances. <Col N="1361" /> The group looked in detail at the future of the North Atlantic service, having regard to its contribution to the economy generally.</P>
    <P>The review group's examination revealed that in the short term at least there would be very little difference between the operating loss returned by the airline with its full range of trans-Atlantic and European services and the loss anticipated with North Atlantic services closed down.  This situation arises from the fact that, in spite of 1,500 immediate redundancies which would arise with an Atlantic closedown, a large element of costs currently shared between the trans-Atlantic and European operations would remain after an Atlantic close-down, thus pushing up significantly the costs of the European operation, rendering that operation unprofitable.</P>
    <P>In the course of its assessment of the value of the airline's trans-Atlantic operation to the economy generally and the implications of cessation of services by the only carrier on the route with a commitment to providing a service on a year round basis, the review group consulted with representatives of the various agencies concerned, including Aer Rianta, Bord Fáilte, SFADCo, Córas Tráchtála and the IDA.  The group found that, apart from the very substantial loss of employment involved &mdash; 1,500 jobs &mdash; the withdrawal of the Aerlínte service would prove damaging to many sectors of the economy including tourism, trade and commerce.  I should perhaps mention that this view was generally shared by the agencies consulted by the review group.</P>
    <P>While continuation of the North Atlantic operation was not seen by the group as being justified on strictly commercial grounds, even though closure would significantly disimprove the economics of the European operation, the group's assessment of the contribution made by the service to tourism, trade, industrial development, Shannon Airport and the Shannon region generally indicated that a recommendation in favour of termination of the service would be difficult to justify.</P>
    <P>It was on the basis of all these considerations <Col N="1362" /> that the last Government, in considering the financial position of the air companies in July 1982, concluded that it was essential from a national viewpoint that the airline should continue to provide a scheduled trans-Atlantic service, a decision recently reaffirmed by the present Government, which also accepted the need for further State investment in the air companies.</P>
    <P>The immediate problem is that arising from losses in the past the balance sheet of the air companies' consolidated operations bears an unsustainable level of debt relative to State equity.  As of March 1982 the ratio of debt to equity was 88:12 and the interest bill in the year 1981-82 was in excess of £12 million.  This is an unacceptable position for a company which is engaged in international commerce.</P>
    <P>In examining the need for further investment in the air companies the Government have had to take into consideration not alone the particularly difficult financial position of the Exchequer but also competing claims for equity investment from other State companies, some of which are also in the transport sector.  It is against that background that the Government have recently confirmed the former Government's decision to invest £30 million equity in the air companies by 31 March 1984.</P>
    <P>The Bill to provide equity is only one part of a thoroughly researched and comprehensive proposal to restore as soon as possible to viability the finances of the national airline.  There is no question that losses will be tolerated indefinitely or that there is unlimited Exchequer support available.  Action by the airline itself is, therefore, an essential element in the overall plan to improve its financial performance.</P>
    <P>An area in which Aer Lingus has been remarkably successful has been the development of profitable ancillary activities to balance the losses which the company has incurred on its air transport operations.  Over the years operating profits, before interest and tax, from ancillary activities have grown from £4 million in 1973-74 to over £18 million in 1981-82.  In net terms the 1981-82 profit <Col N="1363" /> after all charges amounted to some £12 million.  The success of Aer Lingus in these ancillary areas of providing services to other airlines, hotel management and financial and computer services is an example of the dynamism which the Government expect from State enterprises. These activities provide profits which have helped to sustain basic transport operations.  Without them a serious crisis in the airline's finances would have occurred long before now.  In addition, they help to provide and sustain significant employment in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, the essence of commercial risk-taking that some investments may not come up to expectations. The Government, therefore, expect Aer Lingus to keep under continual review all the individual components of its investments with a view to ensuring that they are earning an adequate return.  I know that this view is shared by the board of Aer Lingus.  Moreover, in the present circumstances there are limits on the amount of finance which the Exchequer can make available to the airline.  In that situation, it is reasonable &mdash; and I know that the previous Government were of the same view &mdash; that the company should make the maximum contribution which is commercially prudent from its ancillary activities towards the resolution of its present problems.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise, however, that it is not Government policy that Aer Lingus should disengage from its ancillary activities. It would be a very short-sighted strategy to dismantle the ancillary activities programme and forego the profits that the programme can continue to generate. A continuing, and hopefully growing, flow of profits from an ancillary activities programme, constructed and operated within the constraints of the airline's own resources, can help to ensure that Aer Lingus continues as a self-sufficient airline to discharge its mandate to provide air transport services on cross-Channel, European and North Atlantic routes.</P>
    <P>Action is also being taken by Aer Lingus with a view to improving efficiency and reducing costs in every aspect of its <Col N="1364" /> operations.  Undoubted progress is being made on this front, but with the recession continuing and constant pressure of competition, Aer Lingus must be relentless in cutting back expenditure wherever possible.  I fully appreciate that such necessary action can, of course, affect certain routes.  Indeed, Montreal and Chicago have already had to be dropped from the company's scheduled passenger network.  The B707 fleet was retired as its economics disimproved.  Operating patterns have had to be modified to realise savings.  Substantial savings in fuel consumption are being achieved and new technology is being introduced.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the considerable progress which Aer Lingus has made over the past two years in reducing staff numbers. While consultants' reports have made it clear that Aer Lingus is in line with industry norms of productivity for airlines of its size, the financial pressure which it is facing and the drastic measures being taken by its competitors to reduce their unit costs are such that further improvements are clearly necessary.  It is clear that our State companies which operate in international markets can only continue to be successful if their unit costs are as low as or lower than those of their competitors.  Sustainable jobs of long-term value to the community can only be maintained within a framework of commercial viability.  For this reason, I strongly support the efforts of Aer Lingus to streamline its operations further by reducing supervisory structures and simplifying work practices.  Considerable progress has already been made but Aer Lingus itself is fully aware of the need to do more to enable it to return to profitability as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>When these various elements &mdash; equity investment by the State and the measures being taken by the airline itself &mdash; are combined the unfortunate fact remains that Aer Lingus will still be in difficulty at least until a much more favourable environment is restored on the Atlantic route.  In that situation, and bearing in mind that accumulated losses on Atlantic operations give rise to an interest bill of the order of £7.5 million a year, the Government accept that some temporary <Col N="1365" /> support in respect of the commitment to continue Atlantic operations is called for. Payment of £5 million a year for a three-year period between 1983 and 1985 by way of cost alleviation to Aerlinte accordingly forms an integral part of the overall financial restructuring package. Provision for payment of the first £5 million instalment is included under subhead S of the Transport Vote in the current year's Estimates, which I understand the Dáil will take this week.  I must stress, however, that this cost alleviation is a temporary measure to help the airline during a period of particular difficulty. As such, it will, I believe, help the airline's finances without interfering with the commercial ethos of its operations.</P>
    <P>There is one other aspect of the North Atlantic situation to which I must refer and that is the position in relation to charter traffic from the United States this year.  Deputies may have seen recent press reports on this subject and I would like to take this opportunity to clear up any misunderstanding which may exist.</P>
    <P>First, let me say that the Government welcome US charters and see them as having an important role to play in ensuring that the needs of Irish tourism are adequately served, particularly in the peak season.  Any assessment of charter activity must, however, also take account of the basic need to provide the framework for comprehensive, reliable year-round air services at the lowest possible economic prices to meet the growing requirements of trade, commerce and tourism between Ireland and the US. Excessive charter capacity can very easily destabilise the market for scheduled carriers with a commitment to providing year-round services.  This can be particularly the case when the charter capacity is provided at what can only be termed opportunistic, or indeed predatory, fare levels.  It is against that background that I have had to examine the position as it was emerging on the charger front this year and take certain decisions which I will now recall for the benefit of the House.</P>
    <P>In examining charter programmes submitted in accordance with my Department's charterworthiness rules up to 31 <Col N="1366" /> January 1983, I reviewed the overall market situation and concluded that for the New York and Boston gateways, filed programmes, coupled with the services provided by the three scheduled service carriers, would provide ample capacity for the coming summer.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I approved the programmes before me at that time.  These programmes provided for a doubling of the number of charter seats that could be offered, as compared with the 1982 level of operations, and for a 50 per cent increase during the peak months June to September.  In approving that scale of increase, I am satisfied that there is ample scope for growth in tourist traffic between the US and Ireland in 1983.  In that regard, Deputies will be aware that Bord Fáilte have set themselves a target of a 5 per cent increase in tourist numbers from the United States this year.</P>
    <P>The charter programmes will be operated on Pan Am aircraft by Round Tower/Old Country Tours, the largest tour operator in the United States specialising in the Irish market, and by International Weekends, a large Bostonbased tour operator which has brought visitors to Ireland for many years.  The approved charter programmes are attractively priced and, taken in conjunction with the extremely keen fares being offered by the three scheduled carriers serving the US&mdash;Ireland market &mdash; Aer Lingus, Northwest Orient and Trans-America &mdash; should go a long way towards helping Bord Fáilte to attain their 1983 target.  Indeed, I should also mention that Pan Am charter operations played a significant part in the turn-around in Shannon Airport's fortunes last year, and the increased charter activity now authorised should help to further strengthen Shannon's performance during the current year.</P>
    <P>I have referred already to the destabilising impact that excessive charter capacity can have on the overall market. Accordingly, when approving the increase in charter activity which I have already described, interested parties, including a number of US airlines and tour operators, were notified that summer 1983 charter programmes beyond <Col N="1367" /> those duly filed and approved by me would not be authorised from either New York or Boston into Ireland.  That decision, I might add, was taken only after full consultation with the State agencies involved in the promotion of tourism to Ireland, all of whom acknowledged that the decision was necessary in the best interests of Irish tourism and the development of Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that without this regulatory action considerable damage could have ensued, damage which would not only have aggravated Aer Lingus' already serious financial problems on the Atlantic but might also have undermined the commitment of the US carriers to continue providing scheduled services to Ireland.</P>
    <P>Some press reporters have suggested that my decision also affects charters from Chicago.  That is not the case. Charters from Chicago, or indeed any US point outside the gateways of New York and Boston, are not affected by my recent decision.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I should like to say a few words about Aer Lingus' current traffic performance and prospects. Traffic for the year ending 31 March 1983 continues to show the effect of the recession and, for the third year running, cross-Channel air traffic is down compared to the previous year.  Continental traffic has shown a fall of some 1 per cent. In traffic terms, the Atlantic is the only bouyant sector, with Aer Lingus achieving a growth rate of 3 per cent in 1982. The year ahead is seen by Aer Lingus as another difficult one.  In financial terms, and taking account of the various measures to which I have referred during the course of this speech, the position is, however, somewhat more promising with Aer Lingus hopeful of reversing the loss-making results of recent years.</P>
    <P>The financial package which is now being put together was developed after an exhaustive analysis of various options by the review group to which I have already referred.  I recognise that the package still leaves the airline with a formidable task in endeavouring to return to profitability.  Such a return is vital, not <Col N="1368" /> only in terms of the next few years, but also so that the airline can begin to face the major question of fleet replacement in the later half of the 1980s.</P>
    <P>I express my thanks to Deputy Wilson and the Opposition for agreeing to take all Stages of this Bill today.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>This is my first opportunity to welcome the Minister and wish him well as Minister for Transport.  The ministry has become a fairly difficult one and part of the reason for that difficulty is apparent from the Minister's speech.  I appreciate what the Minister said that in essence this is the Bill which I got ready for the House when I was Minister for Transport.  I had hoped to take it in November 1982.</P>
      <P>There is hardly any semi-State company which has attracted more pride from Irish people at home and abroad than Aer Lingus has from its inception and throughout its period of development. Those Members of the House who have good taste in literature and read our programme <i>The Way Forward</i> will see that in our projected programme for the five years ahead we said we intended to commit semi-State companies to an appreciation of commercial criteria in their activities.  The Minister reiterated that in his speech.  It is important not to stand back from that.  Ideologically it does not mean that there will be less commitment to the semi-State sector nor is it a move away from semi-State to privatisation, but it is an effort to apply strict commercial criteria to the activities of semi-State bodies so that the State will benefit from increased productivity and competitiveness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister outlined in his speech the nub of the financial problem is the North Atlantic operation.  It is true that Laker and Braniff are no longer able to operate this route because of the cost involved.  It is also true that charters put pressure on Aer Lingus.  As the Minister said Trans-America and Northwest Orient fly the North Atlantic route as competitors of Aer Lingus.  Air Florida was not mentioned by the Minister for obvious reasons.  In relation to charters <Col N="1369" /> the ideal situation as far as Aer Rianta and Bord Fáilte are concerned would be total freedom for all charters to fly in as many people as possible.  That approach is too simplistic.  There must be regulation of the charter business; otherwise scheduled business would fall by the wayside.</P>
    <P>Falling traffic has been a serious problem although I heard the Minister say that on the North Atlantic route Aer Lingus improved last year.  We had strikes in 1978 and 1980 which damaged Aer Lingus and Aerlínte.  The Minister mentioned the huge interest which has to be paid on borrowings.  There are factors which damaged the service such as the deregulation in the United States.  Basic to the whole problem is the international economic recession.  We are told that in the US there may be a little economic uplift.  However, we have heard it so often now that a wise man would wait and see whether it is justified.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the heavy cost of fuel.  This has been a factor in all transport operations for some time. There seems to be some justification for a little optimism in this regard.  Fuel costs seem to be on the verge of dropping.  I ask the Minister to indicate whether his colleague, the Minister for Finance, will pass on to Aer Lingus and Aerlínte the full value of any drop in fuel costs which we may have in the period immediately ahead.</P>
    <P>The decision to provide additional equity for Aer Lingus was made in a certain framework.  The years to be covered were 1982-83, 1983-84 and 1984-85 in the arrangement I had envisaged with £10 million equity investment to cover each of those years.  I understand from the Minister that what he is doing is providing £15 million in the year ending 31 March 1983 and £15 million in the year ending 31 March 1984.  The amount of money involved is the same but due to unfortunate errors on the part of the Irish electorate this money was not made available in November 1982.  Consequently the Minister is providing £15 million for the current financial year which for Aer Lingus ends on 31 March.  The provision of £60 million for an increase in share <Col N="1370" /> capital is something which the law indicates may be subscribed by the Minister for Finance.  The increase of £75 million in the State gurantee limit for borrowings for air companies was also included in my proposals for Aer Lingus at that time.</P>
    <P>The Minister commended Aer Lingus and rightly so for their involvement in ancillary activities.  He praised the company for having made profits in those areas which were used to sustain their general activities.  I know there was controversy about the extent to which air companies should be involved and the extent to which they should realise some of their assets with regard to ancillary activities.  When in office my general principle was that what was providing a good return on capital and profit for the company should not be interfered with.  There was some question about the disposal of two particular assets, the Foxhills and Tenerife, and some talk about Guinness Peat investment.  I fully realise the delicacy of this matter and that if the company were regarded as being under pressure from the Government to dispose of these assets, purchasers would be in a very strong position to buy perhaps at prices far below the value of the assets. I would like the Minister to indicate what is happening along these lines.  I am sure that the combined wisdom of the Minister and his Department will ensure that no action will be taken which would in any way lower the price that might be available to the company for their valuable assets which they have decided to dispose of.</P>
    <P>The Minister might also mention something about the federal express project which I have not heard about for some time.  It was regarded, more by Aer Rianta than Aer Lingus, as a possible source of substantial profit.  I would also like the Minister to indicate if he has any thoughts beyond 31 March 1984 because, in the terms of my own proposals, there was, as the Minister knows, a three-year span.  Admittedly, there was a certain loss in the interest involved through the money not being made available at the end of 1982.  Current cost alleviation has been mooted for some time and I had <Col N="1371" /> made a decision on it.  I was going to make available £5 million in 1983, £5 million in 1984 and £5 million in 1985. Aerlínte-Aer Lingus were very anxious that the whole idea of subsidy should be excluded from consideration with regard to those companies.  If my memory serves me right the provision of the £5 million was connected with certain extra costings which Aer Lingus had to endure, the provision for Dublin and Shannon landings, for example.  There may also have been a fuel factor involved; I am not sure. Perhaps the Minister would indicate whether the current cost alleviation provision is linked to that type of cost because, as far as the ideology is concerned, it is helpful if that is so, the views of Aer Lingus being what they are with regard to the danger of being subsidised. Perhaps the Minister could also indicate the source of this finance.  Is it Exchequer, internal or external financing?</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill which, with the exception of the one change of allocation of resources in two years instead of three, is fundamentally the Bill which I was preparing for the House.  The Minister has rightly commended Aer Lingus for having made a profit from 1960 to 1980, with the exception of the four years he mentioned.  At that time we were extremely proud of Aer Lingus and their achievements.  There used to be a story of a British Airways pilot buzzing one of our pilots on the North Atlantic route asking what was keeping him as he passed him out.  The Aer Lingus pilot replied: &ldquo;Pass out, we are carrying a full load&rdquo;. This was an indication of the buoyancy of business at that time.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would also like to refer to the Airmotive, the venture that Aer Lingus had so much hopes for.  I gather, from my time in the Department of Transport, that the signs were hopeful then.  Since then I read in a newspaper article that this venture has run into difficulties. I do not know what credibility to give to the article.  I am naturally and basically sceptical about statements like that so I would be grateful to the Minister if he indicated what the position is now.</P>
    <P>The loss on the North Atlantic operations <Col N="1372" /> is very serious and is causing headaches to Aer Lingus-Aerlínte and to the Department of Transport and, seemingly, will continue to do so.  We have already mentioned the deregulation, the competition from other airlines on the North Atlantic route and also the problem of chartered planes.  These are all part of the picture.  There are matters of national prestige although they do not rate very highly in the commercial world involved in maintaining the service. Nevertheless, it is wise to indicate to Aer Lingus-Aerlínte that the strictest commercial criteria that can operate, considering the difficulties, should apply in this case so that it would be known that the taxpayer, while investing in Aer Lingus-Aerlínte's operations on the North Atlantic for various reasons, including national prestige, will get the very best value for money in a very difficult market. I do not think any economist is capable of disentangling all the factors of profit and loss in such an operation.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte have a very strong interest in the maintenance of the North Atlantic service.  It is impossible to quantify the benefits to tourism from that operation. The Industrial Development Authority, apart again from national prestige and the advertising value of having a national airline operating in an area where we are trying to attract investment, find it hard to quantify what it means in terms of industrial development and the attraction of capital for investment here.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the review group and that they had looked at the future of the service having regard to their contribution to the economy generally. I cannot see how anybody could have the multi-faceted expertise to decide succinctly and exactly what profit they bring to the country but all the agencies are in agreement that, as a national airline operating on the North Atlantic, it is very important for them in the various activities to which they are committed. On strictly commercial grounds it has been said that we cannot justify in any way the continuation of the service but, taking everything into consideration, we must maintain it.  I think that the Minister's proposals in the Bill are at <Col N="1373" /> present the only way that we can do that.</P>
    <P>The parlous debt-equity ratio will be remedied somewhat by the provisions of the Bill.  The problems will not be over when this Bill is passed and the money made available.  Nevertheless, the Minister has provided the company with some of the equipment to help to maintain their system over this very difficult period.  The facts and statistics are given and the House will agree with the Minister in what he is doing not merely for the company themselves but for the other agencies who benefit by its continuation.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister about the B.707 fleet.  He stated that it was retired as its economics deteriorated.  I would like to know the present position. Has the fleet been disposed of, and, if so, at what kind of figure?  Again, the question of employment is a serious one and it is serious in our economy in general, and in order to improve the company's competitiveness there has been a reduction in staff numbers.  The Minister will agree that improvement in competitiveness is a laudable objective and the reduction of unit costs is very important in order to be able to continue with the operation, but there is a limit to the application of that criterion also.  Commercial viability, to which we have attached great importance in our programme for the five years coming up, is very important but it is not the only consideration to be taken into account.</P>
    <P>I am sure that some Members of the House will have more to say about the charter operation.  I have stated my views on it.  We have the position of Bord Fáilte and Aer Rianta attempting to get as many landings and customers as possible on to our soil and we must balance that against the requirements of Aer Lingus who are committed to keeping a scheduled service on the Atlantic throughout the year.  The Minister has made clear that in the action he took about charters he is not in any way discouraging any chartering from Chicago or other areas in the US and I am glad to have his assurance in that regard.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am pleased that this has come to the House at this time and that the Minister, apart from the allocation of the <Col N="1374" /> money in packages different from the ones I had intended, has stuck to the policy reached by me as Minister and by the Department in consultation with other Departments and with Aer Lingus themselves.  The goodwill of this House has always been available to Aer Lingus as our national airline company and that will continue to be so.  I endorse the Minister's remarks which I take not merely to be a statement of fact but also an encouragement to Aer Lingus to improve their profitability for the benefit of their own company and of the taxpayer and to provide a good, competitive, efficient service which in commercial terms will be good for this country and also from the point of view of national prestige.</P>
    <P>Dá bhrí sin cuirim fáilte roimh an Bhille seo.  Déanfaidh mé mo dhícheall chun cuidiú leis an Aire an Dara Léamh seo a chríochnú agus an Bille iomlán a chríochnú an tráthnóna seo.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1375" /> I am glad to have this opportunity of contributing to this debate and of supporting the Bill which has been introduced by the Minister and which will allow the Minister for Finance to increase the State shareholding in the air company by up to £60 million, and to increase from £75 million to £150 million the State guarantee limit for borrowings by the company. Also the State equity investment which at present is £46 million will be increased by an additional £30 million.</P>
    <P>At a time of severe financial stringency naturally people who are not familiar with the airline business perhaps do not realise the enormous difficulties which have confronted Aer Lingus and every air company particularly in recent years due to the world economic recession, escalating oil prices and continually increasing costs.</P>
    <P>The basic fundamental argument in favour of the State continuing to support the national airline is the fact that we are a small island country on the periphery of Europe and, therefore, the provision, maintenance and continuation of air links between this small country and the continent of North America, Britain and Europe is vital and fundamental to our economic development and social progress.  We are a small island country, vitally dependent on exports, modern trade and tourism, and in this modern age air services are a <i>sine qua non</i> for the conduct of business and the development of industry, business, trade, commerce and tourism.  While the balance sheets and annual reports or Aer Lingus, the national airline, in recent years showed increasing losses and on the face of it would be a cause of concern for this Parliament, nevertheless when one looks at the performance of the national airline over the past few years against the enormous problems that have confronted this company and the aviation industry all over the western world, we must admit that Aer Lingus have had a remarkable degree of success.  I fully support the measures proposed by the Minister and I hope that the financial provisions will be adequate to enable Aer Lingus to <Col N="1376" /> overcome the enormous difficulties confronting them.  The greater part of the problem is due to factors outside the control of the company and the Government.</P>
    <P>The advent of deregulation in the United States has led to utter chaos, particularly on the North Atlantic.  It has led to a free-for-all situation, a drastic reduction in air fares and the inevitable collapse of a number of air companies. The most notable pioneer of low fares on the Atlantic, Freddie Laker, is regarded as having revolutionised the whole concept of air travel but he went too far.  It is easy to advocate the reduction of fares to totally uneconomic levels as Mr. Laker did, but it has led to many problems. Following the decision 18 months ago by Icelandic Air to terminate their scheduled transatlantic services, the president of that airline said that the law of the jungle operated where strong airlines were killing the weak.  This has been the exact position during the past couple of years.</P>
    <P>I agree with the analysis outlined by the Minister and also with the findings of the review committee who have examined the matter.  The question will continue to be posed as to whether Aer Lingus should continue with their Atlantic services, despite the enormous losses incurred.  I believe our national airline must be allowed to operate on the North Atlantic.  The chaos created by deregulation is forcing the American authorities to reconsider.  The world economic recession which has had such an enormous impact on aviation will not always be with us.  A decision to terminate the Aer Lingus transatlantic service would be short-sighted and would not be in the national interest.  It would be detrimental to tourist traffic and the promotion of business between the North American continent and this country.</P>
    <P>I fully support the concept of ensuring that we have the national flag carrier operating on the North Atlantic.  They should be supported during this time when the law of the jungle is operating. Nevertheless, there is one important matter we must face.  The transatlantic services land at Shannon and Dublin. While I have had the privilege of being a <Col N="1377" /> member of the European Parliament I have had occasion to catch the morning flight from Shannon to Dublin to connect with Brussels or elsewhere.  The Aer Lingus Boeing 747 lands at Shannon: some passengers disembark and the remainder continue to Dublin.  I do not know the exact figure but I believe that on average 60 per cent or 65 per cent of transatlantic passengers embark or disembark at Shannon. A massive Boeing 747 flies between Shannon and Dublin only one-third full. There has been much controversy about this fact during recent years.  Two years ago Captain Hill of the Irish Airline Pilots Association flew a kite and advocated that Shannon should be by-passed.  A certain lobby in Dublin have been making this case.  Deputy Sylvester Barrett and Deputy Daly will agree that we have heard the flimsiest excuses in support of the claim that Aer Lingus should overfly Shannon, such as that the winds are marginally dangerous or the visibility might not be very good.  In considering the loss-making transatlantic services we must recognise that the services should be turned around at Shannon.  Shannon should be the transatlantic terminal.  All the economic evidence supports this case and I challenge anybody to refute it.  I have made this point during every debate on aviation in the past 20 years.</P>
    <P>Smaller aircraft should operate between Shannon and Dublin, Belfast, Cork, Waterford and other smaller airports. The transatlantic services should be based at Shannon with a proper system of feeder services.  This is the logic we must face and I hope the new Minister will look at it objectively and get an independent assessment of the economics of it.  I believe a saving of £1 million could be effected.  There are massive costs involved in a Jumbo jet taking off at Shannon every morning en route to Dublin with possibly only 100 passengers. A small aircraft such as the Boeing 737 would be adequate and other aircraft could be used to link with Cork and elsewhere. I have spoken on this subject on many occasions but the arguments in favour of this suggestion are stronger and more convincing now than ever.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the question of regional <Col N="1378" /> air services.  Aer Lingus have made a massive contribution directly and indirectly to our economic development, particularly through tourism.  A cost-benefit study will show that the direct and indirect contribution by Aer Lingus to the development of tourism was impressive, but on the other hand the company has not shown a proper commitment to the development of regional air services and services between our regional airports and airports in Britain and Europe.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus made monumental blunders in regard to the development of such air services.  When Deputy Lenihan was Minister for Transport and Power between 1969 and 1973 &mdash; at that time I had the privilege of being spokesman for Transport and Power for my party &mdash; it was decided by Aer Lingus to go all jet. At that time 11 Viscount aircraft were left lying at Dublin Airport and finally had to be sold for scrap.  Prior to that the company sold the Fokker Friendship aircraft. Those of us who travel to Brussels regularly are aware that most mornings we must go via Amsterdam because there is no direct flight due to an unfortunate ongoing dispute between Aer Lingus and Sabena.  From Amsterdam to Brussels one will travel on an F27, the inter-city hoppers operated by KLM and others. Aer Lingus had such aircraft in the fifties and sixties.</P>
    <P>When Aer Lingus phased out the Viscount and Friendship aircraft I described it as a fatal mistake, pointing out that the company should have established a second level airline for charter and regional services, between Cork and Great Britain and near destinations in Europe.  It was wrong to sell off all the turboprop aircraft and go all jet.  As a result of that Aer Lingus in recent years has had to pull out of Liverpool, Cardiff, Leeds-Bradford and other UK routes.  There is not any service to those UK destinations from Dublin, Shannon or Cork.  It is not economic to operate a 737, 747 or a BAC 111 but as soon as Aer Lingus abandoned those routes British companies took them over using small aircraft.  A very satisfactory service is being provided from Liverpool to Dublin twice daily with an aircraft capable of carrying 17 passengers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1379" /> Aer Lingus could have continued to operate on those routes had they retained their turboprop fleet.  The Minister should comment to the House on a report in the <i>Irish Independent</i> this morning by John Healy to the effect that Aer Lingus have placed orders for a number of Shorts 330s, a small turboprop aircraft for use on cross-Channel services.  That is fine, but it should have been done in 1960 because in the meantime UK companies as well as Aer Arran and Avair have developed successful services between here and the UK.  After sitting back for 15 years and concentrating on all-jet routes it appears that Aer Lingus are about to purchase the small aircraft for use on routes that have been developed by other companies.  If that is the case it should be stopped.</P>
    <P>Applications by independent operators for licences to use routes abandoned by Aer Lingus have been vetoed time and again by successive Ministers because of objections by the company.  The attitude was that a licence could not be given to independent operators to fly Dublin-Leeds-Bradford because Aer Lingus were operating the Dublin-Manchester route.  It was felt that to give a licence for a Dublin-Leeds-Bradford service would mean that passengers would be taken from the Dublin-Manchester route.  That ludicrous situation will have to be looked at.  Shannon Airport is our main trans-Atlantic airport and I have advocated that Aer Lingus should have to turn around there.</P>
    <P>I am the only Irish representative on the European Parliament's transport committee and since 1979 that committee has devoted all its time to the question of European aviation.  A number of documents and reports have been produced by the Commission, the first in 1979 by the Commissioner for Transport, Mr. Richard Burke.  A number of reports have also been produced by the transport committee.  The question of regional air services is recognised as a vital element in the development of peripheral European regions.  I regret that problems are arising in relation to Cork Airport because in the context of the development <Col N="1380" /> of that vast region it would be an economic disaster to downgrade it.  We have never looked at the development of internal aviation services on a national basis.  We have had <i>ad hoc</i> applications for licences for various routes and I was involved in those as Minister for the Gaeltacht during the development of Aer Arran.  We have a new airport at Waterford and landing facilities at Farranfore, Ballinskelligs and other centres, including the three Aran Islands.  There is also an airport at Castlebar but the airport at Galway is in need of expansion.  For too long successive Ministers have looked at the development of regional airports on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  I appeal to the Minister to carry out an objective study into the prospects of development of a proper internal air service and the prospects of developing further regional services into Cork, Shannon, Galway and Castlebar.</P>
    <P>I made those suggestions because of the monumental blunder by Aer Lingus in the sixties and their decision to opt out of internal aviation development.  With regard to Knock Airport I should like to state that while I was a Minister I was responsible for committing State funds for the laying of seven airfields from Donegal to Ballinskelligs and I came to the conclusion then that there was a cast-iron case for a Connacht regional airport.</P>
    <P>Castlebar Airport, which some of my colleagues and I have used on a number of occasions, cannot be extended because the railway line is at one end and the road at the other.  They should have proceeded with the Connacht Regional Airport on the basis that there was an airport development there.  It should have been done on a phased basis.  A runway to take smaller aircraft should have been erected and this could have been extended as the service developed.  If one had a proper aviation development programme one could approach it on that basis.</P>
    <P>While I have consistently defended the national airline and supported every Bill that was introduced in connection with the national airline, because I believe it is vitally important for the country to have essential airlinks with the major centres in North America, Britain and <Col N="1381" /> Europe, we must recognise the total failure of the national airlines to develop internal services and regional services.  I believe they have terminated certain services &mdash; I have not got the list of them &mdash; particularly the services terminated between Dublin and other destinations. There was a service between Shannon and Manchester for a number of years.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will throw some light on the question of whether Aer Lingus have now decided to buy smaller aircraft and, if so, whether they are going into competition with companies like Aer Arran and Avair who have developed those routes.  I hope the Minister will be able to tell us that during his term of office he will make a comprehensive study of the development of internal aviation and also the development of regional air services between Cork, Shannon and the other regional airports we have and various destinations.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the deregulation situation in the USA, the &ldquo;Open Sky&rdquo; policy, as it has been called, or &ldquo;Freedom of the Skies&rdquo;.  It is a free for all.  Aer Lingus have had to contend with this.  The European Parliament over the last three and a half years has been devoting continuous attention to the whole question of European aviation.  During that period there has been a continuous new threat to the viability and the future of Aer Lingus emanating from the EEC because there is a strong lobby within the EEC Commission and within the Parliament in support of the application of the rules of competition of the Treaty of Rome to air transport.  There has been a consistent attempt to introduce deregulation in the European aviation scene.  I am the only Irish member of the transport committee but I must acknowledge the continuous solid support I have got from all my Irish colleagues in the European Parliament irrespective of what party they belong to and whatever group they are attached to in Europe.  Up to this we have successfully fought this attempt to deregulate and to introduce an &ldquo;Open Skies&rdquo; policy. We are seriously concerned about this situation.  The Irish members have briefed members of the transport committee very impressively on this matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1382" /> I want to direct the Minister's attention, in his capacity as a member of the Council of Transport Ministers &mdash; and, hopefully, in a few years times when Ireland has the presidency he will be President of the Council of Transport Ministers &mdash; to how very important it is that he and his Department pay increasing attention to the developments taking place within the Commission in particular and within the European Parliament. The Irish members of the European Parliament will watch this development.  The latest attempt now is to dismantle IATA. The former Minister for Transport, Deputy Wilson, must also be aware of this.  There has been a concerted attempt to dismantle IATA on the basis that there must be more competition in European aviation, that there must be more competition between the airlines.  Some go so far as to say that there should be a free for all, that any company who want to operate into Dublin, let it be Sabena or KLM, should be allowed in unrestrictedly. That has been knocked because of the disastrous results of deregulation in the USA.  The latest attempt is to try to apply the competition rules of the Treaty of Rome to air transport.</P>
    <P>We had a debate last December in the European Parliament in which a report was produced by the Economic Affairs Committee which has special responsibility <i>vis-à-vis</i> competition policy.  In that report by a British conservative member, Miss Forster, it is recomended that IATA be dismantled and that the fixing of air fares within the EEC should be done independently of IATA.  They have introduced a highly dangerous new concept which could be very detrimental to Aer Lingus &mdash; I want to draw the Minister's attention to it &mdash; a new concept of country of origin.  That would simply mean that if a European airline applied for permission to operate a service into Dublin at a fare which Aer Lingus at the other end might consider uneconomic, they would be allowed to do so.  At the moment, due to the bilateral agreements, under IATA regulations, the arrangements are subject to negotiation between the two countries concerned.  It is very important in this matter of deregulation, <Col N="1383" /> of dismantling IATA and trying to apply the rules of competition of the Treaty of Rome to the European aviation scene, that the Minister puts his foot down.  I have no doubt that he will do so.  I am sure any Irish Minister would adopt the same attitude.  The Minister referred to charters from the USA.  This topic has been discussed for many years.  I remember having many a battle, when I was in Opposition, with the then Minister for Transport, Deputy Lenihan.  There have been many discussions about the question of charter services and applications for landing rights made by American tour operators, voluntary groups and other airlines.  This has always been a bone of contention.  Successive Ministers for Transport have taken a balanced view of this.  I can appreciate this.  It is a very important factor.  It has been said that the recent decision by the Minister to refuse an application from a group in Chicago will result in a net loss of £14 million.  I do not accept this.  Unfortunately, there is a lot of misinformed comment about it. One has to look at the question of charters objectively and try to arrive at a balance. I believe successive Ministers have tried to strike a reasonable balance.</P>
    <P>I believe the approach of the current Minister is of the same character.  He has granted licences to a large number this year which will bring a substantial addition to tourist traffic into Ireland and particularly into Shannon.  If an application for a landing licence was made by a tour operator in Chicago, Boston, New York or anywhere else, the argument was that there is adequate capacity on the Atlantic at present, but we must be very careful that, when a tour operator applies for landing rights for charters, our refusal does not result in that operator by-passing Ireland and going on to a European destination.  We could lose traffic that way.</P>
    <P>From what the Minister said, I understand there is no problem in relation to west coast destinations.  Aer Lingus do not service the west coast of the United States.  It was a great pity that we stopped the Chicago service.  There are many Irish in that area and there has been a great <Col N="1384" /> influx of visitors here from that city.  It was a great pity that economics, exclusively, dictated that Aer Lingus pull out of that route.</P>
    <P>In supporting this Bill I hope Aer Lingus will be able to ride out the financial storms on the Atlantic route.  Anybody familiar with aviation will realise they are fighting against enormous difficulties. I hope this additional financial subvention will enable them to survive and develop new services.  I want the Minister to have a hard look at the desirability of having the trans-Atlantic services terminate at Shannon.  Aer Lingus, as a national airline, will have to play their part in developing and maintaining regional air services, particularly from Shannon, Cork and any other airports there might be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Like previous speakers I warmly welcome this Bill. Essentially it is not just an enabling Bill, but continues the commitment of the restructuring package which was accepted by the previous Government in July 1982.  That involved subscribing an additional £30 million by way of equity over the coming period, and further £15 million cost alleviation payments over a three-year period.  This should go a long way towards restoring the viability of our national airline.</P>
      <P>Our national airline is a matter of great pride to all Irish men and women.  We have had many failures in the semi-State area but the success story of Aer Lingus, the service and courtesy of their staff and the high rating of the airline is a source of pride to all.  It is a source of particular pride to those of us who have the privilege and honour of living in north County Dublin.  Many of the work force of Aer Lingus and the airport are resident in that area.  It is also a source of pride for us to have seen the development of the airline and the airport over the last generation. This is vital to the economy of north County Dublin and the health of the airlines, and any measures taken by the Government to help them is of vital importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lest it be thought that this Bill and the commitment by the Minister to honour <Col N="1385" /> the decision of the previous administration with regard to equity and current cost alleviation is a handout to our national airline, let me tell everybody that that is far from the truth.  Our national airline in the 20-year period 1960-80, with the exception of four years, were in a profit situation.  What has happened is that our airline have been, in the words of one of the senior management in a recent paper delivered to the Institute of Transport, in a situation of survival in a blood bath.  That is the only way one could describe the present situation in the North Atlantic.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that Aer Lingus are wholly owned by the Irish public and their primary aim is to provide a service for the public in accordance with a commercial mandate.  They are anxious to operate on a commercial basis but it is important to recognise the business environment in which they had to operate on the Atlantic in the last few years.  I purposely used the word &ldquo;business&rdquo; because I want to emphasise that this involvement of the State today, as announced by the Minister &mdash; £30 million equity and, in particular, the £15 million current cost alleviation &mdash; is in no way to be perceived as interfering with the commercial operation and is in no way setting Aer Lingus down the slippery slope which has been taken by so many State organisations.</P>
    <P>This Bill and the Minister's decision confirming the previous Government's decision is a recognition of the totally unique circumstances of trading that Aer Lingus have had to endure for the last few years.  It is merely an effort to restore viability so that Aer Lingus can go from strength to strength.  When considering this injection of State funds it is important that we look at the regulatory background and the problems Aer Lingus faced in the seventies when there was the start of the charters and the fuel crisis &mdash; and the problems faced by Aer Lingus and other carriers during the Laker period, from 1977-82 when he went bust, right up to the new US-Europe accord of 1982 which promised so much stability for the future and then dashed so many hopes.</P>
    <P>IATA have been referred to on a number <Col N="1386" /> of occasions in this debate.  It is important to remember that that organisation was part of the machinery set up to ensure the orderly development of aviation.  Governments took the initiative in creating IATA and the object was to protect the consumer, and to set rates at economic levels which would enable international aviation to be operated commercially.  Unfortunately, what we have seen over the last number of years &mdash; in particular the decision of the American Civil Aeronautics Board to scrap regulations &mdash; is massive damage being done to national airlines, such as our own, and to companies of the strength of Pan Am.</P>
    <P>It must also be remembered that CAB, in making that decision, made it not in the interests of any of our European airlines or the major US airlines, but for strategic and military reasons, to back up their second line carriers which were used for the carriage of their troops to Vietnam and, in their spare capacity after Vietnam, of the US troops in Europe. There is a major element of military strategy involved in the support of the US supplementals by the Civil Aeronautics Board.  The problem is, that while CAB have been involved in this process, they have succeeded in providing vast overcapacity on the European routes and have clearly damaged the national airlines. The second problem facing Aer Lingus, which could not be foreseen when they changed in the sixties from turboprop aircraft to a full jet fleet, was the massive fuel increases which took place in the early seventies.  Deputy O'Donnell spoke about the mistake made by Aer Lingus in the sixties in changing to a jet fleet.  At that time, that was very good forward thinking and planning. Nobody could envisage the change which took place, in particular during 1973, in fuel costs and the effects of these on airline charges and on the costs incurred by airline companies.</P>
    <P>The load rate which Aer Lingus must succeed in achieving just to break even across the Atlantic is now somewhere around 40 per cent, before the aircraft can take off the ground.  That is just for the cost of the aircraft.  Before they can <Col N="1387" /> make a contribution towards overheads and repayments on loans and so forth, they have to obtain a load factor somewhere in the region of 75 per cent to 80 per cent.  Again, this is something which nobody could have envisaged a number of years ago.</P>
    <P>Another problem which has been the curse of Aer Lingus and the other national airlines has been the Laker phenomenon.  Laker developed the charter idea into a walk-on, walk-off situation where one booked a ticket and took availability.  The situation, on the surface, looked good from his point of view, a high load factor, making it a paying proposition.  However, that did not materialise, because the other airlines had to fight back.  At the time, Sir Freddie was the darling of the media, David taking on Goliath &mdash; Goliath being IATA and the national airlines.  Unfortunately, the sky-train concept was doomed to failure and did fail, and we are all aware of the effect of that failure, not only on the employees of Laker airways, but also on international air fares and the viability, generally, of international airlines.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important, if the Minister is serious &mdash; and I totally accept his bona fides in this &mdash; about ensuring the viability of Aer Lingus, that we once again strengthen IATA for the benefit, not just of the airlines but also for the benefit and protection of the consumers &mdash; the travelling public.  While the Minister spoke of the provision of finance for the airline, greater productivity and other factors, to which I will refer later, unfortunately he did not refer to the importance of agreements between the American civil aviation authorities and the European authorities.  It is vital that the Irish Government fight on behalf of Aer Lingus to protect their work force and our national identity with our national flight carrier.  Otherwise, what we are seeing today will be only short-term.  We must bring some control, sense and sanity back into the transatlantic air flight arrangements. Without that, there will be further Pan-Ams &mdash; and we are all aware of Pan-Am's situation today, groping <Col N="1388" /> throughout the world for any cash flow situation which they can use.  This is one thing which worries me about the recent arrangement made by the Minister with Pan-Am, with the tour operators, whose name escapes me for the moment, coming into Shannon at rates far below what the three established carriers &mdash; Trans-America, Northwest Orient and Aer Lingus &mdash; can compete with.</P>
    <P>The general success of Aer Lingus, as I have said, is a matter of great pride to us as a nation but, equally, the continuation of Aer Lingus on the transatlantic route is absolutely essential.  It is vital, from a national and an airline's point of view, that Aer Lingus continue to carry passengers on a scheduled basis across the Atlantic.  To do that, they need the assistance which has been given, the equity and the current cost alleviation funds.  They need those funds, but they also need the assistance of the Government in fighting on behalf of our airline with our European partners, in contest and in debate, with the American operators.</P>
    <P>If the Atlantic service were to go, as was stated in the Minister's speech, up to 1,500 jobs would be lost in Aer Lingus. That is a figure which is unacceptable. The national impact of the loss of a scheduled service to America, the effect on our trade and industry and the absence of an Irish scheduled connection between Dublin and New York, the effect of that on IDA promotional work, on CTT and their trade efforts, the effect it would have on Bord Fáilte, the effect it would have on so many different facets of our society &mdash; all that is one thing.  But the totally unacceptable figure of 1,500 jobs means that what the Government are doing now will have to be continued in the future in order to assist Aer Lingus, ensuring that we have a long-term commitment to the transatlantic route. Already the work force in Aer Lingus has dropped by 9 per cent over the last couple of years, something like 700 men and women.  That is a lot of jobs.  Many people have lost out through voluntary redundancies without any replacement. To talk about a further 1,500 jobs is <Col N="1389" /> Minister that I will fight that every inch of the way.</P>
    <P>We have heard much about productivity and the achievements of Aer Lingus.  One area of achievement about which we should all be proud is that of their ancillary activities.  They have been superbly successful in this respect.  Their contribution to the overall financial strength of the company is a source of pride to us all. The fact that management had the foresight to involve the company in so many ancillary activities, resulting in the production of this profit for the company, is also something of which we can be very proud.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that the Minister says there will be no cuts effected in the ancillary activities programme, something about which I am very happy.  The talk circulating some time ago about interference with the London Tara Hotel is something about which I was unhappy. Certainly I should not like to see such interference.  That hotel has contributed to the overall success of the company's ancillary activities, something I should like to see continuing.</P>
    <P>The question of the turn-around of transatlantic flights at Shannon arose in the course of the debate and was referred to particularly by Deputy O'Donnell.  I want to put on the record of the House again quite clearly that I am totally opposed to the idea of Shannon becoming the base for our transatlantic fleet which traditionally has been at Dublin.  It is our capital city and it is there our national airline should have its national headquarters.  The case put forward by Deputy O'Donnell was that feeder planes could bring passengers to Shannon from Dublin, Cork, Belfast and the other regional airports around the country. Equally, passengers could be brought on these feeder lines not to Shannon but to Dublin.  I thought Deputy O'Donnell advanced a very good case for a total over-fly at Shannon.  This is not something I want to get into.  I do not want to involve myself in a regional row among Deputies from all sides of the House on Shannon versus Dublin.  If Deputy O'Donnell is talking about a feeder passenger service into a base for the transatlantic <Col N="1390" /> flights, he is making an excellent case for a feeder system into Dublin Airport. I honestly believe it to be in the interests of Shannon, that region and in the national interest that we continue to have the transatlantic stop-off at Shannon, with aircraft operating from the national base at Dublin Airport.  It has proved to be an excellent system so far and I see no reason that it should not continue.  As a matter of fact if Deputy O'Donnell and others who advocate that case really thought about it they would see that they are coasting on very thin ice, that it is something that would not be in the interests of the national airline, in the interests of its efficient operation, or in the interests of its success and financial viability.  In the long run I do not think it would be in the interests of the viability of the airport at Shannon.</P>
    <P>While we have seen the success of Pan Am this year in bringing extra business into Shannon, I made the point earlier that some of the fares they quoted were of the level of a company experiencing serious financial difficulty who needed a cash flow at any cost.  That is what we have been seeing there.  Some Deputies will recall the debate of a number of years ago on the subject of Pan Am and TWA getting landing rights at Dublin Airport. Yet they had not got into Dublin a year or two when they left again.  That argument continued for years &mdash; about all the extra business and tourists they would bring into Dublin with the full benefit of their worldwide schedules.  Yet they had been here for only a year or two when they disappeared again.  Therefore I suggest to the Deputies from the Shannon area, including Deputy O'Donnell, that they are skating on very thin ice if they are depending on the efforts of Pan Am as one carrier.</P>
    <P>I welcome this badly-needed Bill.  It is unfortunate that international air travel has got into its present state.  I would appeal to the Government to make a strong case, along with our European partners, to the Civil Aeronautics Board in Washington to introduce more regulations across the Atlantic.  This would be in the best interests of passengers, and it is about passengers we must be most concerned, <Col N="1391" /> and would also be in the best interests of our national airline, our economy and that of our European partners.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of productivity earlier. I might remind him that productivity does not mean merely letting men go.  At a time of high unemployment here the last thing we should be thinking of is relating productivity to fewer numbers in jobs.  Although I should like to see airline productivity being raised, it should not be by a reduction in the numbers.  It could be done by the company involving themselves in extra fleets, extra marketing, in regional programmes, involving themselves in turboprop aircraft for shorthaul work.  That is the sort of productivity I should like to see.  As a society we have got into the habit of linking productivity with firing people &mdash; that if you fire people you get productivity.  That is not the way forward and I should like to see greater recognition of the work that has been done by management, by staff at all levels, from loader to chief executive, from cleaner to airline pilot, to air hostess and booking clerk.  They have done a superb job on behalf of the nation.  As a native of north County Dublin it has been a source of pride to me to see the development of our airports and our airline. Long may Governments show the wisdom we did last July when we came to our decision, and long may the Minister continue to show the wisdom he is now displaying in implementing the decision of July 1982.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Like previous speakers I welcome the Bill, particularly the assurances given by the Minister about the future of the transatlantic route and about charter flights to Shannon.  I come from a region very much dependent on tourism.  I have read the criticisms levelled at the Minister about decisions made in relation to charter flights, but having listened to the points made by him today I agree that the decisions made were in the best interests primarily of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not an expert on civil aviation, <Col N="1392" /> but like Deputies Burke and O'Donnell I will be unashamedly regional in my comments.  I come from the Cork-Kerry region which is suffering from higher than average unemployment.  It is very much dependent on the tourist industry and on the ability of the IDA to maintain our markets with Europe and Britain and the ability of our industries to maintain those links.  We also depend on the IDA to develop new industries and to attract outside industries to the area.</P>
    <P>We have a high number of chemical and computer industries in the Cork area that require a continuing link with Europe and Britain and with different centres in both Europe and Britain.  I am surprised that the Minister's speech did not make reference to the links between Cork and Europe and Britain.  In recent times there have been suggestions that the Cork link with some European and British centres would be done away with. There have been a number of meetings between Aer Lingus representatives and representatives of interested groups in the Cork region, and agreement has been reached.  At the same time I should like an assurance from the Minister this evening that next year Aer Lingus will be in a position to obtain the type of shorthaul aircraft necessary to make the Cork-European and Cork-British routes viable.</P>
    <P>All fair-minded people must admit that the curtailment of flights from the Cork-Kerry region will further erode the confidence of the people there.  Having lost one major link with Britain this year because of a problem that crept up on us through managerial difficulties, the Minister has an obligation in fairness to the region to ensure that a planned withdrawal from the Cork region will not be undertaken by either of these semi-State bodies involved in civil aviation, Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta.  I appeal to the Minister to stand up to both bodies and to tell them to get out of their mind the obsession they have with centralisation.  It is a dangerous trait that has been creeping into Irish society, especially among semi-State bodies: there is a tendency to think that everything has to come in and out of Dublin.  Here today we have heard <Col N="1393" /> that everything has to come in and out of Shannon as well, without any mention of Cork.  In any future plans or financial packages put together, Cork must be considered seriously.</P>
    <P>I question the arrangement that exists on the transatlantic route.  Aer Lingus are forced to stop over at Shannon, I think on all scheduled flights coming into the country.  Has this been costed?  What is this arrangement costing the national airline?  Deputy O'Donnell made a good case for having the transatlantic flights terminated at Shannon and, naturally enough, Deputy Burke, representing north County Dublin, put an equally strong case for terminating at Dublin.  We cannot have it both ways.  The problem must be looked at seriously.  I am convinced that moneys being lost because of this arrangement between Dublin and Shannon is resulting in a curtailment of services in the Cork region.</P>
    <P>I will mention one other problem in relation to Cork.  It involves Aer Rianta who at present are arranging for the planned curtailment of flights out of Cork while they are engaging in an investigation of their operations in Cork.  I have lost confidence in that semi-State body because last year we were told there would not be any question of redundancies in Cork but we learn now that the company were quietly, behind closed doors, going ahead with plans for redundancies, cutbacks in overtime and other measures at Cork Airport.  Since these problems are inter-related I ask the Minister for an assurance &mdash; I do not ask him to do it tonight because I have only just informed him of it now &mdash; that the Cork area will not have this.  We have suffered enough because of semi-State conniving and it is about time semi-State bodies were made more accountable to us, politicians, who ultimately must take the rap, because the buck stops with us. Therefore I ask the Minister to ensure that because of a temporary curtailment of flights, Cork will not be downgraded this year by the second semi-State body involved.  I welcome the major parts of the Bill as presented to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett (Clare) Mr. Barrett (Clare)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Clare):</i> I congratulate the Minister on his new portfolio and wish <Col N="1394" /> him well during his term of office.  Like other Deputies, I welcome the Bill which gives the necessary transfusion to Aer Lingus to stay in business.  It is not before time.  Naturally it was delayed due to the election, but now we have got it and we hope it will be of great benefit to Aer Lingus.  It surely must be because of the amount of money involved.</P>
      <P>During the years Aer Lingus have been regarded as a successful semi-State body. On both sides of the House many politicians congratulated Aer Lingus many times.  They were truly a success story because when most airlines throughout the world were suffering severe losses &mdash; big outfits like Pan Am and TWA &mdash; Aer Lingus were one of two airlines in the late seventies who broke even or showed a slight profit &mdash; Aer Lingus, and if I remember correctly, the Israeli airline, who have now gone out of business. It is a departure for them to find themselves in a loss situation.  Two years ago they lost £13 million or thereabouts and last year they lost just over £9 million. We would be interested to hear from the Minister the reason for this drop in one year.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus have had a much wider role than many people realise.  They were not confined to flying people in and out of the country.  They were one of the greatest promoters of Irish tourism in the North Atlantic countries.  From their inception they advertised extensively and brought tourist customers into the country. This should never be forgotten. Quite a sizeable part of their financing went towards this cause which was well worth while as all the good years in tourism have proved.  They worked side by side with Bord Fáilte and all the other State agencies who were involved in these advertising and promotional efforts.  We owe them a debt in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Transatlantic operations have been showing a loss for some years.  Most other airlines have been showing a loss in the North Atlantic.  In their efforts to counteract this loss, Aer Lingus became involved in what are known as ancillary activities.  It was a very good decision to do this not only in London but also in the US.  There were also proposals in relation <Col N="1395" /> to Tenerife.  If Aer Lingus are flying people from Shannon or Dublin to London, there is nothing wrong with providing hotel accommodation to reap some benefit from that end of the activity as well.</P>
    <P>The same would apply to Tenerife. Quite a large number of people go there on holidays.  I am not up to date with the Tenerife proposal.  I do not know whether it got off the ground or will get off the ground.  The Minister might let us know what the position is.</P>
    <P>Another of their purchases was the Foxhill complex which was to be a sporting complex.  If I remember correctly this was put on the market.  I would be interested to know if any reasonable offer was made which was anywhere near its value at that time.  I understand it has not been disposed of and I should hate to see it disposed of at a serious loss.  In the long-term it has a future in the ancillary activities.</P>
    <P>Their ancillary activity in the US is a real success story.  They bought into the Dunfey chain of hotels and I understand that chain has been doing quite well.  The manner in which these hotels are used by Aer Lingus to promote Irish tourism is also a success story.  Their ancillary activities have helped them in no small way to counteract the losses on the North Atlantic routes when the short haul routes, the European routes and the United Kingdom routes, were paying their way.</P>
    <P>I welcome the new arrangements expanding the charter flights and making the whole system more flexible.  Many tourist operators and people involved in tourism are not too worried about what type of planes are used to fly in tourists so long as the tourists arrive.  Some would not mind if the tourists were flown in in wheelbarrows so long as they are flown in to spend money.  I am not saying they should be flown in in wheelbarrows.  The expansion of charter flights makes it more attractive to tourists from North America to come here for a holiday.  I welcome the new arrangements.</P>
    <P>The question of Shannon Airport was mentioned by a few speakers.  Deputy Allen wondered why planes on the North <Col N="1396" /> Atlantic route had to stop at Shannon Airport.  It so happens that Shannon Airport is our transatlantic airport.  Dublin is not.  It should be remembered that over the years, while it has varied slightly, a figure of between 60 and 70 per cent of all terminal passengers to this country from the North American countries disembarked in Shannon.  The remaining percentage flew on to Dublin.  This is also a very good reason why the planes should land there.</P>
    <P>In the early seventies we had an issue known as the landing rights issue.  This was the question of whether other transatlantic airlines or North American airlines should be permitted to fly into Dublin instead of using Shannon as the terminal for their flights, which had been the case.  This became a major issue in this House and outside it.  There was a great deal of opposition to it and comment on it during our term in office up to 1973.  We withstood the pressures brought to bear on us to grant these landing rights.</P>
    <P>If I remember correctly Deputy O'Donnell was Opposition spokesman for Transport and Power.  He opposed it. On one occasion he made a public statement that if the rights were granted he would resign.  I think I am correct in saying that.  In Government we withstood the pressures and the rights were not granted.  A short time after the change of Government in 1973 those landing rights were granted to TWA, not to Pan Am. They flew into Dublin.  They had the same experience that the big percentage of their passengers disembarked at Shannon. They flew into Dublin for quite a short period and then discontinued flying in to Dublin.  As it transpired, it was not such a major issue as many people thought it was, and the harm it did was not as great as some people feared.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the point Deputy O'Donnell made about using Shannon as a turn-around point for transatlantic flights.  I find myself in agreement with him that this should be considered seriously, even though Deputy Burke on my side of the House is not prepared to contemplate it.  I makes good business sense to consider it seriously.  If 60 per cent to <Col N="1397" /> 70 per cent of the passengers on the jumbos and the bigger planes disembark in Shannon, surely this should be the terminal. Shannon should be the turn-around point because, as Deputy O'Donnell rightly said, smaller aircraft could be used between Shannon and Dublin at a lesser cost to Aer Lingus and Aerlínte.  It should be considered seriously.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke put forward arguments which I find do not stand up, so I will not go into them.  The only argument I take seriously regarding why this should not be done is that of the major transfer of skilled staff and maintenance staff from Dublin Airport to Shannon.  I do not know what percentage of the staff involved are from rural Ireland and it has never been fully examined whether these people would want to transfer.  It must be remembered that during the years Aer Lingus have involved themselves in maintenance and overhaul work on foreign aircraft.  This work has been carried out successfully at Dublin Airport.  By developing this work they could still employ many of the staff involved at Dublin Airport.  This matter should be considered seriously.  It would mean a saving to Aer Lingus if they did not have to fly the jumbos and the larger aircraft on the short flight from Shannon to Dublin.  I am not saying this just because Shannon is in my constituency but, with respect to Cork, Shannon is the airport that services the west of Ireland from the point of view of tourism and I am sure all will agree that the west of Ireland is the best of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Something will have to be done about fares to the UK.  They will have to be reduced in some way.  The cost of a return flight to Cardiff for two people is £310. This is a phenomenal charge for a short flight, probably the shortest flight from Dublin across the Irish Sea.  The return flight from Shannon to London is £185 which is an excessive charge for a short flight.  There are many Irish people in London who would come home more frequently if the fares were more reasonable. Generally a reduction in the fares would encourage more passengers from here also.  Many of the flights do good <Col N="1398" /> business because they connect with other European flights but the entire service could be developed more effectively if the charges were examined with a view to reducing them.  When one considers that the return fare to Cardiff for two people is £310, I am sure if the people involved took the ferry and drove down to Cardiff they would save at least £200. I ask the Minister to request Aer Lingus to try to do something about the very high charges for short flights.</P>
    <P>We welcome the Bill.  This is badly needed for our national airline of which we have been so proud during the years. Aer Lingus have the job of flying people in and out of Ireland and they have also played an important role in promoting this country since their establishment and since they first went to North America.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to pre-empt what the Minister may say in his reply but I am sure that, like me, he has been heartened by the support and interest this Bill has evoked from all sides.  Interestingly enough, we have seen colleagues from the same party disagree with each other.  I am sure it will not have escaped the Minister's notice that most of the contributors to the debate are people in whose constituencies the major airports are located.  That is good because it means the Deputies concerned are fully conscious of the role of Aer Lingus in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fashionable nowadays to criticise our semi-State companies.  Perhaps I would have criticised the input of another £30 million if it was the case that Aer Lingus were the only airline in the world losing such a vast amount of money on the North Atlantic route.  However, as the Minister pointed out, this is not the case.  Many of the major airlines are finding the same difficulties as those encountered by Aer Lingus.  These difficulties can be traced back to the problems that arose particularly in 1973 at the time of the fuel crisis and also to the enormous growth so far as consumers are concerned. I am not the oldest Member here but I remember when I was 18 or 19 years the thought of a flight to the Continent for a holiday was as far removed from my <Col N="1399" /> hopes as a flight to the moon.  However, nowadays practically every young person has been on a flight by the time they are 17 or 18 years.</P>
    <P>We could not have a debate on a Bill such as this and just talk about the costs and the financial viability of Aer Lingus without reflecting also on the service element. Of necessity, any service industry will find it difficult to make ends meet.  If Aer Lingus were to make ends meet on the North Atlantic route the easy answer would be to put up charges to such an extent that they could run the service economically.  However, they would not sell any tickets if they did that.  Therefore, we cannot rule out the service element. If we cease operating on the North Atlantic route it will be open to the charter companies to fill the void.  While these companies help to supplement traffic during the high season they are not there in the low season even though the service is still required by the tourist industry and, even more important, is required for business interests.  I know that the Minister has studied carefully the work of the review committee which was set up to see whether this kind of finance should be put into Aer Lingus.  I see that discussions were held with groups such as the IDA and SFADCo.  These groups have stated they would be concerned if the North Atlantic route were to be closed. The Government decided that the service be kept open &mdash; hence this Bill.</P>
    <P>As other speakers have done, it is important to dwell on the more positive aspects of Aer Lingus.  They have had considerable success as a semi-State body.  We have seen their success with their diversification programme, particularly with their hotel, computer services and travel businesses.  This is a good indication that Aer Lingus want to find an area in which they can have a viable operation which will compensate for not being able to raise fares so high that they would lose passengers.  They have had great success in fuel economy and with the greater use of technology this is an area where there could be even greater improvement.  They have reduced their <Col N="1400" /> fuel costs by 30 per cent, which is considerable.</P>
    <P>About 70 per cent of all travellers to and from this country use Aer Lingus. They cannot say that they are not serving a purpose as a national airline.  They should be commended for so doing.  As the Minister pointed out, there is not a bottomless pit from which money can be drawn for any State-sponsored body.  I am sure the staff and management of Aer Lingus are conscious of this.  We are playing a dual role.  We are giving the necessary finance to Aer Lingus to ride out their severe economic difficulties on the clear understanding that they have a role to play in cutting costs and introducing flexibility to ensure efficiency in staffing and administration.</P>
    <P>I have heard many people complain that on the Dublin-London route one does not get a cup of coffee.  Most of us can survive for three-quarters of an hour without a cup of coffee.  If this was found to be cost effective then it was not a bad move by Aer Lingus to cut out such small comforts.  Recently I flew home from a Continental city and there were approximately 14 passengers on the plane.  We had three air hostesses looking after us but we could have been effectively looked after by one.  I am not saying that we should automatically fire two out of three air hostesses but management should look at flights which are not heavily booked and see if some savings can be made.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputies O'Donnell and Barrett that we must look at the size of our aircraft.  Air Lingus have three jumbo jets.  It is not an answer to say that they do not need three jets because in summer they would have to cut their trade.  However, the time has come for them to look at the size of their aircraft.  In the sixties fuel was cheap and we moved into the jet area.  Now that fuel costs are so high there is merit in looking at the size of aircraft serving certain routes and at the number of passengers who fly at certain times of the year.  Perhaps investment in a few smaller aircraft might prove better in the long run.  These are ways in which they can look at their operation and come up with answers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1401" /> I know Aer Lingus are making strong efforts to reduce their costs.  They have a staff of 6,000 between Dublin, Cork, Shannon, England, the US and Europe. In the last few years there have been 600 redundancies.  They are making an effort which should not be overlooked.  Apart from giving them this equity, the Government must look to see how they can help with the enormous capacity on the North Atlantic route which is available particularly during the summer.  Are there any measures the Government can take to prevent price-cutting flights or limit them in some way?  If stringent measures have to be taken to prevent these very cheap flights, then the Government may have to take them.  It will not be popular from a consumer point of view, but it may have to be done.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus must look at the cost of maintenance.  I represent a constituency in which Dublin Airport is situated.  In every housing estate in my constituency there are at least five families earning a living directly or indirectly from Aer Lingus. There is a fair amount of talk about Aer Lingus and their service at almost every gathering in Dublin North.  If Aer Lingus need to hire a plane that cost can be as high as £20,000 per day.  Most spare parts are enormously costly.  It is not just £4 or £5 but £4,000 or £5,000 for even the smallest replacement part.  Aer Lingus must keep a careful watch on maintenance.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and know from people I have spoken to in Aer Lingus that they are conscious of the role they must play.  They know that the £30 million equity is to help them over a rough period.  If the North Atlantic route was cut, 1,500 people would lose their jobs. I do not say that we must weigh up the loss of those jobs and allow a non-viable operation to continue indefinitely.  I hope it does not come to that.  The management and staff are very conscious that the end of the road came too near in recent years.</P>
    <P>A senior management person in Aer Lingus, Mícheál O Riain, read a paper rather evocatively called &ldquo;Survival in a Blood Bath&rdquo;, to the Chartered Institute <Col N="1402" /> of Transport in Dublin on 15 February 1983 in which he stated:</P>
    <P>I would like to end on a high note but I am afraid it might be false.  The problem of the Atlantic for North Atlantic carriers as a whole is not showing any signs of easing.  The prospect of continued losses by Aerlínte remains.  Easing of our interest burden as a result of the Exchequer investment makes it possible that we will reduce out Atlantic losses, make profits elsewhere in the system and survive, but the problems are far from over.  Meanwhile the one sure path we must follow, whatever the outside circumstances may be, is the path of cost control and we are firmly on that path.</P>
    <P>That is a commitment which I am prepared to take and I hope Aer Lingus will see it through.  I welcome the Bill and hope it will pass through the House so that Aer Lingus can survive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my colleagues I wish the Minister well in his new office and assure him of co-operation and support from this side of the House.</P>
      <P>We welcome this legislation and I sincerely hope it will be effective in ensuring the speedy return to profitability of the airlines generally.  However, more than financial incentives and assistance are needed to tackle the problems in the airlines. We must have an overall strategy which covers the sale and marketing of our airlines and industry generally.  In many respects, financial incentives, aids and Government support will not succeed in getting the airlines back to profitability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that the closure of the North Atlantic would result in a significant disimprovement in the economics of the European operation.  This brings home to us that the European operation is almost totally linked now with the North Atlantic operation and if we talk about the discontinuation of the North Atlantic operation, we are really talking about a discontinuation of the whole operation as well as a loss of 1,500 jobs.  This has been borne out very forcibly by the Minister's remarks.  I am glad <Col N="1403" /> that the review body have come out strongly and demonstrated very clearly that a close down of the North Atlantic operation would have a serious detrimental effect on the whole operations of the airline.  It is important that we keep this in mind.  I was disappointed that there was not a more positive approach in this regard.  The Minister seems to be saying that a recommendation in favour of terminating the service would be difficult to justify.  That is a weak and defeatist attitude. We must have a positive and constructive approach in this whole area.</P>
    <P>I have a special interest in Shannon Airport and I support the views which have been expressed here by Deputy Barrett and Deputy O'Donnell that it is timely now to have a close look at the question of the turn-about of the North Atlantic services in Shannon.  There are indications that Aer Lingus are about to purchase additional small aircraft. Approximately 65 per cent to 70 per cent of transatlantic passengers disembark at Shannon and we should look at this area to see if we could have this turn-about at Shannon.  I am aware that decisions were made some years ago to turn-about some of the transatlantic flights, but that course was not proceeded with.  I would like to see some, if not all, transatlantic flights turn-about at Shannon this year.  Other smaller aircraft could be utilised to supply the necessary backup for that.</P>
    <P>A committee was set up under Mr. Walls to inquire into the feasibility of customs pre-clearance and the possibility of having that service provided at Shannon. I am sure the Minister is aware of the benefit that such clearance would have, not only to Shannon but to the North Atlantic operation generally.  I would like the Minister to give us up-to-date information about the report of the Walls inquiry.  If it is not possible for him to publish the report at this time he should at least make it available to various interested parties who have been concerned about it.</P>
    <P>The major problem that needs to be dealt with in the North Atlantic is to try to get over the smallness and seasonability of that operation.  It is desirable and <Col N="1404" /> urgent that we have a strategy to try to extend the season so that we would not have this problem where for much of the year many services have to be maintained without benefit to the operation generally. A very vigorous campaign is needed to extend the tourist season in co-operation and consultation with the various bodies involved.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the charter situation and to support the views which have been expressed by Deputy O'Donnell.  I am glad the Minister has clarified the question of charters in relation to Chicago. As the Minister is aware, there was some press comment recently from tour operators in the United States that because of the failure to allow charters from Chicago and New York and other centres there would be a loss of $20 million to the tourist industry this year.  I am not satisfied that the Minister has clarified the situation.  I would like to get details of the applications which were refused by him and why they were refused.  I have a parliamentary question down in that regard.  I would also like to know whether any consultation was undertaken by him directly with the industry to see if it would be possible to allow at least some of these, bearing in mind that in some cases it may not be running counter to the views that have been expressed in other quarters.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, we welcome the Bill and especially the decision being taken to continue the transatlantic operation. Those mid-west of the Shannon are conscious of and recognise the value not only to the airlines of this business, but the whole importance of the development to the structure of the economy of the mid-west and the west generally. We would like to see Shannon maintained as a gateway to the west and to see further development and expansion of facilities at Shannon to make it a more attractive place.  We would like to see a more vigorous campaign embarked upon by the Government to develop infrastructural facilities, including customs pre-clearance, federal express and all the other additional business which can be generated and can make these operations viable and profitable in the future.  I <Col N="1405" /> assure the Minister he will have our co-operation in seeing that the right policy and approach is adopted to deal with this complicated and difficult area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Minister for Transport (Mr. J. Mitchell) Jim Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank all the speakers who wished me well in my appointment and especially Deputy Wilson, my predecessor, who now has the onerous responsibility of shadowing me.  I also wish him well and I am sure we will work together in the interests of the country to take the best decisions for transport in all its aspects.</P>
      <P>I apologise to Deputy Carey and other Deputies who have not been able to get in on the debate because of the agreement to curtail it in order to get this legislation through in time.  There have been delays, as Deputy Wilson said, because of the general election.  I will try to answer as many of the points raised by Deputies as I can.  Before doing so I would like to thank Deputies for the constructive nature of their contributions.  I found the debate very interesting and illuminating and Deputies can rest assured that the points they have made will be taken into account.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wilson asked about Air Florida. Air Florida departed this year from Ireland and that departure is indicative of the problems on the North Atlantic generally.  Ireland cannot look to US carriers to provide year-round services.  Air Florida followed the pattern of TWA and Pan Am who abandoned the scheduled services to Ireland in previous years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point raised was cost alleviation. Aer Lingus are obliged to serve <Col N="1406" /> both Shannon and Dublin.  That should not be seen as a penalty in a national sense because the two airports contribute roughly equally in the supply of passengers to the airline.  Aer Lingus must invest very heavily in promoting Ireland as a tourist destination.  The investment clearly has two objectives: the promotion of tourist numbers to Ireland and the filling of Aer Lingus seats.  In that regard the airline must invest more than average in promotional activity.  Those factors, plus the heavy interest burden to which I referred in my opening speech, were all taken into account in deciding on the cost alleviation payment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Wilson stated, it is important that the payment should not be seen as in any way carrying connotations of subsidy.  For that reason it is being made clear to the company that the payment is a temporary one for three years and it is intended to help to place the airline's finances on a sound footing.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wilson also asked about Airmotive. Airmotive are an extremely attractive company from a national point of view.  They are providing a high technology export-oriented service in the maintenance and overhaul of aircraft jet engines.  The company have been successfully set up, the staff trained and this is a highly productive organisation.  The company have been less successful than anticipated in their early years in obtaining engine maintenance contracts because of the worldwide recession in the airline industry which has reduced demand sharply for jet engine overhaul. While the setting-up phase of Airmotive is likely, therefore, to take somewhat longer than originally anticipated, there is every expectation that this will be a highly successful high technology Irish company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to asset disposal, also raised by Deputy Wilson, as I have explained in my Second Stage speech, a comprehensive package has been designed to bring the air companies back to profitability as soon as possible.  This includes the equity investment by the Exchequer, the cost <Col N="1407" /> alleviation payments and action by the airline themselves to restore their finances to viability.  In the latter connection, I have outlined the action being taken by Aer Lingus with a view to improving efficiency and reducing costs in every aspect of their operations.  In regard to asset disposal, it is a matter for the company themselves to make the maximum contribution which is commercially prudent from their ancillary activities towards the resolution of their present problems.  I am aware that Foxhills, to which the Deputy referred, has been advertised for sale and that some parts of the Tenerife property have been sold.  It is a matter for the board of the air companies to determine what further contribution can be made from within their own resources towards solving their financial difficulties.</P>
    <P>The question of turnover of services at Shannon has been raised by Deputy O'Donnell, who suggested that Aer Lingus transatlantic services should be turned around at Shannon.  I stress that Shannon is the country's transatlantic airport and will remain so.  However, we cannot avoid the fact that Aer Lingus need both Dublin and Shannon traffic to fill their Boeing 747s.  In fact, the two airports contribute almost equally in the generation of traffic for the transatlantic service.  The feasibility of using feeder services between Dublin and Shannon has been examined in detail many times, but because of the marketing considerations and other operational reasons the option is not really practical.  Deputy Raphael Burke made a number of points countering points made by Deputy O'Donnell.  The debate on this point shows the complexity of the whole situation. As I have said, Dublin and Shannon are essentially complementary feeding points for the Aer Lingus transatlantic operation and I can see no situation in which Aer Lingus will not continue to serve both airports.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bernard Allen questioned the cost of the dual-stop requirement.  While double landings clearly cost more than a single stop, marketing considerations dictate <Col N="1408" /> that the airline must serve both airports.</P>
    <P>In relation to Cork Airport, which was raised by Deputy O'Donnell and Deputy Allen among others, following a critical evaluation of services into Cork, Aer Lingus concluded that the restructuring of their services for summer 1983 was called for.  While the original plan envisaged the virtual elimination of direct plane services between Cork and the Continent the revised schedules which Aer Lingus devised would have given a better range of services &mdash; admittedly directly through Dublin &mdash; into Cork from the major European destinations.  In the process Aer Lingus would have been expecting to realise a cost saving of some £700,000 a year.  The scaling down of direct plane services was not viewed in the most favourable light by the local Cork community and, following a series of very constructive meetings between Aer Lingus and a group representative of all Cork interests led by the Lord Mayor, Deputy Coveney, a compromise package was recently agreed, with the new arrangement to come into effect at the end of the month.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing that traffic through Cork has been on the decline in recent years and, the costs continuing to rise, this has posed problems not only for Aer Lingus but also for Aer Rianta.  A loss of roughly £.5 million was incurred by Cork Airport last year and if the surplus on commercial activities such as duty free sales were left out of the reckoning the loss on operations would have been of the order of £1 million.  With no great prospect of traffic recovery this year Aer Rianta are facing a difficult position in Cork.  It is against that background that the company's concern about the financial fortunes of Cork must be looked at. In that regard Aer Rianta are looking at all of the options in the same way as any prudent commercial enterprise would do when it sees the gap between its costs and its revenues widening.  Clearly, a State company would be failing in its task if it did not take account of emerging trends. At the same time, bearing in mind in particular the headlines in one of this <Col N="1409" /> morning's newspapers, I want to make it clear that there is no question of Aer Rianta taking unilateral action of a drastic nature in terms of their employees in Cork.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to ensure that, in accordance with the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1976 the broadcast treatment of current affairs by Radio Telefís Éireann, including matters which are either of public controversy or the subject of current public debate, is fair to all interests concerned and that the broadcast <Col N="1410" /> matter is presented in an objective and impartial manner.</P>
    <P>I was influenced to put down this motion because of recent disquieting developments regarding Government involvement with RTE.  We have for the first time the appointment of a Minister of State attached to the Taoiseach's Office who has special responsibility for RTE. Deputy Nealon was appointed Minister of State in December 1982 in charge of Arts and Culture.  On 22 February 1983 the Taoiseach informed the Dáil that Deputy Nealon had been given responsibility for RTE and broadcasting generally, attached to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>Prior to this announcement the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Haughey, posed a parliamentary question to the Taoiseach regarding this matter.  On 26 January last Deputy Haughey said:</P>
    <P>I am asking the Taoiseach a very simple question and I think we are entitled to some information about it. My question is simply: is the issue of the transfer of responsibility for RTE from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to the Taoiseach's Department under consideration at all?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach denied categorically that he had any proposals to transfer responsibility from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to his own office.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacSharry then asked several questions attributed to Deputy Denis Foley.  The Official Report states:</P>
    <P>Mr. Foley: Arising from what the Taoiseach has said in reply to Deputy Haughey in relation to the transfer of functions of RTE to the Minister of State at his Department, is the Taoiseach now categorically denying suggestions made by his Minister of State, Deputy Nealon, to that effect in certain media in recent weeks?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach: The question put to me is whether it is proposed to transfer responsibilities to my Department and I have answered that question.</P>
    <P>Mr. Foley: Is the Taoiseach denying <Col N="1411" /> suggestions made by his Minister of State, Deputy Nealon, in that regard, that such was about to happen?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach: I am not aware of what the Minister of State, Deputy Nealon, said and, therefore, am not in a position to comment on it.</P>
    <P>Clearly the Taoiseach was denying that there was any proposal to transfer responsibility for RTE to the Taoiseach's Office.  However, on 22 February he informed the Dáil that Deputy Nealon had been given special responsibility for RTE and broadcasting generally.  I asked the Taoiseach where the Minister would be located, whether he would be at Government Buildings with direct responsibility to the Taoiseach or in the GPO.  Perhaps the Minister of State will be able to answer those questions now. It is my understanding that he has a token office in the GPO but will be working from the Department of the Taoiseach in Merrion Street.  Perhaps the Minister of State will shed some light in relation to his physical location so that we can contact him if we wish to make representations.</P>
    <P>As far as I can see, the Taoiseach is taking over responsibility for RTE through his Minister of State.  This is a complete change because up to now RTE has been the responsibility of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and the Minister of State at that Department had not any direct involvement with policy in relation to RTE.  There are now two Ministers of State attached to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, one of whom is also attached to the Department of the Taoiseach.  Will he answer directly to the Taoiseach on matters concerning RTE or will he be in communication with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in these matters?</P>
    <P>We view with grave concern the transfer of responsibility for RTE affairs to Deputy Nealon.  No doubt he is very well qualified to be involved in the broadcasting area.  He was attached to RTE for about ten years and was involved in the &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; programme.  I admired his ability as a broadcaster on current affairs <Col N="1412" /> programmes.  Some would say that maybe his true vocation was as a broadcaster in RTE, but that is a matter for the people of Sligo-Leitrim to decide, and they decided otherwise.</P>

      <P>Presumably.  According to that publication Deputy Nealon was head of the Government Information Services from 1975-77, presenter and political commentator on RTE television current affairs programmes for ten years, editor of the <i>Sunday Review</i> in the sixties, earlier reporter and political correspondent on Irish newspapers and in Fleet Street, London, and director of the Fine Gael Information Services 1977-81.  They are good credentials for a man who is taking over the propaganda for a Government who badly need propaganda at this stage as a result of the many changes in direction they took in recent months.  We could kindly refer to the Minister of State as the Goebbels of the Coalition Government, the propagandist of the administration. That is an apt title because he is the first Minister of State to have been given direct responsibility for RTE.  That is causing grave concern to us and to RTE staff.  I do not believe that the talented <Col N="1413" /> people in RTE will be impressed by the appointment of a supervisor or a person with direct political control of RTE.  His appointment represents a dangerous move.  I have not come across any section in the Acts dealing with RTE that refers to control by a Minister of State.  His appointment is an infringement of those Acts.</P>
      <P>In my view there is no provision in the Acts for the involvement of a Minister of State with direct control in the day-to-day management of RTE.  I have no doubt that Deputy Nealon is on a propaganda mission to ensure that the Coalition partners of Fine Gael and Labour get more than their fair share of radio and TV time.  I am worried about the implications for the fair and impartial reporting on RTE.  To date we have found RTE current affairs programmes impartial in their approach but for some strange reason the day after Deputy Nealon was given direct control of RTE, on 23 February, on the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme, a fine successful follow-up to &ldquo;Frontline&rdquo; and &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; which carried on the proud tradition of impartiality at all times&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; broadcast a programme about the school transport charges that were being unfairly imposed by the Coalition, RTE was impartial.  That programme dealt with an issue that has major repercussions for school-going children.  The matter was raised in the House on many occasions and Fianna Fáil feel they were responsible for the Minister deciding to withdraw the charges temporarily.  The RTE programme on Wednesday night <Col N="1414" /> dealt with that matter but presented only one side of the argument, that of the Minister for Education, Deputy Hussey.</P>

      <P>That programme was an exclusive propaganda exercise for the Minister for Education and her policies, policies which are unacceptable to the vast majority.  Our spokesperson, Deputy O'Rourke, was not given an opportunity to participate.  I should like to know why, one day after the appointment of Deputy Nealon as the Government propagandist, was our spokesperson not given an opportunity to put the Fianna Fáil side of that argument?  Who made that decision?  On what grounds was it made?  Was the Minister of State involved in this matter?  Presumably Deputy Nealon will reply to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hussey on the programme was given a strong interview but there was nobody to speak on behalf of Fianna Fáil who represent 45 per cent of the electorate. As the major Opposition Party we have a right to put forward our views. We were not asked to appear on that programme and there was no contact with Deputy O'Rourke or the Fianna Fáil press office.  Did that new approach represent Deputy Nealon's views?  On Thursday last I sought permission to raise that matter on the Adjournment but my request was ruled out by the Ceann Comhairle on the basis that the Minister was not responsible for the day-to-day decisions of RTE.  I presume that referred to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and not to the Minister of State who is now in charge of RTE and has a token involvement with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in the GPO.  Has the Minister of State visited the GPO since his appointment?  Will he ever have his office there?  I believe he will be grossly involved with the Taoiseach's <Col N="1415" /> Office with little to do with arts and crafts or culture.  In my view he will have some involvement daily with propaganda and broadcasting.  The Minister of State has had great experience with the GIS and has his office in the same building.  His appointment as Minister of State with responsibility for RTE represents a major change and one which is causing concern in RTE where staff are worried about their independence.</P>
    <P>On Thursday I wrote to the Director General of RTE, Mr. George Waters, on behalf of my party protesting at the lack of political balance in the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme on 23 February 1983 dealing with school transport charges.  I said that as we were not invited to take part on that programme it lacked political balance and permitted the Minister, Deputy Hussey, to give the Government position only in regard to that matter.  I told Mr. Waters that we would appreciate if this matter was investigated and asked him to ensure that in future proper political balance would be maintained as required in the Act setting up RTE.  On Thursday night I watched the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme which dealt with youth unemployment, a serious matter affecting many of our young people.  This is a growing problem, one which is a priority in our party to solve but sadly is not getting the consideration which it rightly deserves by the Government.</P>
    <P>This particular investigative programme concerned alleged abuses in relation to the youth employment scheme.  We have had contributions by Deputy George Birmingham, the Fine Gael Minister of State at the Department of Labour, and the Minister for Labour, but no participation by the Fianna Fáil spokesman, Deputy Gene Fitzgerald, or any other spokesman for Fianna Fáil in relation to this particular issue.  Why?  We had no participation by Fianna Fáil on Wednesday night and on Thursday a major programme being broadcast nationwide and involving one of the most fundamental issues affecting the people, but the party representing the vast majority of the people, the true party of the <Col N="1416" /> people, Fianna Fáil, were not given an opportunity to have a spokesman there to explain our position in relation to youth employment and in relation to the general problems in that area at this stage.</P>
    <P>Why should the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme, a programme which has always exercised impartiality up to now, at this stage decide to deprive our spokesperson of an opportunity to contribute to a major national debate on the greatest problem we have today, youth unemployment? Surely it is only right that a current affairs programme as prestigious as the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme would have participation by the major Opposition party in the State?  I believe the people demand that participation.  I believe the people paying their increased television licences demand that participation from Fianna Fáil in relation to this issue.  We are available at all times to provide spokespersons or representatives of our party to be involved in any of those programmes but we were not given the opportunity on either of those occasions.  We had Deputy Birmingham on &ldquo;Poporama&rdquo; on Sunday morning on RTE radio.  We had an exclusive &ldquo;Poporama&rdquo; programme with Deputy George Birmingham, the new whizz kid of the Fine Gael Party, spokesman for junior&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister of State turned down the invitation.  He was invited to take part in &ldquo;Poporama&rdquo; on <Col N="1417" /> Sunday morning.  The new spokesperson for RTE was invited but he said he turned the invitation down and allowed the new pop man of the Fine Gael Party, the Minister of State, Deputy George Birmingham, to take it on.  We take it that he was invited as the new spokesman for RTE to participate in &ldquo;Poporama&rdquo; on RTE on Sunday morning and he turned it down.  I thought the Minister of State turned it off when he heard the programme but I heard him saying he turned the invitation down.</P>
      <P>Since Deputy Nealon was appointed Minister of State with responsibility for RTE I can quote two very current situations in the last week of lack of impartiality in relation to two major issues.  I suppose the most important issues at the moment are school transport and the issue in relation to youth unemployment. I sent a protest to the Director General of RTE, Mr. George Waters, in relation to the lack of balance but so far I have not received any response from him.  I presume I will receive that in due course unless the Minister of State, Deputy Nealon, is taking on that responsibility as well and is answering for RTE directly in Dáil Éireann.  That would be a completely new departure.</P>
      <P>I am a TD from the neighbouring constituency to the Minister of State, Deputy Nealon.  The west of Ireland was almost deprived of Ministers.  There is only one full Cabinet Minister in the west and we have three Ministers of State.  It is an improvement of two from the last Coalition administration.  When Deputy Nealon was appointed Minister for Arts and Culture he gave an interview to <i>The Sligo Champion</i> which was quoted in that paper on 24 December 1982.</P>

      <P>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle may be less severe than the Acting Chairman.  I represented part of the constituency of the Minister of State on the Leitrim side for four years.  The Minister of State, Deputy Nealon, said in his interview with <i>The Sligo Champion</i> as quoted in that paper on 24 December 1982:</P>
      <P>I am happy with my job.</P>
      <P>He arrived back in Sligo in his Mercedes car.  We do not hear much about the cars now but we will be hearing much about them in due course.  He expressed satisfaction with his portfolio.  He said if he had a choice he would have actually asked for this particular portfolio.  He said, as quoted in <i>The Sligo Champion:</i></P>
      <P>At the moment the exact areas for which Mr. Nealon will have responsibility have not been finalised but it is likely that the new Department will have control over the Arts Council, the National Gallery, the National Museum, Public Records and State Archives, National Monuments, the National Concert Hall and the National Film Board.  However, there is speculation that the Department may be given responsibility for other areas including broadcasting and RTE. The previous Fine Gael spokesperson for Arts and Culture, Gemma Hussey, TD, also had broadcasting included in her portfolio, and there is a possibility that responsibility for this area could be trasferred from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to the new Department.  If this development was approved, then Mr. Nealon could be in charge of initiating Government plans to broadcast on radio debates from the Dáil.  However, Mr. Nealon declined to comment on this speculation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I presume he had good grounds for declining to comment because now we know that Deputy Nealon was appointed as Minister of State in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs with responsibility for RTE.  We are again into semantics because the Taoiseach said he was transferring responsibility for RTE from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to <Col N="1419" /> the Taoiseach's office.  Instead of that he transferred his Minister of State from the Taoiseach's office to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>

We were satisfied with the impartiality of RTE up to the date of Deputy Nealon's appointment and then things changed.  I am trying to point out the situation since Herr Goebbels over there, Deputy Nealon, was appointed Minister of State in charge of broadcasting.</P>

      <P>Perhaps Deputy Nealon should be a member of a county council. We consider ourselves justified in putting down this motion in the light of our not being given the opportunity to raise the matter in a question on the Adjournment of the House on Thursday last.  Had we been given that opportunity we might have been given assurances from the Minister, Deputy Nealon, in relation to his position <i>vis-á-vis</i> RTE.  We are anxious to have clarification from the Minister of State in regard to his proposed involvement with RTE.  I appreciate also that he will have involvement with the new broadcasting legislation.  We look forward to his carrying out his proposal to reintroduce the Bill that we brought before the Dáil in 1981.  That was a positive piece of legislation which would allow for independent broadcasting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1420" /> I listened with interest to what the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs had to say on a recent &ldquo;This Week&rdquo; programme on radio.  The Minister expressed great interest in relation to broadcasting, to the development of an independent broadcasting authority and to controlling legislation in the area of pirate radio.  I shall be making a statement in detail in that regard soon.  If the Minister can find the time, in between dealing with the day-to-day affairs of radio and television, I urge him to bring before the House at the earliest possible stage the two Bills to which I have referred.  This legislation is essential and crucial because of the extension in the past few years in the area of pirate broadcasting.  This sort of broadcasting is totally unacceptable.  We must bring about a situation at the earliest date possible whereby we can organise, manage and control these broadcasting stations, some of which are very fine broadcasting organs.</P>
    <P>Our broadcasting authority is one of the finest in the world.  Our radio and television services can compete with the best available anywhere.  We have in this service some of the top professional broadcasters.  In these circumstances we would be concerned that anybody should interfere with the impartiality of the producers and broadcasters who are engaged in these radio and television services. This is why I am giving the Minister of State an opportunity to clarify his position. We are giving that opportunity, too, to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs of explaining the new responsibilities of the Minister of State.  It would be totally unacceptable to those of us on this side of the House that anybody from the Government side should assume the day-to-day control of RTE, but I am concerned that as a major broadcaster the Minister of State may use his influence in regard to the management of programmes.</P>
    <P>We are asking for total impartiality on the part of RTE.  For our part, we are available at all times to take part in current affairs programmes, to explain our policies on various issues.  It is only right and proper that as the major Opposition party we be given fair play and that is <Col N="1421" /> what we are appealing for.  I am confident that RTE are anxious always to be fair and impartial.  They must exercise this responsibility in relation to current affairs programmes as well as all other programmes. They must maintain their independence at all times.  They must not be subjected to interference by the Government despite the good relationship that the Minister of State may have with the broadcasting media.</P>
    <P>We in Fianna Fáil would wish our policies to be projected in a proper and fair manner.  By way of this motion we are issuing a warning to the Minister of State that we will not accept any interference from him in the day-to-day running of RTE.  The Act which set up the RTE Authority is very clear in relation to ministerial involvement and interference. The 1960 Act deals specifically with the position regarding a Minister's involvement in the affairs of RTE.  That Act was updated in 1976 but there remains a clear provision on the question of impartiality.  This provision is contained in subsection (1) of section 18 which reads:</P>
    <P>It shall be the duty of the Authority to secure that, when it broadcasts any information, news or feature which relates to matters of public controversy or is the subject of current public debate, the information news or feature is presented objectively and impartially and without any expression of the Authority's own views.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of that section reads:</P>
    <P>Nothing in this section shall prevent the Authority from transmitting political party broadcasts.</P>
    <P>Section 21 sets out clearly the instances in which the Minister can become involved in RTE.  We do not wish there to be any departure from these provisions. The only time that there was cause for concern in relation to this whole area was during the period of office of a previous Coalition.  At that time Deputy Nealon was head of the Government Information Services.  He was working there under the control of the former <Col N="1422" /> Taoiseach, Mr. Cosgrave, and probably in co-operation with the then Minister, Dr. Cruise O'Brien, who took a most unusual interest in the RTE situation. Indeed, it might be said that that Minister took more interest in RTE than he took in the day-to-day management of the Department of which he was in charge.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity of wishing the new Minister for Transport and for Posts and Telegraphs every success in both these Departments.  They are two very fine Departments, perhaps the finest in the State.  From my involvement in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs I am aware of the high quality of the staff there.  I received the utmost co-operation from them at all times.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I can only express the hope that the appointment of the Minister of State will not affect the day-to-day running of RTE, that he will not be involved in directing RTE in any way.  To RTE I make the appeal that under no circumstances must they be under any control by the Minister of State in relation to current affairs programmes but rather that they must be objective and impartial at all times.  All we seek is fair presentation of our policies and views. We ask the broadcasters to be conscious of the need to maintain impartiality and we ask for participation at all times in current affairs programmes.  I would remind the authority that the Irish public, 45 per cent of whom are represented by Fianna Fáil, be given the opportunity of hearing us explain our policies.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;notes that under the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, as amended by the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1976</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i)  it is the duty of the R.T.E. Authority to ensure that the broadcast treatment of current affairs, including matters which are either of public controversy or the subject of current public debate, is fair to all interests concerned and that the broadcast matter is presented in an <Col N="1423" /> objective and impartial manner and without any expression of the Authority's own views and</P>
    <P>(ii)  subject to certain procedures being complied with the Broadcasting Complaints Commission may investigate and decide on complaints, <i>inter alia</i>, that in broadcasting a programme the Authority did not comply with one or more of the statutory requirements referred to.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Leyden is a gregarious fellow, a funny fellow and even a lovable fellow but almost his entire contribution has been totally irrelevant to the motion. Some of his contribution was, I have to say with regret, disgraceful.  The Acting Chairman on three occasions asked him to address himself to the motion, as you did too.  That would be funny if broadcasting was not such a serious subject.  In his first contribution as shadow Minister for Posts and Telegraphs not only has he let himself down, but he has let the House down.</P>
    <P>I want to deal briefly with the appointment of Deputy Nealon as the second Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  The announcement by the Taoiseach which Deputy Leyden obviously has not read is as follows:</P>
    <P>I beg leave to announce for the information of the Dáil that, on 18 February 1983 the Government appointed Deputy Ted Nealon, Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, to be Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs also with special responsibility for radio and television.</P>
    <P>The exercise of the responsibilities allocated to the Minister of State will, in accordance with statute and practice, be subject to the general superintendence and control of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, who will remain fully responsible for all the departmental powers and duties.</P>
    <P>I wanted to put that on record in view of the fact that Deputy Leyden had not read it and he asked if the Taoiseach had taken <Col N="1424" /> over responsibility for RTE and to whom Deputy Nealon was answerable.  It is very clear that that part of Deputy Leyden's contribution was mischievous and nothing else.</P>
    <P>The motion says:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to ensure that, in accordance with the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1976 the broadcast treatment of current affairs by Radio Telefís Éireann, including matters which are either of public controversy or the subject of current public debate, is fair to all interests concerned and that the broadcast matter is presented in an objective and impartial manner.</P>
    <P>He is calling on me, the Minister, to ensure impartiality but the burden of his speech in so far as it relates to the motion was denouncing me and the Minister of State for alleged interference.  The motion calls for us to interfere but the Act says &ldquo;it is the responsibility of the Authority&rdquo; and the Minister has no responsibility.  That is why I was very careful of the words I used when I framed my amendment, which I moved earlier. It is vitally important that politicians, of whatever party, should not interfere with RTE in the discharge of their duty.  The only political correspondence there has been with RTE since the change of Government, as far as I am aware, has been from Deputy Leyden who, in his first few days as Shadow Minister for Posts and Telegraphs complained about programmes in his first few days as Shadow Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, not once but twice.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leyden several times referred to the Minister of State, Deputy Nealon, as the Minister for RTE.  He is not Minister of State for RTE; he is Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs with responsibility for radio, television and all broadcasting matters. I want to explain the reason for that. When I was appointed Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and Minister for Transport, during the first few weeks in office I assessed the range of my responsibilities, looked at the problems and the <Col N="1425" /> issues, and examined the history of those issues.  It is no reflection on any of my predecessors to say that the area of broadcasting had suffered from Ministerial neglect because of pressure of other duties.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leyden was Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the Department of Transport and was fully preoccupied with duties dealing with post and telephones and no concentrated attention was given to broadcasting.  Because of the number of serious developments in this area and because I knew I would not have the time to give broadcasting the priority it deserves, I asked the Taoiseach if he would consider appointing an additional Minister of State at the Department to give broadcasting and the development and problems of broadcasting the priority they have not been getting in the last few years.</P>
    <P>For example major developments in satellite television open up enormous opportunities and risks for this country and grave questions in this area may have to be answered very urgently.  That subject alone warrants the appointment of a Minister of State.  Second, there is the very unsatisfactory situation in local broadcasting &mdash; illegal pirate stations on the one hand and the lack of progress in getting legal local broadcasting going. Third, there is cable television and deflector television.  Fourth, there are many other areas ancillary to broadcasting which need attention.  These are major issues to be addressed and that is why I asked the Taoiseach for a Minister of State to help give these matters the priority they deserve.  I am happy the Taoiseach and the Government were able to accede to my request and that Deputy Nealon, a distinguished broadcaster and journalist of repute, was appointed Minister of State.  I look forward to working with him to give broadcasting the priority it deserves and, hopefully, before a year has elapsed we will have seen the worth of his appointment.</P>
    <P>I think it appropriate in discussing this motion to review briefly the circumstances in which the statutory duty referred to came to be placed on the RTE Authority. <Col N="1426" /> From 1926 to 1960 broadcasting in this country was under the direct control of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. In 1953, however, the then Minister, Mr. Erskine Childers, undertook a radical reorganisation whereby Comhairle Radio Éireann was appointed to operate and effectively control the broadcasting service.  In 1960 the independence granted to Radio Éireann, as it then was, was put on a proper legal footing with the establishment of the new Authority under the Broadcasting Authority Act of that year.</P>
    <P>Section 18(1) of the 1960 Act stated that</P>
    <P>It shall be the duty of the Authority to secure that, when it broadcasts any information, news or feature which relates to matters of public controversy or is the subject of current public debate, the information, news or feature is presented objectively and impartially and without any expression of the Authority's own views.</P>
    <P>In moving the Second Stage of the Bill in the Dáil on 24 February 1960, the then Minister, Mr. Michael Hilliard, made clear his, and the then Government's, views on how the duties specified for the new authority should be exercised; he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In considering the structure of the organisation that should be laid down in the Bill, the Government took the view that the Authority which it is proposed to set up should be quite free to exercise its functions of providing a national service, with power of intervention by the Minister or by the Government confined to a small number of matters in which State interests must be safeguarded.  The Authority will, therefore, have the maximum freedom in the matter of programmes.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>It is not proposed to lay down any specific requirements as regards programme standards, apart from requiring the Authority to ensure that the general tone of programmes will be in conformity with the national aims of <Col N="1427" /> restoring the Irish language and preserving and strengthening the national culture.  It will be left to the Authority to see that programmes are of an adequate quality, and that a proper balance between them is maintained.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt, from the section of the Act which I have quoted and these comments, as to where it was envisaged responsibility would lie for ensuring objectivity and impartiality in the broadcast treatment of matters of public controversy &mdash; it would lie fairly and squarely on the new Authority.  That was, I believe, the accepted view also of subsequent Ministers and Governments, and I have no reason to doubt that it was also accepted by the RTE Authority.</P>
    <P>However, that legislation did not deal explicitly with who would be arbiter on questions of objectivity and impartiality. It did not make the Minister the arbiter, but equally it did not provide any other means of deciding such questions.  In the event therefore, the Minister could have been put in the position of having to make judgments on such questions. There was the danger then that Ministers could make judgments on RTE's approach to questions in which they were interested.  Any such judgments could be made without a formal basis and undue pressure could be placed on the Authority to conform to a view of objectivity and impartiality particularly favourable to the Government of the day.  Ultimately, this pressure could extend to dismissal of the Authority without giving any reasons.</P>
    <P>It was because of the existence of these possibilities &mdash; and I do not suggest for a moment that such circumstances did, in fact, arise &mdash; that substantial restrictions on the powers of the Minister and clarification of the duties of the Authority were provided for in the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1976, which was when Dr. Conor Cruise-O'Brien was Minister and he, too, was despised by Deputy Leyden, very wrongly.  Under this Act, section 18 of the 1960 Act was amended and placed a statutory duty on the Authority to ensure <Col N="1428" /> that all news broadcast by them is reported in an objective and impartial manner, that the broadcast treatment of current affairs is fair to all interests concerned and is presented in an objective and impartial manner and without any expression of the Authority's own views and that any material published by the Authority is similarly objective and impartial.</P>
    <P>There is, however, an important qualification in the section to the effect that, should it prove impracticable in a single programme to apply the provision, two or more related broadcasts may be considered as a whole, provided that the broadcasts are transmitted within a reasonable period.</P>
    <P>The same section specifically prohibited the Authority from including in any of their broadcasts anything which might reasonably be regarded as being likely to promote, or incite to crime, or as tending to undermine the authority of the State and requires the Authority, in their programmes and in the means employed to make such programmes not to unreasonably encroach on the privacy of an individual.</P>
    <P>I believe that the duty as it is now stated in the Act is a fair and satisfactory one in terms of the obligations which it places on the Authority, and of the protection which it gives to those whose views have to be fairly presented.  I take it from the terms of the motion as presented, and from what Deputy Leyden has said, that he has no dispute with that view.  It appears, however, that he is dissatisfied with the manner in which the duty placed on the Authority has been fulfilled.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's speech raises the central issue of how complaints of alleged breaches of the statutory duty on the Authority are to be handled.  This issue is dealt with by sections 18A to 18C of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960 (which were inserted by Section 4 of the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1976).  Under these sections, the Broadcasting Complaints Commission were established to investigate and decide on complaints in regard to alleged breaches of the requirements of objectivity <Col N="1429" /> and impartiality, the prohibition from broadcasting or propagating anything which may reasonably be regarded as being likely to promote, or incite to crime, or as tending to undermine the authority of the State, the prohibition from unreasonably encroaching upon the privacy of the individual, the requirement to observe directions issued under section 31(1) of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, and the Authority's code of advertising standards.  The Act provides that a complaint, prior to its being made to the commission, should first be made to the authority within 30 days of the cause of complaint.</P>
    <P>The Act also provides that as soon as may be after they decide on a complaint made under the Act, the commission shall send to the person making the complaint and the Authority a statement in writing of their decision, and the Authority shall inform the commission in writing whether or not they accept the decision. The commission publish their decisions unless they consider it inappropriate to do so and submit an annual report of their activities, which is laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>It is perhaps worth drawing attention to the differences in approach to the functions of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission as compared with their opposite number in the UK.  A Broadcasting Complaints Commission was not established by legislation in the UK until 1981.  There had been informal committees, established by the Broadcasting Authorities in existence prior to then. The UK Commission is only empowered to consider and adjudicate on complaints of unjust or unfair treatment in programmes broadcast or unwarranted infringement of privacy in, or in connection with the obtaining of material included in, programmes broadcast.  A complaint may only be entertained by the commission if it is made by the person affected, or by a person authorised by him to make the complaint for him.  The commission established here under the Act of 1976 have, as I have indicated, broader functions, although they remain particular to the specific statutory duties placed on RTE.  In this way, they represent <Col N="1430" /> a reasonable balance between the needs of the public and of the broadcasters.</P>
    <P>I take it then from the legislation governing RTE's activities that the RTE Authority are fully responsible for the achievement of fairness and the exercise of balance in their broadcast treatment of current affairs.  That responsibility is not diluted in any way by any secondary responsibility on the Minister or the Government or, indeed, the Broadcasting Complaints Commission to ensure such fairness or balance; there is no such secondary responsibility.  Complaints about alleged failures in such matters must be made to the Authority.  It would be reasonable to expect the Authority, on receipt of any complaint, to examine whether there was any failure on their part, or on the part of their staff.  I would hope that the Authority would be able to arrive at a correct conclusion in their examination of most complaints, but there must, of course, be a number of occasions when their conclusions are not agreed with by the complainant or others. The authority cannot, in every case, be the best arbiter of whether they are fulfilling the duties placed upon them.  In cases where there is still disagreement as between the views of the complainant and the authority, the Broadcasting Complaints Commission are available to give an independent view on the subject of complaint.</P>
    <P>The Broadcasting Complaints Commission accordingly represent the proper method for dealing with complaints regarding alleged breaches of duty in the matters referred to.  The motion as presented, and Deputy Leyden's comments in proposing it, imply that I, as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs should determine whether or not RTE are meeting their statutory duty in matters of this kind and should bring pressures to bear on the Authority.  I cannot agree with this view. It does not seem proper to me that a Minister should be called upon to judge whether the authority act fairly or objectively or impartially in matters of public controversy or debate.  Were I to act in this way, I would be going against both the letter and the spirit of the Broadcasting <Col N="1431" /> Authority Acts.  It is quite clear to me that the stated intention of the then Minister in 1960 to give the Authority the maximum freedom in the matter of programmes must be respected on a consistent basis, if it is to be applied at all.  A freedom which subjects RTE's detailed actions to daily questioning by the Minister cannot be a real freedom, or be conducive to the aim of the Act to create a public service broadcasting organisation independent of detailed controls. Equally, the statutory facility to have complaints investigated by an independent commission must be exercised consistently. It would be unacceptable to insist that some complaints should be processed in the statutory way, while in other cases the RTE Authority should be subject to ministerial pressure or interference.</P>
    <P>It may be asked, what happens if the RTE Authority are so careless of their duty as to allow repeated unfair and imbalanced use of their programmes to project certain viewpoints or to ignore others?  What if they pass off complaints as being groundless or unsustainable? And what if they then proceed to ignore decisions of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission which find complaints about their actions to be well founded?  I have to say that I would think it most unlikely that such a series of eventualities could occur.  The Authority are, after all, a group of respected individuals appointed by the Government to represent the public trust.  It seems unlikely that they would ignore legitimately expressed concern about the exercise of activities with which they are entrusted.  But it may be claimed perhaps that the authority themselves are unable to ensure proper control of activities because of the part-time involvement of the members in their business? This can hardly be the case; the Authority set down guidelines for the achievement of the statutory requirements upon them and exercise their functions through their staff; the staff are accountable to the Authority and they also are unlikely to ignore criticism.  That is not to say that there will not be occasional lapses at one level or another; such lapses must be <Col N="1432" /> inevitable from time to time in any organisation. However, decisions of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission, when published, create a strong moral pressure on the authority and their staff to act to correct any failures to which their attention is drawn.</P>
    <P>The commission do not exercise any specific sanctions.  This is deliberate.  The then Minister, speaking on the Second Stage debate in the Dáil on 6 November 1975, dealt with this point:</P>
    <P>The complaints commission were not intended to have any sanctions which they could apply.  Their sole sanction lies in their finding.  The Government take the view that any Authority are likely to be a responsible body which will not take lightly the findings of a commission if the commission find there is something wrong. Of course, the ultimate sanction is there; and if an Authority &mdash; I think this unlikely &mdash; is constantly being found to be in breach by the complaints commission and if they blithely ignore the commission's findings, that fact will have to be considered when the Authority come up for reappointment. It might have to be considered even before that.  In that unlikely event there is an implicit sanction behind the complaints commission, but it is implicit only.  The complaints commission have only the right to find or not to find that there is something wrong.</P>
    <P>In all these circumstances, it seems to me that the natural tendency will be for the Authority to act to meet their duties and certainly not to be dismissive of them.  Having established that, it is fair to return to the question &mdash; what happens if, unlikely as it may seem, the Authority do repeatedly fail to fulfil their statutory duties?  It has to be accepted that in circumstances where the Authority are shown to have failed repeatedly to meet their obligations, the Minister must formally intervene, in the public interest.  I hope it will be clear from my comments that I think the circumstances justifying such an intervention would be quite exceptional.</P>
    <P>I believe that I have dealt adequately <Col N="1433" /> with the circumstances in which the statutory duties placed on the RTE Authority were created, the manner in which it was envisaged they would be exercised and the way in which their performance can be assessed.  I would like to turn now to my view of the relationship between Governments and broadcasters. It seems to me to be one of the burdens of office, which is not shared with those in Opposition, that with a defined and limited responsibility for broadcasting matters goes a limitation on the comment which can be passed on the exercise of responsibility by others, particularly by the Broadcasting Authority and broadcasting staff.  This limitation arises because of the confidence and trust that has to exist between the public and the broadcaster.  The broadcaster, be it the Authority or the individual staff member serving the Authority in the performance of their functions, must have the support of the public for what they communicate; if the public disbelieve the communication, or consider it to be biased or tending to misrepresent, they will withdraw their confidence from the Authority and the service they provide.  If the Authority believe they have lost the support of the public they can lose confidence and, with it, the ability to communicate successfully with their potential audience.  The Minister, who ultimately expresses the public will, in the exceptional circumstances I have outlined, serves a critical role in this relationship between the public and the broadcaster.  I am constrained, therefore, in my comments upon the details of Deputy Leyden's complaints for this reason also.</P>
    <P>There is always a particular sensitivity in the relationship between politicians and broadcasters because there is such an interdependence of each upon the other. Politicians, whether in Government or Opposition, depend upon broadcasters, and, of course, the other media, to relay information; the media, have the possibility of analysing and interpreting the information they receive and the possibility of seeking more information than is given freely.  The media generally are dependent on a reliable flow of information to report and comment upon.  The <Col N="1434" /> ephemeral nature of broadcasting and its undoubtedly powerful influence, together with the manner in which it is organised, seem to accentuate the sensitivity which exists.</P>
    <P>Considering the natural sensitivity that must exist between politicians of all persuasions and broadcasters there have been remarkably few instances of controversy about RTE's treatment of news and current affairs.  There have been, of course, some exceptions but I do not intend to re-open old controversies.  The exceptions, in themselves, prove that there is a healthy tension and that RTE's treatment of current affairs is not subdued.  I think it is fair to say that in recent years there has been minimal controversy between politicians and broadcasters.  I attribute this situation, in part, at least, to the clarification of roles and duties enshrined in the 1976 amending legislation. It is also fair to say that the RTE Authority has, in general, carried out its role as trustee of the broadcasting services for the nation.</P>
    <P>Earlier in my speech I referred to the important statutory qualification regarding RTE's obligation to be objective and impartial.  The 1976 Act states that should it prove impracticable, in a single programme, to achieve balance two or more related broadcasts may be considered as a whole provided they are transmitted within a reasonable period.  This is obviously an important qualification so far as RTE's nightly current affairs programme is concerned.  It would hardly be reasonable and probably not make good television that every programme should consist of a straight debate between two opposing points of view.  Too much emphasis on balance within the single programme could produce a result which confuses the viewer and produces more heat than light.</P>
    <P>A former Director-General of the BBC, Sir Hugh Greene, has been quoted as saying:</P>
    <P>We have to balance different points of view in our programmes but not necessarily within each individual programme. Nothing is more stultifying <Col N="1435" /> than the current affairs programme in which all the opposing opinions cancel each other out.  Sometimes one has to use that method but in general it makes for greater liveliness and impact if the balance can be achieved over a period, perhaps within a series of related programmes.</P>
    <P>His remarks are particularly apposite in the present case.  Must RTE give a spokesman for every point of view an opportunity to contribute to each programme on every topic?  How enlightening is that likely to be for the viewer?  I do not want to answer these questions but they are fair questions for the Authority to consider.</P>
    <P>My general feeling is that Deputy Leyden has, in the presentation of this case, disclosed an undue and perhaps rushed sensitivity.  I do not intend to argue the details of his complaints but I must say that I could not accept the essence of some at least of the points he makes. That said, I do not have any doubt that the RTE Authority will pay particular attention to the points he has made and that other speakers will make in the course of this debate.  I am confident that the Authority will act in any cases where there is justifiable cause for concern, as I believe they have done to date, and they will have my full support and encouragement in their actions.</P>
    <P>A former Leader of Deputy Leyden's party, a former Taoiseach, Mr. Séan Lemass, referred once to Radio Éireann as an arm of Government.  As Minister for Posts and Telegraphs I oppose that view completely.  It is vital that RTE, in the discharge of their duties, be removed completely from political interference or pressure.  It is very important that Government be particularly sensitive to the need not to interfere unduly or pressure RTE.  But the same onus rests on all members of all political parties.  There is a tendency amongst politicians to be too sensitive, a tendency amongst political supporters to want to influence programmes in their direction.  In my view that is wrong.  Politicians of all parties, should keep out of broadcasting; certainly <Col N="1436" /> they should refrain from endeavouring to influence individual programme or series of programmes.</P>
    <P>I am glad that Deputy Leyden's motion afforded me an opportunity to address this most important subject now.  I thank Deputy Leyden for his good wishes on my appointment.  In return may I wish him a very happy and long period as shadow Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. I am sure we shall get on very well together in the interests of broadcasting and other postal and telegraph matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenLemass" hpid="Mrs. Lemass Mrs. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>May I avail of this opportunity of wishing the Minister well on his appointment and also the Minister of State, Deputy Nealon, in his portfolio.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see that the Minister is taking this matter so seriously because earlier in the debate Members on the Government side of the House seemed to think it a huge joke, something of which I disapprove totally.  It is an extremely serious matter and the Minister has convinced me that he regards it as such.</P>
      <P>Over the past ten or 15 years television particularly has become a very important part of political debate, if you like, a very important instrument in the lives of politicians. Indeed it is a medium which tends to convince people to accept the view of one side or the other.  It gives the public an insight into what opposing parties in this House are thinking, what are their policies and what they are endeavouring to put before the people. Increasingly in recent years television has been having such an impact that it can either elect or defeat a politician at the polls.  Because of this, all of us in the House should be concerned about a balanced view on radio and TV.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During my life as a public representative I have found that I have been very fairly treated by the media.  Barring a few small incidents, the &ldquo;Women Today&rdquo; programme with which I have been involved on numerous occasions has been impartial, constructive and balanced. One small matter worried me.  When I was speaking on that programme I invariably had two opposing speakers, usually <Col N="1437" /> a woman from Fine Gael and one from Labour.  In the most balanced version of the programme it was always two to one in favour of the other side.</P>
    <P>However, I found the programme impartial.  Indeed on one occasion the producer came to me and said: &ldquo;I believe the women in Fianna Fáil have not been getting a fair crack of the whip&rdquo;.  During the previous year on numerous programmes there had been spokeswomen from Fine Gael and occasionally from Labour, and Fianna Fáil people had not been invited.  The producer eventually realised this and he contacted me and said: &ldquo;To make up for lack of involvement of Fianna Fáil women in the programme I am asking you if you would like a full half hour to yourself to do a programme&rdquo;.  I thought that was very fair and I accepted the offer graciously.  It was a great success, a very good programme. From then on we got a fair and balanced view on that programme.</P>
    <P>Having said that, there could be cause for concern if the public began to think that the Government side of the House were monopolising programmes on radio or TV.  It would be a serious matter if the electorate began to see this as a problem. The two programmes referred to by Deputy Leyden caused the view to be taken that the Opposition had not got a fair chance to state their side of the case. The Minister told us this evening that Deputy Nealon has no function in this matter.  However, perhaps he would consider making an effort so that the public will not get the impression that this is happening.</P>
    <P>After all, the Minister of State has been given the appointment in respect of Arts and Culture, with special responsibility for RTE.  I know he cannot tell RTE what to do or not to do, but in his own way &mdash; he knows many people in RTE, having worked there for a number of years, and I am sure he is friendly with all the producers &mdash; he should let them know his views, even in an informal way.  It is up to him to ensure that the electorate do not get the impression that RTE are in favour of one side or the other.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hussey before she became Minister, became closely involved in <Col N="1438" /> RTE.  She did a project and she thought she could tell RTE what they should or should not do.  She interfered considerably. She told them they did not have enough women broadcasters, that they had not enough women involved in RTE. I disagreed with her totally at that time because I regarded RTE as being one of the bodies that employ a considerable number of women compared with other semi-State bodies.  They do very well for women employees.  Deputy Hussey was given an entire &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; all to herself and she was able to get across her points of view.  Later she became spokesperson for Arts and Broadcasting &mdash; I hope I have the right title; I would not like to do her an injustice.  At the time she was not a Minister, she was a spokesperson for the Opposition and she therefore did not have much authority.</P>
    <P>We all realise that politicians are fair game on television and radio, but as they say, if you cannot stand the heat you should get out of the kitchen.  Some politicians who appear on either medium feel they are unfairly treated, that the interviewer does not give them an opportunity to state their points of view.  I think that any politician worth his salt should go in there and say what has to be said and what he wants, and not be intimidated by any interviewer.  An interviewer has to do a job.  Of course, he tries to get the best out of the programme.  He will try to get a politician who does not want to say something to give answers, even if the politician may not have the answers. The politician in that way will find himself in a bit of a pickle and he will consider that he is being harassed or intimidated by the interviewer.  However, a politician who decides to go on a programme must be prepared to do his best and to cope with whatever interviewer is interviewing him.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the new Minister of State has not a function to tell RTE what they can or cannot do.  Perhaps because Deputy Nealon has been associated so closely with the broadcasting station over so many years and is so familiar with it, we on this side of the House are wondering what his input will be.  I have no doubt that he will be impartial and we are <Col N="1439" /> merely asking him to do his best to ensure that all politicians will be treated equally and fairly, because TV and radio today are so important to all of us.  We must get our policies and our parties' points of view across to the electorate as best we can.  We must do it truthfully and honestly. Recently in numerous broadcasts pro-life and anti-amendment people have been given a fair hearing.  I heard numerous broadcasts and they were very fair. Everyone got an opportunity to say what had to be said.  This will enable the people to weigh up the situation and decide what they think and where their commitment is.</P>
    <P>Because the Minister of State is so closely associated with RTE we find it a bit difficult to believe that he will not interfere in some way on one side or the other, that he will not have some input into RTE which will put that little bit of strain on them in their efforts to be totally impartial.  I want him to do his best in whatever capacity he is dealing with the station, and to ensure that all politicians get a fair, adequate and balanced hearing so that they can put forward the point of view and policy of their parties and the electorate can weigh up the situation and decide which point of view they agree with having heard both sides of the story, and not be swayed one way or the other by an imbalanced situation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass referred to my close association with RTE and the danger she saw inherent in that.  That is the greatest guarantee of my total impartiality.  I understand RTE's situation.  From time to time politicians believe they are motivated by purposes other than the production of good programmes.  My knowledge of RTE is that they are totally motivated by the production of good programmes. <Col N="1440" /> There is no one out there burrowing a way in the dark, trying to score on party political issues.  I was associated with them for some time.  I was also head of the GIS and press secretary for Fine Gael.  During that time my record is of total non-contact with them, and of not seeking to influence them, despite pressure from frustrated members of my own party from time to time.  I was often criticised by members of my own party for not working with the same zeal as the public relations officer of our own party in that connection.</P>
    <P>I took a note of something Deputy Leyden said.  This is an interpretation of what he said: that the RTE Authority should be free from interference by the Government; that my own party would not tolerate any interference.  I applaud and fully subscribe to those statements. Yes, Deputy Leyden put down a motion which in effect calls on the Minister to interfere on this occasion.  The motion calls on the Minister to interfere, and yet the whole tenor of Deputy Leyden's speech was that there should be no interference. If it comes to a vote tomorrow night and if Deputy Leyden follows the sentiments expressed in his own statement, he will be compelled to vote against his own motion.</P>
    <P>He mentioned a number of points and it is only fair that I should deal with the specifics.  A question arose about the categorical denial by the Taoiseach that the Minister of State was being appointed in charge of broadcasting in his own Department. I would not subscribe to any suggestion that the Minister of State with responsibility in the broadcasting area should be in the Taoiseach's Department, and neither would the Taoiseach subscribe to that.  I have no doubt that under the present Taoiseach there would be no problem.  I have no doubt Deputy Leyden would say that under his leader there would be no problem.  I do not think it would be a good thing.  There was never any question of my being brought into the Taoiseach's Department and I fully agree with that.</P>

      <P>The Deputy asked where I was being located.  I have a very fine office, the second finest office I have ever had the privilege to work in.  It is being decorated now and the paintings are still to be put in.  This office is in the GPO.  I will be based there.  My activities as Minister of State in this general area will take up far more of my time because of the legislation mentioned by the Deputy and the urgency of that legislation dealing with local broadcasting, dealing with the pirates, dealing with direct satellite broadcasting which has tremendous potentiality.  Much more of my time will be taken up there than in the very interesting area of arts and culture.  I have not got an office in Leinster House.  The Deputy is aware of the scarcity of office room in Leinster House.  My room in Leinster House is based in the Taoiseach's Department.  If I am asked at the end of the year where I spent most of my time physically, I should imagine it will be on a 50:50 basis.  Generally speaking I anticipate that this year anyhow the Department of Posts and Telegraphs will occupy more of my time because of the major developments we are talking about.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also referred to the forecasting in my own local paper of the possibility that I would be appointed to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs as well as arts and culture.  The Deputy quoted from the paper.  I have not got the actual quotation with me.  Speculation was reported that I might be given responsibility in the broadcasting area.  It was reported that Deputy Nealon refused to comment.  That was intelligent forecasting and reporting by the excellent reporter on the <i>Sligo Champion</i>.  There were many excellent forecasts that Deputy Leyden would soon find himself on the front bench as spokesman on the Department of Posts and Telegraphs as a reward for work well done in his period as Minister of State with responsibility in that area.</P>

      <P>The Deputy also mentioned that my appointment was not well received in RTE.  Naturally one likes to hear the good things about one's self and not the bad things.  My information from RTE personnel, the authority and the trade unions is that my appointment was extremely well received.  As I said one is inclined to be told the good things and not the bad things, but that is my information backed up by a considerable number of messages of goodwill to me.</P>
      <P>Two programmes were worrying Deputy Leyden.  I have had absolutely no contact with RTE on either of those programmes or on anything since my appointment.  Deputy Lemass suggested that I should contact RTE about them.  I will not contact RTE about any programme. It is my duty to stand back. There are specific provisions in the Broadcasting Acts which delineate very clearly and specifically what the Minister can and cannot do.  The main purpose of those Acts is to keep the Minister out rather than get him involved.  That is the way I intend to operate unless there is some specific reason as outlined in the Acts why I should talk to the Authority. However, that is very limited and only in cases of extreme emergency is that referred to in the Acts.  By and large RTE do an extremely good job and they seek to be impartial.  In individual programmes they are not always impartial and what can be planned as a totally impartial programme can turn out to be a disaster for one party or another.</P>

      <P>I should like to give some of the time allotted to me to my colleague, Deputy Wallace, from the same constituency, to express his views on the <Col N="1443" /> matter.  The withdrawal of the involvement of Power Securities in the development of Merchants Quay, Cork is a serious blow to a wonderful project that was well planned over a number of years. The development of office accommodation, shopping leisure facilities and a carpark complex was to be the biggest of its kind and at present-day values was estimated to cost £33 million.  During its proposed construction over a three-year period it was estimated that 700 people would be directly employed and many more would be employed in the service industries.  It was envisaged that when completed 2,000 jobs would be available.</P>
      <P>Like many of the decisions taken by this Government so far as the Cork region is concerned, the decision not to go ahead with a commitment given by a Fianna Fáil Government to relocate An Foras Forbartha in 55,000 square feet of office and laboratory space was a severe disappointment.  This project was first mooted in the 1960s when Clare Investments announced plans for a major development.  Power Securities became joint developers and planning permission was granted in November 1981.  It opened the way to what promised to be a huge centre city complex and the corporation's concern to get the project under way as soon as possible was expressed on many occasions.  I lay the blame for the decision of Power Securities fairly and squarely on the Coalition Government.  They have reneged on a firm commitment given by a Fianna Fáil Government to pre-let half of the office space for use by An Foras Forbartha.  It was also to include the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the Office of Public Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question has already been raised as to what this Government intend to do in the Cork area.  This is another glaring example of their gross neglect of Cork which has been highlighted on a number of occasions recently.  One would imagine with the representation of the Coalition parties in the Cork city and county area &mdash; they have 12 seats out of 20 &mdash; that more would be done for the county.  It appears their attitude is to let things slide because they have such a large number <Col N="1444" /> of seats.  Are the voices of our colleagues in Fine Gael and Labour being heard by this Government?  Have they any influence on the decisions being made regarding the Cork area?</P>
    <P>It is obvious with each passing day and week that this Government are determined to downgrade the Cork area, to do as much harm to it as they can, either by their own actions or in collusion with some of the semi-State bodies.  Let us take the example of B &amp; I.  Now we have no sea link with Britain, as we pointed out last week.  Trade, commerce, tourism and industrial development in the area have been thrown to the wind by this Government.  We were fortunate to get a warning from a source outside this country that another semi-State body was attempting to downgrade Cork in the matter of Cork Airport and the schedule of flights by Aer Lingus out of Cork to Europe and to Britain.  The treatment being meted out to this area by the Government is becoming unbearable. People are becoming infuriated by the actions of the Government.  I call on the Government now to stand by the commitment given by Fianna Fáil and to give some priority to the Cork area in the matter of employment, particularly in the construction industry.</P>
    <P>Everyone knows that unemployment is rising so rapidly that the numbers are barely off the press when they have to be readjusted upwards.  In common with the rest of the country Cork is suffering also. To add insult to injury, the Government parties have 12 Deputies out of 20 in the Cork area who are allowing this state of affairs to continue.  For £1 million progress was stopped on the deep water berth at Ringaskiddy.  That would have given employment to 200 people and there would have been more jobs in the service industries.  The construction industry is one of the most labour-intensive industries. We have natural resources in our quarries and in our gravel and sand pits and many firms were organised to prepare and supply the basic requirements for development work in the construction industry.  With regard to the gas pipeline, a Cork firm prepared the pipeline and carried out certain treatment works.  I <Col N="1445" /> have learned that similar work in preparation for natural gas in Dublin will be done by a firm from outside the country. I should like the Minister to investigate this matter.  This is something I heard but I have not got authentic confirmation of it.</P>
    <P>In the budget the Government deferred the expenditure of £120 million estimated for projects in the economic and productive infrastructural categories. What about the proposed enlarged carriageway along Merchants Quay, which is now a restricted three-lane carriageway?  Would some of the £120 million have been spent on that? Why has the IDA's allocation been cut by £6 million?  Why was the decentralisation programme cancelled to save £5 million?  Will they continuously add to the 10,000 people unemployed in the Cork area?</P>
    <P>If the Minister of State, for political reasons, does not wish to have An Foras Forbartha in Cork, will he and the Minister endeavour to secure some alternative so that the complex can proceed and give badly-needed employment in the Cork area?  I should like the Minister to tell me why this development was scuttled. Will he assure me that every effort will be made to ensure the successful completion of this complex?</P>
    <P>I have already outlined the many projects and decisions taken by the Government which downgraded and set aside the Cork area.  What spite, if that is the correct word, have the Government against the Cork area?  After the debate last week on the B &amp; I and our raising of this matter tonight, for which I thank the Ceann Comhairle, I hope it will be brought home to the Government that the 12 seats they hold out of the 20 in the Cork area are on a sandy foundation and will continue to be if they carry on with this charade.  The Government may think it does not matter because they will not be looking for votes for four or five years, but if they continue the way they are going it will be months rather than years.</P>
    <P>I should like to give some of my time to my colleague, Deputy Wallace.  The Minister should make every effort to find some alternative to An Foras Forbartha <Col N="1446" /> so that the complex can go ahead.  The relocation of An Foras Forbartha in Cork was the reason Power Securities pulled out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>This is my first contribution to the House, but it is a sad occasion as I think of the treatment which my constituency, city and county, have received from this Government.  The decision by Power Securities to pull out of the investment at Merchants Quay is a major disaster for Cork and the county in so far as the confidence of investors is at a low ebb.  The previous Government took decisions and made commitments about this development.  The present Government have reversed a very important decision which had been made in this area.  An Foras Forbartha are not coming to Cork.  This decision was taken by them because they did not want to go to Cork. Who is running the country and making the decisions?</P>
      <P>On national average we have the highest unemployment rate in Cork.  I do not know if the Minister is aware of that.  The construction industry in Cork has been the worst hit industry in the country.  Are the Government aware of that?  What was taken into consideration when this decision was made?  Was it because it was located in a certain Minister's constituency and it did not suit him that it should be transferred to Cork?  Do they realise the setback that has been created by this small-minded decision?  The seriousness of it has not been brought home to the Minister or his colleagues.  We had the case of the B &amp; I, East Cork Foods, Aer Lingus and now Power Securities.  As regards the B &amp; I, the Minister tried to get an alternative route out of Cork.  East Cork Foods closed down and another Minister is trying to start up something to keep them going.  The Aer Lingus operation is being run down in Cork.  When we have industries and services why not pay attention to them instead of seeking alternatives when they get into difficulty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Decentralisation should be given priority by the Government.  Dublin cannot accommodate its large population.  An Foras Forbartha did not want to move to Cork.  I do not understand why.  They <Col N="1447" /> were supposed to go to Fota but they got out of that.  When will the Government face up to their responsibilities and take decisions in the national interest rather than in the local interest?</P>
    <P>The trade unions in Cork have expressed dismay at the Government's decision.  Did they look at the advantages to Cork and the surrounding areas?  We hear much talk about employment.  Here was an opportunity to do something about that in the Cork area but the Government made a major blunder and allowed people to dictate to them.  If gardaí or members of the Defence Forces are transferred they have no say in the matter.  They just go.</P>
    <P>The Government should govern on behalf of the people and face up to the issues.  They should face up to the issues because they have made a major blunder here on behalf of Cork.  I appeal to the Minister before it is too late and before our confidence is eroded further to please reverse the decision he has taken, not alone in the interests of Cork but in the national interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the chance to clarify my position and that of the Government in regard to the issue of the relocation of An Foras Forbartha in the development which was planned by Power Securities for Merchants Quay in Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government decided in May 1981 that the institute should be decentralised to the Cork development but no steps were taken to give effect to that commitment. There never was a commitment by An Foras Forbartha to a booking in the development and there is no question, therefore, of reneging on any commitment. Following the Government decision to which I refer, it was conveyed by the then Minister to the board of An Foras that the institute should proceed to make the necessary booking and that the necessary planning should be undertaken. Negotiations were opened by the institute with the company and the Department were kept advised of the progress of these.  Finally, the Department were advised by the board of An <Col N="1448" /> Foras on 7 September 1982 that the institute were ready to go ahead and enter a pre-let agreement with the company in respect of 35,000 square feet of office space on certain conditions, one being that the necessary finance would be assured.  The estimated cost of the move was put at £2.5 million for the first year and £355,000 over and above the normal operating cost each year after that.  Nothing was done by the Government to give the necessary assurance or to make any financial provision to meet the heavy costs involved and, in the circumstances, no action could be taken by An Foras to proceed with the booking.  I inherited that situation.</P>
    <P>Another condition on which the board of An Foras sought clarification from the Minister before they could proceed related to the position of An Foras staff. Understandably, the opposition within An Foras to an arbitrary relocation from Dublin to Cork was strong and widespread. While the Minister of the time was following the line that there was a definite relocation decision and that the staff would have to live with that, assurances were being given outside that there would be no forced relocation.  The Government decision of May 1981 provided that special consideration should be given to individual members of the staff of An Foras who did not want to relocate but no expression was ever given to the special consideration and no offer by way of special consideration was ever made to the staff.  Indeed, no effort was ever made to come to terms with the clear and understandable opposition of the staff to being shifted to Cork without any regard as to whether they wanted to go, were willing to go or if they would go.</P>
    <P>The position as I found it was that there had been a Government decision in May 1981 that An Foras should be relocated to the development in Cork and the company concerned was advised by the Minister of this decision, but nothing effective was done to bring that decision to reality.  In particular, nothing was done to ensure the necessary financial commitments were made or to get the agreement of An Foras staff to the relocation on some reasonable basis.  If there ever was <Col N="1449" /> an intention to move the institute to Cork, it was a paper decision.  It was the previous Government who made this decision and failed to deliver on it.  It follows that there is very little credibility to the position being taken up this evening by the Deputies.  I would like to stress that a decision by Power Securities to withdraw from the development at this stage cannot be put down to any decision of mine.  I have not announced any final decision.  I have been reviewing the situation created by this very difficult, not to say impossible, legacy from the previous Government and trying to see whether there might be any way forward.</P>
    <P>The practical difficulties and the very substantial cost and the completely unresolved issue of staff opposition cannot but raise serious questions as to whether this was ever a practicable or seriously intended proposal.  It was rather ironic that, on the very day An Bord Pleanála gave the final approval of the planning permission for this development, this decision was announced by Power Securities. It is difficult to sustain the view that the viability of this huge project with its massive shopping and other provisions depended critically on the question of An Foras booking.  The amount of accommodation which An Foras would have required, based on their own assessment of requirements during negotiations, was 35,000 square feet or less than one quarter of the total office space planned. It is clear that An Foras scheme, to be practicable, would have been but one element and a relatively small one in the economics of a project of this scale.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs had a commitment to renting 25,000 square feet.  If the shadow which has fallen on the Cork project is blamed on An Foras it is because the previous Government made a decision on which they did not or could not deliver.  I reject any suggestion that this Government have brought on the difficulties.  I naturally share the concern over the withdrawal of the company.  It <Col N="1450" /> is clear, however, from reports that there is still interest in Cork which remain hopeful that the project can still go ahead, perhaps with modification or different phasing.  I am glad that the corporation still have a positive and helpful attitude towards the efforts and are expected to help to bring this about.  I hope their efforts will be successful.</P>
    <P>This Government will do all they can to help in dealing with the problems in Cork city, economic and unemployment problems and the need for urban regeneration. I believe the city and its surrounding development areas have a major part to play in the new efforts that are needed, not only to generate more development overall but to do something about the extent of migration to Dublin with all the problems which that causes, both in the capital and in the areas which are being depopulated.  I have just made a grant allocation of £350,000 to the corporation to enable better progress to be made in dealing with youth unemployment while at the same time helping to improve the appearance of the city by means of environmental works.  The Cork high level area water supply improvement scheme, which has been approved at an estimated cost of £2 million approximately, will service the industrial estate development at Kilbarry as well as serving other developments. The first phase of the new main drainage interceptor sewer is also expected to proceed. The 1983 capital allocation for roads and housing will be notified to the corporation in the near future and these allocations will reflect the needs of the city to the maximum extent possible.  In relation to Deputy Lyons's point regarding the gas pipeline, I have no information on that at present but I will contact him if necessary because I have the same interest as he has in making sure that Irish companies get any available employment.</P>

      <P>Legislation, rather than regulations, <Col N="1235" /> would probably be required to give statutory authority for the placing of speed ramps on public roads.  Some interest has been expressed in the provision of these ramps in residential areas and I am at present considering the pros and cons, in the context of the entire range of measures which may be desirable to improve road safety in such areas.  An important practical consideration is whether, if authorised, use of speed ramps could be contained in a reasonable manner.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the administration of the Industrial Development Authority's small industry programme is undertaken by its Small Industries Division which is located at its headquarters in Dublin.  At present there are 49 staff engaged exclusively in the promotion of small industries.  The direct cost to the IDA for salaries, travelling expenses, advertising, consultancy in respect of small industry activity was £884,000 in 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Small Industries Division carries out its function of promoting small manufacturing businesses in conjunction with the county development officers and where necessary with the IDA's regional managers and staff.  It was recently decided by the Government that a small industry specialist should be assigned to each of the IDA's Regional Offices (excluding the mid-west for which <Col N="1246" /> SFADCo has responsibility) with responsibility for the general development of small firms.  Arrangements are now being made to implement this decision.</P>
    <P>Shannon Free Airport Development Company Ltd. which is charged with responsibility for the intensive development of small indigenous industry in the mid-west region and in west and southwest Offaly, has 24 people engaged in the promotion of small industry.

    <P>From 1955/56 to 1973/74 inclusive, the allowances assumed for the married man were the married allowance, child allowance for two children not over 11 years of age and earned income relief. For the same period the allowances assumed for the single person were the single allowance plus earned income relief.  Earned income relief was abolished with effect from 6 April 1974.</P>
    <P>From 1979/80 onwards the single, married and child allowances have been augmented by the addition of the Special Employment Deduction (PAYE allowance).</P>
    <P>For 1982/83 account has been taken of the PRSI allowance of £312.  As regards column (a), for each of the years 1955-56 to 1967-68, the effective exemption limits (married and child allowances together with related earned income relief) exceeded the average industrial earnings for male workers.  This is reflected in the figures for those years in that column.</P>
    <P>(ii)Average male industrial earnings:</P>
    <P>Up to and including 1968/69 average industrial earnings relate to males of 18 years of age or over employed in transportable goods industries and are based on the amounts earned in a week in October of each year.  Owing to a change in the method of collection and classification of the amounts of such earnings, the earnings from 1969/70 onwards relate to a male of 21 years of age or over and are based on quarterly figures which have been averaged for each tax year shown in the table.</P>
    <P>Up to and including 1973/74 the earnings figures are derived from the annual censuses of industrial production.  For subsequent years, the earnings are based on the new NACE system of industrial classification (General Classification of Economic Activities within the European Communities).</P>
    <P>Column (d)/(e):</P>
    <P>The 38.5 per cent standard rate of income tax which is shown for 1975/76 and 1976/77 is comprised of the standard rate of 35 per cent plus the temporary 10 per cent surcharge which applied to all income tax rates for those years except the first rate.  There is no apparent difference between the questions at (d) and (e).  Consequently, the relevant information is given under one heading, (d)/(e), in the table.</P>
    <P>Column (f):</P>
    <P>Effective rate of income tax:</P>
    <P>This is the average effective rate of tax levied on each pound of Actual Income as defined in the Revenue Commissioners' Annual Reports.</P>
    <P>The latest available information is that contained in Table 76 of the report for year ended 31 December 1980 copies of which are in the library.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1261" /> Column (g):</P>
    <P>(i)  PAYE was introduced with effect from October 1960.  It applied at that time to all employees except those for whom a statutory tax deduction scheme was already in operation (public servants, officials of Bank of Ireland, etc.)  PAYE was extended to all employees as from the year 1976-77.  For years prior to 1976-77 tax payments in respect of all persons (including public servants) taxed under Schedule E have been taken into account.</P>
    <P>A breakdown of the net receipt of income tax attributable to Schedule E is not available for years up to and including 1962-63.  For these years the estimated net produce of that tax has been used.  Net produce of tax is the estimated ultimate yield from the tax assessed in the year, whether actually collected in that year or later, after deducting all discharges and remissions and setting off all repayments.  For years between 1963-64 and 1976 it is possible to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the net receipt of Schedule E tax using actual figures of tax payments under PAYE.  The net receipt figures for PAYE for years subsequent to 1976 are separately distinguished from other tax receipts in the collection process.</P>
    <P>The amounts shown in column are obtained by dividing the net receipt or net produce, as the case may be, by the number of persons shown for the corresponding tax year in column (h).</P>
    <P>(ii)  The reduction in income tax paid in 1960/61 is attributable to the abatement estimated at over £4 million given under section 14 of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1959.</P>
    <P>Column (h):</P>
    <P>The numbers shown in this column are the numbers of taxpayers estimated to be effectively liable to tax under Schedule E up to and including the year 1975-76 and those liable under PAYE in subsequent tax years.</P>

      <P>The following is the information requested:&mdash; (a) 43,700; (b) £549 (for 1982); (c) Not available.</P>
      <P>Notes: (a) The number of farmers assessed to tax on their farming profits in the current income tax year, 1982/83, comprises some 35,800 fulltime farmers together with a further 7,900 (approximately) farmers who or whose spouses carry on another trade or business.  (b) It is estimated that the receipt from farm income taxation in 1982 amounted to £24 million.  This sum divided by the number of farmers assessed (43,700) gives the average payment quoted in the reply. Income tax on farming profits is collected with Schedule D tax generally and because of this cannot be separately distinguished. Accordingly the figure of £24 million is an estimate.  Statistics of revenue receipts are, in general, prepared on a calendar (financial) year basis and it is for that reason that the 1982 estimate of receipts is used in calculating the figure at (b) in the reply.  (c) Revenue records do not distinguish between liable and non-liable cases and therefore it is not possible to indicate how many farmers actually paid income tax without examining each individual case assessed.  Such an examination &mdash; which would involve more than 43,000 cases &mdash; could not be carried out without the expenditure of undue time and resources.</P>

    <P>Notes: The decrease in the amount of penalties for the years 1981 and 1982 was due to the fact that district courts questioned the validity of proceedings where a cumulative penalty was sought in the case of a continuing offence.  Thereafter, penalties in fixed amounts (subject to a maximum of £500) were sought.  These maximum penalties were raised to £800 by section 60 of the Finance Act, 1982.</P>
    <P>The Figures in column 2 relate to the number of proceedings commenced in the year even though they may not have been brought to hearing in that year.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance (1) the number of enforcement actions that have been initiated to recover unpaid taxes; (2) the sum of money involved; and (3) the amount of tax recovered in each tax category in respect of the tax years 1979, 1980, 1981 and 1982.</P>

      <P>The information requested is not available in respect of tax years.  Individual enforcement actions may involve several items of default involving different years.  The available statistics, which are given in the attached table, show the enforcement actions initiated and the yield in the years in question.  The actions and the yield are not directly related as there is a time-lag between initiation and yield.</P>
      <P>Figures for court action for VAT and PAYE/PRSI in 1979 and 1980 are not readily available.</P>
      <P>In relation to the capital taxes (Capital Acquisitions Tax, Estate Duty, Wealth Tax and Capital Gains Tax), there are at present 388 cases proceeding in the courts for enforcement of unpaid taxes.  The records which are kept in connection with these taxes would not be adequate to furnish the information requested without a considerable amount of official time being devoted to the necessary analysis.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the amount of taxation collected on time and the amount collected late in respect of the tax years 1981-82, 1980-81, 1979-80 and 1978-79 under each of the tax categories.</P>

      <P>The information requested is given in the attached table.  There are some qualifications.</P>
      <P>For VAT and PAYE-PRSI &ldquo;on time&rdquo; is taken to refer to paid within the relevant year.  Some payments on time on this basis would be late by strict reference to their two-monthly or monthly due dates.</P>
      <P>The due dates for payment of income tax other than PAYE vary to some extent because of appeal procedures and the varying dates on which tax on additional and late assessments is due.  In these circumstances, an arbitrary single date has been adopted for such income tax purposes viz. the due date for the second instalment¹ plus period of grace as marking the limit of &ldquo;on time&rdquo;.  The figures for such income tax are therefore illustrative.</P>
      <P>In the case of corporation tax the date the tax becomes due and payable is determined by the accounting period of the company or the date the tax is assessed, depending on the time of incidence of either of these events.  It is not possible to provide any information on how much of the receipt was received on time and how much was received late, without extensive analysis of individual cases.</P>
      <P>Capital Acquisitions Tax, Estate Duty, Capital Gains Tax and Wealth Tax become/became payable on a variety of due dates depending on various factors. Accordingly it is not possible to supply the information requested as records are not kept in such a manner as to enable this to be done.</P>
      <P>¹For 1978 and 1979, this related to all self-employed, and for subsequent years to full-time farmers only.</P>

    <P>His recorded earnings in the 1980-1981 contribution year only entitled him to pay-related benefit of 8p a week.  However, following protracted inquiries it has recently been established that he had further reckonable earnings which entitled him to increased pay-related benefit <Col N="1308" /> of £8.58 up to the 156th day of benefit, £6.44 for the next 78 days of benefit and £5.36 for the next phase commencing on 26 February 1983.</P>

      <P>One of the conditions for receipt of a retirement pension under Irish Legislation requires the person concerned to have a yearly average of not less than 24 qualifying contributions from 5 January 1953 to 5 April 1982.  His Irish insurance record is not sufficient to give him the minimum yearly average required to enable him to qualify for pension. He does however under EEC Regulations qualify for a pro-rata rate pension on the basis of his combined Irish and British insurance records since 5 January 1953.  This has been awarded to him at the weekly rate of £20.85 from 7 October 1982.  A pension book containing orders valid for payment from 24 February 1983 has been issued to the designated post office for collection by him and he has been notified accordingly.  The arrears due for the period from 7 October 1982 to 23 February 1983 have been issued to him separately.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The conditions for receipt of full rate old age contributory pension require a claimant to have contributions paid in respect of not less than 156 weeks of insurable employment since entry into insurance under the Social Welfare Acts and to have a yearly average of at least 48 paid or credited contributions from the beginning of the 1953-54 contribution year, or year of entry into insurance if this occurred after 1953-54, to the end of the last complete contribution year before attaining pension age of 66 years. A yearly average of 48 provides for payment at the maximum rate; persons with yearly averages of from 20 to 47 contributions are entitled to pension at varying reduced rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned attained age 66 years on 1 April 1982 and was awarded an old age contributory pension on the basis of yearly average of 47 paid and credited contributions over the period from the 1971-72 contribution year, when she entered into insurance under the Social Welfare Acts, to 5 April 1981.  The pension was subsequently withdrawn when a check of her insurance record showed that she had paid contributions in respect of a total of only 155 weeks of insurable employment since 1971-72.  Her previous record of insurance under the former National Health Insurance Acts can be taken into account in order to satisfy the 156 paid contributions condition but if this is done then, in accordance with the regulations, her yearly average must be calculated over the 28 year period from 1953-54 to 5 April 1981.  The yearly average over this period is 20 contributions for which the weekly rate of old age contributory pension is £37.25 or 30p more than the rate of widow's contributory pension which she is receiving at present.  She is also in receipt of £2.70 <Col N="1311" /> per week living alone allowance which would, of course, continue.</P>
    <P>However, if she were to transfer from the widow's contributory pension she would forfeit the automatic entitlement which recipients of this pension have to weekly free fuel vouchers, currently valued at £4 each.  As an old age contributory pension recipient she would obtain free fuel vouchers from her local health centre only if she satisifed a means test.</P>
    <P>The position will be explained to the pensioner and if she wishes to transfer to an old age contibutory pension the necessary arrangmenets will be made.</P>
