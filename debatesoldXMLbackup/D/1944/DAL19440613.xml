      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Agriculture being the mainstay of our economy here, I suppose it was natural that it should occupy the most prominent and most important place in a debate on the Budget, this year or in any other year. Already this year, in the last Dáil, considerable time was given to debates on agriculture, but we do not seem to have gone anywhere near exhausting the subject.</P>
      <P>I am not an authority on agriculture. I cannot attempt to answer technicians or experienced agriculturists such as we have here, on some of the matters they raised in the course of the discussion on the Finance Bill yesterday. But, of course, as Minister for Finance and as an ordinary citizen with, perhaps, some intelligence and a little experience of life in Ireland and its needs, I am deeply interested in agriculture and in the welfare of agriculturists. Generally speaking, in the economy of this country, if agriculture is prosperous we are all prosperous, and if agriculture is on the down grade we all feel the pinch.  Whether it be the professional classes, the labouring classes or the shopkeepers, all feel the pinch if agriculture is in a bad way. I do not believe that it is in a bad way at present.  Far from that, I think it is, modestly speaking, in a good way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="224" /> All the indications that I can get from any source point to the fact that agriculturists are not in anything that could be described as a sad position, a bad position or a dangerous position. One of the best possible indications is the financial position of the agricultural community, as indicated by the bank returns.  I believe I can get reliable information on that point, though the banks are not at all anxious to disclose anybody's position and will not give any information with regard to any individual's financial position. Neither do they like to disclose much with regard to classes.  However, any figures that I can get go to show that the advances from the banks to the farming community went down by about 35 per cent. from the beginning of the war up to last December, the end of the calendar year; while the deposits by the farming community in the banks went up by an even greater percentage. That in itself would indicate that the farming community are not badly off at present, to put it mildly, and that is very comforting.  I would like to see them better off.  The better off they are, the better for everybody.  If they were in a bad position financially, there would be demands on the Agricultural Credit Corporation for advances; there are practically none.  There is no business doing in that respect, though the rate of interest has been lowered considerably since the beginning of the war.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Both are affected by the war.  That is one thing that I think, in all fairness, Deputies speaking on a matter of this kind ought to preface their remarks by saying: &ldquo;We know there is a war situation.&rdquo;  Nobody did that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy did.  I did not hear him.  If he says he did, I will accept his word. Industry is vitally affected; the fact that we cannot get supplies of many kinds of things essential for industry has thrown thousands out of employment and before this war ends there will be many more thrown out of employment.  Agriculture is not in the flourishing condition that it was in during the last war because we are not getting anything like the prices we got then for our stuff.  Nobody tries to hide that&mdash;we could not even if we tried.  But it is not correct, I respectfully suggest, to put forward the idea that agriculture is in a decaying condition. It is not, according to any of the indications that I in my capacity as Minister for Finance can find.  I am interested, as an ordinary citizen, as a Deputy representing a city constituency, but particularly as Minister for Finance, in agriculture; I am interested in the welfare of the people connected with agriculture; I am interested in the welfare of the country as a whole, and anything that I, as Minister for Finance&mdash;and speaking on behalf of the Government&mdash;can do to help agriculturists now or at any other time to become more prosperous, more efficient, better able to derive a living from the land, will be done and done with pleasure, finding money if necessary for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hughes and others said yesterday and on previous occassions that we will have difficult times after the war.  I believe that is true, that a period of depression is bound to come, and anything that can be done to provide for the rainy day should be done by any Government that has the interests of the people as a whole at heart, as this Government has.  If <Col N="226" /> there is any constructive suggestion to come from any quarter of the House as to the things we should do to make provision for the depression that is almost certain to follow for a few years after the war, now is the time to make that suggestion, to make the necessary provision, to look ahead.  As Minister for Finance I am prepared sympathetically to consider any suggestion, any proposition of a constructive nature, that will help us and the agricultural community&mdash;the country as a whole&mdash;to meet that depression when it comes and be able to face up to it.  It is not that there is any want of will or want of desire to provide whatever is necessary to help the agriculturist to become a better farmer or a more efficient worker, whether he be a farmer or an agricultural labourer.  As regards research work, I would like to see more of it done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is very little being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>It might surprise the Deputy to know that I read the whole of the article on soil analysis that he referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The author of it happens to be a personal friend of mine and I am interested in his work and in the subject of soil analysis as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to have anything done about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Something is being done all the time.  To start at any time an analysis of the soils of this country is a wise and proper thing, but it will take decades to get it completed. Not alone will you have to get an analysis of the soil and arrive at conclusions about the soil possibilities of the various counties and of all the parishes in the country, but eventually you may have to come down to every farm, and maybe every field, if you want to do the thing properly, efficiently and scientifically.  That will take a long time and involve a very big staff, and the very Deputies who are clamouring for it are the Deputies <Col N="227" /> who will be most vocal about increasing the Civil Service.  You cannot make a soil survey without employing hundreds of workers.  If you want it done in five years&mdash;this is only a shot in the dark&mdash;you might have to employ 200 or 300 officials.  If you want it done in 10 years you might reduce that number by half, but in any event it will require a very large staff no matter what period you may suggest.  If you suggest a period of 20 years, that may seem too long.  Nowadays we like to get things done in a hurry.  Even 10 years might seem too long a time to get a job of that kind completed, but it would require a staff of 400 or 500 people to get the soil survey carried out in 10 years, and I dare say Deputy Hughes will be one of the very first to become vocal and noisy about enormous increases in the numbers and the cost of the Civil Service.  You cannot get work of that kind done by the State without providing a large staff.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cogan wants a model farm in every district&mdash;not in every county. Imagine the numbers of civil servants who will be required to supervise the running of these farms.  If he had his way, Deputy Cogan, in that one item alone, without taking into consideration all the other schemes he would like to see operated by the Government, would add thousands of individuals to those already in the State service. Just imagine the hundreds of thousands of pounds that that would add to the annual Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The farmers would pay something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy would be the first to say, when the next Budget is presented, &ldquo;Look at the way the Civil Service has increased.&rdquo; Deputy Hughes and Deputy Cogan are no different from most other people in the House in that regard.  From every side of the House, my own side included, scarcely a day passes that I do not get suggestions about schemes of various sorts.  No doubt the schemes themselves are quite good.  I am not saying anything against Deputy Cogan's scheme or the scheme suggested by <Col N="228" /> Deputy Hughes about soil analysis. These schemes are excellent in themselves, no doubt, but they would need staff and money.  All I would say to Deputies who advocate schemes of that kind is: &ldquo;Do not forget when you are advocating those schemes that the day will come when you will have to pay for them and you will have to put up with an increase in the number of civil servants and with the increased cost that will be involved.&rdquo;  There has been a considerable increase in the numbers and in the cost of the Civil Service since this Government came into office.  I do not deny that; I actually set it out in the Budget each year, giving the figures representing the exact cost.  I want the House to realise how heavy the cost is and that every time Deputies clamour for new schemes and additional social services it means extra staff and involves the expenditure of more money.  You cannot get away from that.</P>
      <P>Since 1932 we have increased the services that affect all classes of the community.  Every class has benefited in some way or other out of State expenditure.  Instead of hiding it, I set out the details in the most elaborate way possible in the Budget to tell the Deputies of all Parties and to tell the country what we are doing. I tried to make my Budget statement a purely objective analysis of our financial and economic position.  If there are items in it that tell against the Government, so be it.  I want to let the Dáil and the country know exactly what our position is and let us face up to the consequences.  I did that this time and I will do it again if I am still Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that the bill is a big, heavy burden for running this State &mdash; £50,000,000.  It is an enormous bill, an enormous tax, an enormous burden on the backs of our people and on the backs of the agricultural community as well as every other class, but no greater on the agriculturists than on others.  We all bear it.  There is more done for the agriculturists as a class than for any other class in the community. There is more money directly <Col N="229" /> paid out of the State's purse to help the agricultural community&mdash;and it is proper that that should be so.  I am not saying that it is wrong.  Not at all.  On the contrary, I would like to see more money put into agriculture, if we had it.  But do not let anybody say that agriculture is not being spoon-fed. It is, to the extent of millions and again I say, rightly so.  It is the foundation of our economy and we should do everything we can to nurse it.  There is no Party in this House&mdash; Farmers, Clann na Talmhan or Fine Gael, which Deputy Costello said yesterday was the Farmers' Party&mdash; that has agriculture at heart to a greater extent than we have and no Party has ever in the history of the country tried to do more or did more to help agriculture than we have done. The fact of the matter is that we are here in greater numbers than ever because of the votes of the farmers. That is why we are here in such numbers, so successfully.  They have stood to us as no other class has stood to us.  We would not be a Government to-day if we had not the farmers.  They realise that they have good friends in this Government.</P>
    <P>I read before, and I will read again, a list of the subsidies, direct and indirect, that are given to agriculture. The first item in the list that I had made out some years ago is the Estimate for Agriculture.  In this financial year it is £1,267,000.  That is a big bill to run the Department of Agriculture. That Department has numerous officials, every one of whom is engaged in some way or another to help the agriculturist.  But we can leave that out of the picture altogether because every Department must have its staff and every Department has its cost.  The Department of Agriculture is a very big and costly Department, having numerous officials and a staff of men as highly trained as you can get in any country in the world engaged in advising people on agriculture. At the head of that staff is a man who is second to none in knowledge of all branches of agriculture in this country, that is the Secretary of the Department.  I have personal experience of the value of that man to <Col N="230" /> us and to agriculture.  He is the chief adviser of the Minister and I doubt whether, if you were to search Ireland, you would get a better adviser for any Minister.  The Estimate this year for Agricultural Produce Subsidies and payments proposed from Price Stabilisation Fund is £1,095,000; Grants for Relief of Rates on land, £1,870,000. There is no grant for the relief of rates paid to any urban property owners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I will get the Deputy a long list if he wants it.  I say that £1,870,000 is properly paid.  I would like to see more paid to them. At any rate they are getting £1,870,000 to reduce their rates and no other class in the community gets money paid out of the Exchequer to reduce the rates on their property.  The estimated amount required to meet the deficiency in the Land Bond Fund arising from the reduction in the land annuities is £637,500.  The approximate amount which the farmers will receive from the Flour and Bread Subsidy is £1,440,000; Farm Improvement Scheme, £350,000; Seed and Lime Distribution Scheme, £95,000&mdash;last year it was £75,000; Improvement of Estates, £172,000&mdash;last year it was £191,000. All that makes a total of £6,926,000. If you add to that the amount of the annuities saved to the farmers by the halving of the annuities &mdash;£1,565,000&mdash;that is £8,491,000.  Leaving the £1,267,000 that is the cost of the Department of Agriculture, out of that, you have £7,200,000 annually paid directly out of the Exchequer into the pockets of the farmers.  That is a large sum of money even out of a Budget of £50,000,000.  I do not object to a penny of that and I think we could possibly with advantage devise schemes by which we could help farmers further.  I did not hear one constructive suggestion, except the suggestion of Deputy Cogan, to have model farms in every district.  That is the only suggestion of a constructive <Col N="231" /> nature made yesterday in the debate. We had Deputies, some of them speaking on behalf of the farmers, telling us that the farmers were in a bad way and ought to be helped.  I would not agree that Deputy Cogan's method is the best method.</P>

      <P>This State is not long in existence as States go.  It was founded in 1922 and the Government of the day had to face a very serious position.  Instead of being able to devote themselves entirely to constructive effort to help the country, unfortunately, they had to face a situation which meant life or death for the State.  An effort was being made at that time to try to put that State out of existence.  It did not succeed. The effort was made by honest, God-fearing men, who believed they were right.  I was one of them.  I am not a bit ashamed of what happened then, not a bit.  Unfortunately it happened so and the Government of the day had to face that situation and the aftermath of that situation for a number of years. They were unable to devote the attention that they might have given to constructive effort to lift up the country agriculturally and economically.  That is a fact of history that historians will analyse and describe for us later, but we need not go into it now.  We all know what happened and the fact is that the Government had a difficult time for a number of years.  When this Government came in we had a difficult time&mdash; a very difficult time&mdash;we had another kind of fight on hands, but a fight as vital for the economic and political <Col N="232" /> welfare of this country as any other fight that was made.</P>
      <P>The two Governments then have had difficult times.  I do not think anybody in this House will deny that we have been going through abnormal and difficult times during the last Government's period of office and during this Government's period of office.  I do not hesitate to say that the last Government, at any rate in its first five or six years, in the way of doing constructive work were up against severe obstacles that they were not able to overcome. They were not able to do the constructive work they might have done.  That was not entirely their fault.  Similarly, this Government had what Deputy Keating reminds us is called the economic war.  That had only just ended in 1938 and an agreement was made which saved £100,000,000 for the farmers, without talking of other things; £90,000,000 at any rate; £100,000,000, less £10,000,000 that we agreed to pay&mdash;that is putting a modest figure upon it&mdash;saved to the farmers alone, along with other things perhaps of more vital national importance that could not be measured in money.  That period of strife was only just completed when the Great War started and, in less than a year, we were again into another abnormal situation in which we find ourselves still.</P>
      <P>I am not offering that in any way as an excuse for not doing things that we might have done.  But I think that anybody, sitting down calmly and quietly and trying to look at the situation here in an objective way, will realise that in our short history as a State we have gone through very abnormal times.  It has not been easy for anybody.  What will probably in history be termed the Cosgrave régime and the de Valera régime have gone through difficult times and we have come marvellously well out of them.  I am only talking now from the point of view of agriculture.  I am not going into higher politics, about the way that we have come out of the difficult times during this war so far. But, purely from the agricultural point of view, we have a lot to be proud of in respect of the way this country has survived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="233" /> If the war ends inside another year, as many hope it will&mdash;I hope to God it does, if not sooner; nobody knows when it will end&mdash;I hope that we will be in a position to start off with the prospect of making this country really prosperous and its people happy and contented.  There is no reason why we should not.  We have good fertile soil that has probably never been worked to full advantage.  Our history of the last four years has shown us how the people stand up to sacrifices when they are asked to make them; how they stand up to hardship and trials; how they put their backs into the work for the nation's good when they are asked to do so; and how they are able to bear heavy taxation and bear it willingly without grumbling. It has been shown to us that all we have to do is to ask the people, the farmers as well as others, to put their backs into the work and, for their own welfare and for the welfare of the nation as a whole, they will rise honourably to the occasion, as they have done during the war and at other times.  Judging by what we know of the recent history of the country the prospect for Ireland's future when peace arrives should be good.  Instead of grumbling and grousing, I think we should be quite happy and proud of the position in which we find ourselves, despite the fact that the cost of living has gone up abnormally and that many classes of the community find it difficult to live.  Food, clothes, boots, shelter, everything that man requires and that is essential for life, are difficult to obtain and, when you do obtain them, you have to pay through the nose for them.  That applies to all classes of the community; it applies to the farmers.  But, with all that, we have come through the trials magnificently so far and, with wise, prudent leadership in the days to come, first, until the end of the emergency and, secondly, after the emergency, in the period of development and progress that, please God, will lie before us when peace is restored, the brightest prospect I think can be held out for Ireland's future.</P>
    <P>Now with regard to details.  Deputy <Col N="234" /> Hughes wants to know the amount paid annually for sinking fund and interest on our debt.  That was published in a White Paper issued at the end of the financial year just before the Budget Statement.  The actual figures for the service of the debt last year were: interest, £2,175,614; sinking fund, £785,403; total, £2,961,017.  The estimate for the current year is: interest, £2,236,000; sinking fund, £864,000; total, £3,100,000.  These are very different figures from what the Deputy had in mind.  Deputy Hughes made a mistake when talking of the cost of administration as being something like £50,000,000.  I think he had something else in mind when he mentioned £50,000,000 as the cost of administration. The cost of administration, that is the cost of the Civil Service, of the staffs and of the administrative work done, as set out in the Budget Statement, was £6,866,000.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish talked about no special provision being made to meet the increased cost of living of civil servants, teachers, Gárda, etc.  It is proposed to spend this year, in round figures, £1,000,000 in paying bonuses to civil servants, national teachers, secondary teachers and Gárda, the actual figure being £989,000.  That is a considerable sum of money.  I know &mdash;nobody knows better&mdash;that civil servants, and particularly those in the minor offices, the lower-paid people, are feeling the pinch.</P>
    <P>It is true, as Deputy Costello, Deputy Corish and others said, that those with fixed salaries or wages have felt the pinch more than others.  There is no doubt about that, but these classes&mdash;civil servants, teachers and Guards&mdash;know that, at the end of the week or the end of the month, they will get their cheques.  There is no doubt that their jobs will continue. They are in that sound position, although in some cases the cheque may not be very big and it is very hard to balance the budget if the family is large.  Nevertheless, they are not in the position of the thousands of men and women who have been thrown out of employment as a result of the emergency, or of the many more who, it is almost a certainty, will be thrown <Col N="235" /> out of employment between now and the end of the emergency.  These classes are certain that their jobs will continue, that their pensions will be paid if they reach the pensionable age and that they will have, at any rate, a certain sum to meet the expenses of the following week, month or quarter, as the case may be.  They are in a much more advantageous position than so many other classes of workers, but I do want publicly to acknowledge and admit that some of these people have been bearing a heavy burden. They have made a very heavy sacrifice in the interests of the community. They have been called on to make that sacrifice and they have made it without much grumbling.</P>
    <P>Naturally they have complained. They have come on deputations to me and have put it to me that the Government is asking them to bear too heavy a burden.  Civil servants have said that to me formally in deputations and many of them privately, during the course of the last election and the previous election when I met them outside; but while I, as Minister who has to bear the responsibility for that burden, that sacrifice which I ask civil servants and other classes to make, acknowledge that the sacrifice is heavy, that the burden is no light one, I say that, taking all in all, compared with other classes of the community, these people who are in permanent posts have a lot to be thankful for.  If anything further can be done to lighten the burden, to make it a little easier for them, I should be glad to do it.  This year, as I have said, we are spending £1,000,000 in the way of emergency bonus.  When you divide that amongst members of the civil service alone, it does not represent a very big sum for each individual or each individual family, but for the present I think it is as much as the national exchequer can afford.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes wanted to know the financial position of the Road Fund. After meeting all liabilities, it is estimated that the fund will have a credit balance of £397,000 on 31st March, 1945.  We propose to take £100,000 of that credit balance.</P>

      <P>Deputy Costello suggested that no attempt was being made to foster thrift.  I think he is scarcely correct in that suggestion. Almost from the time the State was set up, central and local savings committees were formed.  We paid their expenses and they did excellent work.  They promoted and encouraged the idea of thrift, especially among the young.  Two months ago, we initiated a new movement to encourage thrift.  We are spending a lot of money on advertising, through the radio, the newspapers and many other ways, the idea of thrift.  The cinema is being used and public buildings everywhere are being used to display advertisements designed to encourage thrift, and, as a matter of fact, the amounts which are pouring into the Post Office Savings Bank and the amounts spent on savings certificates are much greater than ever, so that it is not correct to say that we have ignored thrift and it value to the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Costello also spoke of Section 8 of the Bill and said he would like to see certain amendments.  We can discuss that on Committee Stage, but so far I do not feel inclined to lend a sympathetic ear to his suggestion. The Finance Act of 1942 contained a section allowing the Revenue Commissioners to make certain allowances for plant and machinery, and in this Bill we propose, at the request of the Revenue Commissioners, to widen and extend their powers, to allow them greater latitude, in making <Col N="237" /> allowances in connection with plant and machinery.  It was the Revenue Commissioners themselves who discovered that the powers they possessed under the 1942 Act were not sufficiently wide.  We intend to broaden them and to give them further powers to help industrialists who have helped the country during the emergency by the provision of goods which were necessary for the country's welfare and who, in order to do so, purchased machinery which will probably be of little value to them after the war.  We do realise that it is necessary to be generous, to treat generously these people who have served the country well, who have been thoughtful and helpful with regard to the country's interests, and the provision we are making in this Bill will, we hope, give the Revenue Commissioners greater powers in that regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes mentioned that the excess corporations profits tax yielded £4,000,000 a year.  What it yields is about £2,600,000.  All the corporation profit taxes yield about £4,000,000. The point made by Deputy Hughes and Deputy Dockrell, that, under Section 4, children's allowances will cost certain classes of income-tax payers with more than two children £1 per year, is true.  I see no way of avoiding it.  I will not say that it is impossible to do so, but, if I wanted to set up a scheme which would avoid that, it would cost the country and the individuals concerned a great deal more, because I would need to have an inordinate increase of staff to examine every children's allowance application, and to do that twice a year.  I have gone into it very carefully, and it would not be worth the cost.  Those who will have to bear that £1 are people who can well afford it; generally speaking, they are people whose income-tax will be paid at the higher rate.</P>

      <P>That has been thought of, but obstacles and difficulties have been found in that direction also.  Deputy Cogan mentioned that the farmers think their land is unjustly valued.  Why was it, therefore, that when the revaluation Bill was brought in three or four years ago the farmers generally objected very strongly to revaluation?  I should like to see revaluation.  I think Deputy Mulcahy would also like to see revaluation of the country as a whole.</P>

If there is any foundation for the farmers' claim that the land, in the majority of cases, is too highly valued, why not let it be revalued by experts, if we can get experts in this country?

      <P>No; I am not aware of that.  I am aware that, as long as I have been in the House, I have heard almost every year from people on different sides of the House &mdash;my own side as well as other sides&mdash; that the land is too highly valued, and that something should be done to remedy it.  We proposed a revaluation Bill.  I have no doubt that in many cases there would be an increase in valuation, perhaps with regard to buildings more than land.  There would be other places where the value of land would have gone down, but on the whole the farmers objected to revaluation. They still make the claim that the land is too highly valued, but they will not allow a revaluation.  That is not an honest attitude.</P>
      <P>There is one other point which occurs to me and it is in regard to children's allowances.  Deputy Dillon talked yesterday as if he were the <i>fons et origo</i> of the family allowances idea. There is nothing new in the family allowances idea as far as we are concerned here.  It has been discussed in Parliaments all over the world for the last 20 years.  The first I ever heard of it discussed here was not from Deputy Dillon; it was from Deputy Frank Aiken in this House.  I do not even know whether or not Deputy Dillon was a member of the House then.  I do not want to take one scintilla of the credit that is due to Deputy Dillon for his warm advocacy of that social measure.  I know he was enthusiastic about it, but it would have come in here if there never was a Deputy Dillon in the House.  It would have been put into operation if there never was a Deputy Dillon here.</P>

      <P>I think that applies to Deputy Dillon.  I simply want to <Col N="240" /> give the truth and, as I said earlier when I did not know he was in the House, I do not want to take any shade of credit from Deputy Dillon for his warm advocacy of this or any other social reform which he thinks desirable.  He did advocate it here, and his advocacy as Vice-President of Fine Gael did help to create an atmosphere which got that Bill the unanimous support of the House.  That much credit is due to Deputy Dillon, but it would have been brought in here and passed if Deputy Dillon never existed.  There were four members of the Cabinet enthusiastic on this subject.  I was not one of them.  They were at it for years before Deputy Dillon was heard of in public life.</P>

    <P>Maidir le Vóta 47&mdash;Meán-Oideachas&mdash; do méaduíodh an Bónus Éigeandála do Mheán-Oidí mar do rinneadh i gcás Oidí na mBun-Scol, agus meastar go gcosnóidh an méadú sin £21,400.  In ionad tuarastail na Meán-Oidí d'íoc go ráithiúil, mar ghníthear faoi láthair, tá socruithe go n-íocfar go míosúil iad ón ladh d'Abrán, 1944.  Isé an socrú sin is fáth le £20,000 den £49,000 de mhéadú i bhFo-Mhír B. Teastóidh an t-airgead sin chun tuarastail míosa d'íoc i ndeireadh Mhárta, 1945, in ionad a bhfágáil gan íoc, mar ba ghnáth, go dtí an aithbhliain airgeadais.</P>

    <P>Gidh go bhfuil laghdú ar an soláthar le haghaidh Scoláireacht (Fo-Mhír D), ní hionann é agus aon athrú do bheith ar pholasaí choiteann na Roinne ina dtaobh seo.  'Séard is príomh-abhar leis go bhfuil deireadh anois le breisuimhir scoláireacht do bronnadh i 1939, an uair ba lugha líon na ndalta ins na Coláistí Ullmhúcháin agus do socruíodh ar scoláireachtaí breise do thairgsint do dhaltaí as an bhFíor-Ghaeltacht ionnas go dtiocfadh siad sin chun na gColáistí Ullmhúcháin.</P>
    <P>Tabharfar faoi deara go bhfuil socruithe againn athbhunú do dhéanamh ar na Cúrsaí Speisialta Samhraidh i <Col N="245" /> nGaedhilg do Mheán-Oidí&mdash;Cúrsaí a bhí leighte ar lár ó 1939.</P>
    <P>£362,997 atáthar d'iarraidh do Vóta 48&mdash;Ceárd-Oideachas.  Tá £23,257 do mhéadú ghlan ansin, agus tá £22,237 den mhéadú ag teastáil mar gheall ar dheontaisí méaduithe do na Coistí Gairm-Oideachais.</P>
    <P>Táthar chun £7,960 de dheontas speisialta do thabhairt do Chóiste Chathrach Bhaile Átha Cliath d'obair Chomhairle le Leas Oige ins an bhliain seo chugainn.</P>
    <P>Tá socruithe ar Chúrsa Tréineála do bhunú d'Oidí Obair Adhmaid agus Foirgníochta.  Mairfidh an Cúrsa ó Dheireadh Fómhair, 1944, go Mheitheamh, 1946.  Meastar gur £1,958 an costas bheas leis seo go dtí 31adh Márta, 1945, agus gur £7,076 an costas iomlán.</P>
    <P>Bunófar Gearr-Chursaí Samhraidh, freisin, i mBiadh-Eolaíocht, in Eolaíocht Tuaithe agus i Matamaiticí Ceárdúla.</P>
    <P>An £54,816 atá measta do Vóta 49&mdash; Eolaíocht agus Ealadhain&mdash;tá sé £6,264 níos mó ná airgead vóta na bliana atá caithte.  An Breis-Bhónus Éigeandála is fáth le £963 den mhéadú.</P>
    <P>Chun leabhra do cheannach don Leabharlainn Náisiúnta tá £2,000 dhá sholáthar.  £2,100 an tsuim do hiarradh anuraidh.  Ba cheart dom a mhíniú gur £2,600 an gnáth-dheontas bliantúil a hiarrtaí roimh aimsir na hÉigeandála. Mar gheall ar bheith coigilteach, do laghduíodh sin go dtí £1,600 ach do méaduíodh sin go dtí £2,100 do bhliain a 1943-44.  Tá sé curtha in iúl dúinn ag an Stiúrthóir gur ró-ghann £1,600 de dheontas bliantúil le haghaidh riachtanais na Leabharlainne agus tá socruithe ar a mhéadú go £2,000.</P>
    <P>I bhFo-Mhír A. 7. tá soláthar nach raibh ann ariamh go dtí seo&mdash;soláthar chun neithe do cheannach do Mhúséum na nArmas.  Tá an Múséum seo in Oifig na nGeinealach faoi láthair, agus ba é an <i>Ulster King of Arms</i> do bhunuigh é.  Táthar ag brath cur leis an gcnuasach spéisiúil armas, etc. do réir mar bheas caoithe oiriúnacha ann lena aghaidh sin.</P>
    <P>An £1,345 atá dhá sholáthar chun Mion-scannáin do dhéanamh de thuarascbhála <Col N="246" /> Oifig na nGeinealach, do thárla ins an meastachán seo é ar an abhar nár críochnuíodh an obair in am lena híocaíocht do bhaint as Vóta 1943/44. Do réir mar mhínigh mé don Dáil nuair a tháinig an ní seo os a cóir don chéad uair, do socruíodh le Rialtas na Breataine go nglacfadh siad-san le cóipeanna mion-scannán de na tuarascbhála luachmhara seo in ionad na dtuarascbhál bunaidh ionnas go gcoimeádfaimis féin na tuarascbhála bunaidh i gCaisleán Bhaile Átha Cliath.</P>
    <P>Ins an soláthar i bhFo-Mhír B. 1. le haghaidh costais Foillseachán i nGaedhilg, tá méadú ó £8,005 go £11,000 mar gheall ar leatnnú atá beartuithe a dhéanamh ar obair an Ghúim.  Dá thoradh sin, táthar ag súil go luathófar foillsiú a lán leabhar don ghnáthphobal, agus ina theannta sin, tá soláthar dhá dhéanamh don chéad uair chun Téacs-leabhra Iolscol do chur dá n-ullmhú agus dá bhfoillsiú.  Maraon leis sin, fágfar faoi'n nGúm obair na Stair Áitiúil&mdash;obair a mbíodh fo-mhír speisialta dhí féin aici go dtí seo.</P>
    <P>An Deontas-i-gCabhair do Chódháil Náisiúnta na Gaedhilge, ní raibh sé sin, ach oiread, ins an Meastachán go dtí seo, cés moite de bheith i Meastachán breise trénar tugadh £500 don Chódháil mar gheall ar obair 1943-44. Is an-tábhachtach, dar leis an Rialtas, an obair atá beartuithe ag an gCódháil, agus táthar ag súil le toradh fónta do bheith uirthi maidir le haithbheochaint na teangan.</P>
    <P>Vóta 50&mdash;Scoileanna Ceartúcháin agus Scoileanna Saothair: Is truagh liom é bheith d'fhiachaibh orm £8,606 de mhéadú ar Vóta na bliana seo thart d'iarraidh&mdash;rud fhágas £131,450 de votá iomlán le soláthar. Gidh gurb olc an scéal é, tá coirtheacht ag méadú léi i measc an aosa óig.  Bhí 260 ar coinneáil ins na Scoileanna Ceartúcháin anuraidh, agus tá 290 ar coinneáil ionta i mbliana.  Tá na scoileanna seo cho líonta agus is féidir dóibh bheith agus táthar ghá bhfairsingiú faoi láthair.</P>
    <P>An t-ionad coinneála do bhuachaillí bhíos ag fanacht le triail, is i gCnoc Chríonáin do bhí sé le blianta fada; <Col N="247" /> ach tá ionad is fairsinge agus is oiriúnaí ná sin dá úsáid anois i nGlas Naoidhean.</P>
    <P>Vóta 51&mdash;An Gailerí Náisiúnta: Taobh amuigh de £93 de sholáthar breise mar gheall ar rátaí nua an Bhónus Éigeandála, níl aon athrú ar riachtanais an Ghailerí Náisiúnta.</P>
    <P>Vóta 70&mdash;Institiúid Árd-Léighinn Bhaile Átha Cliath: £18,290 an tsuim atá ag teastáil le haghaidh na hInstitiúide ins an mbliain atá chugainn&mdash;rud is ionann agus £1,040 de mhéadú ghlan.  An costas mar gheall ar Fhoillseacháin, is é sin an ítim is mó dá bhfuil luaidhte i gclár an chaiteachais.  Meastar go mbeidh £3,250 ag teastáil lena aghaidh sin, agus is maith an comhartha é go bhfuil toradh fónta ag teacht ar obair na hInstitiúide.</P>
    <P>Maidir le Bun-Oideachas, taisbeánann na figiúracha freastail gur 457,660 líon iomlán na ndalta bhí ar na rollaí i 1942/43&mdash;rud is ionann, do réir chosúlachta, agus 910 níos mó ná bhí ar na rollaí i 1941/42.  Ach, faoi scéim speisialta, idir an dá linn, do glácadh leis na Scoileanna Ceartúcháin mar Scoileanna Náisiúnta, agus tá 4,300 dalta ar rollaí na Scol (Ceartúcháin) Náisiúnta.  Má baintear iad sin den líon iomlán atá luaidhte agam, beidh 3,390 de laghdú ar an líon iomlán, agus is léir uaidh sin go bhfuil uimhir pháistí scoile na tíre seo ag laghdú fós.</P>
    <P>Ins na deich mbliana seo caithte, ní raibh an freastal faoi 82 per cent. ná ós cionn 84 per cent. den uimhir do bhí ar na rollaí; agus, i gcás na ndalta a mbaineann an tAcht Freastail Scoile leo (páistí idir 6 bliana agus 14 bliana d'aois), bhí meán-fhreastal na tréimhse sin os cionn 83 per cent.  Meán-fhreastal 1943, bhí sé rud beag ní ba lugha ná meán-fhreastal 1942&mdash;83.7 per cent. in ionad 84 per cent.</P>
    <P>I gContae-Bhuirg Bhaile Átha Cliath, Chorcaighe agus Phortláirge, áiteanna ina bhfuil Coistí Freastail Scoile ag feidhmiú, bíonn an freastal i gcomhnaí níos fearr ná mar bhíonn sé ins an chuid eile den tír.  Chuaidh sé cho hárd le 86 per cent. agus le 87.5 per cent. ins na háiteanna sin.</P>
    <P>Ins an mbliain dar dheireadh an <Col N="248" /> 30adh de Mheitheamh, 1943, bhí 87.5 per cent. de mheán-fhreastal i gCathair Bhaile Átha Cliath ag na páistí idir 6 bliana agus 14 bliana d'aois; i gCathair Chorcaighe bhí 87.2 per cent.; i gCathair Phortláirge bhí 86.1 per cent. agus i gContae Chorcaighe bhí 86 per cent.</P>
    <P>Maidir le páistí den aois chéanna i gceanntair eile, bhí 85 per cent. de mheán-fhreastal i gContae Chiarraighe, i gContae Bhaile Átha Cliath agus i gContae na hIar-Mhidhe.  Acht i gcontaethe eile&mdash;Cill Mantain. Muigheo, an Mhidhe, Longphort, Dún na nGall, Muineachán, Liathdruim, Cill Dara agus Sligeach&mdash;bhí an meán-fhreastal faoi 82 per cent.  Ó 18 per cent. go 21 per cent. de na daltaí a mbaineann an tAcht Freastail leo, bhí siad as láthair na scoile, gach lá, ins na contaethe sin.</P>
    <P>Cuid an-mhór de dhaoine óga na tíre seo, ní fhághann siad oideachas foirmiúil ná tréineáil threoruithtar éis dóibh an Bhun-Scoil d'fhágáil, agus is léir uaidh sin gur rí-thábhachtach an t-oideachas agus an tréineáil a fáightear ins na Scoileanna Náisiúnta. Ní hé amháin gur riachtanach do dbaltaí na Scol sin eolas d'fháil ar na h-abhair léighinn a leagtar amach dóibh ins na Cláir fhoirmiúla.  Is córiachtanach dóibh teagasc maith d'fháil ins na prionsabail a threoruíos daoine i mbealach na deagh-bheatha agus na deagh-chathardhachta.  Ach ní féidir d'oide a dhualgas do chólíonadh ins an méid sin, mura bhfuil eolas maith aige ar na daltaí.  Ní mór dó bheith in eolas na caoi bhíos ar na daltaí ins an mbaile&mdash;maith nó olc an chaoi í; ní mór dó aithne faoi leith do chur ar gach duine aca; ní mór dó a aithneachtáil gur féidir difríochta an-mhóra do bheith eatortha ó thaobh nádúra agus ábaltachta&mdash;agus ní mór dó an t-eolas sin go léir d'úsáid sa gcaoi ina rachaidh a theagase agus a thréineáil í gcion ar gach dalta dá mbíonn faoi n-a chúram.  Is fusa go mór friotháileamh don dalta chliste ná friotháileamh don dalta atá gann i gclisteacht.  Aithnítear an deaghoide ar an treoir thuigsionach a thugann sé do dhaltaí nach acfuinn dóibh foghluim thapaidh do dhéanamh. An t-oide a bhfuil fios a ealadhan aige, <Col N="249" /> molann sé i gcomhnaí an saothar fírinneach, tugann sé misneach do na daltaí, cothuíonn sé muinín asta féin ionta agus cuireann sé i dtuigse go soiléir dóibh gurb é cuspóir ceart gach duine a dhícheall do dhéanamh, bíodh an dícheall sin sár-éifeachtach nó ná bíodh.</P>
    <P>An eisiompláir is féidir le hoide do thabhairt dá dhaltaí tréna phearsantacht agus a iompar féin, tá sí ar na modhtha teagaisc is cumhachtaí dá bhfuil le fáil.  Má thugann sé dá aire an scoil agus ionad na scoile do choinneáil glan slachtmhar i gcomhnaí, múinfe sé do na daltaí an áird chéanna do bheith aca ar an nglaine agus ar an slacht.  Le linn bheith measúil air féin agus módhúil múinte le daoine eile, meallfa sé na daltaí chun na subháilcí céanna do chleachtadh.  Tré bhriathar béil, féadann sé mórán do dhéanamh chun a chur ina luighe ar na daltaí gurb ionmholta agus gur luachmhar na neithe iad an chóir, an chneastacht agus an fhírinneacht; ach is éifeachtaí ná briathar ar bith béil deagheisiompláir an oide féin.</P>
    <P>Is fíor go gcuireann a lán neithe isteach ar cibé treoir i mbéasaí a tugtar do pháistí ins na Bun-Scoileanna. Páistí na linne seo, is follas nach bhfuil siad faoi stiúir cho héifeachtach ag a dtuismitheoirí agus bhíodh páistí san am do chuaidh thart.  Taobh amuigh, tá droch-thionchuir go leor nach mbíodh a leithéidí ann, ar chor ar bith. Ina theannta sin, fágann na daltaí an scoil sul a mbíonn a gcarachtair múnluithe go foirbhthe; agus, ar an abhar sin, is deacair dóibh gan géilleadh do na droch-thionchuir bhíos ina dtimpeall go flúirseach.  Ach, dá ainneoin sin go léir, is áthas liom a thuigsint as tuarascbhála na gCigirí gurab eol d'fhurmhór na n-oidí a thábhachtaí agus tá an tréineáil úd atá luaidhte agam.  Aithním ar na tuarascbhála go gcuireann na hoidí rómpa féin mar chuspóir an tréineáil sin do thabhairt uatha, agus go n-éiríonn leo go réasúnta maith.  Oifigigh a bhfuil cleachtadh fada leathan aca, deireann siad go deimhin liom go bhfuil furmhór na n-oidí níos fearr ná mar bhí na hoidí bhí ann tuairim tríocha bliain ó shoin.  Deireann siad go bhfuil oidí na linne seo níos feasaí maidir le modhtha <Col N="250" /> teagaisc agus smachta&mdash;go bhfuil siad níos measúla ortha féin agus gur fearr an eisiompláir a thugann siad uatha tré na n-iomchur pearsanta.  Deirtear, freisin, liom go bhfuil páistí na linne seo níos míne de ghnáth ina mbéasaí, gur réidhe ghlacas siad teagasc agus gur fearúla a spiorad.</P>
    <P>Ach is truagh liom é bheith le rá nach n-oireann an deagh-scéal sin do gach cás.  Go fóill féin, tá oidí ann nach léir dóibh cad is fiú an deagheisiompláir&mdash;oidí a mheasas go gcólíonann siad a ndualgas nuair a thugann siad uatha oiread de theagasc fhoirmiúil agus shábháileas iad ar bhriseadh rialach.  Is beag iarracht a thugann a leitheidí sin ar a modhtha teagaisc do chur in oiriúint do gach dalta go pearsanta.  Ní bhíonn foighid aca le daltaí atá maol-aigeantach, agus 'séard is droch-thoradh dá n-obair gur minic a thugann siad ar na daltaí fuath do thabhairt dá n-oide agus don scoil agus dá mbaineann léi.</P>
    <P>Nuair a bhí mé ag cur Meastacháin na bliana seo thart os cóir na Dála, dubhairt mé go raibh ullmhúchán déanta chun scéim nua le haghaidh bronnadh Teistiméireacht Bun-Scol do chur i bhfeidhm i 1943.  Ba é an rud do bhi beartuithe ins an scéim sin go gcuirfí faoi scrúdú i 1943 gach dalta dá mbeadh ins an Seisiú Rang ins na Bun-Scoileanna agus ag a mbeadh 100 freastal ar a laghad déanta.  I mbliana, agus ins na blianta seo chugainn, 'seard atá socruithe go gcuirfear faoi scrúdú gach dalta dá bhfuil ar an rolla ins an Seisiú Rang, nó i Rang is áirde ná sin&mdash;cé's moite de dhaltaí do chuaidh faoi'n scrúdú cheana nó daltaí nach mbeidh an uimhir riachtanach freastal déanta aca.</P>
    <P>An ladh de Mheitheamh, 1943, do bhí an chéad scrúdú ann faoi'n scéim seo.  Tháinig 44,272 dalta chun an scrúduithe, agus d'éirigh an scrúdú le 31,535&mdash;rud is ionann agus 71% den iomlán do tháinig i láthair.  Ar dhaltaí an Seisiú Ranga amháin do bhí an scrúdú sin éigeantach, ach is cúis áthais a bheith le rá gur cuireadh i láthair 13,500 dalta as an Seachtú Rang agus an Ochtú Rang.</P>
    <P>Ba rí-dheacair scrúduchán d'eagrú dá leithéid sin de mhór-líon dalta, mura mbeadh có-chongnamh áitiúil le fáil ina <Col N="251" /> chóir, agus is áthas liom bheith i ndon a rá gur cuireadh an có-chongnamh sin ar fáil ach i bhfíor-chorráit. Bhí beagnach 2,700 ionad scrúduithe ann, agus, ó thárla ag trácht ar an obair sin mé, ba mhaith liom focal nó dhó do rá le gach éinne dár chuidigh léi.  Tairgim buidheachas do Bhainisteoirí na mBun-Scol ar fud na tíre, óir ba mhór a gcongnamh-san leis an scéim do chur in éifeacht.  Tairgim buidheachas do na hUird Chreidimh, óir chuidigh siad go fial le heagrú na n-ionad scrúduithe agus le hobair a bhí có-thábhachtach léi&mdash;marcáil na bhfreagra do thug na daltaí uatha.  Tairgim buidheachas, mar an gcéanna, do na hOidí agus do na daoine eile do rinne an obair do stiúradh.</P>
    <P>Na teistiméireachta gnóthuítoar ins an Scrúdú sin na mBun-Scol, ba chóir go mba tairbheach iad do dhaltaí ar mhian leo dul i mbun cúrsa de mheán-oideachas nó de ghairm-oideachas, agus ba chóir go gcuideodh siad le daltaí do bheadh ag iarraidh postaí i gceárda no i dtionnscail a mbeadh caighdeán áirithe oideachais ag teastáil ina gcóir.  Lena chois sin, tá an teistiméireacht ina cuspóir dheimhin ag an oide dalta scoile, agus ina congnamh ag an oide dá bhrí sin.  Ina theannta sin go léir, tugann an teistiméireacht caoi do thuismitheoirí ar oideachas a gcloinne do mheas.</P>
    <P>Tá mé cinnte go dtuigtear go coiteann an tairbhe bhaineas leis an Scrúdú seo.  Ní hole an cruthú air sin, dar liom, 13,500 dalta as an Seachtú agus as an Ochtú Rang do theacht chun an scrúduithe, gidh nach raibh sin d'fhiachaibh ortha ar chor ar bith. Anois, ó thárla ar bhun nua é, tá mé ag súil nach fada go bhfaghthar có-chongnamh eagruithe ó na hoidí go léir.  Is iondual deacrachtaí do bheith ag baint le scéim cho mór seo, agus ba réidhe do cuirfí in éifeacht í dá dtugadh na hoidí an có-chongnamh eagruithe sin uatha.</P>
    <P>Mar a dubhairt mé cheana, do bheinn toilteanach, uair ar bith, ar dhul i gcomhairle faoi shlithe ar bith ina bhféadfaí có-chongnamh eagruithe na n-oidí d'fháil agus gan athrú do <Col N="252" /> dhéanamh ar bhun-phrionsabail na scéime.</P>
    <P>I mbliain a 1942-43, do ceaduíodh £246,278 de dheontais chun tithe nua scoile do dhéanamh agus chun feabhas no fairsingiú do dhéanamh ar thithe scoile do bhí ann cheana.  Is mar seo do roinneadh airgead na ndeontas sin:&mdash;</P>

Do cuireadh ar fáil go háitiúil an £670,148 sin de dhifríocht idir an dá shuim. Na deontais do ceaduíodh ins an tréimhse sin an dá bhliain déag, 'séard a tugadh iad chun 439 de thithe nua scoile do dhéanamh, chun 170 de thithe scoile bhí ann cheana d'fhairsingiú agus chun 2,747 de thithe scoile d'fheabhsú.</P>
    <P>Idir an ladh d'Abrán, 1932, agus an <Col N="253" /> 31adh de Mhárta, 1943, do críochnuíodh 389 de thithe nua scoile agus do rinneadh mór-fheabhsú ar 680 eile. Ina theannta sin, do cuireadh i gcrích cuid mhór ar fad de mhion-scéimeanna feabhsuithe le linn na tréimhse céanna.</P>
    <P>Mar a dubhairt mé sa Dáil le linn na Meastacháin do thabhairt isteach anuraidh, agus mar do luaidh mé sa Seanad i Mí na Nodlag, 1942, tá sé ar aigne againn clár áirithe d'obair iarchogaidh do chur i bhfeidhm maidir le déanamh agus fairsingiú agus feabhsú tithe scoile.  Ó 10 mbliana go 15 bliana do thógfadh an clár oibre sin dínn, agus, do réir an eolais atá againn faoi láthair, beidh sé riachtanach</P>
    <P>(a) 1,000 ar a laghad de thithe nua scoile do dhéanamh in ionad sean-tithe (500 de na sean-tithe seo, tá siad i ndroch-chaoi ar fad, ach féadfar bail réasúnta do chur ar na 500 eile, ionnas go ndéanfa siad cúis go ceann gearr-thamaill de bhlianta, nuair a beifear i ndon tithe nua do chur ina n-áit);</P>
    <P>(b) fairsingiú nó feabhsú do dhéanamh ar 1,500 de thithe scoile.</P>
    <P>Do réir mar atá luacha faoi lathair, cosnóidh an clár oibre seo idir £5,000,000 agus £6,000,000.</P>
    <P>Ní féidir dul ar aghaidh lena leithéid sin de mhór-chlár oibre in aimsir ina bhfuil abhair foirgníochta cho gann agus tá siad le linn na hÉigeandála atá anois ann.  Ach tá gach dícheall dhá dhéanamh chun riar do chásanna atá an-chruadhógach&mdash;go háirithe in aon chás ina bhfuil contúirt mí-shláinteachais i gceist.  Mar atá luaidhte cheana féin agam, do ceaduíodh £246,278 de dheontais i mbliain a 1942-43 agus do ceaduíodh £221,971 de dheontais i mbliain a 1943-44&mdash;rud is ionann agus clár réasúnta mór d'obair foirgníochta san aimsir atá ann faoi láthair.</P>
    <P>Is minic, cheana féin, do luaidh mé go bhfuil áiteanna ann ina gcuirtear fíor-bheagán suime i mbail na dtithe scoile nó na fo-thithe bhaineas leo.  An deisiú beag do déanfaí cho luath agus chífí a riachtanas, is minic do sheachódh sé an deisiú costasach a mbíonn gá leis nuair a leigtear tithe <Col N="254" /> in ainriocht do réir a chéile.  Ní miste a rá go tréan go mba chóir bail do chur ar thithe scoile cho luath agus bheadh sin ag teastáil uatha.  Sa sórt saoil atá anois ann&mdash;agus a bheas ann go ceann tamaill mhaith&mdash;is beag do b'fhéidir do dhéanamh maidir le foirgnimh nua do chur ar fáil no le trom-dheisiú ar bith do dhéanamh ar shean-fhoirgnimh.</P>
    <P>Caithfe mé tagairt do dhéanamh do rud trom-chúiseach do rinneadh 'féacháil an laghdófaí an ceal oibre ata ar a lán Oidí Náisiúnta le tamall. Coláiste Naomh Pádraig, Druim Chonnrach (an t-aon Choláiste amháin atá ann chun tréineáil do thabhairt d'fhir Chatoiliceacha), do dúnadh é go ceann tréimhse nach fuide ná dhá bhliain.</P>
    <P>Ní hionann sin agus go ndeachaidh an ceal oibre i méid le déanaí.  Bachóra a rá gur thárla sé do bharr plean atá dhá chur i bhfeidhm ar feadh tamaill de bhlianta.  Tar éis scrúdú do dhéanamh, roinnt bhlian ó shoin, ar an soláthar agus ar an riachtanas, ba léir nár ghá, go gceann tamaill eile de bhlianta, cur leis an líon oidí do bhí ar fáil cheana.  Mar sin de, do stadadh go sealadach de thabhairt abhair oide isteach ins na Coláistí Ullmhúcháin, óir is tríotha sin a thagas furmhór na n-abhar oide chun na gColáiste Tréineála.</P>
    <P>I mblianta a 1939 agus 1940, níor leigeadh buachaillí ná cailíní isteach ins na Coláistí Ullmhúcháin; i mbliain a 1941, do leigeadh isteach cailíní, ach do coinníodh dúnta coláistí na mbuachaillí. Maidir leis an scrúdú oscailte iomaíochta (an tslí eile ina dtagann abhair oide chun tréineála), níor cuireadh buachaillí ná cailíní faoi scrúdú i 1938, i 1939 ná i 1940, agus do coinníodh dúnta an scrúdú in aghaidh buachaillí i 1941 agus ina dhiaidh sin. Ós ní gur cúrsa cheithre mblian a cuirtear isteach ins na Coláistí Ullmhúcháin, do thárla, de bhárr na gcosc úd, nach raibh daltaí nua ar bith i gColáiste Naomh Pádraig i 1943, agus nach mbeidh go dtí 1946.</P>
    <P>Tá buachaillí dhá leigint isteach ins na Coláistí Ullmhúcháin arís ó bhí 1942 ann, óir meastar go mbeidh a thuilleadh fear-oide ag teastáil faoi'n am a gcríochnóidh na buachaillí sin a <Col N="255" /> gcúrsa dhá bhlian sa Choláiste Tréineála tar éis dóibh bheith sa Choláiste Ullmhúcháin ar feadh ceithre mblian.  Mar sin de, déanfar Coláiste Naomh Pádraig d'ath-oscailt i Meán Fomhair, 1946, an seal is moille.</P>
    <P>Tar éis comhairle do ghlacadh le lucht stiúrtha an Choláiste agus leis an Aire Airgeadais, tá sé socruithe agam go gcoinneófar an fhuireann agus na foirgnimh faoi réir, ionnas go n-athtosnófar ar thréineáil oidí faoi cheann tréimhse an dá bhlian&mdash;nó níos luaithe, má bhíonn gá leis.  Acht caithfe mé a rá nach dóigh liom a leithéid de ghá do bheith ann.  Ceisteanna airgeadais agus ceisteanna eile bhaineas leis an tréimhse idir-dhá-linn, níl siad réitithe go hiomlán fós; ach tá socruithe cheana féin nach ndéanfaidh an dúnadh sealadach aon laghdú ar chearta ná ar chaoithe na ndaoine atá ar an bhfuirinn lán-aimsire d'ollúin an Choláiste faoi láthair.</P>
    <P>Meán-Oideachas: Mar adubhras cheana tá na Meán-scoltacha ag dul i líonmhaire do réir a chéile in aghaidh na bliana.  Tá na daltaí ag dul i líonmhaire dá réir.  Ins an mbliain scoile 1929-30 bhí 27,645 daltaí i Meán-Scoltacha na tíre; 40,040 dalta atá ionta i mbliana, agus is cinnte go mbeadh níos mó ná sin féin ionta marach an bhail atá ar an saol agus na deacrachtaí atá ag baint le cúrsaí taistil.</P>
    <P>Rinne mé tagairt anuraidh do na hathruithe a bhí ar tí a ndéanta ar an gcaighdeán le haghaidh Onóracha fháil i scrúduithe na dTeastas.  Go dtí anuraidh níor ghá do iarrthóir ach Onóracha a fháil i ndá ábhar agus gheobhadh sé pas le Onóracha sa scrúdú ar fad ins an Árd-Teistiméaracht. Anuraidh níorbh fhuláir do iarrthóir Onóracha fháil i dtrí hábhair ionnus go bhfuigheadh sé pas le Onóracha sa scrúdú ar fad.  Tá an coinníoll céana ann i mbliana, agus i n-a theanta sin, tá an caighdeán i gcomhair Onóracha in ábhar ar bith árduithe ó 50 per cent. go dtí 60 per cent.  Maidir leis an Meán-Teistiméaracht, bheadh Onóracha le fáil roimhe <Col N="256" /> seo sa scrúdú ar fad ach Onóracha fháil i dtri hábhair nó 50 per cent. fháil i gceithre hábhair.  Maidir leis na hOnóracha a bhíodh le fáil ag an té a gheobhadh 50 per cent. i gceithre hábhair tá athrú déanta air sin i mbliana.  Sa gcás sin ní bheidh Onóracha sa scrúdú ar fad le fáil feasta ach ag an té a gheobhas Onóracha (60 per cent.) i ndá ábhar agus 50 per cent. i ndá ábhar eile.</P>
    <P>Tá Tuaith-eolaíocht ina ábhar ar Chlár na Meán-Scol den chéad uair i mbliana.  Mar a mhíníos anuraidh, is i gcóir scoltacha a bhfuil feilmeacha dhá gcuid féin acu nó a mbeadh talamh le fáil go héascaidh chuige sin acu ins an gcomharsanacht, is dóibh-sean is mó a cuireadh an t-ábhar sin ar an gclár.  Eolas -teoiriciúil agus obair saotharlainne is eadh cuid den chúrsa, ach tá gnáth-obair na feilme agus garradóireacht ina gcuid de, freisin. Tá an cúrsa leagtha amach i gcaoi is gur le gnáth-obair na feilme a caithfear roint mhaith den am a bheas ceaptha don ábhar.  Le súil go dtarraingeodh na scoltacha an Tuaith-eolaíocht chuca mar ábhar léighinn, agus le cuidiú a thabhairt dóibh leis na húirlisí riachtanacha a chur ar fáil, tá socruithe na gnáth-dheontais a bhíodh iníoctha ar ranganna Eolaíochta Turgnamhaighe a árdú do réir 50 per cent.  Tá sé cinn déag de scoltacha tar éis an t-ábhar a ghlacadh chuca i mbliana, agus tá 'chuile chosúlacht ann go dtiocfaidh an t-am a mbeidh an t-ábhar ar a gclár oideachais ag 'chuile scoil atá cóirithe chuige.</P>
    <P>Tá socruithe cúrsa Samhraidh don Ghaedhilg a chur ar bun i mbliana i gcóir Oidí Meán-scoile.  Is i gcóir na hócáide sin an t-árdú beag atá tagtha ar an gcaiteachas a bheas ann fá Mhírcheann F de Vóta 47.  Gidh go bhfuil bail mhaith ar an nGaedhilg i bhfurmhór na Meán-scoltacha, tá an caighdeán íseal go maith fós i roint bheag acu, agus tá uimhir bheag de na hoidí nach bhfuil an teanga ar a gcomhairle féin acu, fós.  Bhéarfaidh cúrsa Samhraidh cleachtadh dóibh sin ar labhairt na teangan.  Séard atá ceaptha an cúrsa sin a leagan amach i gcaoi is go bhfuighe siad léargus ar na cuspóirí atá rómpa agus teagasc fá'n gcaoi is <Col N="257" /> fearr leis na cuspóirí sin a bhaint amach.  Múinteoirí a bhfuil eolas maith acu ar an teangaidh cheana, táthar ag súil go mbainfe siad sin féin tairbhe as an gcúrsa sin.</P>
    <P>Gairm-Oideachais: Gidh nach seisiún gan deacrachtaí a bhí i seisiún na bliana 1942-3 cho fada is bhaineas le Gairm-oideachas, bhí 63,443 duine cláruithe ar rollaí na scoltacha sin.  63,975 ainm a bhí ar na rollaí ionta an seisiún roimhe sin.  Na deacrachtaí a bhain le cúrsai taistil agus an t-éileamh a bhí ar na gasúir sa bportach agus ar an bhfeilm&mdash;sin é ab údar leis an laghdú a tháinig ar an tinnreamh ins na Scoltacha Gairm-oideachais fá'n tuaith.  Is beag athrú a tháinig ar an tinnreamh i scoltacha na gContae-bhuirg ná i scoltacha na gCathrach.  Sé toradh an scéil go léir gur thuit an tinnreamh a bhí ghá dhéanamh ar chúrsaí lán-aimsire lae ó 14,184, an uimhir a bhí ann i 1941-42, go dtí 13,212 i 1942-43.  Tháinig ardú beag ar an tinnreamh i ranganna tráthnóna na Scoltacha Gairm-oideachais. Na ranganna a chuir na hoidí Gaedhilge a hoileadh le gairid ar bun a b'údar le cuid den mhéadú seo, agus an t-éileamh a bhí fá n tuaith ar ranganna innealtóireachta acu seo a bhí ag soláthar muilte gaoithe fá chóir solais ab údar leis an gcuid eile dhe.</P>
    <P>Tá an obair ins na Scoltacha Gairm-oideachais fá'n tuaith ag dul ar aghaidh go maith ar bhealach a fheileas do shaol na tuaithe.  Is beag ceanntar nach bhfuil scéim ann i gcóir duaiseanna ar obair garradóireachta a déantar sa mbaile, agus a bhíos bunuithe ar an teagasc praiticiúil a tugtar i ngarraí na scoile.  Déanann tuairisc na gcigirí tagairt, ní hamháin don mhéadú seasta atá ag teacht ar an uimhir atá ag cur isteach ar an gcomórtas, ach ina theanta sin, don deágh-thoradh atá ar an obair a déantar ins na garranta sa mbaile. Rud is tábhachtaí ná sin arís, do réir tuairisc na gcigirí, seadh an chaoi a bhfuil an obair seo sna garranta sa mbaile ag dul i bhfeidhm ar na daoine fásta.  Is iomdha sin scoil tuaithe a bhfuil buidheanta díospóireachta agus caidrimh do dhaoine fásta bunuithe inti fá stiúradh an oide le Tuaith-Eolaíocht. Bunuíodh tuairm agus céad <Col N="258" /> buidhean acu sin i rith an tseisiúin seo.  Cineál fá leith do ranganna tráthnóna seadh an &ldquo;buidhean díos póireachta&rdquo; nó an &ldquo;ciorcal staidéir&rdquo;. Gidh nach ndéantar faillí ins an teagasc fhuirmiúil ins na raganna sin, sén díospóireacht imeasc baill an ranga an rud is mó a cleachtar.  Sén chéad chuspóir atá ag na gnóthaí sin staldéar a dhéanamh ar na prionsabail eolaíochta ar a bhfuil an dúil bheo agus obair na talmhan bunuithe.</P>
    <P>Ag an gCódháil bhliantúil a bhí ag Cumann na nOidí Gairm-oideachais sa mbliain 1942, mholadar có-oibriú níos fearr ná mar a bhí a bheith idir Coistí Gairm-Oideachais agus Coistí Talmhaíochta ar fud na tíre.  Dá thoradh sin, tháinig ionadaithe ón gCumann réamhráite, ionadaithe ó Roinn an Oideachais agus ionadaithe ó Roinn na Talmhaíochta le chéile sa mbliain 1942, agus socruíodh ag an gcruinniú sin go gcuirfeadh an dá Roinn cearcallán le chéile le cur chuig na coistí go léir, ag míniú dóibh an ghéar-ghá a bhí le có-oibriú an-dlúth a bheith idir an dá chineál coiste fá neithe a bhain le hoideachas talmhaíochta agus fá ábhair gaolmhar dó. Cuireadh an cearcallán amach i Mí na Nodlag, 1943.  Míníodh go cruinn ann na neithe ba mhó a raibh gá le cóoibriú maidir leo, agus luadhadh go speisialta roint neithe fá thalmhaíocht &mdash;neithe a bhéas ar an gelár i geóir buidheanta díospóireachta na rang tráthnóna.</P>
    <P>Mhínigh mé anuraidh an chaoi ar ghlac na hoidí Tuaith-Eolaíochta ortha féin síol arbhair a thástáil do na feilméaraí, rud a rinneadar ar iarratas an Aire Talmhaíochta.  I rith an tséasúir seo scrúduíodh ar an gcuma sin, i 94 de na scoltacha Gairm-oideachais, breis agus 10,000 sompla de shíolta agus tugadh toradh na tástála do na húinéaraí.  Is mór an chosaint an tastáil sin ar chaillteanas, tré loiceadh iomlán nó pháirt-loiceadh an tsíl.</P>
    <P>Gan trácht ar an tairbhe a fhághas an feilméara go díreach as an scéim seo, cuidíonn sé leis an teagasc agus an oiliúint a tugtar ins na Scoltacha Gairm-Oideachais a cheangal le saol na ndaoine agus lena gcuid oibre.  Ina theanta sin tarraingeann sé súil na dtuismitheoirí ar obair na scoltacha sin, <Col N="259" /> agus tugann sé le fios dóibh na buntáistí atá le fáil ag a gclainn de bharr freastal ar na scoltacha.  Is féidir a rá gurb é an ceangal a thárla idir an baile agus na scoltacha, de thoradh scéim tastáia an tsíl, is mó ab údar le leathnú rang na mbuidhean díospóireacht tráthnóna do dhaoine fásta agus leis an bhfás a tháinig fá thinnreamh na rang sin.  Is maith liom é bheith le rá agam go raibh sé ar chumas na Roinne seo agamsa socrú a dhéanamh arís i gcóir deagh-oibre sin thástáil an tsíl i rith an tséasúir seo.</P>
    <P>Tá deágh-thoradh ag teacht anois ar an obair a rinneadh ag na cúrsaí Samhraidh a bhí i gCorcaigh sna blianta 1942 agus 1943.  Is ar an leas ab fhéidir a bhaint as cumhacht aeir agus uisce i gcóir solais fán tuaith a tugadh na cúrsaí.  Is iomdha sin rang fa'n ábhar céanna a bunuíodh ins na sráid-bhailte tuaithe agus is minic nach raibh slí ann don uimhir a bhí ag iarraidh freastal ortha.</P>
    <P>Is údar áthais ar chuile bhealach é nach bhfuil aon lá dá n-eirgheann grian nach bhfuil níos mó meas ag tíocht ar Scoil Mhuire le Tigheas atá fá stiúradh Choiste Ghairm-Oideachais Chathrach Átha Cliath.  Is léir ón móruimhir, ní hamháin atá ar rollaí na, gcúrsaí lán-aimsire lae ach ar chúrsaí teichniúla an tráthnóna, go dtuigeann na daoine go maith an áis atá ghá fháil acu.</P>
    <P>Tháinig daoine as ceanntair eile le freastal ar an gcúrsa i mBainisteoireacht Tighe, agus tá scoláireachtaí luachmhara ghá mbronnadh anois ag a lán Coistí Gairm-Oideachais lena chur ar chumas mic léighinn mhaithe freastal ar an gcúrsa bliana seo i mBaile Átha Cliath.  Tá ag eirghe cho maith céanna leis an gcúrsa i mBainisteoireacht Institiúite&mdash;tá postaí i dtithe aoidheachta agus i mbialanna ar fud na tíre fáighte cheana féin ag furmhór na ndaoine a rinne freastal ar na cúrsaí sin an seisiún seo a chuaidh thart.</P>
    <P>De thoradh socruithe a rinneadh le Có-Chumann na Loingseoireachta, Teoranta, cuireadh dian-chúrsa gearr ar bun sa scoil fá chóir cócairí luinge, agus tá postaí anois ar longa de chuid Chomhlucht Loingseoireachta Éireann, <Col N="260" /> Teoranta, ag an triúr mac léighinn a rinne freastal ar an gcúrsa agus ar eirigh leo sa scrúdú a leagadh amach ina chóir.  Cuireadh scrúduithe praiticiúla fá choir teastaisí do chócairí luinge ar naonúr eile agus d'eirigh le hochtar acu sna scrúduithe.</P>
    <P>Chuir an Roinn seo agamsa le cabhair Choiste Ghairm-Oideachais Chathrach Átha Cliath gearr-chúrsa speisialta i mbia-eolaíocht ar bun sa gColáiste le Tigheas i rith Samhradh na bliana, 1943.  D'fhonn deis a thabhairt do na múinteoirí nárbh fhéidir caoi a thabhairt dóibh freastal ar chúrsa na bliana anuraidh, atá sé ar intinn an cúrsa sin a chur ar bun arís i mí Iúil, 1944.</P>
    <P>Táthar tar éis deagh-chríoch a chur ar chúrsa oiliúna na céad-bhuidhne de chaide-phrintíseacha sa Scoil MuirOiliúna Sóisir a theigheas le Ceárd-Scoil na Gaillimhe agus d'éirigh go han-mhaith ins na scrúduithe leis an seachtar mac léighinn a chuaidh fá scrúdú.  D'éirigh le seisear acu meánmharc nach raibh i bhfad as 80 per cent. fháil ins an scrúdú go hiomlán. Tuigtear dom go mbeidh post le fáil go gairid ar shoithigh de chuid. Chomhlucht Loingseoireachta Éireann, Teoranta, ag beirt nó triúr de na buachaillí sin.  Cuireadh tús i Mí Meáin Fhómhair anuraidh ar chúrsa oiliúna den chineál céanna do bhuidhean eile.</P>
    <P>Scéim eile dár chuir Comhlucht Loingseoireachta Éireann, Teoranta, tús léi i gCeárd-Scoil de Crafórt i gCorcaigh i Mí Eanair, 1944, séard is aidhm dí daoine feiliúnacha a oiliúint le dhul mar innealtóirí i Seirbhis MuirThráchtála Éireann.  De thoradh scrúduithe comórtais, bronnadh 3 scoláireachtai arbh fhiú £50 an ceann iad i dteannta táillí teagaisc.  Beidh ar na printíseacha cúrsa áithrid a leanacht ar feadh thrí mblian ins an gCeárd-Scoil, agus beifar ag súil go sroichfe siad caighdeán có-ionann le Cuid A de Theastas Dhara Grád na nInnealtóirí Mara.  Áirmheofar mar chuid de thréimhse printíseachta cheithre mblian dhá bhliain de na trí bliana a chaithfeas siad ag freastal na Ceárd-Scoile.  Ní féidir an Teastas Iomlán fháil gan scrúdú a sheasamh arís tar éis don iarrthóir tréimhse áirithe bheith caithe aige ar muir.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="261" /> D'fhonn ceist na Gaedhilge sna Scoltacha Gairm-Oideachais fheabhsú, rinne an Roinn beart áirithe le gairid. I mí Lúnasa 1943, cuireadh clár speisialta ar fáil do Choistí Gairm-Oideachais lena chur in úsáid i ranganna céad-bhliana na Scoltacha Leanúna. Ar mhodh múinte na haimsire seo a bunuíodh an clár úd, agus leagadh amach é d'fhonn cuidiú a thabhairt do na daltaí labhairt na Gaedhilge a chleachtadh go nádúrdha i ngnáthghníomhartha a saoil.  Ionnus go múinfí an Ghaedhilg mar is ceart, tá socruithe ina theanta sin ag an Roinn gan aoinne a cheapadh feasta ina mhúinteoir lán-aimsire Gaedhilge ach daoine a fuair oiliúint speisialta fá'n Roinn i gcóir na hoibre.  Cuireadh comhairle, freisin, ar na Coistí Gairm-Oideachais fán obair ba cheart a chur ina gcuid scéimeanna ar mhaithe leis an nGaedhilg, agus cuireadh i dtuigsint dóibh an scód a leigfí le hoidí&mdash;bídís lán-aimsireach nó páirt-aimsireach&mdash;a ghlacfadh páirt in obair cosúil le feiseanna, le céilithe, le drámaíocht, leis an gCaisceadal nó le cluichí.</P>
    <P>Bhí cúrsa Samhraidh ar a ndearnadh tinnreamh maith ar siúl sa mbliain 1943, le hoiliúint a thabhairt d'oidí Gaedhilge i Modha Múinte na teangan agus i gcúrsaí Gaedhealacha eile, go háithrid cúrsaí a bhaineas leis an aos óg a stiúradh.  Tá sé ar intinn a mhacasamhail eile de chúrsa a chur ar siúil an Samhradh seo chugainn.</P>
    <P>Is áthas liom tuairisc a bheith le tabhairt agam fána fheabhas a d'éirigh leis an teasbántas de pheictiúirí na bPríomh-Ealadhantóirí Eireannacha a tugadh i Scoltacha Gairm-Oideachais na tíre.  De thoradh an chó-oíbrithe a fritheadh ó Phríomh-Ealadhantóirí agus ó Bhailitheoirí na hÉireann, tá an Roinn taréis 61 peictiúr a léiríos ealadhain Gaedheal fháil ar iasacht.  Sa gCeárd-Scoil i bPortlairge, i Mí Mheán Fhomhair, 1943, an chéad áit ar teasbánadh an bailiúchán seo, agus sul a raibh deireadh na bliana ann teasbánadh, freisin, iad i dhá scoil déag eile de chuid an Ghairm-Oideachais i gCondae an Chláir, i gCiarraighe, i Luimneach, agus i dTiobrad Arann. Níl aón áit dar teasbánadh iad nach ndeachaidh a lán daoine ag féachaint ortha agus nár cuireadh <Col N="262" /> suim mhór ionta.

      <P>When we look back over the difficulties this country surmounted during our lifetime we cannot but recollect what a stimulus the educational ideals and outlook of some of the principal public men of our time was in the overcoming of those difficulties.  The difficulties and asperities of the times were blunted for us by the idealistic outlook which we had on general education matters. This morning, we listened to the Minister for Finance speak with commendable hope and courage of the spirit in which he hoped we should survive the economic and other difficulties that lay in front of us.  We all share his hope and courage.  Coming to consider education, the Department of Education and the Minister for Education, speaking for myself, I must say that my hopes and my courage are called upon to bear a burden which I do not think should be placed upon them.  If we are to surmount our difficulties, it is urgently necessary that they should not be called upon to bear that burden. The Minister in his statement said that, following upon the shutting down of the preparatory colleges and some of the training colleges, St. Patrick's Training College was to be shut down for two years.  Every country which is alive at present realises that its future, both spiritual and material, will rest on the foundations of education.  Even though many countries are struggling with the appalling work of war, they are making gigantic efforts not only to solidify their educational foundations but to plan in a systematic way for increasing the number of teachers, increasing the number of institutions, organising in a better way the curricula and, generally, preparing for the improvement of primary, secondary, technical and university education.  At a time when all other countries are so engaged we are all but educationally dead so far as plans for the future are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister gives no hint in his <Col N="265" /> statement that the Department of Education is on the defensive against public criticism from almost every class in the country&mdash;from those who want to see the Irish language restored, from those interested in the general development of the intelligence and capacity of our young people and from those interested in the commercial, manufacturing and technical life of the country.  From every direction there is a challenge of criticism which puts the Department of Education and our whole educational machinery on the defensive. Nothing is being done to suggest that our Department of Education realises that it lives in a modern world, facing a completely new future, which is pulsating with the realisation that it is only by education&mdash;spiritual and material&mdash;a people can be developed who will be able to face that future.  There is no sign in the Minister's statement that he realises the keen, heart-felt criticism that is directed to the Department of Education. That is all the more remarkable when we consider the stimulus which our educational ideals were to us.  I recall Terence MacSwiney saying in the middle of our struggle that it was a pity we did not accept the Councils Bill of 1908 because, as he said, it would have given us control over education.</P>
    <P>On the eve of the Rising of 1916, and at a time when Padraic Pearse was considering whether in the interests of supporting the Home Rule Bill of 1912 he would allow himself to be dragged into politics, or whether he should stick to his educational work, he wrote <i>An Barr Buadh,</i> which he published anonymously.  Events moved too swiftly and made it impossible for himself or anybody else to do for this country what could be done for education. He left his educational work and became not only a politician but a soldier.  With all the freedom that these men gained when they turned their backs on their educational work and their ideals, in order to help to carve out that freedom, and when educational ideals are rising to great heights in the world, we have here no conception of it at all.  We have <Col N="266" /> tremendous work to do here, and a tremendous stimulant in the past to go ahead with that work.  When the late Professor of Education in the National University was giving evidence before the Primary Programme Conference in 1925, he threw his mind back to what education had meant for this country. He stated positively that the strength behind the O'Connell movement was in the schools.  He emphasised particularly the ordinary schools to which the ordinary working people of that time were forced to go.  Amongst other things was the marked excellence in these schools of the standard of mathematics. He traced the strength of the democratic movement to these schools.</P>
    <P>Here, with all that inspiration in front of us, and with a realisation of what education means, we want to do more than is normally done in the schools; we want to restore and bring back in all its vigour, and in all its appeal, the Irish language.  One would have thought that a Minister with any kind of imagination, whatever the causes that brought about the necessity to close down educational establishments, would have thought it providential that our preparatory training colleges and training colleges would be shut down for a while, so that after a new national grip had been got on education, and a new national experiment with regard to the Irish language in the schools, he would make use of the opportunity to empty the training colleges and to bring back for special courses and for special direction some of the teachers who for such a long time had been engaged under great difficulty on educational work.  However, so far from making any attempt to assist them in any way to deal with their work in these modern times, and so far from making any attempt to review in a systematic way the work that has been done there, the training colleges have simply been shut down. Take the Irish side alone.  A new slogan of a political kind has been raised around the Irish language&mdash;that English must go.  If there was one thing that the Irish language did for us during difficult times it was to keep before our minds the difference between Caesar and God.  We kept in <Col N="267" /> touch with the Irish language because it was traditionally the language of our people.</P>
    <P>Perhaps at the beginning of our youth we did not think it was there but we learned that it was, and were directed to it by whatever movement was there.  What did we find in it? We found at a time when people were very much concerned with politics, and in difficult times, that we were brought into contact with a language that knew nothing of politics, that brought us into touch with people in Irish-speaking districts, that brought us up against humanity, human nature, God's creation, without any reference to the trouble of politics.  While we were dealing with politics and dealing with our language, we had a kind of refuge to which we could go that revived our spirits, one that gave us the necessary outlook on creation and humanity.  Now we are in the very great danger that the Irish language is being made a thing of Caesar, and that the real essence and what it means to us is being lost sight of.  We are asking what our schools are doing to save the Irish language, and why it is necessary to run the danger of making it a matter of politics.  Let us take the last report of the Department of Education on the position of the Irish language in the primary schools, where the Minister intimated what a big factor the primary schools are in the whole educational life of the country.  We know that a tremendously big percentage of our children are entirely dependent on the primary schools for any education that they get.  We find this on page 15 of the report:&mdash;</P>

    <P>That is a report on the subject of Irish in the higher classes.  It says that very often, in the higher classes, much of the knowledge the children had coming from the lower classes is forgotten instead of their grip on that knowledge being strengthened, deepened and broadened.  It says: &ldquo;Not seldom do we see children in the fifth class being taught the same lessons as they were taught in the third class.&rdquo; It says further: &ldquo;It is no wonder, therefore, that only a very small portion of the students get any facility in talking Irish, and in many of the schools there is no reasonable attempt made to use the language as the spoken tongue.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="269" /> That is what we find after 22 years of work for Irish in schools that the greater part of our children have to depend on for their education.  That is the official report of the Department of Education with regard to that position.  As people who stood over the development of the Irish language in the schools, and had considerable experience of how it went and developed, and had a certain amount to do in pressing that the language would be used properly and effectively as a weapon for education, we ask that those whose children have Irish should have an opportunity of getting their children educated through the medium of Irish.  What has the Minister for Education to say to those of us who are concerned with the Irish language, and what has he done about it in the schools?  What has he to say to us about that report?  We are also concerned to know what he has to say to the people who for one reason or another make the complaint that Irish is injuring the general work of education in the schools.  We do not believe it.  What we believe is wrong is that a lot of the work for Irish and for other subjects is not done well, and that it is there that the real cause for criticism of the schools arises.  It is fantastic, and strikes a heavy blow at the Irish language, that the Minister should go down to Cashel, and echoing the political cry of the Taoiseach, say that the English language has to go; that there are difficulties at the present time with regard to Irish in the schools, but that things will be better.</P>
    <P>The children who are attending the schools to-day&mdash;those whose work has been reported on by the Department of Education in their report for the year 1941-42&mdash;will soon be leaving school, and will be the parents of the children that will be attending the primary schools in a few years.  The Minister's hope of parents assisting their children at Irish in a few years' time is very slender indeed if it is based upon what the inspectors in his Department have set down in this report as to the work done by those parents when they were at school.</P>
    <P>Later in the report, in discussing <Col N="270" /> the question of reading in English and Irish in the higher classes, the report criticises some of the ways in which the teachers deal with the work, and winds up in these words:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Cailleamhaint an-mhór do na daltaí é sin mar ní bhíonn dúil sa léigheamh aca de bharr a gcuid scolaidheachta.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is to say, that they leave school without having any interest in reading whether it is in English or Irish. For years past I have pressed on the Minister, in various ways, to take particular branches of instruction in the primary schools and have them specially examined and reported on. I have asked why we could not have some of the most experienced teachers throughout the country removed from their work and given the special task of examining the general way in which, say, geography is taught throughout the country, another group to be asked to do the same with regard to history, and the same with regard to mathematics, so that both people and Parliament would get from a systematic examination some kind of a clear report on the standards that have been arrived at, and of the systems adopted in dealing with various school subjects in the primary schools.  Not only has that not been done in a systematic way, but the fact is that the education reports that we used to get are no longer given to us.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the primary certificate examination has been introduced simply because the inspector system seems to have broken down. Whatever is wrong, neither the Department nor anybody else is able to get, through the inspectorate system, any kind of idea of the condition of the instruction that is being given in the schools to-day.  There was a scheme introduced some years ago for dealing with music.  It was an organising inspectorate.  The results that have attended the improvement of music in the primary schools should have indicated to the Minister what a useful thing it would be if something similar were done with regard to other special subjects. <Col N="271" /> However, nothing like that has been done and, apparently, nothing like that will be done until some people&mdash; maybe Deputies or others-in the country take a more systematic and energetic interest in the Department of Education.  Otherwise, we are going to drift along as at present and the opportunities which can only be obtained to-morrow for our people's happiness and prosperity will be let slip from our grasp.</P>
    <P>On the Irish question alone, I have repeatedly asked that the Irish-speaking districts be made a separate inspectorate.  If we adopt the political catch-cry: &ldquo;English must go&rdquo;, why cannot the Irish-speaking districts be taken and made a separate inspectorate?  Why have the inspectors looking after the work in the Irish-speaking districts to keep one leg in those districts and one leg in the English-speaking districts?  There is no common sense and no systematic approach to anything inside the Department of Education.  If things were being done rightly, we would expect a vigorous aggressive propaganda from the Department against all the people who complain with regard to Irish or other subjects.  In the interest of public opinion as a whole, and in the interest of the work being done in the schools, all this criticism should be challenged, if it be challengeable.  If it cannot be challenged, the situation is all the more serious.</P>
    <P>Here we have all the raw materials for attending to our educational work, but instead of those materials being made use of, and instead of people being encouraged to take an interest in education, those people who systematically try to do constructive work&mdash;whether right or wrong in their conclusions&mdash;instead of being taken and reasoned with and the matter explained to them and public opinion set at rest, are rather challenged as if they were anti-national.  One cannot allow a position to develop here in which any aspect of our educational work is made a political issue.  The attempt is being made to take the Irish language and to seize it for Caesar, instead <Col N="272" /> of allowing it to be what it was with us when it was an inspiration and a help to us&mdash;a thing of God's.  If we allow the language to become a matter about which there is to be political division, then we are sounding the death knell of the Irish language.</P>
    <P>It is a most unexplainable thing that, either through positive action on the Minister's part or through neglect, the Irish language should be dragged into politics by a Department which can stand over a situation reported in the terms which I have read out, and which refuses to look at the Irish-speaking districts as districts which, from the educational point of view, require separate treatment and a separate inspectorate.  The Minister is continuing to look to the Irish-speaking districts for a large part of his primary school teachers for the future, in spite of the fact that he knows that that material has been criticised to some extent by both the educationists there, through whose hands they have passed, and by others connected with the professional side of education. Nevertheless, he persistently resists treating them as areas requiring special educational inspection and review. It is quite impossible to understand the Minister or the Department.</P>
    <P>This time, immediately after the general election, is not an appropriate occasion for systematically asking Parliament to review in detail various aspects of the work of this Department; but it is the time to issue a challenge to the Department and to tell the Minister that we do want inspiration, that we do want energy and activity there.  If the various other Departments and the Government generally, looking forward to the future, can outline a £7,000,000 plan for housing, a £16,000,000 plan for roads, a £7,000,000 plan for drainage, and more plans for other things running up to £60,000,000 or £100,000,000, why is it that there is no move at all to consider education as one of the important aspects of our national life, in which there must be planning and progress?</P>

      <P>Summerhill is closed. Ten weary years of battering at the <Col N="273" /> walls of Summerhill have at last brought them down.  Deputies may remember the Taoiseach saying year after year that he thought Summerhill a very nice place, and a place to which he would send his own children if they did not behave themselves, and the Minister protesting loudly that there was nothing wrong with Summerhill. Ten weary years and Summerhill is closed.  These occasions are the compensation of public life.  Sometimes one feels a little futile in public life, and then there falls from the cliff of obscurantism one fragment, and one begins to realise that the waves have not battered on that base in vain.</P>
      <P>I am delighted, Sir, to learn that Summerhill is closed.  I would be glad if the coy Minister who closed it so quietly would give us some account of the alternative accommodation he has provided in Glasnevin, and what he hopes to provide there ultimately, when all his plans have been carried to completion.  Is it going to be simply a juvenile prison, or is it going to be a properly equipped clinic, where children can be adequately examined, and necessary information compiled for the guidance of the district justice whose responsibility it is to determine what will ultimately be done with the child who is on remand?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I pass from that section of the Department of Education, I observe that the Minister deplores the increase in juvenile delinquency, and blames it on the parents.  Of course, it is a very popular thing if there is anything wrong to blame somebody else for it.  I am not in a position to challenge the Minister when he says that the parents of this country are completely failing in their duties. Some of them may be, but others are not.  I think it is a mistake to give the impression generally that we are all convinced that the whole system of parental control in this country has broken down.  We are living in queer times, and I suppose every country is experiencing the same difficulties that we are experiencing.  When general chaos obtains in the world you cannot expect children to act in an entirely normal way.  I have no doubt that <Col N="274" /> parents are doing their best, and if there is any lack of control on their part I would describe it as a reluctance on the part of certain parents adequately to support the authority of school-masters and school-mistresses. But this, I think, should be borne in mind, that in the thousands of cases where parents do support the reasonable and proper exercise of authority by school-masters, we hear nothing, but in the odd case where you get some &ldquo;daft&rdquo; father or mother who comes down and dances the can-can in the school&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because the schoolmaster has punished the child, that is plastered all over the newspapers, and there is great fuss and pother about it.  I do not think that is typical at all, and if less publicity were given to the activities of these unbalanced parents, probably that would be a valuable help to the maintenance of a proper standard of conduct amongst the young.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I applaud the sentiments expressed in the Minister's discourse on the duties of national teachers, more especially when he dwells on the vital importance of teaching the peculiar sanctity of truth.  I never indulge in criticism of the masses of the people without thinking of Deputy Cafferky's fate when he had the temerity to mention some of the shortcomings of the people.  Deputy Ó Cléirigh fought a complete election campaign on that.  I have no doubt that there are people who will say that I have described the entire juvenile population of this country as inveterate liars, but however my words may be misrepresented, I conceive it to be my duty to say I do not believe sufficient emphasis is laid in our schools on the sanctity of truth itself.  I think there is an accepted convention that if telling the truth will get you into trouble, no reasonable man should be expected to tell the truth; but provided telling the truth involves nothing but commendation or indifference, it is on the whole a desirable thing to do.  If it means <Col N="275" /> trouble or inconvenience or danger, then the general rule should be suspended and you are free to tell a lie or prevaricate, and, upon my word, if I had any message to deliver to teachers it would be to try to teach the children that a good, tough liar is infinitely preferable to a prevaricator. The boy who throws his shoulders back and goes as near damning his soul as a child can by telling deliberately a lie seems to me to be more worthy of respect than the poor, wriggling worm who has not the courage to tell a lie and does not dare to tell the truth. However, the limitation of time imposed on the discussion of the Estimates does not permit me to pursue that question as far as I would like to go.  Suffice it to say, that I am 100 per cent. with the Minister in the emphasis he laid on the necessity of teaching the children of this country not only the stuff that is in their school books, but that most important quality of manhood and decency&mdash;the ability to tell the truth, whatever the consequences may be.</P>
    <P>The Minister deplores that the industrial schools are filled to overflowing and fresh accommodation is now required.  May I direct his attention to a matter I mentioned when the Estimate for the Department of Local Government was under consideration? Industrial schools in this country are packed with children, orphan children, foundling children, never guilty of any delinquency and therefore in no sense problem children.  There is not a single one of them who would not be infinitely better off if he or she was incorporated in some Christian family. The Minister knows rural Ireland as well as I do and I think he will agree with me when I say that in every country town you will find very often respectable widowed women and sometimes respectable married couples who have incorporated in their family circle an orphan child and it is true that after the first 12 months 90 per cent. of their neighbours virtually forget the fact that that child does not belong to the family circle.  Often it is deemed to be a nephew or a blood relative of some kind that is being <Col N="276" /> taken charge of and the fact that it is a foundling which has no family background is completely lost sight of.</P>
    <P>The child grows up in a normal way and when the time comes to get a job or to marry it has a background, there is a house, a home, a father and mother, and there are brothers and sisters.  Compare that child's case with the condition of a child brought up in the best industrial school&mdash;and some of them are very good.  The schools that are run by nuns are sometimes too good to the children; they turn them out too soft.  Taking the best of that kind of school, where the children are blooming, in physical health and a definite credit to the nuns that bring them up, the time comes when the child gets a job.  In due course that child may lose or leave the job.  Compare the lot of that child with the child who has been brought up in the family circle by an adopted mother and you will find it is pitiable in the extreme.  There is no home, no background.  Take the case of such a boy or girl who is about to marry.  There is no mother or father to write saying they approve of the fiancé or fiancée; there is no home to bring the best boy or girl into; there is no background.</P>
    <P>I would commend to Deputies a most moving piece that was recently broadcast by the British Broadcasting Corporation relating to that very point of a foundling who became engaged to a girl who represented herself as being the daughter of a family in London and produced a wire from her mother conveying her good wishes and saying she looked forward to meeting this foundling boy to whom she was to be married.  It subsequently transpired that the girl herself was a foundling and had no actual family background.  The prospects of the foundling boy of getting into a good family circle and having a good background, with parents to write to, were set out in a most touching manner.  I would urge the Minister to consult with the Minister for Local Government in order to get as many children as possible taken out of the industrial schools, where they are sent for no other reason than that they are <Col N="277" /> orphans or foundlings, and put them into good Christian families.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Minister that the only serious obstacle in the way of achieving that is one of money.  If the Minister will get his colleagues, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Local Government, to provide for suitable foster parents remuneration on the same scale as the State is paying to industrial schools for the maintenance of children, half the number of children in industrial schools at the present time will go into decent families and will grow up much better citizens than they otherwise can and his problem of congested industrial schools will be very largely resolved.</P>
    <P>I want to say a word about the teaching of Irish.  Sometimes I think it is a disease that some of us suffer from that we love the language, but I cannot help suffering from it.  I get the same kick out of being able to talk Irish and having people talk it to me as I get when I arrive at Dun Laoghaire after being absent from this country for six months or more.  I do not think there is any rational explanation for that.  I think it is a deep instinct that some of us have and I think if the truth were told the vast majority of the Irish people have that instinct.  Some people argue themselves out of it because they think it is an irrational kind of reaction.  I think it is a very good reaction, a very natural reaction, and it is a reaction I rejoice in having.  I reprobate most strongly the tendency to which the leader of the Opposition has been making reference to-day, that is, the attempt to monopolise the Irish language movement, not for Caesar, but for de Valera.  We may as well be blunt and plain.  The present fiction that is being actively developed in this country by the Fianna Fáil Party is that unless you are a &ldquo;Dev&rdquo; man you are no good to the language movement.  Of course, I blame Sinn Féin for that, quite frankly.  The Sinn Féin movement was the first political movement in this country that ever tried to monopolise Irish and tried to drive out of the Gaelic League anyone who was not of good standing in the Sinn <Col N="278" /> Féin movement.  I thought after the State had been set up here that the error of that procedure was realised by everybody and that a very genuine effort was going to be made to get back to the position in which all sections of the community, whatever their political outlook might be, would be mustered and gladly welcomed in the ranks of the language movement. There is not the slightest doubt now that an effort is being made to turn Irish into a monopoly of the Fianna Fáil Party.  We have all seen the immense amount of ground that was lost as a result of the Sinn Féin incursion into the Gaelie League.  The Gaelic League is now one of the most disreputable bodies in this country and no respectable man&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is as Taoiseach that the effort is being made to monopolise Irish.  That would not sound well.  The object is &ldquo;Dev. Irish; Irish Dev.&rdquo;  There is no question of the Taoiseach involved at all. It is a political ramp, and it is doing the language movement terrible harm, and will kill the language movement if it is allowed to go on.  I am not going to pursue that line of country, because, up to a couple of years ago, I felt that if we all got together, there was no doubt of our ability to save the language.  Now I am beginning to doubt even whether our united effort would be sufficient to save the language. Therefore, I am asking the <Col N="279" /> Minister, as I asked him last year and the year before, will he set up a commission to inquire into the methods at present being employed by his Department of Education for the promotion of the Irish language?  I say that the system of attempting to teach children through the medium of Irish in infant classes, when the teachers are not competent to do it, when the children do not understand the language, when the language is not the vernacular of their own homes, is thoroughly bad.  I say the system of trying to teach children in the higher classes through the medium of Irish, albeit certain safeguards are contained in the Department's regulations, is thoroughly bad. It is true that the Department lays down that no teacher who is not competent to teach through the medium of Irish shall be required to do so.  How many teachers in this country are going to hold themselves out as persons incompetent to teach through the medium of Irish?  Of course, what happens is that every unfortunate teacher tries to teach through the medium of Irish if he or she has any kind of equipment at all.  The children do not know the language; the teachers very often do not know the language with sufficient fluency to teach them. I remember the Taoiseach saying in the House that, with his knowledge of the language, he would not dream of attempting to teach through the medium of Irish, he would find it too difficult to express himself with the exactitude he thought it was the duty of a teacher to employ when teaching. If that is going to continue, I believe not only the language but the whole education of our people is going to be ruined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to say anything to-say calculated to exacerbate feeling, though I could say plenty.  I do not want to exacerbate feeling because I am passionately anxious to secure that our people should be able to speak Irish&mdash;and English.  With that stated, I want to make this clear, that if the language movement in this country is going to be founded on the thesis that English must go; that our people are going to be turned into a monolingual <Col N="280" /> Irish-speaking people, I will fight it with all the resources at my command. Is that plain?  We may as well be clear on it.  If the new departure is that our people are to be stripped of the English language, which has been a bulwark of strength to them during years of oppression and assault upon this country, which has enabled them to make the case of Ireland heard all over the world when those who were concerned to destroy us could have done so, had we not that invaluable means of communication for the defence of our legitimate rights, if the policy of the Department of Education is to strip our people of that and to put them in the same position as Poles or Greeks in the United States of America, or throughout the Commonwealth of Nations, wherever our young people may elect to go in pursuit of an opportunity of earning their living or making their fortunes, then I will fight any such policy with all the resources at my disposal.  If, on the other hand, the Department is concerned to enable every educated person in this country to speak Irish with the same fluency that he speaks English, 95 per cent. of the people of goodwill in this country will be prepared to help them.</P>
    <P>I strongly appeal to the Minister, representing the Fianna Fáil Party, not to split this country to its foundations on the language question, because if you do you will kill the language. There is no need to split; there is no ill-will; there is no one against you on the question of reviving the language itself.  There is no appreciable section of our people opposed to that. The only deep difference between us is one as to method.  For the resolution of that difference, I ask you to set up a commission to inquire into the last 20 years' work and see how your methods can be improved.</P>
    <P>I see the Minister plans to erect a large number of new schools.  Well, indeed, it is not before its time.  A great many national schools in this country are a disgrace.  That is largely his fault, but it is partially the fault of the school managers, or the parish priests who do not exert themselves to get their schools put into proper <Col N="281" /> condition.  I trust that the Minister will exert himself vigorously and, where a parish priest acting as a school manager, fails to take sufficiently active measures to set on foot an adequate building scheme for the schools in his parish which require to be rebuilt, that the Minister will ginger him up and direct his attention to the fact that he is failing in his duty as a manager if he does not make proposals to the Department for the repair of his schools.</P>
    <P>I would again urge on the Minister the desirability, in selected areas at least, of erecting central schools and, instead of having a whole lot of bandboxes with inadequate sanitary and other accommodation scattered over remote places in rural Ireland, that he should erect shelters where those inadequate schools would otherwise have been placed and arrange for bus services to call at these shelters at fixed hours every morning and bring the children from, say, eight or ten national school areas into one properly-equipped central school where you can have playgrounds, proper classrooms, proper equipment, a proper staff and sufficient accommodation and equipment to provide the children with some sort of luncheon in the middle of the day, which the children could either bring with them and have prepared in the school or which, in certain circumstances, might be provided by the school authorities.  It would be very good training for the girls going to the girls' school if they were taught how to prepare the simple luncheon intended for all the children and let the boys help to light the fires and do other chores of that kind.  I sometimes hear Deputies complain that children are asked to light fires and dust classrooms, that it is an outrage on their dignity, but I think if children were taught to cook and other little light chores it would be very good for them.</P>
    <P>I want to remonstrate again with the Minister for that I am continually harassed by young men and young women who want to get into agricultural and domestic colleges, but there is no place for them.  They do not want to get in free; they want to pay fees, but there is no vacancy.  I am told there is no <Col N="282" /> room for them.  Surely in a country like this that is fantastic.  Might I urge on the Minister that, in consultation with the Minister for Agriculture, he should provide accommodation for any student who wants to get a scientific education in agriculture as readily as he can get a secondary education at present?  I direct the Minister's attention to the example of the Diocese of Clogher, where the diocesan authorities opened a diocesan agricultural college, so that any boy who wants to pursue an academic career can go to St. Macartan's, and those who want to equip themselves to work their father's land better than it was worked before, to the agricultural college.  Surely the Minister could arrange that such accommodation would at least be provided in each diocese, and that for girls who want to learn domestic economy, and equip themselves to be efficient mothers and housekeepers, schools would be available to go into, if they are prepared to enter them.</P>
    <P>I want to come to a matter which I think calls for an explanation.  There has been an appointment made recently in the technical branch of the Department of Education of a new chief inspector.  I understand there is an obligation on the Minister, if he is going to promote an officer in his Department, to certify to the Minister for Finance that the officer whom he proposes for promotion is not only competent, but the best qualified person in his Department for the position to which he proposes to transfer him. Nevertheless, recently when he came to appoint a chief inspector of the technical branch in the Department of Education, a divisional inspector of the national schools was taken from the primary branch, and, although he had been seconded for a couple of years to the technical branch prior to his appointment to the position of chief inspector, he was chosen as chief inspector of the technical education division in preference to men who had been for many years in the technical education division of the Department of Education, men whose qualifications were infinitely higher.  I do not know any of the gentlemen involved.  My <Col N="283" /> only acquaintance with Dr. Proinnsias Ó Súilleabháin is to have seen him 20 years ago dancing Irish dances in Ballingeary Irish College.  So far as the other officers of the technical branch are concerned, I have never seen or spoken to them, and I would not know them if I did see them.  Dr. Ó Súilleabháin has not a degree from an Irish university.</P>

      <P>I do not want to be unjust to anybody, but I have a duty to discharge.  I quite agree that you have a grave obligation to members of the Civil Service not unduly to draw them into the sphere of controversy, but what are you to do if you come to the conclusion that a very serious error of judgment has been made by the Minister in the appointment of an officer to a most important position in the technical instruction branch of the service?  I do not know what I can do.  I want to make this crystal clear.  There is no reflection, good, bad or indifferent on the personal honour or integrity of Dr. Ó Súilleabháin, none whatever.  The <Col N="284" /> only matter I am concerned to raise is whether his qualifications&mdash;and I mean his academic qualifications, not his personal character or anything of that kind; that is not in question at all-whether his professional qualifications, as set out by himself, compare with those of alternative appointees who have a long record of service in the technical instruction branch of the Department of Education.  If the Minister says to me in reply: &ldquo;Admitting that these other gentlemen have higher academic qualifications, the personality of this candidate was so exceptional that, on personal interview, preference was given to him over persons who had higher technical qualifications,&rdquo; then I think the Minister answers me.  But I direct attention to an article in the public Press relating to this very matter and I think, far from doing Dr. Ó Súilleabháin any disservice by raising the matter and the Minister by answering this, I do him and his colleagues in the Department to which he belongs a service, because I take it the Minister would feel some delicacy about referring to the article in the <i>Irish School Weekly</i> unless the substance of it was raised in the House, thus affording an opportunity of explaining his own conduct and the administration of that section of the Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am regretfully compelled to say that all the evidence suggests to me that he has done so in this case, and I am obliged to bring these facts before the House.  I should be long sorry to do any member of the Civil Service of this country any injustice, but I am bound to direct the attention of the House to these facts, and that on the clear understanding that I know none of these gentlemen. I have never conversed with them; I have never been in correspondence with them; and I never had any contact with any of them, except to see Dr. O'Sullivan dancing in Ballingeary College 20 years ago when he was, I think, teaching there and I was learning the Irish language.</P>
      <P>The present chief inspector of the technical education division of the Department, Dr. O'Sullivan, has no Irish University degree at all.  He is a Doctor of Philosophy of the University of Freiburg in Germany.  He was subsequently employed there as a lecturer in English, and his employers in that University speak highly of his work as Professor of English.  He then came home and, I think, in 1925, was appointed inspector of national schools.  In 1936 he became divisional inspector.  When he was appointed to that position some surprise was expressed at the rapid progress he had made in the service, considering the academic qualifications which he was in a position to display.  Then, there was this transfer from the division in the Department in which he had done all his work to the technical branch, and having been seconded there for two years, where he was training teachers of Irish for the vocational technical schools and conducting summer courses in Irish for vocational teachers, and doing nothing else, he was suddenly appointed chief inspector of the technical branch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="286" /> Some people might say that there was nobody else in the division fitted for the job, but there was an officer there who was educated from the first day he went to school, in Ballingeary, which is in the Gaeltacht.  He was an honours student at school; he secured a scholarship to the College of Science; he is an Associate of the Royal College of Science in the Faculty of Applied Chemistry.  He is a B.A., a Master of Science of Queen's University, Belfast, and first class, first division, City and Guilds of London Institute, Mechanical Engineering, which is not a very high qualification although it sounds very beautiful when you read it out.  He had 16 years' teaching experience and he had been in sole charge of a primary school.  He was a teacher of Mathematics and Applied Science in a secondary school and head of the engineering department, Methodist College, Belfast, for many years before he joined our Civil Service.  He was an extra-mural lecturer in Physics in Queen's University, Belfast, and a lecturer in Mathematics, Plane and Solid Geometry and Physics, Municipal College of Technology, Belfast.  In addition, he was I believe a very fluent Irish speaker.  He was a member of an coisde ceanntair of Connradh na Gaedhilge in Belfast, and has every conceivable qualification from the point of view of the language that a man could have.</P>
    <P>There was also in the Department another officer who was an A.R.C.Sc.I., Bachelor of Science in the National University and had the National Diploma in Agriculture.  He got first place in the British Isles and was the winner of the Fream Memorial Prize. He conducted courses in rural science for national teachers and has a string of qualifications.  There was also another officer in that division who was a Bachelor of Engineering, an A.R.C.Sc.I, and who had 24 years' service as an inspector in the technical division.  He had teaching experience and had been employed in engineering works in America and was the author of several works on literary criticism.</P>
    <P>There was another officer in that department who was a Doctor of Science, London University.  He had <Col N="287" /> 24 years' service as an inspector in the technical branch and is the author of an economic history of Ireland.  He had specialised in economics and commerce. Another officer was a Master of Science of the National University of Ireland.  He had been a secondary teacher and had 15 years' service as an inspector of the technical branch and had a number of high qualifications in Irish.  He specialised in Mathematics and Science.  Yet when the choice had to be made of chief inspector of that Department, Dr. O'Sullivan was chosen, and so far as I know, Dr. O'Sullivan had no special qualifications at all for the position.</P>
    <P>In justice to the chief inspector of the technical division, in justice to the Department, in justice to the other officers of the Department and the country as a whole, I think it behoves the Minister to tell the House why he gave this officer the special preferment he received, when he was in the primary branch and was made a divisional inspector, and why, having given him that special preferment in the primary branch, he chose to remove him from that branch and give him unprecedented preferment over the heads of other distinguished men who had given long service to the Department in a branch where Dr. O'Sullivan had virtually no experience whatever as compared with the officers to whom he was preferred.  Let me reaffirm that there is no conceivable reflection on the personal character or integrity of Dr. O'Sullivan, or any other officer of the Department.  Their personal character is not involved in this matter.  It is merely a question of how the Minister will satisfy the House that he discharged his statutory obligation by recommending to the Minister for Finance not only a competent officer for preferment in the service but the most highly qualified person available to him in the service.</P>
    <P>I want now to draw the attention of the House to a very odd interlude and to ask the Minister to tell us what the end of it was.  Some time ago, an enterprising gentleman approached the Department of Education and inquired if they would be interested in a glossary <Col N="288" /> of words from the Dingle peninsula. The Department said that they would be very much interested, and he said he was prepared to depart to the Dingle peninsula and return in due course with a glossary of words used, if not exclusively, primarily in the Dingle peninsula.  The Dingle peninsula is a pretty limited area and the Department apparently thought that its geographical limits imposed certain etymological limits on a glossary which was to be exclusively derived from that restricted area, and accordingly, they were persuaded to enter into an arrangement with this enterprising etymologist that they would pay for his work at the rate of £2 per 1,000 words.</P>
    <P>I think the Department were under the impression that they were getting a bargain, but they had not reckoned with the enterprise of the etymologist. He furled his umbrella, brushed his hat and disappeared into the Dingle peninsula. Nothing more was heard of him until he emerged therefrom with 100,000 words.  The Department, looking a bit green about the gills, stumped up, whereupon he furled his umbrella and disappeared again.  He next emerged with 250,000 words, and the Department, looking greener still, stumped up.  When he had produced his 2,000,000th word, the Department began to say: &ldquo;Is there any end to the number of words which he can produce?&rdquo; He was furling his umbrella and starting on the third million, at which stage the Department said: &ldquo;Really, a halt must be called to this&rdquo;, and some arrangement was made whereby the etymologist was tamed.  We are now in possession, I believe, of something like 2,200,000 words from this etymological research in the Dingle peninsula, and what I want to know is whether we are going to publish them, because there will be an acute paper shortage if the fruits of this gentleman's research are to be committed to print.  I want the Minister to tell the House whether he is satisfied that the etymological research conducted in the Dingle peninsula required the employment of 2,200,000 words, and whether he will have the mighty oak which sprang from so small an acorn competently pruned before it is committed to book form? <Col N="289" /> I think the Department, to say the least of it, was surprised&mdash;I will not say more than that&mdash;by the result of this business, but I suppose it is an error into which any of us might fall. It will not happen again, I am sure, but I think we should take effective measures to ensure that the glossary will not be published as it has been submitted, and that competent hands will be employed to reduce it to reasonable compass if it is ever published at all.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which I want to mention, and that is in relation to the Institute of Higher Studies. When the proposal to set up that institute came before this House, there was a good deal of difference of opinion as to its merits.  I defended it on the grounds that I thought it was a good and proper thing to provide a place where scholars of first quality would be assured of a reasonable income and proper leisure to do the peculiar type of work that men of that temperament would be called upon to do, but I do not know whether Deputies in this House have observed that in the course of the last couple of years a most astonishing collection of gentlemen has been gathered into the institute.  We all acknowledge that Dr. O'Rahilly, Dr. O'Brien, Dr. Best, Dr. Schroedinger, and men of that kind, are great scholars of whom any institute might be proud.</P>
    <P>When I mention those men I do not intend to suggest that there is no other scholar of distinction in the institute, but, in addition to the men of distinction, I want to submit to this House that there has been gathered into the fold of the institute a number of men who, I think, require to be explained to the Oireachtas, which is paying for them.  <i>Prima facie,</i> their qualifications and their record of published work do not entitle them to positions in the Institute of Higher Studies.  It may be that they were brought in as amanuenses. It may be that they were brought in without any reference to their scholarly achievements.  If that is so, let the Minister tell us that. Let him tell us that he has collected a new kind of person who has to be quartered on the institute, and that is <Col N="290" /> persons whose academic distinctions or achievements can secure them employment nowhere else.  Do not let us have confusion created in the public mind.  All must rejoice in the summoning home of men like Dr. O'Brien, scholars of national repute, but do not let us confuse persons of that standing with some of the less laudable appointments to the institute which have been made recently.</P>
    <P>We understood, when the institute was being established, that it was designed for the promotion of higher studies and the amplification of learning in this country.  When the Bill was passing through here, there was incorporated in it Section 20 (4), which provided that the conditions of employment of the members of the academic staff should be subject to the approval of the Minister for Education and the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.  These conditions included the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The appointee shall devote his time and ability to the furtherance of the work assigned to the school by the Act and the Establishment Order establishing the school; and he shall perform any duties assigned to him by the governing board or the director of the school, or the senior professor, or professor, who has immediate charge of his work, as appropriate to his office.  Except in so far as may be otherwise permitted by the council of the institute with the consent of the governing board of the school, contributions to learning which result from study or research carried on by him shall be the property of the school and may be published only in accordance with Section 22 of the Institute for Advanced Studies Act, 1940.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I imagined, and I think most people who were concerned with that Bill when it was passing through this House also assumed, that that imposed an obligation on any man working in the institute, if he did an original piece of research, to offer it to the institute before he offered it to anybody else, and that he was free to publish it elsewhere only if the institute rejected it. I do not think any of us read that <Col N="291" /> section as meaning that we were setting up as hidebound a censorship on the work of men employed by the institute as has ever been claimed by Dr. Goebbels in academic institutions in Germany or by the Minister of Higher Culture in Moscow in academic institutions in Russia.  Nevertheless, here is the way it has been interpreted by the director of the institute, who sent out the following memorandum to the members of the academic staff about nine months ago:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Members of the staff are reminded that, by the conditions of service of their appointment, all work done by them in connection with any branch of Celtic Studies, whether such work is done in the school or independently thereof, is the property of the school, and may be published only through the school, except in so far as may be otherwise permitted by the council and the governing board.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The governing board has made an order that when permission has been granted to a member of the school to publish any piece of work elsewhere, the author is to add the words &lsquo;Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies&rsquo; after his name.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Members of the staff who happen to have done in their spare time work which they are desirous of publishing are requested to bear in mind the above facts and to consult the director as to the most suitable means of publishing such work.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That means that if a junior member of the staff or any other person in the institute does work designed to prove that instead of two St. Patricks there was one St. Patrick, he cannot publish that piece of work unless he gets the permission of the director of the institute, who is prepared to demonstrate that there are two St. Patricks. Surely that is a situation which ought not to obtain.  It may be very proper that a junior member of the staff of the institute should submit his work to the director, and, if the director so desires, it may be included in the official journal of the institute, or he <Col N="292" /> may say: &ldquo;I do not choose to publish that; I do not think it is good work.&rdquo; There is a very great difference between the director saying: &ldquo;I do not think the quality of that work is sufficiently high to justify publication in our journal&rdquo;, and his prohibiting its publication altogether, because as I have pointed out in Dáil Eireann before, many a thing was published in or about 1880 by independent minds, which would have been spat upon as being puerile, obscurantist rubbish by the scholars of that age.  If these people had tried to prove that it was Catholic doctrine they were advocating, they would have been laughed at by the scholars of the Victorian age, but nevertheless they were free to publish their views.  It seems to me that if the students or junior professors of the institute have independent views and wish to publish them, they will be prohibited from doing so, whereas, in the primitive Victorian age, such scholars as Darwin and Huxley were quite free to publish their works.  Now, the passage of time has proved that Darwin and Huxley were wrong, whereas the others, who might be regarded as pygmies in relation to the great scholars in those days, have been proved to be right.  The point is that they were free to publish their views.</P>
    <P>Now, the Director of the Institute for Advanced Studies, undoubtedly, is a very big man in his own sphere, but there may be a man within the ranks of the institute who has his own views &mdash;possibly a junior member of the institute&mdash;and surely such a man should have the right to publish his work elsewhere, if the institute will not publish it.  I do not see why the institute should be sacrosanct in that respect. If the person concerned publishes rubbish, and if it is demonstrated that, by doing so, he is bringing discredit on the institute to which he is affiliated, then he can be discharged from the institute for causes stated, on the ground, for instance, that his work is of such a disreputable character that the institute cannot standover it; but surely it was never meant that the institute should be of such a character that no views of its members could be <Col N="293" /> published which did not coincide with those of Professor Tomás O'Rahilly, so long as he is a director of the institute. If that is the case, then I think that we have established a very retrograde departure in the educational life of this country, and I would ask the Minister for Education to take this matter up at once with the Taoiseach who, I believe, is personally interested in the institute, and with the director of the institute, with a view to seeing that in future any junior member of the staff who wishes to publish anything he wants to publish shall be compelled to offer it, first, to the institute, and that if, within a given time, the institute does not indicate its readiness to publish his work, the writer thereof shall have full freedom to publish his work when and where he likes.</P>
    <P>A great principle seems to me to be involved here, and I think that no question of expediency should be allowed to obscure the greater good; the scholars in this country should be free to publish what they believe to be true, and not just what Professor Tomás O'Rahilly believes to be true. I believe that all sections in the House would be prepared to adhere to the principle I am now advocating, and I would suggest that before the debate is over, some other members of the House should press on the Minister the desirability of reform in regard to this matter.  That is all I have to say, and I trust that the Minister will not fail to deal with the points I have made, with special reference to the Institute for Advanced Studies, and also with regard to the matter of the chief inspector of the Department of Education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with the matter of education, Sir, one must not think that a school is the beginning and the end-all of education.  The pupil's welfare in a school must get first consideration, and I would suggest to the Minister that in many parts of the City of Dublin&mdash;I can only speak for the City of Dublin&mdash;the pupils are going to school barefooted, badly clothed, and sometimes into a cold atmosphere without adequate heat for drying their clothing when they arrive on a wet day.  I have been in schools in <Col N="294" /> Dublin which, as one Deputy said, were a disgrace to any Government: schools to which children go on a cold winter's day, with empty fireplaces. and no way to dry their clothes.  I raised the question before about the heating of schools, and I suggested the increasing of a grant by the Department of Education to school managers for that purpose.  I hope the Minister will continue in that direction with a view to seeing that the schools are properly heated.  The Minister deplored, and very properly, that the industrial schools were overcrowded.  Now, in many cases, these industrial schools have, as inmates, children who should be at home with their own parents. Because of absence from school or because, if you wish, of neglect on the part of the parents, many of these children are sent to industrial institutions. The parents complain that they did not send the children to school because they were unable to dress them properly, or to provide boots or stockings for them.  Now, when these children are taken from their parents and sent to an industrial school, they are properly clad and provided with shoes, stockings, and so on, but I am of opinion that it would be better if the sums of money that are spent in that direction were provided for the parents of these children in order to enable them to clothe their children properly, where they can make a reasonable case that they are unable to afford the money for clothes, boots, and so on.  If that were done, I suggest that the industrial schools would not be overcrowded to the extent that the Minister has complained of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that connection, may I draw attention to what I consider to be a grave injustice to Dublin children who are sent to industrial schools, merely because of non-attendance at schools; and that is that very often they are sent to industrial institutions that are as far away as from 200 to 250 miles from the city.  For instance, children are taken from the poorer quarters of Dublin and sent down to Cork, to some place off the sea coast of Cork, where there is an industrial school.  Now, that means that when the holidays come around, the children must stay in that institution, and the parents have <Col N="295" /> no way of seeing their children.  No return half-ticket is provided.  I mentioned this matter to the Minister before.  He was sympathetic, and I rather gathered, from his sympathetic reply to me, that in the case of the parents of children sent from Dublin to industrial schools at long distances from the city, he would provide them with tickets to enable them to visit their children at least once or twice a year, or else provide facilities for the children to come up and see their parents at least once or twice a year. It would appear, however, that his Department is sadly lacking in appreciation of the parents' love for their children and their desire to see them at certain times in the year.</P>
    <P>I suggest that when the holiday season comes round, the Minister, in the case of a child sent to an industrial school at a long distance from the city, should give him or her a ticket to return home, and that, if possible, in the case of a group of two or three of these children coming up to the City of Dublin, a guardian from the school should be sent with them to see them safely home.  When these children are taken from their homes, as the Minister knows, a half-ticket is provided for them, in order to send them, as I say, between 200 and 250 miles away, but yet, when we ask that these children should be sent home for the holidays it would appear that there is no fund at the disposal of the Department for that purpose.  I hold there is, and if there is not, there should be.  If the Minister has not the necessary funds, every member of the House will support him in asking the Minister for Finance for moneys for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I heard quite recently that in the ordinary schools in Dublin great difficulty is experienced in getting necessary equipment in cases where people find that, owing to low wages or no wages, they are not able to provide such equipment for their children.  We were told some few years ago that free books would be given to the children. I am informed that it is almost impossible to get these free books and that in some cases the forms which children or their parents are asked to sign contain rather objectionable <Col N="296" /> phrases.  I was also told quite recently that children in a very large school in the City of Dublin were asked to bring money to school to provide equipment that should be provided by the Minister&mdash;pencils, paper and ink.</P>
    <P>These are part and parcel of the educational equipment and children or their parents should not be asked to provide them.  If, of course, they are able to afford to give their children extras in that direction, good and well, but I think it is the duty of the educational authorities to provide such equipment for poor children.  I also heard that in some of the kindergarten schools where children are taught knitting and sewing they are asked to provide the equipment themselves and that some children and their parents feel very hurt when they are not able to provide the same materials for their education as is provided for children next door.  I hold that in that respect an injustice is imposed upon one class as against another and that everything that is necessary for the education of children in the schools should be provided by the State if the parent cannot provide it.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made a reference to child delinquency.  I think that the incidence of child delinquency is somewhat exaggerated.  We are inclined to blame the school child for damage and vandalism perpetrated by grown-up boys of 16 or 18 years of age, boys who left school at 14 or 15 and for whom the State or nobody else was able to provide employment.  There is a great deal of neglect in that respect.  It is really heartbreaking to mothers when their boys or girls reach the age of 14 or 15 to find that they cannot get suitable occupations.  I am satisfied that every member of the House has had at some time or other the experience of a parent coming to him and saying: &ldquo;My boy is now aged 15.  He is the eldest of seven.  For God's sake, can you get him a job anywhere?&rdquo;  There are no jobs for them.  In this city there is an average every year of 20,000 boys between the ages of 14 and 16 who are left absolutely idle.  We all know the old phrase: &ldquo;The devil finds work for idle hands to do.&rdquo;  There are no playing fields for most of these boys.  The <Col N="297" /> boys are generally strong, healthy lads and they want to use their hands and feet.  A branch of a tree is broken or some other damage is done simply because very few people in this country have paid any attention to the problem of finding useful employment for boys at that age.  I say very few people, because there are certain clubs in the city devoted to this work which are not getting sufficient encouragement from the Government or the municipalities in dealing with this problem.  We have that excellent organisation known as the St. John Bosco Boys' Club.  Other institutions such as the Christian Brothers' Club, the Belvedere and Clongowes Club, and the Boy Scout movement are doing great work for boys between the ages of 14 and 18 but they are not getting sufficient encouragement from either the Government or the municipalities.  Playing fields are necessary for grown-up boys and playing grounds are also needed for children under 14 years of age.  I would appeal to the Minister to take up that matter with the Department of Local Government and the Department of Finance and so make an effort to improve the lot of boys and girls who find it impossible to get work when they leave school.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to a new matter or rather to a matter which is a revival of a certain question affecting schools. Four years ago the Dublin Corporation and other public bodies agitated for hot meals in schools for schoolchildren. We went so far as to provide equipment in the Mansion House and in other parts of the city to be ready for the emergency period when hot meals could not be provided in the homes and when we would be prepared to provide such meals.  I ask the Minister and every Deputy has the time not arrived now when provision should be made to give such hot meals?  Children are now going home at a time when the gas is off. The people whom I have in mind have no electrical equipment for cooking.  I would appeal to the Minister to take steps immediately or at any rate to look ahead and make arrangements so <Col N="298" /> that this equipment could be made available at a moment's notice to take the place of the equipment which can no longer be used in the homes of these children.  In the cottage dwellings of the city and in nearly every tenement room there is what is known as a penny-in-the-slot gas ring or gas stove.  These are now being reduced in number or are being taken away from the people.  Only a few days ago we read in the paper a notice advising people to take more cold meals, cold meats, etc.  I think there are about 40,000 children attending school for whom the Corporation of Dublin provide free lunches.  Deputy O'Sullivan, the Lord Mayor, will correct me if I am wrong.  Of these, 30,000 get milk and a jam or cheese sandwich and it was expected that when they went home they would have a hot meal.  Now when they go home there is no means of providing a hot meal for them.  I think the time has come when the Minister for Education should reconsider this question.</P>
    <P>There is just one other matter which some parents asked me to mention and of which I hope the Minister will take note.  These parents want to know why schools in the city give holidays at different times.  They think that there should be a fixed period for children's holidays so that they can have all the children home from school at the same time.  If that were done, any parents who could afford to do so could bring their children on holidays with them.  Owing to the high cost of living, most parents have to be content with bringing their children to the Phoenix Park or the Bull Wall or Merrion Strand.  These are the holiday resorts of Dublin working-class people.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to give consideration to the points I mentioned, especially the point regarding the provision of boots for children.  A school attendance committee has reported that last year 800 children were brought before the committee or the children's court, and that the parents explained that their children could not attend school because they had no boots or clothing for them.  Up to that time, they had never sent their children <Col N="299" /> to school without being properly clothed.  The Minister mentioned a few weeks ago, before the House broke up, that a scheme was being considered to provide boots and clothing for necessitous people and for members of the small income classes.  He ought to do something quickly and bring to an end this complaint of school attendance officers that children are not attending school.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The problems and difficulties which will confront this country immediately on the conclusion of the war, because of the opportunities and the disadvantages which a situation of that character is likely to bring about, constitute an unanswerable argument for the setting up of a commission of inquiry into our system of education.  If neither these problems nor opportunities were to exist, the very fact that we have now had experience for 20 years of our present system of education is an argument for an inquiry as to whether that system is calculated to yield the best results to the children of our country.  The Constitution places in a very definite place of priority the responsibility of parents for the education of their children. Like many other things in the Constitution, that is a mere pious platitude because it is only on such an occasion as this&mdash;when the Estimates for the Department of Education are presented to this House every 12 months &mdash;that an opportunity is presented to Deputies, who represent the parents, to express their view on the system of education in force for the previous 12 months and make such suggestions as will enable the Minister to arrange matters properly for the ensuing 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the position at the present time across the water.  A consultative committee was set up there which produced the most valuable results in respect of different branches of education&mdash;primary, secondary and adolescent. The reports of the committee served as the basis, to a great extent, of the Bill which was recently brought before the British House of Commons and which was a definite advance on <Col N="300" /> any system of education which existed in that country previously.  Since this question of parental responsibility is emphasised in the Constitution, I suggest that it is time to implement the claim made here for a number of years and by educational authorities outside for the setting up of a committee which would include representatives of parents, managers, teachers and others concerned.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that, having regard to his long experience as Minister and his own personal association with the work and having regard to the situation likely to arise in the postwar period, it is essential now to take a step about which he has been hesitant for many years.  He has been taking the line that the members of his Department and he are the people most competent to decide educational questions.  Other countries have taken a wider view and it is about time that such a view was given effect to here.</P>
    <P>I should like to ascertain from the Minister&mdash;I am sorry he is not in the House at the moment&mdash;what the position is likely to be from the point of view of the Department regarding the building of new schools and the reconstruction of other schools.  It is to be regretted&mdash;I share that regret and I appreciate the position&mdash;that circumstances have slowed up the drive so far as national schools are concerned. We had experience in the city of excellent work in the building of a large number of new schools.  Is the Department in a position to take advantage of the situation immediately building difficulties ease, so as to remedy a state of affairs which has been characterised here many times as an absolute scandal?  Another aspect of this question which was previously referred to in this House is the size of classes which teachers are called upon, particularly in city schools, to take charge of.  There are classes of from 50 to 70 pupils in some cases.  Anybody remotely associated with teaching knows that it is absurd to attempt to impart education to a class of from 50 to 70 children.  The most that any teacher can do in such a class is to maintain a certain amount of discipline during the day.  Attention has been repeatedly <Col N="301" /> drawn to this appalling state of affairs so far as city schools are concerned. My information is that that position still obtains and that despite the fact that upwards of 200 teachers will be unemployed by the 30th of this month. For the life of me, I cannot understand why the Department has not taken strong and stringent steps to remedy this situation.  Children are crying out for admission to our schools and, when they get there, they are deprived of that individual touch which is so desirable, particularly in the case of primary education.</P>
    <P>As regards the training of teachers, we could have the most ideal form of building, excellent playing fields&mdash;I am glad that matter has been referred to because the first care of the Department should be to see that a playing field is attached to every school so as to uproot the cause of juvenile delinquency&mdash;and all other facilities&mdash;but if the teaching was not up to standard the provision of these facilities would have been in vain.  At present, only one training college is in operation for male teachers.  Because of the drop-off in the flow of recruits from the preparatory colleges for some time, this college will close down at the end of this month.</P>
    <P>I understand that as a result, including those who will come out of training at the end of the month, and those already partially employed, roughly 200 teachers are thrown on the hands of the Department.  That seems to me to indicate a complete lack of vision and foresight, as far as the Department is concerned, to allow such a serious position to arise It has arisen from the introduction of the system of preparatory colleges.  No doubt the people who brought about that particular system did so with the very best intentions, but it has been a failure, and I think the Department had better stand up to it and say that it is a failure.</P>
    <P>The idea of bringing children into preparatory colleges and keeping them in college surroundings for four years, and subsequently sending them for another two years to training colleges, with the idea of training them as teachers, does not make commonsense. <Col N="302" /> In the case of a child of 14, with the primary purpose of starting out as a teacher, every Deputy will agree that such children do not know where he or she is drifting.  It is a notorious fact that for a number of years there are individuals in these training colleges who feel that they are out of their depth.  They regret having spent so many years preparing for a profession for which they feel unsuited.  The preparatory college system has been a failure.  These colleges were set up in certain districts, the object being to bring students into close touch with people who are speaking the native language.  Such a system was never put into operation.  These students were kept, practically, in the close confinement in the colleges so that the original purpose was defeated.</P>
    <P>What of the standards which obtain in the training colleges?  It is a well-known fact that the training of a great percentage of our teachers is at present confined to two parishes, Ballyferriter and The Rosses.  It is also well known that a certain amount of reservations have been set aside for these students, and that no matter how brilliant other students may be, who would like to enter the teaching profession, they are precluded until a certain number in the Fíor-Ghaedealtacht were first settled. My information&mdash;and I would like to have a contradiction of it from the Minister&mdash;is that some of these candidates got their final diplomas without taking English or mathematics as subjects and that in fact the standard in these two subjects, as far as future teachers are concerned, is lamentably low.  That applies to Irish grammar and to English grammar.  I understand that that is the position and that it is viewed with alarm by responsible educationists. The Minister has a serious responsibility to explain to the House how a situation of that kind has been allowed to develop.  I suggest to him that the whole question of training ought to be reviewed.  There is plenty of room for doing so.  The Minister will first of all have to take into consideration the standard of remuneration that the Department proposes to give to the teaching profession, in order to ensure that the best brains of the <Col N="303" /> country will be rewarded as they should be, in the noblest profession that we have.  It is within the knowledge of the House that for years and years the teaching profession has been decrying the small salaries being paid.  These salaries can never be reckoned as adequate, having regard to the work performed, and the position will continue to be worse as time goes on, unless there is a clear indication that the question of salaries is once and for all satisfactorily settled.</P>
    <P>On the question of the standard of education, so far as the schools are concerned, I understand that the programme is not all that might be desired. Subjects like nature study and drawing are completely ignored because of the exigencies of the programme. If subjects of that character cannot be included, that constitutes an argument for raising the school age, to ensure that such subjects will be available to students between 14 and 16 years of age.  School attendance is a serious question for the teachers because of falling averages.  Everybody is familiar with the state of affairs that prevails, particularly in rural areas, when school children are taken away for other work, and how the position of the teachers is affected.  I suggest that attendance at schools at the present time might be regarded in the light of the emergency and treated on that basis.  I am not a teacher and I have no association with teaching, except that I am in close contact with teachers from time to time, and know their circumstances.  What struck me as an intolerable rule of the Department was that when a teacher becomes ill he must provide a substitute after a given time, and in certain circumstances. I am not daring to advocate that the same system should obtain in other branches of the Civil Service. Teachers are servants of the State, but in the other branches of the Civil Service the position is dealt with in the ordinary way, and it passes my comprehension why such an exception is made in the case of teachers.</P>
    <P>There is also discrimination when teachers retire.  They must have 40 years' service before they can get half <Col N="304" /> salary as pension.  In addition, no provision is made, as in other Departments of State, that on retirement teachers will get at least a year's gratuity.  The payment of salaries is a matter that also affects teachers in the lower scales.  As one associated with a concern that is called upon to pay a great deal more than the Department of Education pays, I cannot understand why the Department is not able to ensure that teachers will get their salaries a day or so after the 30th of the month, and not have to wait for eight or nine days in the subsequent month.  I suggest that a business arrangement could be made so that payments will flow promptly after the 30th of each month as obtains in other branches of the Civil Service and in business establishments.  The delay imposes an undeniable hardship on teachers, particularly those on the lower scales.  May I say that there is a demand, and it is one that is understandable in the circumstances, that there might be more frequent payments of salaries, say, mid-monthly?</P>
    <P>Surely, that would not impose such a heavy strain on the Department in the case of teachers who desire such payments.  I know of business institutions in which sections of the staff, if they so desire, can have half their salaries on the 15th of each month.  I suggest to the Minister that some arrangement of that kind might be made particularly in areas like Dublin and Cork, where living conditions press heavily on the members in the lower grades of the service at the present time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamFrancisODonne" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>On the occasion of my visits to the polling booths in the schools during the last two elections I was shocked at the condition of some of the schools.  On page 6 of the Minister's introductory speech it is stated that:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Among the most potent educative agencies available to the teacher is the example which, in his own person and conduct, he can set before the pupils.  He can train them to an appreciation of cleanliness and tidiness by ensuring that the school and its surroundings are at all times clean and tidy.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="305" /> In the schools that I visited, I found pot-holes in many of them.  I stumbled out of them, although I was quite sober.  In such schools, how could an example of tidiness be given to the children?  About half the schools that I visited were a disgrace.</P>
    <P>Some weeks ago we read in the papers that a number of men and women who were cutting turf took refuge from a lightning and thunder storm.  Of the number, two men and two women were killed.  A few neighbours in my house were discussing the question as to what one should do in the case of lightning.  Their views on the subject were diametrically opposed. An old man who had experience of a lightning storm on the Knockmealdown mountains said that he took refuge behind a rock.  When it was struck the water began to pour down.  He moved away about 100 yards, and almost immediately the rock was split in pieces.  The point is to know what to do in such a situation. There is no instruction given on these matters in the school books.  There are so many different views held on what one should do in such a case, that I suggest to the Press they should invite views from scientists on the subject.  In my young days we used to put mirrors under the bed-clothes during a lighting storm.  Some people hold that windows should be opened, and others that they should be closed during a storm.  We also had a discussion in regard to animals, as to whether they should remain out in the open or take shelter under trees.  We used to be told that trees were lightning conductors.  I also heard of two members of the Dáil who were sitting around the fire in a house during a lightning storm.  Politically their views were diametrically opposed. There was a dog sitting between them. The lightning came down the chimney and killed the dog.  There was great sympathy for the dog.  I was not a member of the Dáil at the time.</P>
    <P>With regard to the teaching of rural science and agriculture, we have two teachers for these subjects under the South Tipperary County Committee of Agriculture.  I think it would be a good <Col N="306" /> idea if the agricultural instructor were to attend in the national schools and in the Christian Brothers' Schools for half an hour or an hour once a week and give a lesson to the higher classes on agriculture.  The average healthy boy does not like attending school in the evening.  He is inclined to regard the teacher as a kind of monstrosity.  Personally, I hope that my own teacher has a high place in heaven.  But, under the present system, the position is that the evening classes conducted by these instructors are not well attended.  I think that if my suggestion were adopted it would be a good thing.  In my opinion the boys leaving school 40 years ago were, on the whole, better educated than the boys leaving the primary schools to-day.  We are told now that the children leaving school are illiterate in two languages.  In my time boys leaving school at the age of 15 years had a good knowledge of the six books of Euclid, of advanced mathematics and English.  Boys leaving school to-day at the age of 14 cannot speak grammatically or write a letter grammatically.  What we are to attribute that to, I do not know but, as compared with the system in operation 40 years ago, there seems to be something seriously wrong.  I read in the newspapers a short time ago that there were 600 applications for a clerkship in the Great Southern Railways Company. I have four men and three sons working on my farm.  A few Sunday evenings ago a neighbour asked me if I could send him two men to work on the land.  I could place men at the moment in every second Tipperary farm house.  What is wrong I do not know, but that is the position.</P>
    <P>There is another matter that I would like to bring to the Minister's notice. It concerns a number of old teachers who have been very badly treated.  I have had some piteous letters from them.  One of them is not a political supporter of mine.  I do not say that he deliberately voted and spoke against me from a political platform, but he did not wish to see me elected.  Despite that, he is a great friend of mine.  The pensions that these old teachers have amount to nothing practically.  They would not buy a pair of boots or a suit <Col N="307" /> of clothes for them.  It is a sad commentary on the present system that a number of young teachers are not able to obtain positions.  A great deal of money was spent in setting up training colleges, but when they come out of the colleges they find that there is no need for them.  Now, we find that St. Patrick's Training College and the training college in Waterford are being closed down.</P>
    <P>That was a most stupid thing to do. The money spent in the training of those teachers could be spent on giving fees to craftsmen, country smiths, harness-makers and carpenters, and would be better employed.  There is a plethora of teachers at present.  We had 16 applications for one temporary agricultural instructor for three months, and each of those applicants must have cost a couple of hundred pounds to educate.  They have come from the secondary schools and primary schools and not one of them will work on the farm.  If the country were run by farmers or merchants in that way, it would be bankrupt.  It is time that there was an end to the muddle and conglomeration between one Department and another.  There is no outlook or efficiency behind the present system.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I must congratulate the Minister on his very clear statement to the Dáil to-day regarding the work of the various branches of the Department. Also, I wish to congratulate him for many very valuable and very necessary things that he has done to promote the general cause of education, during his time as Minister.  There are, however, certain other things with which I do not agree and to which I wish to make <Col N="308" /> hasty reference.  Pádraig Pearse mentioned that the first real necessity of any national system of education was national inspiration and adequate inspiration and Deputy Mulcahy, Leader of the Opposition, reiterated that to-day. Now, in order to have that inspiration really effective&mdash;and I hold that the Minister does give that inspiration&mdash;the first thing necessary is a contented staff.</P>
    <P>At the moment, the teachers, as far as we can judge by their public pronouncements, are not content.  I shall take the first aspect which has caused the rift which brought about that position: it is the question of primary certificates, which now seem to be the be-all and end-all of primary education. I do not blame the Department for introducing a system of primary certificates, as I believe that the idea came originally from certain members of the teachers' organisation itself some years ago, even though the full body of the organisation did not agree to it.  They thought at that time that this certificate would give the scholars some status, either in going into employment or in going for higher education, and that it might also serve as an inducement to the brighter boys to remain in school longer in order to get that education.</P>
    <P>The whole thing has altered recently. What was formerly a voluntary system has been made compulsory, and the teachers are kicking against it. They hold that the original purpose of these certificates is not served at all, that they are not a passport to any employment and do not give any exceptional status to those who go into colleges for higher education.  They hold that, if certain localities do not approve of them, they should not be compelled to adopt them.  Pearse said, in writing about &ldquo;The Murder Machine&rdquo;, that one of the important things in education was freedom for the teacher and freedom for the scholar.  Now, there is no freedom for the teacher if he thinks that these primary certificates do not serve in his particular district the interests of the pupils he is teaching and still is compelled to put every child, good and bad, through that examination.</P>
    <P>Everybody dealing with schools <Col N="309" /> knows that there may be bright pupils, especially in one particular year. Sometimes, again, there may be a class not up to the standard, but they must go through the examination also, whether the children like it or not, whether their parents want it or not and whether the teachers think it serves any good purpose or not. Teachers are expelled from the organisation if they take any voluntary part in checking the papers or anything of that kind.  Is it an inspiration to the children in those schools to know that if the teacher has anything to do voluntarily with these primary certificates, he may be expelled from the teachers' organisation?  I would suggest to the Minister to try, in co-operation with the teachers' organisation&mdash;as he suggested himself in his statement that he hoped he would have co-operation in working out some scheme acceptable all round&mdash;to make some improvement in the present position.</P>
    <P>Another thing that was necessary and which steps are being taken, I think, to provide, was a definite scheme of text-books.  A big list was issued by the Department of books which could be used in certain standards but, subsequently, an inspector came along, perhaps in a year when there were not specially bright students and another book served the purpose&mdash;and said the book was too difficult.  There was no standard at all.  It was the teacher's opinion as against that of the inspector, and the teacher's opinion won.  The book had been purchased and could not be changed.  Sometimes the list was submitted beforehand to inspectors and they let it pass by, as it was only when they came to the schools that they could determine whether or not it was suitable.  There might have been an epidemic in the school and the children in the lower standards might have been ill, so that when they passed from class to class at the end of the year, they needed a lot of pulling up. We know that, in former times, before our own day, there were books set out by those controlling the educational system in this country and who insisted on the English language in the schools. They put standard books there and kept them there for two generations, so <Col N="310" /> that the parents knew the same books as their children were subsequently using.  I think steps are being taken now to do that in our schools also.</P>
    <P>In the Gaeltacht, teachers and children are prepared for a higher standard in English than others in the Galltacht or Breac-Ghaeltacht, and a whole lot of the importance in education depends on the practical and systematic work in trying to get these things done.  Reference has been made here by Deputy Byrne to the industrial schools.  There are certain defects amongst the industrial schools, no doubt, but it should be remembered at the same time that the pupils of the industrial schools are not complete orphans; generally one of the parents survives.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the steamer operated by the Bantry Bay Steamship Company between Bantry and Castletownbere is at present laid up for overhaul and that substitute lorry services are being provided by the Great Southern Railways Company at their normal scale of road charges.  I am informed that the number of persons unemployed as a result of the discontinuance of the steamer service is seven.  The military camp stationed in Bere Island have their own boat which is adequate for their requirements.</P>
      <P>Inquiries into the circumstances of the discontinuance of the Bantry-Castletownbere service are being made, but it will be appreciated that, apart from the difficulty in procuring materials for the extensive repairs necessary to the vessel, the resumption of the service in present circumstances would be dependent on the availability of coal supplies.</P>
      <P>I have no information as to whether or not the motor vessel mentioned would be suitable for operation by the Bantry Bay Steamship Company on this service, but from the particulars available it appears that it has a gross tonnage of 30 tons, compared with the 212 gross registered tonnage of the &ldquo;Princess Beara&rdquo; and would have, therefore, only very limited carrying capacity.</P>

      <P>I was dealing with the question raised by Deputy Byrne regarding certain aspects of leave for children in industrial schools.  I live beside an industrial school, probably the one to which Deputy Byrne refers, and I know that during the summer season the boys there are allowed to return to the custody of their parents or their guardians.  Who pays for them I do not know, but before they are let <Col N="316" /> go either the parent or the guardian has to intimate that he is prepared to take charge and be responsible for the boy during the holiday period.  Therefore, I do not see any difficulty in the matter about which Deputy Byrne seemed to have a grievance, because what has been done in certain cases can be extended to other cases if the conditions required by the principals of the schools are complied with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the Irish language has been mentioned repeatedly to-day. In that regard, there is one feature which I think should be developed, that is, subsidising bodies of earnest workers who are providing funds to send children to the Gaeltacht.  In the school the children get a good deal of Irish but when they return home they are helped very little.  Most of us remember from our experiences in our young days that Irish came more fluently to us when we were in the Gaeltacht from the very atmosphere of the place.  Those of us who were not able to speak Irish very well, in a few days developed a fluency which we could never develop in the Galltacht. This scheme of sending young children to the Gaeltacht where they hear the language spoken naturally, is the best method that I know of.  There is no use in making Irish an academic subject and confining it to that.  It must be brought into the principal activities of life.  It must be brought into religion, which is an important part of life. That can be done by having Irish prayer-books.  At first they could be bilingual prayer-books, having Irish on one side and English on the other, just as some prayer-books have English on one side and Latin on the other.  Irish must be brought into the children's games and amusements. All these things must be done gradually.  We find that the children who have been to the Gaeltacht are most anxious to go there again, even children whose parents know no Irish whatever.  A Deputy made a very wise suggestion to-day, namely to have children who have been to the Gaeltacht during the summer season formed into clubs during the rest of the year where they would meet for <Col N="317" /> an hour in the evening or a couple of hours a few times a week.  These clubs would continue the benefits derived from their visits to the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the position of some teachers in industrial schools who, so to speak, have been allowed to fall by the wayside.  When industrial school teachers were taken over for payment by the Department of Education some time ago, certain teachers were not taken over because they were supernumeraries on the staff.  They had been in receipt of very poor salaries all their lives.  They had given years of service in the institutions where they worked and now they are facing the end of their years without adequate provision for pensions. I am sure there are not many such cases but some of them have made representations to me in the matter. Some of them had a paltry £1 a week. They were left in that position because they were supernumeraries and were not taken over by the Department.  The same thing applies to the pensioned teachers, to whom Deputy O'Donnell referred to-day. After years of service, after years of struggle in the cause of national education, they are left and there is nobody to take any notice of them.</P>
    <P>In connection with the many schools that have been established for vocational and technical purposes there should be departments where adequate instruction in farming and agriculture could be given.  Such instruction is given in some of the schools.  There is a theory that you must go out after the plough or the machine to learn agriculture.  But, if we are to improve our methods, we must treat agriculture also from the academic point of view. Progress in this country largely depends on the capacity of the people who work the land to co-operate with the Government&mdash;no matter what Government is in power&mdash;in the various schemes that they may promote in the interests of the country. Therefore, agriculture is a most important subject and one to which we should devote our attention.  When we see rooms idle in many of these <Col N="318" /> schools, it is time steps were taken to provide instruction for those increased numbers who desire to learn domestic economy and those who desire to study the soil and its products. I would suggest that the Minister should give attention to that matter because I know many places where it could be put into effect.  The country in general needs such facilities.  The people are asking for them.  We have the accommodation and all we want are the teachers, and I am sure they can be provided.  It is sad that training colleges are being closed down while in some schools there are classes of 40, 50, 60 or more pupils to one teacher.</P>

      <P>The situation is even worse in rural areas, with small classes.  I remember teaching in a building which was called a school but which local tradition says was a hospital in the famine days.  It is still there &mdash;a rat-infested hovel on a hillside. My successor is now teaching there.  I remember having 57 pupils in that school divided into five classes.  In other circumstances that number of pupils would have warranted an additional assistant.  In half an hour five classes had to be set to work and educated.  How is any teacher to do that?  It is worse than having large classes.  If I had one class of even 70 I could do better work than I could do with 50 pupils divided into five classes.  I do not think so many teachers need be unemployed if the whole system of things were reconsidered. We took over a certain institution and it is taking years and years to alter it.  Padraig Pearse said that what was wanted in education was not a change but a revolution of the whole thing.  I think we have not yet reached the position that we are giving the adequate inspiration that he asked for or modelling the whole system on the requirements of the localities where the schools are.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mulcahy in opening the debate struck the right note in appealing for a higher ideal in education. There is no doubt that the <Col N="319" /> entire future of our nation depends upon the standard of education in the first place and, to a greater extent, upon the ideal which inspires those in control of education.  Unless those who set themselves out to train the young mind have some definite clear-cut ideal before them, this nation will drift along from year to year, following dry text-books, dry rules and regulations, without inspiring new ideas in the youth of the country.  Sometimes we have been inclined to ridicule the standard of education in the public schools in Great Britain.  We have been inclined to ridicule the snobbery and other evils associated with the public school system but, at any rate, in the British system of education they set out to achieve some object, whether it was right or wrong.  Here, apparently, there is no definite clear-cut objective in education and, as a result, we have a rather futile system which has achieved very little in the past 20 years.  Criticism is frequently expressed of the low standard of citizenship of our young people, the low standard of respect for truth, honesty, honour and justice.  It would be well to consider whether that low standard is due to a failure in our educational system to set before it a higher standard and higher objectives.</P>
      <P>The teacher has been described as God's second priest and there is no doubt that his function is a very high and noble one.  He is entitled to a decent status in society and a decent standard of remuneration, but he is entitled also to such help, co-operation and assistance as would enable him to improve his standard of teaching and his work in the school.  It may be asked what ideas I have to suggest in that respect.  At any rate, the Department of Education, acting in co-operation with the teachers, perhaps through their organisation, should seek to provide courses that would be helpful to the teachers and an inspiration to them in improving the standard of their work &mdash;courses of lectures and instruction and bringing the teachers together for the purpose of helping them to get better results from their labours.  That should be one of the first aims of our Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="320" /> I am glad to note from the Minister's statement that there are proposals for a vast improvement in the school buildings throughout the country.  There is no doubt that such an improvement is long overdue.  I am not, however, prepared to give approval to the ideas of Deputy Dillon in that respect.  Deputy Dillon started out to-day by boasting of the success which he had achieved in having his ideas accepted in regard to the closing down of the Summerhill Detention Home, and in other directions.  I would be rather alarmed if I thought that all Deputy Dillon's ideas would be accepted, particularly his idea in regard to primary schools in the rural areas.  He suggested that the small primary school should be levelled, and that larger buildings should be provided in the towns in which the children over a vast rural area should be concentrated.  Life at the moment is sufficiently complex without making the education of our children in rural areas dependent upon mechanical transport.  Those of us who have been reared in rural districts will recall that quite a substantial proportion of our education was acquired on the journey to and from school, and I do not think that there would be any definite improvement in the outlook of our rural population if children were to be collected from the rural areas and brought in by buses or lorries or other motor vehicles to urban areas for education. The rural schools ought to be preserved. They fill a very useful function, and if, unfortunately, many of the rural schools to-day are half-empty, that is not the fault of the teachers or of the schools; it is the fault of our economic system, which tends to promote means of livelihood in the larger towns and cities, to encourage, by every possible means, the population to leave the country districts and to settle in the larger towns and cities.  I believe that position will eventually be rectified, and that we will reach a time when the rural schools throughout the length and breadth of the country will be at least half as full as the schools in our cities and large towns.</P>
    <P>On the question of primary education, <Col N="321" /> I have always held that education in the primary schools should be simplified to the last degree.  No subject should be introduced which cannot be taught thoroughly and fully.  No child should be sent out of a primary school without a thorough and complete knowledge of any subject in which he has been instructed.  Nothing tends to destroy self-confidence and to send young people out in life with an inferiority complex more than the knowledge that they have not acquired all the education that they are supposed to acquire in primary schools.  If a boy can leave a primary school satisfied that he has learned everything that it was intended to teach in that school, that he is fully qualified in every subject in which he was instructed, he will leave with a sense of confidence and an assurance which will be helpful to him all through life.  Therefore, I say that we should confine the number of subjects in the primary schools to the lowest possible minimum and teach those subjects thoroughly.</P>
    <P>Reference was made in the Minister's statement to lack of parental control. There is a tendency to blame youthful delinquency and all such other evils entirely upon the parents.  While everyone will admit that a large measure of the blame is attributable to the failure of parents to exercise proper control, our educational authorities must accept a fair amount of responsibility also.  We must remember that it is through our educational system we have to raise the standard of good citizenship and the outlook of our people, nationally and morally.  If, for some reason, whether because they have not the necessary training or because they are physically or mentally unequipped to train and control their children, parents have failed, it is the duty of our educational establishments, and, to begin with, the primary schools, to fill that need and the fact that parents have neglected their duty for some cause is no reason why their children should be compelled to be bad citizens and eventually to be the parents of bad citizens.</P>
    <P>There must be a change for the better, and it is through our educational establishments that that change <Col N="322" /> must come about.  Much of the minor crime and bad citizenship amongst our young people is due to the fact that boys and girls when they leave the primary schools have no settled employment. This raises the question of continuation education, and I hold definitely that it is a duty of the State, and there is a moral obligation on the State, to see, when boys and girls leave the primary schools, that either post-primary education will be provided, or employment will be found for them.  If boys and girls, having left the primary school, can secure positions on the land, in the factory, or in business, where they will be properly trained and looked after, all is well, but if they are to remain unemployed when they have left school, all is wrong.</P>
    <P>In that case there is a duty on our Education Department to see that education is provided for all boys and girls who cannot find employment on leaving the primary schools.  In this respect also it is desirable in regard to vocational education, that even where a certain measure of employment can be found for young boys and girls, the Department should seek to provide night classes, so as to ensure the better training and better mental development of our young people.  That should be the aim of our vocational schools&mdash;to provide regular day classes for those who cannot find employment and night classes for those who are in employment, and that, I think, should apply both to rural and urban areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister, when last speaking in this House, took me to task rather severely for having suggested that rural vocational schools have to a large extent been a failure.  In making that statement, I was not casting any reflection upon the teachers or even upon the programme in these schools.  What I wanted to point out was that, in the rural areas, the people who avail of our rural science schools for education are mainly those young people who have no intention of remaining on the land.  Boys and girls who intend to work on the land&mdash;on the farms of their parents or as agricultural <Col N="323" /> workers&mdash;almost invariably absent themselves from these vocational schools.  It is only those who intend to get away from the land and into some other occupation who avail of these schools, and, for that reason, a great deal of the good work being done in these rural vocational schools is brought to naught.  I fail to see how that position can be remedied unless we have what must ultimately come, that is, a raising of the school-leaving age by one year and provision for education in these vocational schools for all young people who intend to take up work on the land or manual work of any other kind.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that the overwhelming majority of our people have to depend for their livelihood on manual work, and the main purpose of education, both primary and whatever vocational education we can provide, should be to ensure that these manual workers will be as skilled as they possibly can be and will have as high a standard of education as it is possible to give them, without impairing their efficiency as manual workers, because there is no doubt whatever that if our boys and girls are kept at school for a very prolonged period and kept away from work on the land in particular, they will find it difficult to acquire a taste for such work in after life.  This has been demonstrated by the educational system in Denmark which provides that boys and girls, and particularly boys, who intend to work on the land shall go to work at an early age, and, at the age of 18, shall receive supplementary education.  The motive there is to ensure that these boys will acquire a taste for manual work early in life, and, having acquired that taste, will set out at the age of 18 or 19 years to acquire the mental training and improvement which they will find desirable and beneficial.</P>
    <P>The Minister was on quite correct lines when he suggested that one of the best methods of instruction in our primary and other schools is the setting of good example by our teachers. There is no doubt that our teachers must set for themselves a very high <Col N="324" /> standard of conduct and very high ideals which will inspire our young people to follow their example. It ought to be impressed upon them by this House and by every section of the community that the people expect from them a very high standard, so that by their example they will inspire their pupils to aim at being better citizens and better workers in whatever sphere of life they may be called upon to make their livelihood.  Nothing gives to any boy or girl a worse start in life than to cultivate habits of idleness or deceit during school hours. Whether or not the teacher is very brilliant, he can turn out very good pupils so long as he inspires them with the ideal of diligence and hard work in class, and the ideal of truth and honesty in their dealings with their fellow pupils and later on with their fellow citizens.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say at the outset that I consider our whole education system here to be wrong.  In what is primarily an agricultural country, we do not seem to fit our children for the life which the majority of them will undoubtedly have to lead as adults, nor do we, on the other hand, adequately prepare them for the type of life which some of them will take up if they leave the rural areas.  We have on the one hand a system of trying to get the rudiments of higher education into their heads, and on the other hand of leaving them without the necessary knowledge in the life which the majority of them will lead.  That system seems to fall between two stools of educational thought.  I think we ought to make up our minds which line we are going to follow.  We ought either to teach them more with a view to the life they will lead, or prepare them generally by expanding their minds.  We do not seem to do that very effectively.  People who are dealing with children nowadays tell us that they notice a falling away in the standard as compared with previous years.  I do not intend to go into the reasons for that, but a number of unbiased people seem to be firmly of that opinion.  Never before in the City of Dublin was there such a large amount of juvenile delinquency. <Col N="325" /> I am not one of those people who think that the unfortunate teachers should be asked to teach the children everything.  If parental control is lacking, it is very difficult for the teacher to take the place of the parents; in fact, it is impossible, and nobody should ask them to do it.  I think, however, that more attention ought to be paid to that aspect of education.</P>
      <P>In connection with the teachers themselves, I should like to pay a tribute to them in regard to the very difficult work they have to do.  I do not think their conditions of employment or their salaries are in keeping with the dignity of the teaching profession. Every parent feels that there is no body of people to whom he ought to pay more respect.  The teachers are dealing with their own children and with the citizens of to-morrow.  Those are all truisms.  You have all heard them before.  The teachers have an opportunity of moulding the character of our people.  They are making the citizens of to-morrow.  There is no finer or nobler work in the country, and we here in this House do not give the teachers either the status or the salary which that noble work should ensure.  I would warn the Minister quite seriously that, after this war, unless there is a radical improvement in the status of our teachers, we will find that a very large proportion of them will go across to the other side where they have brought in a sort of Magna Charta for teachers, and we will find ourselves faced with a very grave shortage; we will certainly find that the more clever teachers will have gone away from us.  I would ask the Minister to take steps to prevent that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter to which I want to refer&mdash;it has already been touched on by other speakers&mdash;is in regard to the number of pupils a teacher is asked to teach.  There is a definite limit set by educational experts, and, I think, by our own Department of Education here, but in many cases that standard is not being adhered to, and the classes are far too large.  Everybody knows what the result is&mdash;tired, irritated teachers and insufficiently taught pupils.  I hope the Minister will remedy <Col N="326" /> that situation as quickly as he can.  I think he is aware of that position, and certainly it reflects no credit on the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, we are primarily an agricultural country, and it seems a great pity that the children are not taught more about agriculture. Even if they were not exactly taught agricultural methods, they should at least learn something of the dignity of that calling.  Now, I should like to come to what is really a very vexed question in this country, and that is the question of the teaching of Irish, and particularly the teaching of subjects through the medium of Irish.  It would appear that our educational system is revolving around the question of the teaching of Irish, and that that is the be-all and the end-all of our whole educational system.  That, in my opinion, is quite wrong and against all tenets of educational thought.  Now, when I say that, I do not wish to be taken as being opposed in any way to the teaching of Irish.  I am not.  Irish is being taught at the present time, and should be taught, in our schools, but I am definitely opposed, and always will be opposed, to the teaching of subjects through the medium of Irish when the pupils themselves do not know Irish.  It is an offence to every known educational canon to try to teach a small child certain subjects through the medium of a language which is unknown to the child.</P>
    <P>That is against every known educational tenet, and I believe that in the end it will defeat the object it is intended to serve.  It will mean that the child will only get a hotch-potch knowledge of the subject he is supposed to learn and, in the end, it will mean that he will have a definite dislike for the Irish language.  In putting this point forward, as I have said before, I am not by any means opposed to the teaching of Irish.  I am saying this in all sincerity: first of all, because I believe that the teaching of subjects through the medium of a language which the pupils do not understand is an offence against every educational tenet, and, secondly, because it is a method which, in my opinion, will destroy the whole object which it sets out to encourage. <Col N="327" /> On that note, I shall sit down, but I wish to mark my disapproval, as a Deputy of this House, of that method of teaching.</P>

      <P>At a time when the Government is telling us about its post-war plans regarding arterial drainage, agriculture and electricity&mdash; long-term plans which cannot be fully implemented for a considerable period &mdash;one would imagine that the Minister for Education would avail of this Estimate to tell the House and the country generally what the Government's plans are in respect of post-war education.  I should have thought that a substantial portion of the Minister's introductory speech would have been devoted to some attempt to review in a progressive way the State's acceptance of the policy of raising the school-leaving age.  For some reason or other, the Department of Education appears to have made up its mind that, <Col N="329" /> whatever other reform may be introduced in the sphere of industry, agriculture or fiscal control, there is to be very little reformation of our present inadequate methods of education and school-attendance.  It is not long since we had a report from a very notorious committee which told us that children of 14 years of age were not too immature to enter industry.</P>

      <P>I shall go back to it on another Estimate in this group if the Minister has no objection.  This unknown committee told us that, in their opinion, children of 14 were not too immature to enter industry.  There was such a widespread revolt against the sentiment expressed by that unknown committee that we have had attempts in this House to whitewash the committee's report and attempts outside to treat the report in a similar manner.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can make his own reply, linking up the report of these unknown warriors who dealt with this question of the age at which young people should enter industry with the Department's general attitude to this matter.  That attitude indicates that we shall not have for a very long time, unless we get new minds to deal with the matter, a raising of the school-leaving age from 14 years to 16 years.  I think that the committee knew the mind of the Department and the Government in the matter because the whole attitude of that committee has synchronised with the Government's and Department's go-slow policy in respect of the raising of the school-leaving <Col N="330" /> age.  In every other country to-day education is rightly occupying a very important place.  All references to post-war planning in the various countries indicate the natural and rightful emphasis which is being placed upon the necessity of equipping the youthful citizens of these countries with the maximum amount of education so as to enable them to enter upon what everybody expects to be the sterner battle of life in the years to come.  Can anybody pretend to believe, from what he sees to-day in this country or from the results of our national education system, that we are keeping in touch with the world-wide movement in accelerating the absorption of education and devising new methods calculated the better to equip our citizens educationally and culturally for the future?  My own opinion&mdash;I think it is shared by a number of people&mdash;is that, if the world standard be accepted as the datum line of what should be natural progress in educational matters, the standard of education here is receding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a referendum could be taken of the opinions of parents, particularly parents who do not think that all their geese are swans but who have a realistic view of education, the conclusion would be reached that we are not getting results from our educational system comparable with the amount expended on that system and that we are not giving the children the standard of education which was available, and which was certainly absorbed, 15 or 20 years ago.  It is true that we have examinations, more examinations and new types of examinations but the general experience of people in touch with the educational equipment of children leaving school at 13 and 14 years of age will convince any impartial person that we are not giving to the youth of the country that educational and intellectual equipment which will be more necessary than ever in the stern years which lie ahead.  If the Minister wants an opinion on this matter, he will get it from the teachers' organisation. He will certainly get it from a very wide and ever-widening circle of parents who are disappointed with the results of our present educational <Col N="331" /> methods.  I suggest to the Minister that, now that we have had an educational programme in operation under a native Government for 22 years, and as that period is adequate in which to test the efficiency or otherwise of a system, the time is overdue for an inquiry by impartial people into the results of our present educational system, our present educational direction and the standard of education which is being imparted to the children.  I do not know any parents who would not welcome an inquiry of that kind.  I do not know any teacher who would not welcome such an inquiry.  I do not know any taxpayer who, realising the amount spent on education, would not like to be satisfied that we are getting the best results from the educational system to which we have wedded ourselves during the past 20 years.  If parents and teachers want an inquiry and if the taxpayers would welcome such an inquiry, why is the inquiry not held?</P>
    <P>For some reason or other, the Department of Education seems to be opposed to the holding of an inquiry. Nothing but good could come from an inquiry of the character I have indicated. If it confirms the efficacy of our present educational methods, well and good.  It will run to earth the erroneous belief that our present methods are not satisfactory or efficient. If, on the other hand, it shows that our methods are by no means satisfactory, that they fall far short of reasonable efficiency, then we shall, at least, be in a position to take steps to remedy whatever defects show themselves in our educational methods and to correct, so far as possible, the mistakes which may have been made in the past.  The one big complaint appears to me to be that parents and teachers seem to have no effective voice in directing our educational programme.  The function of parents seems to be to provide the children and send them to school.  The function of the teacher seems to be to try to get whatever education he can into the heads of the children under a method of education in the direction of which he has no control.  Parents <Col N="332" /> and teachers seem to be regarded as Enemy No. 1 by the Department of Education.  Their voice is never heard.  No machinery is provided to enable their voice to be heard when it comes to directing our educational activities.</P>
    <P>It was believed in the early days of this State that a council of education would be established on which teachers and parents would have representation and that the Department of Education and the Government generally would be kept informed through regularised channels of the viewpoints of teachers and parents on educational problems which arose from year to year, and that in that way we might, by such impact, by studying educational methods elsewhere, as well as by an examination and analysis of the results of our present teaching methods, be able to correct whatever blemishes were revealed in the light of our experience of the present educational system.  Here again the Department of Education decided that there was to be no council of education, just as, apparently, they decided that there would be no inquiry into our teaching methods.  Consequently there is no council of education and, in the same way, no inquiry into the result of our teaching methods.  I cannot see on what grounds the Minister can easily resist the demand for an inquiry into our teaching methods.  I have instanced the advantages which would flow from an inquiry, no matter what the result would be.  It is time the Department indicated that it will welcome an inquiry into our teaching methods, will welcome an examination of the results of those methods over the past 20 years by an impartial body of persons, who will be given the opportunity of examining results, which I believe to be unsatisfactory results, and which a large number of people equally believe to be unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>On the question of raising the school-leaving age, I cannot understand the Minister's attitude as to the intention of the Department and the Government.  There is every advantage to be gained here that has been gained elsewhere by raising the school-leaving <Col N="333" /> age, and thus allowing children to remain at school until 16, instead of permitting them, as at present, to be running wild through the streets of our cities and towns.  Any examination of the destination of children who leave national schools at 14 years of age will reveal that a very large number of them find their way into idle, destructive and wasteful pastimes.  Considerable numbers of them get no employment whatever, and from 14 to 17 or 18 they are roaming the streets and their energies, unfortunately, are not harnessed to useful purposes.  In many instances if they were kept at school until they were 16, not only would their characters be improved enormously in those formative years, but they might be able to equip themselves for employment much easier than when released from school at 14, when they abandon all educational effort, with the hope of getting freedom from restraint, and earning a few shillings a week.  In a large number of instances they are not working, they are a source of anxiety to their parents, and a source of national loss because of idle and destructive pastimes.  For the generality of our people national schools are their kindergarten, their schools and universities.  That is the only school they have ever known, except what the hard battle of life teaches them, and we ought to make sure that if these children have not, under the present educational system, a passport to secondary education and university education, at least they are kept at national schools and given the greatest measure of education that it is possible to impart there, until such time as they have sufficient sense and wisdom to attend secondary schools and universities, to which a number of them have no access because of the difficulty of getting there without the wherewithal.</P>
    <P>I felt that when the Children's Allowances Bill was being discussed in the Dáil, a little more consideration might have been given to the repercussions of that measure, when it, probably, would have been decided to have it for two purposes: (1) to endow large families, and (2) by raising the <Col N="334" /> school-leaving age, making it possible to endow large families by paying an allowance for children kept at school until 16 years of age.  That opportunity was unfortunately missed, and any extension of the school-leaving age now will presumably have to stand on its own, because of the manner in which the Act was framed.  Personally, I think that a very excellent opportunity was missed in not using the expenditure under that Act in regard to raising the school-leaving age.  If that had been done, those with large families would have got whatever measure of endowment was provided in the Act, and we could ensure children remaining at school until 16. Where there was some economic loss as a result, at least, parents would get some compensation for the fact that we were preventing children from entering the employment market between 14 and 16 years of age.</P>
    <P>On this Estimate there is a reference by the Minister to the cost of primary education, and a brief reference to what the small increase in the emergency bonus granted to teachers in recent years will cost.  It must be well known to the Minister&mdash; it was certainly well known to his Party when in opposition&mdash;that there have been widespread complaints by teachers at their present unsatisfactory conditions of employment.  They complain that the salary scale which was introduced for them away back in 1920 was a scale appropriate to normal times, but that since then they have suffered a number of cuts, cuts which were unreasonably imposed, and which had no economic justification, and not only that, but that they were cut further to make good a deficiency in the pension fund for which they were not in any way liable, but for which the Government was liable.</P>
    <P>The teachers complain that bad as their condition was in 1939, owing to these cuts being imposed, and the obligation put upon them to make good a deficiency in the pension fund for which they were not liable, the position has been worse during the past four and a half years by reason of the fact that the cost of living has increased in that period.  Even the <Col N="335" /> Department of Industry and Commerce rates that increase to be over 70 per cent., while the increase granted to the teachers has been little more than 10 per cent.  It requires only a very cursory examination of the position to realise from these figures how the teachers have suffered.  Cost of living has gone up by more than 70 per cent., wages by 10 per cent., so that the gap represents a rapidly deteriorating standard of living as far as teachers are concerned.</P>
    <P>From what I see around me from the results of our educational system, I think we should, as soon as possible, embrace the philosophy that we are too poor to save money on education. Teachers represent the pivot on which our whole educational system swings. If teachers are dissatisfied with their salaries, and are placed in the position of wondering how they can balance their domestic budgets, and if they are constantly worried as to how the baker, the milkman, the tailor and the landlord are to be paid, we cannot get satisfactory service when they are beset with such perennial problems. We will only get satisfactory service from the teaching profession, if they feel that they are getting a fair deal, that their conditions of service are reasonably good, and that their complaints will be listened to with a sympathetic ear.  I understand that efforts by the teachers' organisation to see the Minister for Education to discuss the question of the shrinkage in teachers' incomes, due to the rapid increase in the cost of living, met with a rather stony rebuff so far as the Minister is concerned.  He took the view that it was not a matter for him, and that there was no use in seeing the teachers, notwithstanding the important part which they play in our scheme of national education.</P>
    <P>The teachers have a very genuine complaint also in respect to their pensions.  For all practical purposes, they are public servants, as much public servants as any civil servant is, and as much a civil servant as any civil servant.  A teacher on retirement gets a pension which, at the maximum, is <Col N="336" /> 40/80ths, or half his salary, but if he happened to be an inspector in the Department of Education, and not a teacher in the school, he would get not merely half his salary, but would get a lump sum based on a thirtieth of his salary and emoluments for each year of service, subject to a maximum of one and a half years' service. Because he works in a school trying, under desperate odds, to impart education to children, he is deprived of a year's salary on retirement, whereas if he were an officer in the Minister's Department he would get not merely half his salary on retirement, but would get a year's salary as well.  He might possibly get one and a half years' salary on retirement.  That is an obvious blot on the teacher's superannuation code which ought to be remedied.  It is a principle which is recognised in the local government service and in the Civil Service.  There is no reason why it should not be extended to the teachers or why they should be left with the feeling that they have been singled out for differentiation in the matter of superannuation, and in a way which is unfair in conception, which is inequitable in its operation, and for which there can be no justification whatever when one thinks of the different types of superannuation which are applied to other public servants.</P>
    <P>Some few years ago the Department of Education introduced a scheme by which a female teacher who had 35 years' service had, on reaching the age of 60 years, to retire.  The anomalous part of this direction was that, where the teacher was required to retire at 60 years of age, if she had 35 years' service, she could not manage to get her full pension of half her salary unless she had 40 years' service. Technically, she could qualify for a pension of half salary on retirement, but the Department of Education issued an instruction which compelled her to go out before she had the 40 years' service necessary to get half her salary on retirement, and so that she had to go out with 35 years' service. That, of course, may have been done for the purpose of providing employment for other women teachers. I understand that the necessity for the continuance of that regulation does <Col N="337" /> not now arise.  If that is the position, as I believe it is, I think the Minister for Education ought to indicate the abandonment of that emergency direction which is unfair to women teachers and deprives them of a very definite normal right to earn half their salary on retirement.  They cannot get that unless they have had 40 years' service. The Department edict on the matter, however, prevents them from reaching the 40 years' service because they are retired at 60 years of age if they have had 35 years' service as teachers.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that no system of education can function harmoniously and efficiently if the teaching profession is seething with discontent. It is difficult to remember one year during the past 22 years when the teachers have not complained bitterly of the harsh and unsympathetic treatment they have received at the hands of both the Department and the Government.  You cannot have satisfactory educational results while the teaching profession is seething with indignation.  I put it to the Minister that, for the good of education, steps ought to be taken, through the medium of the Government, to listen with reason and understanding to these grievances which the teachers have, and to remedy them.  The continuance of these grievances, even though it may save the Government certain expenditure, is militating against getting value for any type of expenditure on national education.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter, and that is the question of the erection of school buildings.  Under the present method there is a certain obligation on local people to raise a certain sum of money towards the cost of the erection of school buildings unless the school is to be owned by the Department of Education, in which case, I think, the whole cost is borne by the Department.  This problem is somewhat related to the question as to who controls and owns the school, and is inter-related to the problem of the management of the school.  Whatever its difficulties may be, I, at all events, think that some solution will have to be found for the present unsatisfactory position.  It seems absured to require <Col N="338" /> an area with limited financial resources, due largely to endemic poverty, to bear portion of the cost of erecting a new school.  It is particularly wasteful to have a long harangue as to who will pay for the school if the effect of the continuance of the harangue is to house the children in buildings which are not fit to house cattle in.  Some steps ought to be taken by the Department and the Government to bring to an end this age-old see-saw as to who owns the school and who is going to manage it. From the point of view of the children, the important matter is that they should have school buildings where the circumstances and environment will be such as to be conductive to the absorption of knowledge.  That should be the primary concern.</P>
    <P>I strongly appeal to the Minister to take steps to bring that issue to an end so that in future schools will be erected where they are needed.  It seems to me that the sensible thing to do, in the circumstances as we know them in many areas in the country, would be for the State to pay the whole cost of the erection of schools so as to ensure that decent schools are erected, and that the children are given the educational facilities which are so necessary if they are to derive real benefit from our scheme of national education.</P>

      <P>However much sections of our people may differ fundamentally on matters of social and economic policy, one is struck by the universal agreement there is among our people, representing every shade of political opinion in the country, as to the unsatisfactory condition of our educational system.  I have even heard supporters of the Minister's Party express the view that we have not made any progress whatever in that direction; that, in fact, the children leaving school at the present time are leaving with a poorer foundation of knowledge than that possessed by children leaving school some years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a fair question to ask.  Surely the Minister will not deny that people have the right to express their views and opinions.  The Minister must have heard the expression on every side of the House and outside the House of general dissatisfaction.  That point was also put to him on Votes for his Department in the past few years.</P>
      <P>We are at the end of a cycle now and facing the difficult post-war period, when there may be new standards, new ideas and keener competition. We are almost at the end of a quarter of a century of self-government, and the time has come for a thorough investigation into our educational system.  That request has been put to the Minister and he should hearken to it.  It is no pleasure to Deputies to say that our educational system over a long period has been a failure, as there is something fundamentally wrong with it.  They do not come in here for the mere pleasure of stating that.  In all sincerity, I may say I have heard all over the country that the children coming back from the primary schools do not appear to have had laid in them as solidly as in the past, the foundations of education, and I add my voice to those who call now for a comprehensive investigation into the whole matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the point of view of my particular calling in life, I am satisfied there is something fundamentally wrong with our educational system which is reflected in the character of our people.  One of the difficulties affecting the expansion of agriculture and the development of industry generally is the lack of ambition in our people.  We have not at all the same ambition as is to be found in people in other countries.  That may be due to our climatic conditions or to our religious principles, but it is a difficulty facing, not merely a <Col N="340" /> Fianna Fáil Government, but any Government.  The average person in rural Ireland has no ambition to improve the amenities of his home or to raise the home standards.  If we have not inculcated into our youth a high ideal in life, surely that is a matter worthy of careful investigation?</P>
    <P>Look at the history of Denmark, where that famous Protestant Bishop started the Folk High Schools.  That big idea was the basis of industry and agriculture in Denmark and the foundation of a nobler ideal and a higher standard of living.  That gives the youth the ambition to carve out a way in life; without doles or subsidies.  It cannot be denied that many of our people lack that ambition, which is so essential if our country is to make progress.  Our youth emerge from the primary school with a passive acquisition of factual knowledge.  No attempt has been made at character formation, no attempt has been made to inculcate into the youth a nobler outlook on life, which is the very foundation of everything.  In that respect, I cannot understand why we go in for such a highly standardised system here, instead of adopting the curriculum which suits the particular district best.  The curriculum of a rural school should not be the same as that of a city school.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Any school in the country is entitled to suggest a curriculum of its own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sufficiently informed on that aspect of it to discuss it in detail with the Minister.  As far as I can see, the curriculum is generally the same all over the country.  One reason for the highly standardised system we have inherited from the British was that they had a highly industrialised outlook and merely required a certain type turned out, as if out of a machine, to suit particular industrial occupations.  Our social and economic circumstances require a completely different outlook and the type of education in rural areas should be very different from that in the large city areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quite agree that it is necessary to lay the foundation of knowledge&mdash;the <Col N="341" /> three R's&mdash;and that educationists generally are concerned with the means and the methods and not the end.  The end of education is to equip people for the battle of life, to equip them as best we can for their particular walk of life.  That appears to be lost sight of in our educational system.  We merely cram a lot of factual information into the youngster at an impressionable age.  That is the time to lay the foundation of his education, to teach him how to acquire knowledge for after-life and how to use it to the best advantage, how to observe things in life and assess them at their true value.  Surely it cannot be said that our people are so equipped on the average that they have reached a high standard in that regard?  It is in that respect that we have failed almost ignominiously and that our whole educational outlook is fundamentally wrong.</P>
    <P>I am not an educationist in any shape or form and do not aspire to be an authority on the matter, but I can give the point of view of the man living in rural Ireland.  I believe there must be a careful investigation into this matter, as it is fundamental to the future prosperity of the country. Time and time again I have come in here to criticise the failure over a long period to make progress.  It has not redounded to the credit of our people that we have failed in that regard to make progress.  The statistical facts are there, no matter what Government is in office or is responsible, and the fact remains that we have not made economic progress in the past half-a-century. I am forced to the one and only conclusion that our educational system is wrong and that, before we can hope to make progress, we must reorganise it and change our whole ideas and outlook, so far as it is concerned.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Irish language, without going into the matter in detail, I may say that I think compulsory Irish and the teaching of other subjects through the medium of Irish is fundamentally wrong.  From the point of view of encouraging the use of the language in everyday life, it is the wrong method.  The children <Col N="342" /> are crammed so much with Irish that, instead of getting a love for it, they hate it.  If the acquisition of the language is not voluntary on the part of the children, it will not become a living language in this country by a system of cramming.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe we have suffered very considerably in other respects.  No matter how much the Minister may be inclined to challenge the statements by Deputies here, a very substantial number of discerning people outside believe it is time the Government examined its conscience on this matter.  We are not stating these incontrovertible facts merely for political reasons.  Complete compulsion will not succeed in this respect and will mean serious loss in other directions.</P>
      <P>In the matter of vocational education, too, we have made no progress. So far as primary education is concerned, one would expect a bias, particularly in rural education, in favour of agriculture.  There does not appear to be any such thing there, and the subjects taught in rural schools are not practical.  I have come up against this situation directly.  I live in a beet-growing area in Carlow.  Quite a number of Deputies will understand how a load of beet going to the factory is treated, how the sugar content is calculated, and how the tare is calculated. I believe there are few children leaving national schools in the four beet-growing areas who have been asked to calculate the tare and weights and sugar content of loads of beet, although that might be a very practical matter for them in later life.  Those are real things, and we are not realistic enough in that regard; we are not practical enough.  In the same way, how many young fellows who leave the national school can lay-off an acre of land if they want to sow grain?  It is all by rule of thumb, and there is far too much guess-work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not unreasonable to expect that a child leaving school at 14 would be capable of doing these practical and useful things.  In the schools they <Col N="343" /> are supposed to be given the foundations of knowledge on which they can build and on which a youth with ambition can go far.  It is not unreasonable to expect that, having been taught how to acquire knowledge and where to look for it, a youth will be able to build on that foundation.  It is not unreasonable to expect that in rural Ireland the education of our youth will be related definitely to their particular calling.  I do not think any proper attempt is being made to do that.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot about the flight from the land.  Our chief aim should be the raising of the rural standard of life so as to bring it into more favourable relationship with what obtains in the larger towns and cities.  We should endeavour to make our people appreciate the real things of life in the country districts rather than be attracted by the artificial life that exists in the towns and cities.  We should endeavour to make them appreciate to a far greater extent the values of rural life and the great natural advantages of living in the country, where they are more close to nature, as compared with the artificial life in the towns and cities.</P>
    <P>What attempt is being made in rural Ireland to make the people appreciate those higher values, the real things in life, the nobler things in life?  What incentives is given to the youth in the country to make them say when leaving school: &ldquo;I am out to carve my own niche in life.  I am not looking to the State.  I do not believe in the totalitarian system under which people look to the State for everything.  I am capable of making my own way without any help or assistance or any perquisites from the State.&rdquo;  That should be the object of our education.  We have failed completely in that regard, I submit.</P>
    <P>Last year the Minister defended vocational education.  I agree it is absolutely sound, but it has not made the progress here that one would expect.  To a very large extent the rural science school is a failure because the parents do not appreciate the value of vocational education. <Col N="344" /> The majority of young people go to the vocational school in the hope of getting a job and not to equip themselves with higher knowledge for work on the farm.  The girls go there largely to get a job and not so much to interest themselves in domestic economy so that they can attain a higher standard in the home and improve the amenities of the home.  Their main anxiety in going to the vocational school is to secure a job.</P>
    <P>Many a youth is sent to Glasnevin to obtain a higher scientific knowledge which may later be applied to the farm.  I believe that 99 per cent. of them are sent to Glasnevin and other schools and colleges in the hope that they will get a job and not have to go back on the land.  The outlook of the average farmer is that, for every other walk of life except the land, education is necessary.  Many a farmer is afraid to educate the son he wants to keep at home because he thinks that if he is well educated he will run away from the land.</P>

      <P>This is not a matter for one political Party; it is a national question that must be tackled if this Parliament is to do its job in an effective way.  I want to add my voice to the voices of Deputies who pleaded with the Minister for a thorough investigation into these matters.  I am quite satisfied as regards the one aspect of the problem on which I am capable of offering an opinion&mdash;the agricultural aspect&mdash;that a lot of our shortcomings and failures, and the fact that we have not kept abreast of other countries in the matter of technique, new methods and ideas and greater organisation and higher production, can be attributed to the failure of our educational system.  I urge the Minister to consider <Col N="345" /> these matters and give serious attention to the representations made from all sides of the House.  He is not so omniscient and he must not be satisfied that he is right and everybody else is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot for one moment agree with Deputy Hughes with respect to the teaching of the language in the schools.  If our children do not learn the language in the schools they will never learn it.  The only hope we have of preserving the Irish language is by having it taught compulsorily in the schools.  I agree with my colleague, Deputy McCarthy, that there should be some provision in this Estimate for sending the school children on holidays to places like Ballingeary, sending them to Irish-speaking districts, where they will learn far more than if they were sent home to parents who probably do not know Irish and any Irish they learned in the schools would quickly be lost during their holidays at home.</P>
      <P>We must remember that 75 per cent. of the youth of this country must find their way back to the land.  The groundwork in agriculture which was taught in the national schools 25 years ago has vanished from the national schools to-day.  I am not a university graduate.  I had to leave school at the age of 13½ but, if we are to judge by the products of the university who find their way in here, whose main talent seems to be the dissemination of filth and filthy abuse, and whose only skill seems to lie in keeping that abuse within the Standing Orders, I have not lost much.  We send our young lads to evening classes in agriculture and the agricultural instructors have to start training them in what they should have learned in the schools if the national schools were functioning as they should.  That is my principal complaint in regard to the national schools to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We come then to our agricultural colleges, whose sole purpose, apparently, is to turn out young fellows for jobs.  Not 3 per cent. of the young lads of to-day who attend the agricultural colleges find their way back <Col N="346" /> to the land and take up farming as an occupation.  You have them roaming around chasing after jobs.  We are entitled to ask where are our universities leading to?  The universities of this country are costing the State a lot of money.  Each year they turn out graduates for crowded professions. We have 20 doctors produced each year for every one that is required.  We have teachers coming out of universities and no schools to teach.  We have the Civil Service, like the frog in the fable, trying to swell as big as an ox.  That is the position of the university graduates. It is rather sad.  There should be in the universities a definite programme, limiting the number of graduates to be trained for the professions in this country.  Let not State money be used for the purpose of training young men for export.  Let us get down to that situation some time.  Undoubtedly there will be a big opening for engineers when the drainage schemes go through.  We will need hundreds of good engineers who know their job, if the rural electrification scheme is put into operation.  Our universities should start training with these schemes in view, instead of training for professions in which the only outlet is the emigrant ship.  I should like to ask the Minister for Justice how many applicants for the Gárda he had last year who had B.A. and M.A. degrees. Every day I meet university graduates looking for jobs, with degrees that are absolutely useless to them in this country to-day.  Let us have a ground work in agriculture given in the national schools.  As I said, I had to leave school at the age of 13½, and to go out after the plough, but I knew more about agriculture, at the age of 13½, than 95 per cent. of the lads leaving the agricultural colleges to-day. Let us consider education in the light that 75 per cent. of the boys in the schools will have to earn their livelihood either from or by the land, and let us prepare our educational system on that basis, so that our boys will not be like the young lads I meet on the roads in the rural areas at the present time, who could not recognise turnip from beet growing in a field.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephHallide" hpid="Mr. Halliden Mr. Halliden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halliden</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been rather disappointed that no provision has been made in the Estimates for the further education and direction of boys and girls who leave the national schools at the age of 14.  The national school has always been recognised as the university of the poor man's children and of the children of the middle classes.  Yet, as Deputy Corry and other speakers have said, fully 90 per cent.  of those children get no education of any kind after they reach the age of 14 years.  I think that is very unfortunate because, at that age, the children's minds are just being formed; they are at a plastic and impressionable age.  At that important period in their lives they are turned, as it were, adrift, with very little direction, very little control at the present time and with the culture they get at the crossroads.  I think that is very unfortunate.  In most progressive countries, boys and girls of 14 years of age and over are regarded as the nation's greatest asset.  In this country, too often they become burdens to us and they become the worry of their parents.  I think, with a native Government established here for a quarter of a century, it is regrettable that no comprehensive scheme has been evolved for the development of these boys and girls, for training them according to their natural propensities, with a view to providing for them a decent livelihood in their own country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Vocational schools fill a useful purpose in many districts but we have not sufficient of them and, consequently, a big percentage of the boys and girls have no chance of developing their minds and their natural gifts between the ages of 14 and 18.  They then find that they have no future but the emigrant ship and when they go to a foreign country they have no qualification for any employment except as unskilled labourers.  That is a pity, and I think our Minister for Education should seriously consider the desirability of putting into operation a scheme whereby those boys and girls will be properly directed, properly influenced, impressed and controlled, so that they will not be, as they are <Col N="348" /> at present, unfortunately, in many cases, a burden to the country and to their parents and very often out of hand and not properly controlled.  That is one of the greatest slurs on our educational system.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies stated that the system of education is not in keeping with our main industry.  That is true fundamentally, but I must admit, as one having practical experience, that there is no objection to a teacher in any rural area introducing a programme or curriculum into his school which may give the education of the children a rural bias.  I have seen that done very effectively and there is nothing to prevent others doing the same.  But I think the kernel of a great many of our social evils, and one of our greatest difficulties in maintaining the people on the land, is the fact that our children are thrown as it were into a promiscuous crowd at the age of 14 without any direction or control, while in Denmark and other countries they are taken up, directed and guided and are regarded as the greatest asset in the country.  I hope the Minister will seriously consider that particular aspect of our educational system.</P>
    <P>I think our women teachers have got a very raw deal.  In 1934, a regulation was introduced obliging female teachers to retire at the age of 60, after 35 years' service, and in that way they were deprived of five years' salary and their pensions were reduced by about 6¼ per cent.  A great many of them, who had a programme outlined for themselves and their families, have been grossly disappointed and, I say, unjustly treated.  I, therefore, appeal to the Minister to make some provision for these teachers to meet the emergency regulation that was then enforced and to compensate them in some way for the great loss they have endured.  As regards the future, we know that a regulation is in force that lady teachers when they get married must retire.  In that connection I was given some figures recently by the Minister for Education which are very illuminating. In a question I asked the percentage of married women teachers who were <Col N="349" /> rated highly efficient, efficient, and non-efficient. An overwhelming majority of these teachers were rated highly-efficient, or efficient, and very few non-efficient. That being so, it cannot be said that they were obliged to retire at the age of 60 from an educational point of view.  I am afraid it was more from a financial point of view.  In view of the present circumstances in the teaching profession, I think that the regulation should now be withdrawn and I definitely ask that it should not be enforced in the case of young lady teachers who were in the preparatory colleges or training colleges when the regulation came into force.</P>
    <P>Another strong reason why I would advocate post-primary education is that at present the Irish language is being taught very intensively in the national schools.  Some Deputies complain that the standard of education of the boys and girls leaving school is not as high as it was some years ago. That is possible and there is no reason why it should not be possible, because in the short period they are at school at present from six or seven years to 14 years of age they are obliged to learn two languages&mdash;English and Irish.  In my school days we had one language; now we have two languages. As a man who has practical experience, I can assure the Minister that we will never see the day when the Irish language will be the spoken language of the country except an effort is made to enable these children to continue the speaking of Irish, after they leave the primary school at the age of 14, through post-primary schools. At present when they leave school, packed with Irish as I might say, they very soon lose the environment of the school and, when they meet in towns or at fairs, markets, dances or other social gatherings, they will not speak much Irish.  It is only the spoken language that can keep Irish alive.  Until such time as we have post-primary schools, I can see no hope for the establishment of Irish as a spoken language.  I am absolutely certain of that.</P>
    <P>I find that nearly all the matters I meant to deal with have been already dealt with by other speakers, but I rise <Col N="350" /> specially for the purpose of making a plea for the children of the poorer and middle classes who reach the age of 14 and whose education is then, as it were, completed.  I think it should be the function of the State and, particularly, the function of the Minister to devise and plan a comprehensive scheme to give these children a proper education, a proper outlook, and a means of developing their natural bents so that they may fit themselves for a decent livelihood in their own country.</P>

      <P>Practically every aspect of education as affecting rural and urban Ireland has been touched upon to-day and I do not intend to go into any great detail in what I have to say. But Deputy Dillon mentioned a recent appointment in the Department of Education and it would appear from the case he made that the Minister, in making his selection, acted rather arbitrarily, at least to this extent, that he selected a man trained in the scholastic atmosphere of philosophy for an appointment in the technical or trades branch of the Department of Education.  He also selected a man who had been largely trained abroad, in Germany.  I do not know whether the Minister thinks that the German system of education is more appropriate in the vocational education section of his Department than the Irish system, or perhaps the Minister thinks that his selection may Hitlerise the vocational education committees and the vocational education officers throughout the country.  There is a rumour that that is the intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has extraordinary powers under the Vocational Education Act.  I do not wish to criticise these powers, as they have been passed by the Dáil, but I hope that in the exercise of these powers he will not act as arbitrarily as he acted in the case of this appointment.  There is one word which I should like to put to the Minister in regard to that appointment.  Did he at any time, either before or after the appointment was made, receive representations, objections or protests from any authorities, lay or ecclesiastical, in this State?  I am not casting any <Col N="351" /> aspersion whatever on the individual concerned, but I think it right that the Minister should make his case for that appointment clear to the House.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon established a precedent to-day in raising the question of the appointment to which the Deputy now refers. The Deputy now goes further in inquiring whether there were any ecclesiastical representations against the selection.  Does the Deputy not see the possible implications of such a query?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to cast any aspersion on his character.  I do not know the man personally, and I know nothing about him.  One point which strikes me about this Department is that it is not making sufficient use of the cinema as a means of educating our youth.  I should like to see a development in the Department whereby educational films would be made and circulated to the school districts of Ireland.  This has been done in England in the case of the Traffic Association of England with quite good results.  Traffic pictures have been made for school children to teach them the dangers of the road, the dangers to avoid when crossing roads, and so on, and they have been put in the form of motion pictures for them. I see no reason why a similar development should not take place here, so as to educate our children in matters of history, geography, agricultural science, and, of course, the matter I have mentioned, road traffic.</P>
      <P>With regard to agricultural science, the elements of agriculture, of botany and of zoology could be given to these children by a system of educational films.  We have recently had a development of that kind in Dublin in relation to Irish, and I seriously suggest to the Minister that he should undertake a similar development in relation to the matters I have mentioned in the schools.  This is a quiet period on the roads, but when this war is over and cars come back on the roads, I anticipate an epidemic of road accidents and now is the time to prepare for the terrible period that may lie ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="352" /> Juvenile delinquency, of which I have some experience, has been mentioned. No cause, I think, can be assigned as a definite contributory cause of juvenile delinquency.  It is a feature of crime in every country to-day.  Some people suggest that lack of parental control is the primary cause, while others tell us that it is due to the cinema and the gangster film.  There must be some cause for it, but, in spite of commissions of inquiry in every country, nobody seems to have been able to put his finger on the cause.  There are, however, a few points which strike me in this connection.  One is that the parents themselves are cinema-goers&mdash; they are cinema mad in many cases&mdash; and every night they are at some cinema or other, and the children are left on the streets.  There should be some sort of curfew, if you like, for children under a certain age, to keep them off the streets after a certain hour.  That system obtains in the Nordic countries.  I think there also should be a minimum age for children attending cinemas at night, and that, after a certain hour, say, 6 or 7 o'clock, no child under 14 years of age should be permitted to attend a cinema.</P>
    <P>Another factor which would contribute to a reduction of juvenile delinquency is the raising of the primary school-leaving age from 14 to 16 years, and, coupled with that, there should be a system of compulsory attendance at vocational education schools for these children who, having left the primary school, find themselves without employment.  It is from that group that the modern burglar and housebreaker is appearing in Ireland to-day. He does not belong to any particular class or grade of society&mdash;he comes from all classes and grades of society.</P>
    <P>The Minister has outlined a large scheme of school building, and we welcome it, but when he comes to consider the plans for his schools I suggest that he take in an extra piece of land&mdash;it will not cost very much&mdash; to provide a playing pitch for hurling and football, and also to give us a ball alley at the school for handball.  These are matters which have been neglected up to now in the modern schools which I have seen erected.  I would go <Col N="353" /> further and suggest that a small patch of ground be set aside for a school garden, to be worked voluntarily by such children as take an interest in gardening or agriculture, and that the garden be placed not under the control of the teacher, who has enough to do, but under the control of the local agricultural and horticultural instructor.</P>
    <P>I propose now to touch on politics for a moment, but I do not wish to be taken as trying to disfranchise the teacher or to put him out of political life, but I think that some rule should be made whereby teachers could not take an active part in politics.  A member of the Defence Forces is allowed only to vote.  He is not entitled to give free expression to political opinions and cannot take an active part in politics.  A member of the Gárda Síochána not only cannot give vent to his political feelings, but is denied the franchise.  It is doubtful if that is constitutional, but he is, by law, denied the franchise.  The civil servant likewise may vote, but he cannot take an active part in politics, and I see no reason why an official who, above all, has the formation of the youthful mind in his charge and control for five or six hours a day should be allowed to take an open and active part in Party politics.  Is it not clear that such a man or woman will be biassed and prejudiced and will not be impartial in the discharge of his duties in the schoolroom?</P>

      <P>With regard to the enforcement of the School Attendance Act, there is a gap in the 1926 Act <Col N="354" /> which, I think, should be closed at the earliest possible moment.  It arises in Section 17, which deals with the failure of parents to comply with the Act. There is a provision there that a warning in the prescribed form may be served upon the parent, and if he, within a week after its service, causes the child to attend school, or gives a reasonable explanation for his absence, everything is all right.  But if, in the following week, the child's attendance drops off, another warning has to be given.  That is happening all over the country.  When the delinquent parent is warned, he is cute enough to send the child to school for about a week. Then the child drops out again, the Gárda or the school attendance officer has to come along with a fresh warning, and the same old farce goes on. The parent is dodging prosecution all the time, and we are not getting effective school attendance.  Under the Act, if he is prosecuted, no warning is necessary within three months of proceedings. I suggest that the warning in this case should be made similarly effective, so that, once the parent is warned, the child will have to attend school for at least three months, or the parent must face the music.  It is just a small point, but it gives considerable trouble, particularly to the Gárda Síochána in rural areas, who have enough duties to perform without that type of thing being imposed upon them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one last point which I want to mention, and that is that the difficulty with regard to Irish, as I see it, is largely created by two hostile atmospheres.  The home atmosphere is hostile to the child from the Gaelic point of view.  In 90 per cent. of the cases, the parents know no Irish.  The brothers and sisters probably know no Irish, or, if they do, they do not speak it.  The home atmosphere is against Irish at the moment.  That may pass with a new generation of parents. The cinema atmosphere is dead against Irish, and I seriously suggest to the responsible Minister and to the Government that, if they are serious in this matter of Irish, they should pass legislation compelling all cinemas to show a certain percentage of their <Col N="355" /> programme in Irish.  Under present legislation, they may not devote more than 5 per cent. of the time of the programme to advertising.  Why not make some provision like that compelling them to devote 5 or 10 per cent., or whatever it may be, to Irish films?  Considerable expense may be involved in the development of Irish films, but the matter has never been tackled, and unless a beginning is made I see no hope for Irish.  I would seriously suggest that an inquiry be set up to consider those matters, in addition to the alleged mis-teaching of Irish at the moment.  I will not go into that matter because it has been fully dealt with already, but I would suggest that those two points, together with the teaching of the language and the teaching of other subjects through it, might easily form the subject of a Government inquiry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we all heard with considerable interest and with a good deal of sympathy the constructive speech to which we have just listened from a new member of this House, Deputy Coogan.  There is only one claim made in his speech with which I join issue, and that is that the freedom of teachers who take part in public affairs should be restricted.  I think, on fuller consideration of this matter, Deputy Coogan will probably form a different opinion.  I do not know whether he is aware&mdash;it is a very important factor in discussing this matter&mdash;that the winning of civil rights for the teachers took a very long time, and that in fact in certain parts of this country those rights have not yet been extended to them.  On closer investigation of this matter, I think the Deputy would probably agree that, whatever political opinions the teachers do hold, such opinions are never obtruded on their school work.  Why they should be deprived of their elementary right as citizens to exercise their views on public affairs outside school hours is a question that I do not think could be answered in the way he has suggested.  I say that with all respect, and with all sympathy towards the general tenor of his speech.  It was a very interesting <Col N="356" /> speech, and was made in a very proper way.</P>
      <P>I understand that the main questions which usually arise on an Estimate like this have already been fully discussed, and I do not propose to trouble the House with a repetition of pleas for various changes, reforms and adjustments. There is, however, one point that I should like to put to the House and to the Minister.  It is a point arising out of the marriage ban imposed on teachers.  I do not propose to discuss this question in its wider application to all lady teachers at the present time, except to impress on the Minister that there is a very strong view in various parts of this country that, in regard to the comparatively small number of teachers who had actually entered on their career and were undergoing a course of training at the time that this regulation was made, the ban should not be imposed I refer to the teachers who were then in the preparatory or training colleges. I think the number is small, and I think the Minister will agree that the comparatively few people who had made arrangements to embark or had embarked upon a career of teaching, and who were unaware of this impending change, could be reasonably said to be in a different position from lady teachers generally.  I think that is a point which is worthy of further consideration, and accordingly I bring it to the notice of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want also to add my plea&mdash;I think this matter ought to be stressed very strongly&mdash;to what has been said in favour of some adjustments of the miserable condition of the old, pensioned teachers.  In some cases £1 a week represents their total income.  I understand that it is as low as 10/- a week in other cases.  Whatever our financial difficulties are in this country, I think nobody will deny the justice of the claim of that dwindling, pathetic few in this country at the present time to have adjustments made in their position.  I want to impress that on the Minister.  I think no section of people in this country, no matter how they may feel the necessity for keeping taxation at its lowest possible level, will grudge whatever may <Col N="357" /> be spent in doing some belated measure of justice to the small and rapidly disappearing number of people involved in this case.</P>
    <P>There is only one other matter to which I should like to refer, and I am afraid that, in making this plea, I am asking for something that cannot be answered at the present time, and that is the appearance of an extraordinarily large number of young boys and girls in this country who, in spite of having received very high standards of education and being afforded very high educational possibilities of one kind or another, are not, seemingly, fitted for the battle of life.  I refer to the very large number of boys and girls in this country who have gained very high educational qualifications, such as the leaving certificate, and even higher qualifications, and who yet are compelled at the present time to take any kind of casual work.  That is something that we all regret.  I am sure that every member of this House is aware of it, and I can only hope that there will be some change made in this regard in the future.  Perhaps, we might be emboldened to hope that there may be some prospect of a change in that regard in the future as a result of the prospects held out by the Minister for Finance in the statement he made to-day, when he said that he hoped that, in the years to come, there would be better prospects in that direction.  At any rate, I think it is very disappointing and depressing that, in this country at the present time, there should be such a large number of young people, with high educational qualifications for whom there seems to be no opening or no immediate prospect of employment.</P>
    <P>I admit that that is a much wider matter than could be discussed within the scope of this debate, and I only mention it because it is an ever-present and pressing matter in the minds of parents at the present time.  Parents, at the present time, can see very little future for their children, and that is the reason I have raised this matter. With these few remarks, I shall conclude, hoping that the Minister, in his reply, will deal with the points I have made, or that, if it does not come <Col N="358" /> within the scope of this debate, he will find an opportunity subsequently to give his attention to this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>On previous occasions in this House, when this Estimate was under consideration, I always waited almost until the last speaker had spoken, because I wanted to hear what was the view of the trained educationist on this matter before I intervened&mdash;or even the views of those who, in other spheres of life, might have been associated with the teaching profession or with the bringing up of children, in general.  For that reason, I listened with great interest to what Deputy Coogan had to say because, knowing the experience that he has had over a number of years in dealing with juveniles, I realised that any contribution he might make to this debate would be of interest and probably of considerable benefit.  For that reason also, I listened very carefully to what a new member in this House &mdash;Deputy McCarthy, from Cork&mdash;had to say, because I knew that he was interested in the matter of education. I want to make it clear, however, that so far as I am concerned, I stand in this matter where I have always stood. I join with my old friend, Deputy Murphy, in the plea he made on behalf of the old pensioned teachers.  I feel that the Minister's heart is in the right place in regard to the old pensioned teachers, and I am sure that the Minister will sympathetically consider the plea that has been made on behalf of those aged servants of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, in relation to this question of married lady teachers, I took up the stand on a previous occasion, and I stick to it still, that because of the amount of unemployment amongst unmarried lady teachers in this small country, lady teachers should be compelled to retire on marriage in the same way as lady civil servants are compelled to retire on marriage.  Deputy Halliden raised the question of a lady national teacher who entered one of the training colleges long before this ban on married teachers became operative, and I admit that there is an injustice there, since young girls entered <Col N="359" /> the service at that time, not knowing that, on marriage, they would have to retire.  Many years ago, I advocated that lady teachers should be compelled to retire on marriage, because I maintain that if a man marries he has a jolly good right to be able to keep his wife.  I have always advocated that, and I still advocate it; but, having made that point clear, I also want to make clear, in regard to the regular spate of oratory that we heard here to-day on the matter of juvenile delinquency and juvenile crime, that there should be included in the curriculum of our national schools some text-books on civics.  Long before juvenile delinquency or juvenile crime became as bad as it is now&mdash;whatever may be the cause of it, and many causes are assigned to it&mdash;I advocated that a reasonable attempt could be made to deal with the problem if we had included in the curriculum of our national schools some text-book or text-books on civics.  I think that the value of a knowledge of civics cannot be overestimated either in this House or outside it.</P>
    <P>It must be obvious to all of us that, in this country in recent years, young boys and girls coming from the national schools have no regard for public property.  Dublin City and Cork City Deputies are fully aware of the destruction that is done to public property by these boys and girls.  You have cases of lifebuoys being cut to pieces on the quays, street lamps broken, trees torn up, and so on, and I suggest that if a course of teaching on public civics could be given to these children in their early days in the national schools, it would go a long way towards eradicating or diminishing juvenile delinquency.</P>
    <P>Now, the Minister talked about our universities and their worth to the nation, but it must be remembered, whether we like it or not, that we shall always have an exportable human surplus in this country, and, thank God, we have it.  We are a prolific race, and there is no natural way of keeping the race down.  There may be an unnatural way of doing it, as has been discovered in other <Col N="360" /> countries, but I shall not enter into that.  However, so far as this country is concerned, we are a prolific race and we know that we have and, with God's help, will continue to have an exportable human surplus, but the question is: What is to be done with that human surplus?  I hope that we shall never see this country turned into the condition of other countries where the race has practically ceased to exist. Please God, that will never happen in this country, but we should endeavour to train our young people to face the world and prepare them for the battle of life.  For that reason, I join with Deputy Corry in his plea for an agricultural bias in the training of our young people, especially in the country districts; but, at the same time, I suggest that it would hardly be necessary to create that agricultural bias in the training of children from the cities and towns.</P>
    <P>I remember, when I was a youngster, we had a little green book&mdash;I forget its title at the moment, but I think it was written by Fr. Finlay&mdash;in which special emphasis was laid on agriculture, the rotation of crops, and so on. That would be of no use to city boys in after life.  It was certainly all right for country boys who would be looking forward to spending the rest of their lives on a farm, but it would be no use to boys of the city as a preparation for their after-life.  I have the feeling that if we are to continue to have that surplus export population, as I hope we shall continue to have, these young people must be qualified to make their way in some other country and to earn their livelihood in other countries. They must be equipped for the battle of life.  If we are to send that surplus of our population across the Channel, to the United States of America, to New Zealand, Australia, or other colonies, then I think we shall have to see that our children will be properly equipped for the battle of life in these countries.</P>
    <P>Again, I have to preface a whole lot of what I have to say because of the methods, and the nasty methods, particularly of our political opponents, in taking words or phrases out of their context and implying that, because <Col N="361" /> some of us may speak on this matter of education, we are enemies of the movement for the restoration of the Irish language.  I have every sympathy with the restoration of Irish as the spoken language of this country, but I am absolutely opposed to compulsion in any shape or form.  I attended a meeting some months ago, in the City Hall in Cork, at which the Taoiseach made a wonderful appeal for the Irish language.  One of the new Deputies of this House, a councillor of Cork Corporation, who is now Deputy Daly, was sitting by my side in the City Hall in Cork when that appeal was made by the Taoiseach.  Now, a well-known and distinguished educationist was also on the platform&mdash;the Right Reverend Monsignor Sexton, Dean of Cork&mdash;and he was vigorously opposed to compulsion, and, of course, when the Taoiseach was replying he joined issue with the Dean on that matter, and pointed out that English was made compulsory here.  The Dean is not here in this House, but I am sure that we all feel that that was not right, coming from the Taoiseach.  I felt that even though that appeal was well put, he had not his whole heart in it because he knew there would not be 50 or 40 per cent. of the audience who wanted compulsion.</P>
    <P>If we are to have that exportable surplus&mdash;and we know we are going to have it&mdash;continuing in this country we should give some consideration to the people who constitute it as well as those who remain in the country and who will continue to remain in it so long as they can get a living in it. If we are to continue compulsion it will have very bad results and these results are already apparent.  What are the facts?  The child, be he boy or girl, is reading a primer, a first or second year book which is in Irish and contains no English at all.  That child goes home to an atmosphere in which, in 99.9 cases out of 100, no Irish is spoken.  The parents at home speak no Irish, the result being that the child doing its homework cannot receive any help from the parents or the guardians. Any teacher will bear me out&mdash;I had 12 months' experience of teaching myself a long time ago&mdash;that the help <Col N="362" /> and co-operation of the parents are a wonderful asset to the teacher.  In the past everybody in the home was able to spell out for the child in difficulty ordinary words in the primer, the second, third, fourth or fifth book. That co-operation exists no longer because the people in the home are unable to co-operate with the child in the direction I have indicated. Although we have a lot of statistics on paper which go to show that pupils in the Seventh Standard are as advanced as similar pupils were a quarter of a century ago, the Minister must know that that is not the case. Anybody in business who has any kind of experience, such as I have had myself going back over 30 years, of boys leaving the national school after having been through the Fifth or Sixth Standard, will know that such boys in former years were fully equipped to take up most positions offering in the commercial life of the country.</P>
    <P>To-day what do you find?  I can produce to the Minister&mdash;no names, no pack drill&mdash;a letter written to me by a boy with the Leaving Certificate in which four or five words were wrongly spelt.  That is a common experience. Ask any employer, if he had his choice as between the type of boy who in the past came from the Fifth or Sixth Standard in the national school and the boy nowadays with the Leaving Certificate, which he would prefer.  The odds are 100 to 1 that his answer would be that he would prefer the type of boy who left the national school after having reached the Fifth or Sixth Standard some years ago.  We know that boys were prepared for the British Civil Service in national schools in remote areas in former years and that they passed into that service with the highest honours.  We had the case of a boy from a national school near Sneem who topped the list for First Division of the Civil Service in Great Britain.  To-day we have our colleges turning out a number of professional men.  Deputy Corry seems to deprecate that.  But if those men have to go abroad to earn a living, that should not be regarded as discreditable to the Minister for Education.  It is a good <Col N="363" /> job that we have our colleges and universities even if we have to export our physicians and surgeons to another country.  I agree that of course if we had a population of three times its present size, if we had a population of 9,000,000 or 10,000,000, things might be different, though I imagine we would be eating our heads off if we had a bigger population than we have now.</P>
    <P>I wanted to hear some trained educationist speak on this question, those who are in contact with education in the country, but I agree that the man in the street should have a little more to say to the education of his child than he has had up to this. I know that we have enshrined in one of our measures the principle that the parent should have that right.  I think the right still exists to say: &ldquo;Well, I want my child to be educated and to have a knowledge of Irish, but I do not want to have Irish rammed down his throat.  Let him learn all the Irish he can but I am totally opposed to compulsion in the teaching of Irish.&rdquo; I have often given expression to that view myself and I have been dubbed an Imperialist for saying so, yet I have been elected six times to the Dáil. All this talk cuts no ice with certain people, but the fact remains parents are not sufficiently vocal on this question. They are vocal in their homes and they are vocal when they come to see their local T.D., whether he be Fianna Fáil, Labour or Fine Gael, and I may tell you they do not say anything very complimentary in regard to the teaching of Irish in the schools&mdash;in fact, sometimes, rather the reverse.  Occasionally their language is of a lurid type that I should not care to repeat in the Dáil as I do not want to bring the debate down to the level of the proceedings here last Friday.  I say that on this question we should face up to the facts.  By all means let us have Irish taught in the schools and let us encourage the teaching of it in every way, but there should be no compulsion.</P>

      <P>Deputies Murphy and Anthony have mentioned two points to which I specially intended to refer, <Col N="364" /> indeed two points to which I have referred on various occasions on this Estimate.  I refer to the case of pensioned teachers and the marriage ban as applied to those who had entered preparatory colleges or were in training at the time that that ban was promulgated.  In reply to a question put in the Eleventh Dáil by the then Deputy Connolly from the Labour Benches, the Minister gave the various grades of pension and the number of teachers in receipt of these pensions.  His answer was very illuminating because we find from it that the number of old retired teachers who were in receipt of pensions not exceeding £52 per annum, £1 per week, was 320; that those in receipt of pensions not exceeding £78 per annum or £1 10s. 0d. per week numbered 136; that those in receipt of pensions not exceeding £104 per annum or £2 per week numbered 230; that those in receipt of pensions not exceeding £2 10s. 0d. per week, numbered 679; that those in receipt of £156 per annum or £3 per week numbered 792; that those in receipt of £182 per annum, that is £3 10s. 0d. per week, numbered 494; that those in receipt of pensions of £208 per annum or £4 per week, numbered 332 while those in receipt of over £208 per annum numbered only 129.  The total number of pensioned teachers at the date the Minister replied to the question was 3,112.  Of these only 129 had pensions in excess of £4 per week. There were 320 who had pensions of less than £1 per week and 136 who had pensions between that amount and 30/- per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the feeling of everybody in this House would be in the direction that Deputy Murphy outlined, that at any rate for old teachers who are in receipt of a pension under £3 a week some concession should now be made.  It would not cost a terrible lot and even if it did it would be a dwindling sum, because most of those men are now well on in age.  The persons in receipt of the smaller pensions, we may take it, are very old, because they must have gone out at a period before the granting of the increase in salaries which carried a rise <Col N="365" /> in pension with it.  I have worked out the various figures here and even if you gave a flat rate increase of 10/- per week to all those who have pensions under £182 per year, that is to bring their pensions up to £3 10s. 0d. per week, it would amount to a sum of £1,325 per week or about £68,900 a year.  It is a substantial sum, I agree, but it is a sum at the imposition of which no taxpayer would grumble. Every one of these men gave long service of a particularly strenuous type to the country.</P>
    <P>Some people may think that, because the hours appear short, teaching is an easy job.  Anybody who knows anything about teaching and about the spending of five or six hours a day in charge of young children from five to 15 years of age realises that there is scarcely any work more strenuous. These old people spent from 35 to 45 years doing that type of work.  Now, at the end of their days, there is a strong case for making some little concession to them.  Even the small sum of 10/- per week to these poorly-paid pensioners would make a very substantial difference to the comfort in which they can live.  I ask the Minister to go once more into that question and to consult the Minister for Finance with a view to seeing if anything can be done for those pensioners. I leave the matter at that.</P>
    <P>I raised the question of the marriage ban before.  I pointed out to the Minister one extraordinary anomaly in the concession he made to persons who were junior assistant mistresses at the time the ban was promulgated.  I forget exactly what the amendment he made was but I know the effect it has had.  Take the case of two girls sitting on the same day for the examination for entrance to a preparatory college. One got a very high place at the examination and was admitted to the preparatory college; the other failed to get a place.  The girl who succeeded went on to the training college from the preparatory college and became a fully qualified national teacher, having spent six years in preparing&mdash;four years in the preparatory college and two years in training.  That involved <Col N="366" /> some expense.  There is a State grant to assist students but in nearly every case there is some contribution by the student.  In many cases, a very considerable contribution is made by parents towards the training of their children as teachers.  What has happened?  In one case of which I know a girl who succeeded in passing the exams, and going into training, spending six years in the process, came under the ban and, if she marries, she will be obliged to resign.  The other girl, in due course, passed the qualifying examination and became a junior assistant mistress.  She commenced to teach as junior assistant mistress and was earning during portion of the time that the other girl, who had been more successful in the examination, was in training.  She is now married and still a junior assistant mistress. There is something wrong in that.  I am making this plea only for those who were either in the preparatory colleges or training colleges when the ban was promulgated and my plea can affect only a very limited number.  I make no plea on behalf of any person who entered a preparatory college after the ban was promulgated.  Those who did that acted with their eyes open.  I think the ban is unfair to the girls who were in preparatory or training colleges at the time it was announced and unfair to their parents who expended a considerable sum in preparing them to qualify as teachers. Many of them could ill-afford the money which they spent in this way. I know one man who says that he would not have spent a five-pound note to qualify his daughter as teacher if he had known at the time she was about to enter the preparatory college that this ban would come into force. That is a matter which, I think, the Minister should review.</P>
    <P>I listened with great interest to such of the speeches on this Estimate as were delivered while I was able to be here.  Unfortunately, I was not able to be present for the Minister's statement or for some of the earlier speeches.  Deputy Dockrell made what I regarded as a very interesting speech.  He referred to educational canons and tenets.  I agree that all this work which we are attempting to <Col N="367" /> do through the medium of Irish appears to be against some of these educational canons.  Some years ago, I referred to that in this House.  I told the Minister that I remembered, when sitting in the lecture room before the late Dr. Corcoran, that one of the first principles of education we learned from him was that we must proceed from the known to the unknown.  That is an ordinary canon of educational science but the fact of the matter is that I know of cases where all that has been blown sky-high.  I know teachers who have carried out this work of teaching through the medium of Irish children who had not a word of Irish when coming to the school and who have done that successfully. Unfortunately, I am afraid those are exceptional cases.  Where you have a gifted teacher, a born teacher, fully equipped, with a magnificent knowledge of Irish, and where you have all the enthusiasm you usually find in the good teacher, then this thing can, undoubtedly, be done successfully.  But it would be far too much to expect that the general body of teachers would conform with these requirements. I am afraid that the canons to which I have referred, though they cannot be generally applied, have still a certain amount of justification.  We should, at least, sit down and examine what has occurred over the period of years in which the experiment has had a trial.  It was from that point of view I spoke here in the past.</P>
    <P>Deputy Breathnach made easily the best speech I ever heard him make in this House.  He spoke entirely in Irish and his was one of the best and one of the most moderate speeches.  I have heard on an Education Estimate for quite a long time in this House.  It was an excellent speech.  On one point I did not agree with him.  In reply to Deputy Dockrell he tried to show that the Deputy was wrong, not from the angle I have pointed out, but because of the way in which English was brought in as the language of this country.  That is mixing up two different things.  If it is our desire to force Irish over as the national language, and as the sole language, then I should <Col N="368" /> say that what we are doing is quite correct.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coogan instanced the operations of the British Government here for a number of years in the educational line.  Through teaching entirely through the medium of English, and through the documents, summonses, etc., that were distributed in the Gaeltacht, and where Irish was spoken, they desired to have English the spoken language, where such was not the case previously.  That was not the educational programme.  Nobody could say that that method of putting English across was good from the educational point of view.  It was good from the British point of view to make English the spoken language here.  We must segregate that from the educational principle.  If we are setting out to forget that educational system, and to force Irish across as the spoken language we are going in the right way. I think we ought to consider the position if we want to do two things, not only to bring Irish along as the spoken language but also to educate children who are growing up.</P>
    <P>It is time that we took stock to see where we have gone.  Deputy Breathnach was quite good on that.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;B'feidir go bhfuilimíd ag dul amugha&mdash;bféidir nach bhfuil an slighe ceart againn agus go mba chóir feuchaint isteach 'sa sceul.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was a moderate point of view from a person who, from youth, is well known as an Irish revivalist.  It was advocacy of inquiry into the educational system now, to see how it has worked, to see whether, in fact, we are making an advance even in knowledge of the spoken language. Side by side with that you must have the effect it is having on the general educational standard.</P>
    <P>I join with Deputy Breathnach in saying that we ought to have such an inquiry.  About 22 years have gone by since this system was instituted.  Some Deputies forget that this is not one of the things for which Fianna Fáil must be blamed.  It was Professor O'Sullivan, when Minister for Education, brought in that system of education, <Col N="369" /> and gave it a trial.  It was he who, some years ago, was the first to advocate that, after the number of years that had gone by, it was time to take stock to see where we were going, to see what advance we were making with regard to the progress of the Irish language, and whether we were advancing our educational system generally.  Therefore, I think, now that the Minister has had that spur from his own benches, and from a man who has been a lifelong enthusiast on the side of the revival of Irish, one who is a native speaker, he ought to listen to views from his own benches and concede that inquiry.</P>
    <P>Some of the things that Deputy Breathnach said would make one doubt whether there had been any substantial advance.  I was amazed when he mentioned that some persons who had spent four years in a preparatory college, and then two years in training, and, who, presumably, must have had a considerable knowledge of Irish when they succeeded in passing the entrance examination to the preparatory colleges, when they came from the training colleges were unable to teach the bilingual programme.  I was amazed to hear that.  It was the first time I heard that such a thing could be possible. Certainly if that is the case, then there is room for inquiry as to how the colleges are acting.  The Report of the Department of Education on page 15 contains a paragraph entitled &ldquo;Labhairt na Gaedhilge&mdash;an dul chun cinn ins na hÁrd-Ranga.&rdquo;  What that report shows would make one sit up and take notice because it indicates that in the higher classes in the national schools now, there is far from being that advance that might be expected.  In fact, in the higher classes teachers have to go back and teach things that were learned in the lower classes some three or four years previously.  That being so, it is right that the Minister should look favourably now on the suggestion that some inquiry should be made by some body set up by himself, preferably composed of persons whose bias is entirely pro-Irish and who are themselves enthusiastic in the revival.  I concede that.  Let a body of that type be set <Col N="370" /> up, which will go into the whole question of what success we are achieving by present methods, to see whether they are successful with regard to Irish.  I assume that you would have amongst those with an Irish bias, people with educational qualifications, and that they would look into the general effects on our educational system.  There is a strong case for that.  It is giving nothing away and is no slur on the Department to have such an inquiry.  It is no slur on the teachers to have such an inquiry.  I can see no reason why the Department would consider it a slur or why the Minister should consider it a slur.  He was not the originator of the system.  If the thing is wrong blame a previous Minister for Education, Professor O'Sullivan.  There is no slur on the Department if it is found, as a result of inquiry, that the system needs reforming. On that point I think the Minister should agree to have an inquiry.</P>
    <P>Those who have been advocating inquiry in the past have now support in asking for it from Deputy Breathnach, who is a very experienced teacher and a well-known revivalist of Irish.  Deputy Breathnach referred to other matters with which I have sympathy.  One which would have considerable effect in helping the work done in the schools after the children have left ordinary schools concerns night schools which were abolished.  I had forgotten that it was so long ago since these schools were abolished. These schools were conducted by national teachers as an extra.  Possibly when national teachers became a little more affluent, and when their salaries were improved as they were in years gone by, they were not so keen on carrying on these classes&mdash;but they were very useful institutions in the country at that time.  I do not know that I could agree with Deputy Breathnach that they would be so attractive now.  If Deputy Breathnach knew his native Kerry as well as I do in the last few years, he would find that there are other institutions more attractive now, such as dance halls, and that while in the past people used to go to classes in the national schools, <Col N="371" /> there is the attraction of the dance halls which take all their spare pence. If the Minister, after consultation with the teaching profession, thought it advisable it might be worth while giving the thing a trial because the ordinary boy or girl, after leaving school, will have few opportunities of keeping in touch with any Irish reading or any chance of improving their knowledge of Irish through conversation unless some opportunity of this sort is provided for them.  The number of vocational schools in the country is few as far as the rural areas are concerned. They are very difficult to reach, but the night school is there in the locality and a lot of the young people from 16 to 21 years of age would turn into it for social purposes. If they did nothing more than speak Irish there, that, I think, would probably be a considerable help towards the spread of the language.</P>

      <P>We had an interesting discussion on this Estimate.  It will give heart to people, especially when they read the speeches made by those who, because of their teaching qualifications, can be regarded as speaking with authority on this subject. Many grievances brought to my notice by the managers and teachers in my county deserve to be raised here. Most of the teachers hold that the present Minister for Education is too dictatorial, that he will brook no opposition and will not listen to reasonable complaints put forward by the teaching profession.  I think myself there is something in that.  We need to have friendship and harmony in order to give the best education possible to the children.  Therefore, the Minister, I think, should keep in closer touch with the national teachers' organisation.  At the moment there is a wide gap between the two. Instead of divergent views, there should be harmony and a closer coming together between the Minister and the teachers.  That would be for the good of all.  The managers in different parts of my county feel that there is no use in their going to the Department with any grievances such as trying to get a teacher with long <Col N="372" /> service&mdash;8, 10 or 15 years&mdash;promoted principal when another teacher retires.  They find that the Minister overrules and wipes out all their pleas and complaints, and will not listen to reason.  I think that is wrong.  After all, the managers of the schools have long experience behind them.  They have had a good education and should be listened to.  They know more about the work done by the teacher in the school than either the Minister or the Department.  After all, the manager of a school knows the type of teacher that is there, whether he is good at the character-formation of the citizens of the future.  Therefore, I say the manager should get more consideration from the Department and the Minister. I hope that will be so in the future.</P>
      <P>The teaching profession is one of the noblest in the country.  It comes next to the clergy and should be maintained on the highest plane. It is not right that the teacher should always have to be begging and craving for an increase of salary.  It should be at such a figure as will enable him to live in reasonable comfort and fulfil the task allotted to him.  That task is a very important one&mdash;to lay well the foundation of the coming generation. If the teacher has to be constantly making complaints that he cannot live on his salary, it tends to lower him in the eyes of the people. Deputy Lynch referred to the unfortunate position in which the old retired teachers find themselves to-day.  It is too bad that respected teachers who gave 30 or 40 years' service to the country, and who are in retirement in this difficult time, should have to try and live on small, mean, niggardly pensions.  They are not able to do so, and are in such a bad way that they nearly have to seek home help.  It is not a good thing for education that any teacher should have to beg or crawl.  The Government should make a noble response to the appeals that have been made on behalf of these old teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A good deal was said to-day about the present position of teaching. According to statements made here, almost everyone is a dunce and education has gone to the dogs.  I do not <Col N="373" /> hold that view at all.  Our education may not be up to the standard that we would like, but I think that, on the whole, it is reasonably good. Almost every parent thinks that his child is a genius.  The fact is that, while you may have one brainy child in a school, you will have 20 or 30 dunces.  As a people our abilities are moderate enough.  We do throw up a genius occasionally, but I think that, in the general run, we are a pretty dull people.  Education, taking it all in all, is not in such a bad way at the present moment.  What, I think, we are most backward in at the moment is in the character formation of our children.  Something has gone wrong there.  That is a subject that will need more attention in the schools in the future.  What I find is this: that most of our children when they get into any mischief are ready, in order to escape the consequences, to tell lies and to swear holes through a pot.  There is nothing manly in that.  If a child does wrong, he should be manly enough to own up to it.  The fact, however, is that he will evade every means of telling the truth.  That is a bad thing. There is too much untruthfulness in the youth of to-day.  They are ready to tell lies in order to escape the consequences of their acts.  In the old days if farmers' children did anything wrong, they would own up to it and take their trouncing like men.  The children of the present day will not do that.  They will do anything to evade punishment and will try to get off as easily as they can.  Therefore, I would urge more character formation in the children attending school.  In the schools the children should be taught civics, respect for the old and the weak and for animal and bird life. At the present time you find children going along the roads in the spring time trying to find out birds' nests so that they may rob them or kill the birds.  That is another aspect of education that should get attention.</P>
    <P>There is a good deal of controversy as to why we have not a proper agricultural bias in this country.  That is a question that I have looked into.  I am definitely of opinion that the reason why we have not that agricultural <Col N="374" /> bias is this: in the past, 90 or 95 per cent. of our teachers and clergy came from the farming community. At that time the farmers were able to pay for the education of their children so that a boy might become a priest or a teacher.  At the present moment education and the priesthood are almost vested interests so far as the children of civil servants, of teachers and of the R.I.C. are concerned, or they may be the children of some of the new aristocracy that has sprung up in the country.  That is very unfortunate, because they have not the proper economic, national or social outlook.  They are a different type of people altogether from the agricultural community.  We had a far better type of people when the teachers were the sons and daughters of farmers.  At the moment, it is a rare thing to find a farmer's son or daughter able to become a teacher. They are shoved to one side by the new aristocracy who have plenty of money, pomp and means to oust everyone out of their proper place.  I think there should be some definite bar against the professional classes ousting the ordinary agricultural people from their lawful rights.</P>
    <P>This country was a much better place to live in when the agricultural people were in control.  At the present moment it is the sons and daughters of the R.I.C. and of the Civic Guards who are teachers.  That is why you have not a proper agricultural bias. What in the name of God could they know about agriculture?  They would not know a cow from a goat.  How could they teach the agricultural community, which represents 95 per cent. of the county, or how could we expect to have good results in agriculture? My old teacher spent a good part of each day forming the character of his pupils.  He taught us to respect animal and bird life, how to live on the land and everything that was good. At the present moment we have a crazy system by fanatics who do not know anything.  They teach for five or six hours, then get out and have a good time afterwards.  A good many teachers blow into my county from God knows where, and do not seem to have any qualifications, but they go <Col N="375" /> around the country as irresponsible fanatics night after night.  You could not expect farmers or labourers to send their children to schools where they are teaching They have the gibberish of the Irish language, which they did not learn because they were paid to do so, but rather because they came from native areas.  They are trying to cram Irish down the people's throats, in the land of the Pale, where English was forced down the throats of our fathers and grandfathers.  These bombasts do not show any great respect for the ordinary people, and they are taking the place of the farmers and other decent people.</P>
    <P>Technical education is one of our vital needs, which I would like to see fostered and brought to a high pitch. However, in my county some years ago, some fanatics built a high building in a little village at great cost&mdash; that was the huge school at Nobber, which cost £10,000.  They also converted an old workhouse into a school at Dunshaughlin.  From that day to this, those two buildings have been white elephants and a drag on the taxpayers. A public inquiry should be held into that matter and they should be closed down and the pupils transferred to some other school.  Those schools are kept there at present by certain people in their own interests and that is not fair to the county.  I would agree to the continuance of those schools if there were a decent class attending, but the teacher has to go around begging and crawling to find students and even has to pay some of them to go to the school, so that it may be kept open.  I would like to see these teachers retained in permanent employment, but I do not want these schools to be a drag on the community.</P>
    <P>As regards technical education in general, people seem to have a bad outlook, their whole idea being to get a job and get away from the land. Some definite article should be signed by people going to technical schools, that they will go back to a certain profession or do something in their own homes or on the land.  In my county, many people of the ordinary <Col N="376" /> cottage class go to the technical schools to learn shorthand and typewriting and when proficient they have no thought but to get a job.  They are not willing, when the job is not there for them, to come home again as they are too big for their homes and want to be grandees, ladies and gentlemen and walk around refusing even to pick a bag of potatoes for fear it would dirty their boots.  They like to have plenty of lipstick and, as a result, they are just a nuisance to everybody.  The people who went to school with them are ashamed of them and look down on them as upstarts.  Eventually, they drift to Dublin or over to England and often do not end up well.  I do not like to see this type of people with only shorthand and typewriting.  In fact, that should be closed down, as it is really a nuisance.  They should be taught domestic work, how to make butter, how to bake bread and keep poultry and they should go home to stay with their parents.  They will not do that at present, as it would be work then and they want to take the line of least resistance.</P>
    <P>I agree that the Irish language should be fostered and brought forward in this generation and the next, as well as we can, but I do not think we should try to force it down people's throats.  The people are as patriotic as they can be and want to learn the language, but they do not wish to be rushed too quickly.  They do not want these fanatical teachers from Donegal and the West of Ireland to come &ldquo;faluterin' &rdquo; around the country driving it down the people's necks. The people in my county are sick of that and do not want these bombasts who come, not for the purpose of the language, but to get themselves bigger jobs.</P>
    <P>Regarding school building, I am not at all satisfied that the Minister has made any effort in the last few years to remedy the desperate condition of at least 12 schools in Meath.  They are a disgrace, they are dirty, sodden and rat-eaten and the children spend the whole day in damp and dirt, looking at the rats coming up from their holes and they try to hunt them with crusts of bread.  It is not fair to expect children to be properly educated in <Col N="377" /> that way.  After 25 years of native government there should be a decent, sanitary school, with an acre or two of ground in each parish and every attention given to teachers and children.  I would not blame the teachers in any of the schools in my county if they threw up the job.  They have been complaining from year to year and asking that something should be done.  The wind whistles through the windows and the doors and half the children are sneezing and coughing, and the teachers are at home for months, through the schools being dirty, insanitary, damp and draughty. The managers and the Minister should get something done, as the present state of affairs is not fair to the community.</P>
    <P>The debate has been a good one, and I think the Minister will be more helpful, after having heard the views put forward than he was in the past. Teachers and managers have told me that the Minister scarcely listens to reason, but brushes aside complaints and queries by managers.  That is a wrong attitude.  After all, the Minister is really the servant of the people and should be able to meet the teachers' organisation and the managers and do something.</P>

      <P>I asked the Deputy last year&mdash;or any other Deputy who had a complaint about a school&mdash;to write to me.  I do not recollect having heard from the Deputy.  Really, in self-defence, I think I am entitled to ask him to come forward and give particulars of the cases in which he alleges there was neglect.  It is not sufficient to come in once a year to make general statements.  I am entitled, in all fairness, to get some particulars of the cases the Deputy has in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has continued <Col N="378" /> for about six hours and I am sure that, if the Minister has not benefited by some of the speeches he has heard during the day, he has benefited very much by that of the last Deputy.  In regard to any complaints which were brought to him by me, he did his best.  That is correct, though I do not want to rub him down.  I had to go to him on many occasions during the year and, while he meant well, he was very slow.</P>
      <P>There is one point I make, in all seriousness. In my constituency, schools have gone into disrepair, though not as bad as those in Meath, where Deputy Giles says the rats are hunted with crusts of bread; and I would ask the Minister, in the case of rural areas in the Province of Connacht, to give a bigger grant from the Department towards the repair of old schools and the building of new ones.  The manager is at present responsible and, in a poor parish in a rural area, he finds it impossible to collect the money, with the result that the years pass on, until at last the school is a total wreck.  I have a case in my own parish, where the manager had to go to the bank to raise the contribution which he had to give to the Department, in order to have the school built in that parish.  I think in the poorer rural areas, especially in the Gaeltacht, where definitely the inhabitants are very poor and unable to contribute, the amount expected from them should be lowered considerably and the smallest contribution possible should be asked by the Department towards the repairing of those old schools or the building of other schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards desks for schools, I had occasion some time ago to go to the Minister on the subject of providing desks for a certain school.  He sent down an inspector, who reported as to the necessity for desks in that particular school.  That was some nine months ago, and it was only to-day, strange as it may seem, that I got a letter on the subject.  I do not believe the writer of the letter knew that it would be mentioned here to-day.  He says there has been no word yet with regard to the desks. In this school there are four or five children sitting in a desk intended for <Col N="379" /> two, and in some instances there are children who are obliged to sit on the floor.  That is the case in one convent school at least.  I shall try to see the Minister to-morrow about that matter.  There is no reason why, having sent down an inspector some nine months ago, the position in that school should not by now be remedied. Deputy Giles made a complaint as regards agricultural schools.  My view is that 90 per cent. of the young people who attend national schools and later go to the higher schools are only anxious to get away from agriculture. There can be no doubt about that.  I do not think any discussion here will induce the children attending these schools to become agriculturally minded.  I believe the wish of the father and the mother in most cases is to give their children a higher education so that they will be able to go away entirely from the land.  That is the trend in the country at the present time.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give serious attention to the matters to which I have referred&mdash;the contributions from the poorer rural areas towards the building of new schools and the repairing of schools that need repair; the position of some schools that urgently require desks and perhaps other furniture.  I might point out to the Minister that in some areas the manager of the school has had to go to the bank to get money in order to have repairs carried out.  In my own parish the manager had to get money from the bank in order to put up the amount necessary for the building of a school.  There was no hope of work being done otherwise. I hope the Minister will see that only the smallest contribution will be expected from the poorer rural areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Almost every aspect of education has been mentioned by Deputies in the course of this debate. There are some matters I would like to emphasise.  The cleaning of schools is one subject with which I would like to deal.  I do not think any Deputy mentioned it at any great length So far as I have been able to ascertain, no contribution is made by the Department <Col N="380" /> to the cleaning of schools.  The practice appears to be that children are kept after school hours in order to sweep out the school.  I think the Minister will agree that that is not as it should be.  Many parents and teachers attribute the spread of tuberculosis in a great many areas to the fact that children are kept after school hours to sweep out the schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I will refer the Deputy to sub-head C (6) of Vote 46, and he will see that there is a provision of £47,500 for the heating and cleaning of schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the amount given for the cleaning of schools is sufficient, because the managers find themselves in the position that they are unable to pay a decent rate, and therefore cannot employ any person to clean the school.  If one goes through some of our rural areas he will find the schools in a very filthy condition.  Apart from the cleaning of the floors, the walls never seem to be swept down, and they are seldom distempered or painted.</P>
      <P>I notice that there was a paper circulated by the Minister to-day.  I suppose it is a translation of the speech he made in Irish.  In that paper he refers to the provision of new schools.  I presume that means after the emergency.  If the Minister proceeds at the same rate after the emergency as he is proceeding at the present moment in the matter of erecting schools, then it will be a very long time before the Department of Education will be able to overtake requirements.  There are absolutely wretched schools in some parts of rural Ireland.  I know some schools in my own constituency, and they are in a wretched condition.  It is absolutely impossible for children to absorb decent education in such a wretched environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies have mentioned teachers' salaries.  I think the Minister knows that there is, and has been for some considerable time, discontent prevailing among the teachers.  I think he will admit that it is not good to have such discontent in the teachers' <Col N="381" /> minds.  Deputy Norton said to-day that a man whose mind is agitated by reason of the fact that he is unable to balance his household budget, is not in a fit condition to impart education to children.  The teachers, for a number of years prior to 1920, were agitating for increased payment.  Some time in 1920 they extracted from the British Government a comparatively decent scale of wages.  The normal scale for men was from £170 by annual increments to £370, and for women £155 by annual increments to £300. When that scale was in operation in 1923, the Government of that time applied a cut of 10 per cent.  In 1932 there was another cut ranging from 5½ to 8 per cent.  Before 1938, the new minimum and maximum rates for men were from £140 to £303 as compared with £170 to £370, and for women the figures were £128 to £246 as against £155 to £300 in 1920.  These rates remained unchanged until April, 1938, when the Minister announced an increase of 5 per cent.  In 1933, when the Public Economies Act was passed, cuts of 5½ per cent. to 8 per cent. were applied.  The Public Economies Act expired on March 31st, 1934, and all the services, with the exception of the teachers', had their original salaries restored.  So that I think it would be admitted that the teachers, above all other classes of civil servants in the State, have suffered very severely.</P>
    <P>In Northern Ireland the position is infinitely better.  For men there the salary ranges from £160 to £356 and they get a war bonus of £45 per annum.  Taking everything into consideration, the Minister must admit that the teachers have reason for their discontent.  Repeatedly in this House Deputies have asked that some increase should be given to teachers who are on pension.  I think it will be admitted by everybody that those teachers who have gone out on pension in recent years were the pioneers so far as the teaching of Irish is concerned. They did the spade work in the old days.  They were comparatively old at the time and they had to go to a great deal of trouble in acquiring a sufficient knowledge of Irish to enable them to impart it to their pupils.  These people are to a great <Col N="382" /> extent in a state of hardship now in consequence of the low pensions that have been granted to them.  I have heard a suggestion made lately that even a refund should be made to pensioned teachers who had made contributions to the Pension Fund.  The position as regards contributions is different now.  I would ask the Minister to do something to increase the miserable pensions that are being paid to the pensioned teachers, as has been done in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>There was a great deal of criticism to-day of technical education.  I think the system of technical education in this country at the present time is splendid.  I do not think the Minister ought to be condemned if having had certain schools erected in certain areas and facilities provided for the people, the people do not take advantage of them.  I do not think the Minister can be blamed for that. Some people have asked that an agricultural bias be given to education in the technical schools.  My experience on a vocational education committee, of which I have been a member for a considerable time, is that any reasonable demand made on the Department of Education is conceded. Many and many a time classes were asked for in parts of the country where they had not previously existed and when representations were made to the Minister through the committee, the classes were at once established. I do not think any blame should be attached to the Department in this connection.  I believe that if a definite desire is expressed on behalf of the population in any part of the country, the Minister and his Department are always most anxious to help.  That is my experience at any rate and I think it is only right that I should say so.</P>
    <P>In regard to vocational education, some years ago there was a greater tendency to give scholarships for certain trades.  In recent years I do not think so many scholarships are given. In domestic economy classes in technical schools, especially in urban areas, and in engineering classes, I think a greater effort ought to be made to secure that pupils attain such a degree <Col N="383" /> of education that they could be given scholarships to enable them to become teachers.  I refer specially to domestic economy teachers.  The tendency at the moment is, I think, to take people from colleges and universities to be domestic economy instructresses.  I would ask the Minister to do something to encourage pupils in the ordinary technical schools to attain a degree of knowledge which would qualify them to become teachers. After all, domestic economy in itself is a humdrum existence.  I know it is absolutely necessary and I wish more of our people would take advantage of the courses of instruction in domestic economy afforded in the schools all over the country.  But I also think pupils should be encouraged to qualify as teachers.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the heating of schools.  My attention has been drawn to the fact that there was a large school built in Crumlin, in this city, a very short time ago, and that during last winter there was very little, if any, heating provided in that school. No facilities were provided for cooking although the Dublin Corporation were prepared to help in providing food to be cooked under the Free Meals (Necessitous Schools) Act.  I understand that electric heaters had been provided in the school but, of course, as everybody knows, for the last two years it was not possible to have proper electrical heating in any building, especially in a school.  I would ask the Minister, before next winter is here, to try to provide alternative heating apparatus because there was a number of complaints during the past winter.</P>
    <P>With regard to the building of new schools and the repair of schools, I, like Deputy Donnellan, would suggest that the Minister should not insist that a proportion of the cost of a new school, or of the repair of a school, should be collected in the parish.  Anybody familiar with the country will know that it is in the particular area where there is a poor population we find the bad schools.  Managers in various places have made strenuous efforts to try to collect their portion of the money required for a new school <Col N="384" /> and in a great many cases they have been unable to secure the necessary proportion to qualify for the grant.  I think the time has arrived when that question should be examined, and I think the Minister should recommend the Department of Finance to give the entire cost.  It is only then that we may arrive at a stage when we will have proper school facilities throughout the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BridgetMRedmond" hpid="Mrs. Redmond Mrs. Redmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Redmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to a few points, as I feel that this is one of the most important Estimates that will come before the House.  After all, when we talk about education, it embraces everything and everybody.  For that reason I think that it is my duty to say just a few words.  The first thing I should like to ask the Minister about is the condition of some of the schools.  I agree that he is perfectly right when he says that we ought not to come in here with complaints and not be able to back them up.  I am wholeheartedly behind him in that.  Actually, I have no complaint about any school, but, at the same time, I do know of certain schools that have no sanitary accommodation, and at this hour of the day, in 1944, that does not speak very well for such an important Department that has an amount of money at its disposal. I feel sure that the Minister will, within the next year, see about trying to improve conditions in the schools in country places, because everything should be first-class for the children in order to bring them up to the standard that we expect them to achieve.  We want to have them in surroundings that will encourage them to learn and encourage them to go to school.  As well as that, it will be an encouragement for their parents to see that they attend regularly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I often wonder are the children of the present day as well educated as the children were when we had not self-government here.  It is my opinion that the children of the present day in the national schools, even though we have schools which are run by an Irish Government, cannot take their place with the children of some years ago. First of all, it has been stated here that perhaps sufficient attention is not given to character-forming and to <Col N="387" /> training them for private life.  I quite agree with that, because you do not want anything better as an example than the children's misuse of private or public property.  You simply cannot pass by in a motor car without children, for want of knowing better, and perhaps for want of being taught, feeling it their duty to throw stones.  I quite agree that children will be children; but, at the same time, I think that sufficient time is not given to their training in this regard, as it was in the old days when people were told how to behave themselves.  I think there is a grave lack in this respect in the schools at present.  Too much attention is paid to cramming into the heads of the unfortunate children things that perhaps will be of very little use to them in after life.  I think it is really time for plain speaking and for stating the facts as we find them.</P>
    <P>Something has been said about the technical schools.  I think they are very excellent institutions, and my only regret is that it has not yet sunk into the minds of the parents that they should insist on their children, particularly girls, attending these schools. Possibly this is a big thing to ask, but I think the Minister should make it compulsory for girls on leaving the national schools to attend some of these technical schools, even for six months' training, because so many of them are lacking in this training when they look for positions in later life. When you ask them why they did not go to the technical school, they look at you as if they never heard of it.  I often think it a pity that they are not made realise, when going through the ordinary school, the necessity for attending technical classes in the afternoon and night on leaving these schools, and it would be well if something could be done to instil into their minds a realisation of the necessity of preparing for after life, and that education is not a great load for anyone to carry, no matter what position he or she occupies.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that some agricultural course should be given in <Col N="388" /> the ordinary schools, and I quite agree.  It would be excellent if a few hours in the week could be set aside for the training of boys who are interested in farming, because it is to farming they must look for their livelihood. As I came in, I heard a Deputy say that it was some people's idea and aim in life to prepare children of this country for export to other countries, but any sensible person will understand that has always been the case, and will continue to be the case.  We certainly do not want to close ourselves up here on an island and have no intercourse with the outer world, and we ought to be proud of the many who have gone to other parts and made a name for Ireland in the past, and who, I am sure, will do so in the future.  We should aim at education which will make us fit and capable of taking our place in any nation, whether we like it or not.  We have got to earn our living, and we have to make up our minds to it.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the question of compulsory Irish.  The Minister knows my feelings on this matter, as I have spoken on this Estimate several times. I quite understand that there may be people who feel that the Irish language must be restored, and if it is the idea that, by doing so, we shall get a prominent position as a nation, I believe we should have it as an independent language and as a language taught in the schools for itself; but we should not try to aim at something which we cannot achieve, that is, the education of our children through the medium of Irish.  It is not possible, and the teachers have come to that conclusion. I have been speaking to lay teachers and nuns, and surely they ought to have a good idea of what can be done.</P>
    <P>It is very easy to lay down rules in an office, but it is quite a different matter to put those rules into force in schools where a teacher is trying to control 50 or 60 children, which is a small figure for any school.  Nuns and lay teachers in country schools find that the task of imparting the knowledge they want to impart to the children through the medium of Irish is really impossible, and no matter how ardent the Minister may be in <Col N="389" /> the matter&mdash;and I believe he is&mdash;I think he should call a halt to this procedure, because it is not for the good of the children's education.  It is for them we are supposed to be catering and we do not want to make them dislike the language.  We want to get them to like the language so that they can learn it as a language.  That is not the position at present.  People have come to the conclusion that it is a matter of putting Irish down their throats, whether they like it or not, and whether they are capable of learning other subjects through Irish or not.</P>
    <P>It would be well&mdash;and I say it in all sincerity&mdash;for the betterment of the education of the children of the present day if the whole matter were re-examined by, if you like, some sort of committee which would not be biased one way or another.  Let such a committee examine the facts as we hear them throughout the country and I feel sure that the Minister will alter his decision.  No matter how badly he may feel about abandoning the idea, I feel that when he comes to believe it is for the good of the education of the children who have to set forth to make a livelihood in other countries, if not in their own, he will agree that it is not a proper system.  At present many of the children are not able to read or write properly, or to add figures.  These are horrible facts, but that is the position, and I am sure that when the Minister examines them, he will have no doubt as to what is the right thing to do, that is, to teach it as a language, if he feels keenly about it.  I say that sincerely and genuinely, and in no spirit of vindictiveness.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a long debate and I want merely to touch on a couple of points which have already been referred to.  First, I think it would be very wise if the Minister would acquire small plots of land adjacent to schools in rural areas in order to instil into the children as they are growing up a taste for agricultural work.  Every county committee of agriculture has a county agricultural and horticultural instructor, and the moneys provided by the local authorities <Col N="390" /> would be very well spent if a few hours each week were devoted to demonstrating in rural schools to children in their early years how best they could use their brains on the land.  It would be a great help in after life towards making good men of them because it is the early training which makes the man.  If a child is trained to agricultural work, it will be an encouragement to him in after life to remain on the land and to have a love for the land, instead of having no love for it and no training in the use of it, but an anxiety to get away from it, as is the case at present.  It would have the effect of encouraging a flight to the land instead of from the land.</P>
      <P>With regard to fuel for schools in winter, provision should be made by the Department for an adequate supply of fuel for schools in the rural areas during the winter.  It is very hard that young children, in many cases badly clad, have to travel two, three and even more miles to school and remain in school in soaking clothes all day.  That is a matter which should be given serious consideration by the Minister if the health of the children is to be preserved.  Every effort is being made to-day to cope with the dreadful disease which we all know as T.B., and the provision of an adequate fuel supply is one of the ways in which we could eliminate any tendency towards that disease in the children.  I know five schools in my own area in which not even a glass of drinking water is available for the children.  It is a very serious state of affairs that numbers of children should be gathered in a school for four, five or six hours, without a supply of even spring water, and having to depend on people who cart water past the school obliging the teacher with a few gallons a day.</P>
      <P>That is a very serious state of affairs. I think the Department ought to be more conscious of its responsibility, and that the board of health, through the intervention of the Department of Education, should provide an adequate supply of water both for drinking and sanitary purposes in the schools.  I would ask the Minister to take particular note of those three points, and to see that attention is given to them as early as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="391" />
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig) Thomas Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think perhaps the first thing I should say in reply to the points which have been made by the different Deputies who have spoken is that the control and management of the primary schools in this State is vested in the Church authorities.  As far as the State is concerned, we come in to give certain financial assistance, in the building and improvement and the heating and cleaning of schools, for example, and we come in, through the inspectors, to see that the work is done satisfactorily and that certain standards are attained by the teaching staffs.  The Church occupies the predominant position in regard to the control of education here. That is a point which I think Deputies ought to bear in mind, particularly if they are inclined to make strictures upon the Minister for Education or his Department for neglect that has come under their notice in maintaining school buildings properly.  The provision of the site and the establishment of the school in the first instance as well as maintenance are matters for the school manager.  The initiative must come from him.  When a proposal from the manager is received in my Department for the building of a new school, or the reconstruction or improvement of an old one, the matter goes ahead. The Board of Works is responsible for seeing that the site is a good one, and that the work is carried out satisfactorily, particularly if the manager does not make the full local contribution of one-third which is normally expected. If the case is what is termed a necessitous one, that is to say if the district is either a very poor one or there have been very heavy liabilities upon it, and it is clear that the manager is unable to put up the standard contribution of one-third, the State may give more than its normal two-thirds, but I am satisfied that, in the future, the ecclesiastical authorities throughout the country as a whole will make every effort to see that the parishes make their fair contribution.  I do not agree at all with Deputy Donnellan, although we both probably have the same idea in mind and we both want to get the work done.  It must be my duty, in safeguarding the interests of the State in this matter and in carrying <Col N="392" /> out the wishes of the Government, to see that the local contribution is a satisfactory one.</P>
      <P>I am not disposed to hold up necessary work for the sake of a few pounds or for the sake of haggling or bargaining, but I hope that, under the plans for a large building programme which we have envisaged, with the cooperation of the ecclesiastical authorities&mdash;to which I am looking forward with confidence&mdash;we shall have a better response from those areas that were lacking than we have had in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must not be forgotten that a great many of the managers have made big sacrifices.  When I am told that there are certain managers who have not been able to collect money to carry out their obligations, my first answer is that the managerial system&mdash;and I think it is to the interests of the country as a whole that that system should be continued and should be operated satisfactorily; it is in conformity with our traditions; it is peculiary suitable for our needs, and has been so pronounced by the responsible spokesmen of the church authorities&mdash; envisages that the parish must shoulder its responsibility in this matter.  Unfortunately, owing to historical reasons, in certain areas in the country people consider that they have no obligations towards the schools.  They think that is entirely a matter for the Department of Education in Dublin.  There may have been some justification for that belief in the long years when the National Board portended to them an alien administration, but there is no justification whatever for continuing that view under an Irish Government.  The schools are the property of the trustees for the people themselves.  In them their children spend a great part of their lives, and it is to the interest of each one of us to see that they are built properly in the first instance, and, when built, that they are properly maintained.  Unfortunately, they are not so maintained in certain areas, and I want Deputies to realise that, so far as I am concerned, I have tried to get the Government to make the largest possible annual contribution towards getting essential work done.  During the coming year we hope to expend <Col N="393" /> in grants another sum of roughly £250,000, and I think that is very good having regard to the emergency conditions and to the difficulty of getting the work done.  It is quite true that at present we are not in a position to get ahead with our new building programe, but we can plan for the post-war period.  The Government, as you know, have set up an organisation to establish priority in regard to post-war building.</P>
    <P>Projects for building throughout the country are under the direction of the head of this branch in the Department of Industry and Commerce, and my Department has been supplying that office with a list of the cases in which action is actually proceeding, both as regards the building of new schools and the indication of sites which have been already obtained and sites which will be secured, and we intend to add to these.  We realise that, in order to solve this problem of clearing off accumulated arrears, it would be necessary to spend at least double the amount that was spent in the pre-war period.  In regard to school buildings, my advice to those who wish to plan for the erection of school buildings after the emergency would be to get in now on the ground floor, so to speak, and to send along their proposals as soon as possible.  We have received a large number of proposals already, and I am awaiting proposals from a large number of areas in the country.  When I receive proposals from other areas in the country, I intend to send them along, like the others to which I have referred, to this branch of the Department of Industry and Commerce to secure priority for them.  If managers of schools do not send proposals to me in time, there is a danger that whatever materials are being allocated to us for school buildings may not be available to them at the end of the emergency, and these schools, therefore, will have to be omitted.  Even with the best will in the world, school buildings cannot hope to have absolute priority over other buildings.  Hospitals and other similar institutions, for instance, will also have to be taken into consideration, but so far as it is possible to do so, we hope to get priority for schools, as being necessary, <Col N="394" /> not alone for educational purposes, but also from the point of view of providing hygienic surroundings for the pupils of these schools.</P>
    <P>With regard to this matter of the appointment of teachers, as there is a number of new Deputies in the House, I should like to make clear, with reference to a statement made by a Deputy here, that the Department of Education has nothing to do with the appointment of teachers, except to the extent of seeing that the teacher appointed by the manager has the necessary qualifications that are laid down under the rules.  I have nothing to say as regards the appointment of a teacher, except to that extent.  The matter of the appointment of a teacher is entirely one for the manager of the school concerned.  There is also the question of the panel and seeing that the panel regulations are carried out. There is no use in Deputies asking me to alter that, because I have no discretion in that matter, and therefore I would ask Deputies not to press me upon it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy referred to the ideals which ought to actuate us in our educational policy, and he spoke of the foundations being available, so far as I understood him, and being satisfactory in other places.  I think that we have the foundations here. We have the happy position that we have Church and State working hand in hand, as I have just mentioned, and in regard to any development which may be considered necessary in the way of re-construction in the post-emergency period we shall have the satisfaction of knowing that we shall not have these very critical questions confronting us which divide nations so sharply, even in neighbouring countries.  We shall not have these fundamental issues to face here. Thank God, we are all united on these fundamental matters in this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy seemed to suggest that, perhaps, I was not fully aware of what is going on in the schools. Surely, I am more fully aware of what is going on in the schools than any other Deputy could be.  Not only have I the advantage of personally seeing from time to time what is going on in the schools, but I also have the advantage <Col N="395" /> of seeing the reports of a large staff of inspectors and officials. These are not merely persons who come in to me to give advice on rare occasions.  They are people who have spent practically a whole life-time, since their official careers commenced, in dealing with these matters, and they are intimately concerned with education in all its aspects.</P>
    <P>I am not one of those who lazily assumed that when we took upon our shoulders the task of reviving the Irish language and making it the spoken language in this country, it was something easy to do.  I know that we have undertaken such a task as few other countries have ever taken in hand.  I realise that it is a very serious and tremendous work, and I also realise that there is no easy way to achieve success.  I know that, if we are to achieve the ideals to which Deputy Mulcahy referred as having guided us in the past, through such organisations as the Gaelic League and Sinn Féin, it will not be easy, and I know that the efforts of all such bodies have been and will be of the greatest possible assistance to us.  But we must not assume that we can easily achieve the objective of having the language spoken again generally in this country.  It was because the Irish Government, in its early years, realised that this question of the restoration of the language was a fundamental one that they set out to see that its foundation would be laid solidly by Gaelicising the work of the schools gradually and thoroughly. That work has been going on for 20 years, but if one were to pay attention to some of the criticisms that were made here, it would appear that the present critics are in the same position, with regard to lack of information as to the real position, as the critics of compulsory Irish were over 20 years ago.  I shall not go into that matter, but I do say that we have precisely the same criticisms at the present time regarding methods of restoring the language, and so on, as we had at the time of the controversy on compulsory Irish over 20 years ago.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="396" /> We have demands made for inquiries. I am not opposed to inquiries.  As I said last year, if it is necessary in the interests of the language that an inquiry should be set up, the Department of Education has nothing to be afraid of.  Our instructions are there in black and white, and it is admitted by those critics who, at least, have done us the courtesy of reading these instructions, that they have been carried out, and are being carried out.  I have been in infants schools, where I can truthfully say that the knowledge of Irish possessed by these infants would compare favourably with the knowledge of a foreign language possessed by an adult and educated person after having spent a considerable time abroad in learning that language.  I wish that Deputies would go into these schools and see for themselves what is happening.  I am not saying that all the schools can perform the work that has been set out for them.  As has been pointed out in the course of the debate, it requires the greatest skill and devotion to duty to attain the wonderful results that we see, but I know that these results can be got and have been got.  I also know, however, that if we are going to relegate the language to the position in the schools where it is only going to be a school subject, we shall not be able to achieve our object.  From the very fact that the child is living in an English-speaking atmosphere, that he hears nothing but English in the home, and perhaps receives very little encouragement to speak Irish in the home&mdash;and that is for nine or 10 hours out of the 14 or 15 waking hours&mdash;I cannot see how the language can be restored without very intensive effort on the part of the teachers in the schools.  It would be quite impossible, if we are not going to concentrate on the language in the schools, to make up for the serious inroad that the English-speaking atmosphere all around them must have on the children, particularly at that impressionable age.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fionán Lynch said, very truthfully, last year, that even if it were a comparatively easy task to teach children the language in the schools and to get the teachers to teach <Col N="397" /> it efficiently and get good results, and even if the parents were anxious to co-operate with the teachers, nevertheless, granted all these things, there was no proof that the children would like Irish particularly. If the teachers, on the one hand, fail to give the children the necessary background in teaching them the history of their country, and pointing out the way in which it is bound up with our language, and if the parents, on the other, do not help the children along, then obviously it is a very difficult thing to expect the children to speak Irish of themselves.</P>
    <P>I think it would be quite unfair and not related to the facts to blame the schools because the children receive no encouragement outside, that they give up speaking Irish after a while and probably lose a great deal of the Irish they have learned.  The fact is that the Irish is there; the children know Irish.  There is probably more Irish known in this country now than there has been for the last 100 or 150 years, but it is not being spoken.  A language cannot live, cannot exist, unless it is spoken.  Its continuous use means its existence.  It is because the officers and the Minister for Education, from the first Minister down to myself, realised that continuity in the use of the language was essential so that the pupils would not only secure a firm grip of the language but that they would speak it quite naturally in their ordinary lives, that the policy of extending Irish gradually to all subjects and classes was embarked upon.  It is not easy to get those impartial people who, on the one hand, have no commitments or no prejudices about the Irish language, or those, on the other hand, who, in Deputy Fionán Lynch's opinion, should be on the Irish-Ireland side and who would be absolutely safe, so to speak, from that point of view.  It is very difficult to get persons who will satisfy those who are really anxious about the position and who want a strictly impartial and unprejudiced examination and to satisfy others who want to ensure that anything that has been gained during the last 20 years of hard work is not going to be thrown away now by trying to push the clock <Col N="398" /> back.  If it were easy to secure the personnel for such an inquiry, I think I may assure the Dáil that it would have been set up long ago, but it is not easy.  Moreover, you would require to have persons who have some intimate knowledge of the work of the schools, who would preferably have spent a considerable portion of their lives themselves as teachers, and who would understand all the matters that are likely to arise.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy seemed to suggest that, if there are criticisms and challenges to the present policy, the Department of Education ought to go out and answer them.  It is extremely difficult for anybody in the Department, except the head of the Department who has enough work apart from that, to answer these criticisms.  I do not know whether the Deputy means that I should take on the position of answering all these critics, very often nameless ones.  If I do, I shall probably be charged, as An Taoiseach has been charged here in the course of the debate, with arrogating to myself the right of being the sole spokesman, the sole custodian and monopolist, as far as the Irish language is concerned.  If we are going to make progress we shall require the assistance of all those who are interested in the language revival. We shall require their intense and earnest support in fact.  The mere answering of criticisms will not be sufficient.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, what is required is a nation-wide movement, to get the support, not alone of all those who had formerly been workers in the language movement and who understand the issues, but of the young people who have seen the Irish programme themselves and who have gone through the schools during these 20 years, to secure their interest and to awaken their enthusiasm.  If we can get that, I have no doubt whatever that we can get results because I am quite certain that they have the knowledge of Irish.  The fact that we have had this criticism of An Taoiseach to-day is proof that the speeches he made while campaigning in the country have at least had the very beneficial effect that the Irish people have come to see that this is a big <Col N="399" /> national issue and that it can no longer be treated as a mere question of the schools.  It must be brought out into the market-place.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not admit that an essential preliminary to mobilising support in the country would be a statement of the facts as regards the problems that would be included in the reply of the Ministry to these criticisms?  A statement of the facts is essential to mobilising public support.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>One fact, in my opinion, whether the work of the school is faulty or not, is that the children have a knowledge of Irish and that the schools cannot be blamed because progress has not been made outside the schools.  Other agencies must be blamed for that.  I do not think that when your commission of inquiry come to examine individual schools they could ever come to conclusions other than those which other commissions have come to based on general observations.  They could discern certain advances or certain retrogressions.  They could give us certain general indications of progress or otherwise, but in the schools they will visit they will see results which may range from poor or unfavourable up to results which are very excellent.  I have no doubt whatever that you will get schools and teachers of varied degrees of proficiency when your commission go out to examine the position.</P>
      <P>With regard to the policy of the Department generally, as I explained to the House on former occasions, our ultimate policy aims at the extension of continuation education until provision is made for the attendance of all young persons between 14 and 16 years of age at suitable courses of instruction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Part V of the Vocational Education Act, young persons between 14 and 16 years of age in any area who are not in attendance at school can be compelled to attend courses of not more than 180 hours per annum.  That <Col N="400" /> provision has been in operation in Cork for the past three years.  We have brought it into operation in Limerick and we are considering bringing it into operation in Waterford.  I said last year that we intended to bring it into operation in Dublin and would make the necessary arrangements but that it would be impossible to state at what date the scheme might be brought into operation.  A great deal of preliminary work would be necessary in a large centre such as Dublin.  In the meantime, the Commission on Juvenile Unemployment has been sitting under the chairmanship of His Grace, the Archbishop of Dublin, and I understand that that commission has been looking into the educational as well as the social aspect of the problem.  We have not been pressing forward with our arrangements pending the report of that commission.  I believe that we shall probably receive from the report valuable guidance as to the lines on which we should proceed and the best direction to go in extending our system of education and in providing better post-primary facilities.</P>
    <P>When Deputies tell me that we ought to do more, I take it that what they have in mind is that attendance at centres of continuation education should be made compulsory.  I should like to refer them to what I said in my opening statement in dealing with a number of counties in which there is a constant absence of from 20 per cent. to 25 per cent. of the pupils even when those pupils should, according to law, be present at school.  I am glad to hear from my friends, the farmer Deputies, that, if we extend compulsory continuation education in the rural areas, they feel it will be received with general acclamation.  The figures regarding bad school attendance in so many counties which I have read out&mdash;this bad attendance has, unfortunately, persisted since the emergency&mdash;would seem to show that our people do not appreciate the education provided for them.  If they did, we should, certainly, not have those serious absences in the areas which I mentioned.  I hope the enforcing authorities will do more, if that be possible, to secure a better attendance. We have been surveying the position <Col N="401" /> generally with a view to ascertaining the financial and other arrangements which would be necessary if a scheme of compulsory full-time education between the ages of 14 and 16 years was being introduced into the towns and cities.  As regards the rural areas I do not wish to enter into all the points for and against or to debate at length the question of the school-leaving age.  I merely want to say that, as most rural people will recognise, there is, obviously, a question as to whether extended education in rural areas will be compulsorily whole-time or merely part-time.</P>
    <P>At any rate, we can congratulate ourselves in this country that, whatever plans are being made elsewhere for education in the near or distant future, we have taken a very practical step, which I always regarded as an essential preliminary to the adoption of compulsory continuation education, either part-time or whole-time&mdash;the introduction of a scheme of family allowances.  I always believed that, preparatory to introducing any scheme to compel poor parents to keep their children at school over the age of 14 years, some allowance would have to be made to them.  When the Family Allowances Bill was being considered, the Government decided that it would not be tied up with the question of school attendance.  We were not going to make the payment of the allowances dependent on the attendance of the children at school.  We definitely rejected that.  The allowances are payable generally, and the school-leaving age has not, so far, been raised in a general way.  In my opinion, the introduction of the scheme of family allowances was a necessary preliminary and enables the step for the raising of the school-leaving age to be taken more easily if it should be decided to take it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne referred to the provision of boots, fuel and books for the children at school, and he described the schools as &ldquo;a disgrace to any Government&rdquo;. I do not know whether or not he was here when I was explaining, in my opening statement, that the management and control of the schools, including provision for their heating <Col N="402" /> and cleaning, is a matter for the school managers.  In so far as the Department of Supplies has been able to do so, it has, within its resources, provided the school managers in Dublin with the necessary fuel.  I know that. Deputy Martin O'Sullivan referred to the size of classes in Dublin.  In a number of schools we have those large classes.  We have been looking into the question over a long period, and, if it were merely a question of providing additional teachers, the problem would be easily solved.  That is not the position.  In spite of the fact, to which Deputy Breathnach referred, that a very large number of children&mdash; probably several thousands&mdash;have been transferred under the housing schemes from the schools in the centre of the city to the outskirts, we still have a number of schools which have not accommodation for the children attending them.  They have not sufficient rooms, and under no scheme of reorganisation of the teaching staff or for the provision of additional teachers, could we arrange that there would be sufficient accommodation for the classes.  The accommodation is not there.  The only alternative seems to be&mdash;and we are seriously considering it &mdash;restricting the enrolment in those schools, particularly in the junior classes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Breathnach referred to the fact that young teachers were not very successful in passing the examination for the teastas dhá theangach.  The examination for the teastas dhá theangach, which would enable the teacher to secure the qualification necessary to teach other subjects through Irish, was in the nature of a severe literary test so far as the training colleges were concerned.  When a teacher had been trained and was engaged in teaching outside, the examination included a test in the practice of teaching.  But, so far as students in the training colleges were concerned, it was really a test of a literary nature and did not give them, in my opinion, a fair opportunity. I do not say that it was not extremely disappointing we had not better results but, since last year, there has been a definite improvement in the numbers which have passed the <Col N="403" /> examination.  The standard is, naturally, a very high one.  The inspectors do not wish, nor do I, any teacher to attempt to undertake teaching through Irish unless he is fully qualified.  If the teastas dhá theangach is to be a criterion of his ability to teach through Irish, it must, obviously, be a qualification of high standard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton stated that the teachers received a &ldquo;stony rebuff&rdquo; from me when they came to see me about the question of having their emoluments improved, in view of the increase in the cost of living.  I do not think Deputy Norton's description, in his rhetorical manner, of my &ldquo;stony rebuff&rdquo; is an accurate description of what took place.  I explained to the teachers, as I explained to the Dáil that since the emergency the Government has followed a certain policy with regard to increases in emoluments.  If I asked the Government to depart from that policy in regard to teachers, then it must be departed from in the case of civil servants, guards, and other public servants.  I hope that it may be possible to do more for the teachers, but I suggest that it is quite inaccurate to say that there was any lack of interest on my part.  I explained the policy fully to the teachers, and told them that they were not likely to be successful when I made representations to the Government, in view of the feeling the Government had, to adhere to their declared policy.  That is the position.</P>
    <P>As regards teachers' pensions, I explained last year that the Government feel that if they can do more for those in their direct or indirect employment at the present time, who are in the category of public servants, they should have first claim upon them.  It is not that the Government feels hard-hearted, or does not realise the position of teachers who are on very small pensions.  It is not a situation that should not arouse their compassion. The fact is that these teachers are on pensions in the ordinary way, and we cannot deal with them, apart from the whole class of pensioned public servants generally. <Col N="404" /> If I approach the Minister for Finance again on the matter I am sure I will be told that it would be quite impossible to deal with one particular class of pensions without raising the whole issue of whether pensioned officers are not to receive an emergency bonus, somewhat similar to that which those in employment had received.  That is going to be a rather big financial item.  A good many of the teachers on small pensions were junior assistant mistresses or lay assistants, and did not come into the pension scheme at all until 1934.  A certain number of them I must say are, probably, teachers who had not very long service, but had retired for disablement or for other reasons.  I do not contend for a moment that the pensions they are receiving in a great many cases are anything like what one would like to give them, if these matters could be ruled entirely by our natural feelings, or what we would like to do as distinct from what we can do, having regard to the other obligations on the National Exchequer.</P>
    <P>On the question of the retirement of women teachers at 60, I hope that it may be possible, with the new measures we have had to take to restrict further recruitment of young teachers, perhaps in the not too distant future, to relax that rule.  If it is at all possible I should like to do so. I could not at present, having regard to the state of unemployment amongst young teachers, relax the rule further than in the cases which Deputies know of, genuine cases of hardship, where there was no other income for the family except that of the woman teacher, and where there were children at school, severe sickness, or big debts to be liquidated.</P>
    <P>I cannot hold out any hope to Deputy Lynch, in spite of the fact that I would be delighted to give him whatever he asked for in this House, he has such a persuasive and nice manner in making a case.  I should like very much to meet him in regard to the question of allowing those girls who were in training or in preparatory colleges, when we made the announcement that women teachers would after a certain <Col N="405" /> date have to retire on marriage.  The Deputy has shown the danger of making any concession whatever.  A small concession which was given to junior assistant mistresses in the same connection is now being used to try to lever a further concession.  We must have finality somewhere.  I regret to have to say to the Dáil quite definitely, and, I hope, finally that I do not intend to relax that rule any further. We will have to stand by that.  It was not introduced for financial reasons but on general social grounds.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes and other Deputies referred to the question of an agricultural bias in the schools.  We had all that out last year and the position is as the Taoiseach and I explained to the Dáil more than once.  If we expect our teachers to give our pupils in national schools the rudiments necessary in reading, writing and in the speaking of two languages, and to have a foundation in arithmetical knowledge, and in addition have some knowledge of elementary history and geography, particularly the history and geography of their own country, we are giving the teachers quite a large amount to do.  I do not think it would be reasonable or fair to ask them to do more.  Deputy Halliden knows from his experience in the agricultural, as well as in the educational sphere, that if teachers are countrymen and are interested in country things, they can use these as a background and as an illustration for a great deal of the work of the schools.  When they are doing arithmetic, they can talk about the sugar content of beet or the results of cow-testing associations where they still exist.  Teachers can get any number of practical illustrations which, if they are really interested, will be of far more moment, coming from personal interest than anything we might ask them to do through official instructions.  The fundamentals in rural schools, and the basis of learning must be the same as in the city schools.  It is all right to say that we should have different programmes, but after all fundamentals must be the same.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Donnellan reminded us, people will try naturally to advance <Col N="406" /> their children by giving them the best possible education, so that they may get a better position in the world, perhaps, than their parents had.  We have no fault to find with that, but in my opinion it is the simple explanation of that situation.  I do not think that Deputy M. O'Sullivan was right in alleging that students could become qualified as teachers without qualifying in English or in mathematics.  It is quite true that in order to secure honours in the leaving certificate examination it is not necessary for a candidate to take English, but I think we may take it that, even those candidates who have gone through the preparatory colleges, have to pass in the leaving certificate in English and mathematics, as well as getting honours in the examination as a whole.</P>
    <P>We are looking into the question of whether it may not be possible to pay salaries more promptly, or, at any rate, make more prompt payment of salaries to lower paid teachers.  The question of closing the Dublin or other schools on the same days for holidays is really a matter for the managers. In that connection I may mention that we are interested in seeing, particularly as long as the present severe restrictions in electricity and fuel last in towns and cities&mdash;it may be more difficult in rural areas&mdash;that children will be allowed home at the same time for the mid-day interval, so that they may have lunch together at home.</P>
    <P>The provision of boots and school meals are really questions for the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  I hope that he may be able to do more to help the poor children, particularly in the larger centres like Dublin.  Deputy Dillon referred to the new place of detention, when referring to orphans, and the necessity for trying to have orphans boarded out with respectable families. The number of orphan children in industrial schools would only be about .2 per cent.  The new place of detention at Glasnevin is the building which had been used as part of the preparatory college where the pupils and staff lived for some time.  The entire house is not in use.  It is roomy. <Col N="407" /> The dormitory and dining room are spacious, and the accommodation generally is, in my opinion&mdash;I have been there&mdash;suitable.  It would not be possible to have a clinic in connection with juvenile delinquency there, because these boys are only kept there on remand from one court to another. That a clinic should be maintained there, that would necessitate that these boys would be kept under supervision for a longer period of time.  Normally the period of detention is a week or two.  I think that the matter of clinics will be dealt with in another way.  In any case, the question of having a clinical examination in these cases would really come more appropriately under the Department of Justice, because that is the Department that should make the necessary arrangements to facilitate the district justices.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon raised the question of the Institute of Higher Studies and of certain restrictions that have been placed on the members of the staff in the publication of works.  I do not intend to set another bad precedent today which, I think, I would be doing if I were to go into the work of the institute here.  I think that we ought to leave these matters to the institute and its director, the council and governing boards and committees, to thresh them out.  I do not think that the Dáil is a suitable place to do that.  Neither do I think that it would be in the interests either of the institute or of the parties in whom Deputy Dillon may be interested, to thresh out these questions here.  Deputies know very well that we cannot have the necessary knowledge of all the facts and circumstances, and that this is not the appropriate body to deal with such matters.</P>
    <P>The question of the appointment of the chief inspector in the technical instruction branch of my Department was also raised.  As the Ceann Comhairle pointed out, it was rather a precedent that the appointment or promotion of a civil servant should be raised in this way.  I appointed the officer in question to the position that he now holds. It is my responsibility and that is all I have to say in regard to it.  I regard <Col N="408" /> him as the best and most suitable man for the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>A rather Gilbertian situation arose in Cork recently with the Cork Vocational Education Committee, of which I have been a member since it was set up.  There was an advertisement issued for a teacher, Irish being one of the subjects.  A lady teacher, amongst others, applied for the post.  The Chief Executive Officer had to rule out her application although she had the higher diploma of education and took out all her examinations through the medium of Irish and had taught through the medium of Irish. Yet, it was held that she was not eligible to teach Irish.  I ask any man of common sense to say whether he has ever heard of such a situation outside of bedlam.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister himself has said that, in order to teach through Irish a person must have qualifications of a high standard.  This lady, as I have said, applied amongst others for this post.  She had done all her examinations through the medium of Irish, and yet, because of some technicality or rule in the Department of which the Minister is in charge, she was ruled out because she was regarded as not being able to teach Irish although she had been teaching other subjects through the medium of Irish.  That is a peculiar situation to arise in any country.  I would like the Minister to look into it and to offer some explanation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points that I raised: (1) the question of the Gaeltacht, and (2) a separate inspectorate for the Gaeltacht.  I again ask the Minister whether he has come to any conclusion with regard to them? I do not accept at all the extravagant suggestion made by some that the policy which was being pursued in our schools regarding Irish is the same as the ruthless policy that was pursued long ago in forcing English on the country. But, even if it were, it could not be successful except the Gaeltacht is saved.  The policy by which English was forced into the schools could not have been successful in bringing English into the homes if it had not been for the English Pale and its influence in spreading the language in ordinary use throughout the country.  If the Gaeltacht is not so preserved as to be an effective spreader of the language in ordinary use throughout the country, the work of the schools will not be successful in doing so.  I again ask the Minister why cannot a separate inspectorate be established so that the Irish-speaking districts, from the point of education, will be kept under systematic review with their particular importance in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the national school inspectorate is concerned, the ordinary inspector has about 120 schools to look after.  If you think of <Col N="410" /> West Donegal, West Galway or more especially, West Kerry, you clearly will not have enough work in any one of them for a single inspector.  With present transport difficulties, I do not think the Deputy would envisage, even if there was a good case for doing it, that it would be feasible to have one man travelling from Kerry to Galway or from Galway to Donegal.  At the moment we have inspectors in the Gaeltacht areas.  We have particular inspectors dealing with the £2 scheme. There would not be, in most cases, even perhaps in Donegal and West Galway, a sufficient number of schools to give them full-time employment. As the Deputy knows, there is not very much in the way of post-primary education in those areas but, under our inspectorial system, we have a different staff of inspectors for secondary education&mdash;rather a small number of inspectors&mdash;and we have a small number of inspectors for vocational education. If we were going to do what the Deputy says, we would have to amalgamate the three branches and appoint a common staff of inspectors.  Perhaps that would be a good thing to do, but I do not know whether the Deputy had that in mind.</P>

What the Minister says seems to suggest that mere administrative convenience is being allowed to prevent a concentrated effort being made to see that the educational side of the Irish-speaking districts is looked after by inspectors whose work is completely absorbed in those districts and, therefore, completely carried out through the Irish language.  I would urge that on the Minister again.</P>

      <P>The second point I would like to put before the Minister is in relation to the extract I read from the Report of the Department of Education for the year 1941-42, regarding the speaking of Irish in the higher classes in the primary schools. What has been done with regard to that, or what can the Minister say that will reduce our concern with regard <Col N="411" /> to the position disclosed in that </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say.  I have not by me an examination of the particular extract in question.  I should say, at first sight, that the explanation is that, generally speaking, the younger teachers who are most proficient in Irish are dealing with the junior classes and very often in the schools&mdash;as admitted in the teachers' own report&mdash; there is, unfortunately, a definite declension when the children pass on to older teachers who have not the same qualifications, who have not themselves been educated through Irish and who cannot possibly compete with teachers, many of whom, as well as having better educational qualifications, are native speakers of Irish.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not understand how disconcerting it is to those of us who are really interested in the language and anxious to protect it, develop it and defend it against the charges that this work is injurious to education generally, if a report can be made of the kind which I read out this morning and the Minister does not deal with it or show a little sign to us that he has examined the situation presented by that report?  He will admit that it is a most disconcerting report.</P>

      <P>We have teachers, unfortunately, still in control of schools&mdash; and important schools&mdash;in this country who are not alone not able to teach Irish but scarcely have a word of Irish themselves.  I cannot do anything to alter that situation, until those teachers retire and their places are taken by teachers who have the qualifications.</P>

    <P>That a sum not exceeding £175,405 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1945, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, including certain services administered by that Office.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the normal functions of the Department of Industry and Commerce relate to the stimulation and supervision of industrial development, the facilitation of commercial activities and the control of the conduct of internal and external trade, together with the administration of various statutes affecting industry, commerce, transport and certain social services.  Since the outbreak of war, many of the functions of the Department have been suspended in large measure, particularly those which related to the promotion of industrial development and the encouragement of certain commercial activities.  On that account the debate on this Estimate is likely to be less contentious than it has been on occasions in the past.</P>
    <P>The main activities of the Department at the present time are concerned with various aspects of the wartime control of materials, particularly of materials used in industrial processes and later, to a lesser extent, but nevertheless to an important extent, with activities which can properly be described as post-war planning.  Some Deputies, particularly those who have not previously participated in Dáil Debates on this Department, may have difficulty in determining the line of demarcation between the functions of the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Supplies.  I can easily understand the difficulty, because there is a degree of overlapping between the activities of the <Col N="416" /> two Departments.  It was because such overlapping was unavoidable that the Taoiseach decided upon the device of having one Minister in charge of both Departments and this eliminated unnecessary inter-departmental discussions. Broadly speaking, it can be said the Department of Supplies is responsible, apart from its main function of securing supplies abroad, for the regulation of the distribution and use of consumers' goods, whereas the Department of Industry and Commerce controls the distribution and use of industrial raw materials, such things as explosives, cement, paint, metals, timber, paper and the like.</P>
    <P>Deputies may desire that I should give them an indication, which must necessarily be a brief indication, of the position concerning the more important of these industrial raw materials, the distribution of which is controlled by the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I emphasise the word distribution, because the problem of securing increased supplies of these materials where they have to come from abroad is the function of the Department of Supplies.  In the case of explosives, upon the supply of which a number of important industrial processes depend, we have been working for some time past upon approximately one-third of the quantity normally required.  There are certain export industries which receive a special allocation of explosives from the British authorities, but in the main the industries which we carry on here, the collieries, the slate quarries, the cement industry and others, which require explosives in the conduct of their operations, have been getting allocations which were rarely, if ever, more than one-third of what they would normally require.  A very high proportion of the total quantity of explosives imported in the past was used by local authorities either in connection with public works or relief schemes, or by Government Departments in a similar connection. We decided as a matter of policy that the minimum requirements of industries should be met out of the available supply, and that the curtailments should be more drastic in the case of public authorities and Government <Col N="417" /> Departments so as to ensure that the industrial processes would be carried on, even though we recognised that the curtailment of supplies of explosives to the public departments and to public authorities would necessarily restrict very considerably the ability of these bodies to undertake relief schemes which were an important source of employment, particularly in rural areas during the slack seasons in agriculture.</P>
    <P>As regards cement, we had a very loose system of control in operation until quite recently.  That system really only attempted to regulate the purchase of cement by large-scale consumers. The average individual requiring five tons or less would not need to have a permit.  In fact, the system of control was nothing more than nominal.  It had been more severe in the past during the time of the scarcity but, with the passage of the scarcity, the control was maintained, even though it was not essential.  With the cessation of cement production, to which I referred yesterday, because of fuel and other difficulties, we have, within the last few days, decided that it is necessary to tighten up very considerably the control of the purchase of cement. As announced in the Press, all existing permits for the purchase of cement have been cancelled and those persons who had permits will be required to apply again&mdash;those people who require cement for works of importance&mdash;and all cement dealers will require to be registered.  That rigid control over the purchase of cement, and the confining of the use of cement to important purposes, will have to be maintained so long as the present fuel difficulties necessitate a limitation of cement production.</P>
    <P>Deputies representing agricultural areas will be particularly interested in the position concerning the production of steel bars and rods from which horse shoe iron is provided and which is required in substantial volume for the production and repair of agricultural machinery, as well as for the manufacture of wire nails and other essential industrial goods.  The House is, I think, aware of the fact that a mill for the rolling of steel rods was <Col N="418" /> established in this country prior to the outbreak of the war, but the difficulties of procuring machinery, arising out of the war, prevented its completion, with the result that the mill was never put into the condition in which it could manufacture steel rods, utilising scrap metal.  During last year we succeeded in procuring for that mill a limited tonnage of imported steel billets which were rolled by the mill into rods and distributed for the manufacture of horse shoes, agricultural machinery and certain other essential purposes.  The supplies were very limited and, because they were limited, the price at which the steel could be made available was extraordinarily high.  This year we have been fortunate in being able to make arrangements for a larger quantity of billets than could be procured last year.  The result is that there will be a greater supply of rods for horse shoe iron, for agricultural machinery manufacturers and other industrial users, and the price has been substantially reduced.</P>
    <P>When I spoke last year I held out hopes that we would be able to procure the balance of the equipment required to put the mill in a position to use scrap metal.  These hopes have not been realised.  There is a considerable number of refractory bricks still required to complete the furnaces.  All efforts to procure the bricks in Great Britain have failed.  Efforts are now being made to procure them on the other side of the Atlantic, where there appears to be a better prospect of obtaining them, even though they may cost more.  I am still optimistic that it will be possible in the course of the year to secure delivery of the requisite bricks to complete the furnaces.  If the furnaces could be completed, then the considerable supplies of scrap steel available in the country could be utilised and, to a substantial degree, our steel problems would be met. There will be certain fuel problems still to be encountered.</P>
    <P>In respect of cast iron, we have been able to keep the foundries going up to recently.  Efforts were made to organise the collection of scrap cast iron, which were more or less successful, even though substantial difficulties <Col N="419" /> were encountered.  Quite recently we have experienced new difficulties in procuring pig iron without which the scrap cast iron cannot be utilised, and these difficulties, unless they can be resolved, may have serious consequences on foundry operations.  I cannot say what the prospects are of procuring additional supplies now available are being confined to the production of goods which are classified as essential.</P>
    <P>During the course of the year many Deputies pressed me for permits to enable constituents to purchase timber. Our position concerning timber is that no supplies have come from abroad for the last three years, and there is no prospect of securing supplies from abroad until the war is over.  The quantity of timber which we have to last us until the war is over is known; it can be estimated with some degree of accuracy, and we can decide how we are going to use it upon various assumptions.  In the year 1942 I came to the Dáil and told them of that position.  I told them that I then estimated that the war might last for two years and that I proposed to issue permits for the purchase of timber so as to spread the available supplies over a two-year period.  These two years are now over and we still have some supplies of timber left because long ago we decided that our estimate as to the duration of the war in 1942 was unduly optimistic and that these available supplies, which could not in any way be expanded, would have to be spread over a longer period.  We still have supplies of timber and permits for the purchase of timber are issued only where it is required for the construction of buildings or other works which are deemed to be of national rather than of personal importance. We, of course, arrange for the supply of timber to keep existing buildings in repair or for some industrial processes, but Deputies will have to understand why it is that a great many of the applications for permits to purchase timber have to be refused. Unlike other industrial products where there is a prospect of obtaining additional supplies or of expanding home <Col N="420" /> production, the supply of timber, either cut or standing, can be estimated with accuracy, and there is no possibility whatever of expanding it. We have to make that supply last until some time after the war is over.  There are urgent uses for timber arising from time to time and we should not allow ourselves to reach a position where necessary works could not be undertaken because we had improvidently used up the whole of our timber stocks.</P>
    <P>There is one other industrial product of major importance that I should like to refer to, and that is paper. Normally in this country we used about 65,000 tons of paper every year, and of that quantity we produced at home in paper mills situated here about 12,000 tons.  There are many Deputies who have spoken on the difficulties concerning paper in the past, and others who have commented in public on the subject who appear to have a very false conception about the pre-war relationship between paper imports and paper production.  We produced only 12,000 tons and, by various devices, some of which were the result of extraordinary ingenuity, our paper manufacturers have, despite all the difficulties&mdash;and included in the difficulties was the fact that they made paper pre-war very largely from imported materials&mdash;the home production of paper has been increased, at any rate until recently, by about 12 per cent.</P>
    <P>What effect the existing fuel problems will have upon paper production it is difficult to say but most of the larger paper mills have long since made the necessary arrangements to utilise turf instead of coal for power purposes.  Our imports of paper from abroad which, in pre-war years, totalled about 53,000 tons, are now around 10,000 tons.  In other words, they have been cut to one-fifth of what they would normally be.  That substantial contraction in the imports of paper has necessitated the making of a series of Orders designed to restrict the use of paper for various purposes, to prohibit its use for other purposes and generally to regulate the allocation of the available supplies amongst the various users of paper. <Col N="421" /> One of the most difficult problems that arose in that connection was the allocation of newsprint to the daily and weekly newspapers.  Despite the strenuous efforts which I made and which the officers of my Department have always made to endeavour to ensure that there was equitable treatment of all users of newsprint, needless to remark, because there are political considerations which arise there, we have not infrequently been accused of showing preference to one newspaper as against another.  However, we did succeed in relation to the daily newspapers in getting an agreed basis of allocation and, subject to various vicissitudes, that agreement has more or less persisted and is at present being used as the guide in determining the allocation of newsprint supplies to the newspapers.  The prospects in relation to paper are not too bright.  We were in the past able to get certain supplies of newsprint from Sweden transported to Portugal, and shipped from Portugal to this country.  There are substantial quantities of paper on order in Sweden which we had intended to bring in by the same route.  Whether it will be possible to do so or not, I cannot say. It is possible to obtain supplies still in Canada but shipping difficulties limit the amount we can take.</P>
    <P>There are other industrial raw materials which are also controlled by Orders administered by the Department of Industry and Commerce but concerning which I have no comment to make&mdash;such materials as linseed oil, asbestos cement, creosote, molasses, sacks and bags, ropes and cordages. I should say, concerning sacks and bags, that on an earlier occasion I expressed the view that one of the most acute problems of distribution which would arise here during the war would be occasioned by the scarcity of sacks, bags and other containers.  Arising out of that fear, we took a number of measures to try, not merely to preserve the existing sacks, bags and other containers, but also to secure their prompt return to the firms requiring them for the packing of goods.  I do not say that our arrangements in that regard have always worked as smoothly as we wished and <Col N="422" /> although we imposed substantial financial penalties on persons who delayed the return of sacks, bags and other containers, there is still considerable reluctance on the part of some traders and other users to meet the requirements of the Department in that regard. However, it can be said that the very acute problem which we visualised here at an earlier time has not materialised, because of the arrangements which were made in that connection.</P>
    <P>I presume it is intended, in accordance with the usual practice, that all the Votes of the Department will be discussed together, including the Vote for Unemployment Insurance and Unemployment Assistance.  In connection with the unemployment position, I should like to refer Deputies to the reports which have been published from time to time by the Inter-Departmental Committee which watches the trends of employment and unemployment.</P>
    <P>A number of years ago I considered it desirable that the maximum amount of information concerning the employment and the unemployment positions should be available to Deputies and to the public.  I, therefore, set up a committee to watch the trend in that regard and the reports of the committee have been regularly published. The most recent report, which covers the situation in 1943, is now available. The report shows that during that year the volume of unemployment continued its downward trend.  It is, of course, quite true that emigration during the past two years has been the main cause of that downward trend in the number of persons registered as unemployed. The number of persons who emigrated in 1943, was, however, considerably less than the number who emigrated in 1942.  The approximate average number of persons employed during 1943 in employments which are insurable under the Unemployment Insurance Acts was 3,000 less than in 1942.  That, I think, is a fair measure of the extent to which the emergency conditions have reduced the employment available in industrial occupations.  There was in that year a considerable increase in the employment available in agriculture <Col N="423" /> and in turf production, but the increase in employment in these occupations was more than offset by decreases in other employments.</P>

      <P>Persons insured under the Unemployment Insurance Acts. We have had a number of debates here in the past in which reference was made to the emigration which has proceeded during the past two or three years, and I think it is desirable that some information should be given to the Dáil concerning it, so that the many fantastic estimates sometimes given as to the volume of that emigration should be rectified.  Prior to 1939, the balance of passenger movements by sea, rail, road and air was always outward in every year.  More people travelled out by these various routes than came in, with, I think, the single exception of the year 1932.  During 1939 and 1940, however, the balance of passenger movements was inwards, and there was, in fact, a very substantial balance inwards, representing an addition to the population of this country. That was a natural development of the outbreak of the war, and probably represented the return here of many persons who had previously been employed in Great Britain, and, to some extent, the sending to this country of the wives and children of people employed in Great Britain.  But, in 1941, the balance was outward again, and it was outward during the year <Col N="424" /> 1942, and also during the year 1943. That outward balance last year was 39,000.  The number of people who left the country during that year exceeded the number of people who came into the country by 39,000, and that is, I think, a fair indication of what the emigration position was in that period.</P>
      <P>The number of exit permits issued to persons desiring to leave the country to take employment in Great Britain was, however, 48,000, and the difference between that figure of 48,000, representing the number of exit permits issued to persons leaving the country, and the other figure which I gave of 39,000, representing the balance of passenger movements outward, indicates probably the number of persons who had emigrated in the previous year to employment in Great Britain, but who had returned in 1943 for one reason or another.  What the position will be this year I cannot say.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware, the issue of exit permits to persons desirous of going to Great Britain has been suspended entirely since March last.  The suspension of the issue of exit permits followed on the announcement by the British authorities of the imposition of certain restrictions upon passenger movements between Great Britain and Ireland.  It was considered that we should take the precaution of suspending the issue of exit permits until that situation became clarified.</P>

    <P>The matter will have to be considered soon, because, although it is quite obvious that we have reached a situation in which there is no surplus labour in any part of the rural areas&mdash;there is, in fact, a danger of a scarcity of labour in many parts of the rural area &mdash;nevertheless, we may be imposing a hardship in individual cases by maintaining a complete ban upon travel outward.  It is, of course, a function of the Government to protect the interests of its citizens at home and abroad, and if it should be decided to resume the issue of exit permits again on any scale, it will be necessary to ensure that the arrangements in operation in Great Britain will be such as will permit the return to this country of persons permitted to leave it when <Col N="425" /> such return is necessary for any good reason, such as domestic arrangements, personal health, or inability to perform the work for which the person had been recruited.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, the employment situation tended to improve in 1943. I am referring to the employment of persons in the industrial production of transportable goods and not to the general situation which is affected by the employment of workers at turf production or agriculture.  The number of firms working short-time in December, 1943, was substantially less than the number working short-time in December, 1942.  The number of firms who had suspended workers for a period, long or short, in December, <Col N="426" /> 1943, was also substantially less than the number which had suspended workers in December, 1942.</P>
    <P>In connection with industrial employment generally, there are some observations I should like to make, because they will be of assistance to members of the Dáil in considering matters affecting post-war industrial policy to which I should like to make some reference in moving this Estimate.</P>
    <P>I move to report progress.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; the Committee to sit again to-morrow.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, June 14th.</P>
