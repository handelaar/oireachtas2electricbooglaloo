      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  In page 3, Section 4 (1), lines 42 and 43, to delete the following: &ldquo;the Children's Allowances Act, 1944 (No. 2 of 1944)&rdquo; and substitute the following: &ldquo;the Act of 1944&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>(b)  at the end of the section to insert the following two subsections:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  Sub-section (2) of this section shall not apply in the case of a <Col N="1099" /> claimant who, because he is compelled to reside outside the State by reason of the circumstances of his trade, profession or employment, is not resident in any region on any date (being the qualifying date in relation to any payment period for that region) in the year of assessment to which his claim relates.</P>
    <P>(4)  In this section&mdash;</P>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;the Act of 1944&rdquo; means the Children's Allowances Act, 1944 (No. 2 of 1944);</P>
    <P>the expressions &ldquo;qualifying date&rdquo;, &ldquo;payment period&rdquo; and &ldquo;region&rdquo; have the same meanings as in the Act of 1944.</P>
    <P>This is to prevent a hardship that would arise if certain people were obliged by their trade, profession or employment, to live outside the State, owing to the fact that they would not come within the terms of the Bill as at present drafted.  If they paid income-tax, they would suffer the reduction in the income-tax allowance and would not be entitled to get the children's allowance, so they would lose in both ways.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, Section 4 (2), line 53, to delete the words &ldquo;forty-seven&rdquo; and substitute therefor the word &ldquo;fifty&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I put this amendment down in this exact form in order to bring out more clearly, not so much the principle that is involved as the method by which the difficulty could best be overcome.  As was pointed out very clearly before, normally an income-tax payer who is in receipt of an allowance in respect of children under the income-tax code would, if he became entitled to a children's allowance, lose £1 per year for every child.  A day or two ago, I was able to send the Minister a letter from one income-tax payer, who had eleven children, ten of whom were under 16, and who stood to lose £8 a year, because the State had adopted the principle that the family should be assisted by children's allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1100" /> The Minister has met the situation in a very reasonable and generous way. After all, the arguments have been piled on top of him.  I am grateful for his attitude in the matter.  My amendment, as printed, reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In page 3, Section 4 (2), line 53, to delete the words &ldquo;forty-seven&rdquo; and substitute therefor the word &ldquo;fifty&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister would be agreeable to accept it, if I substitute &ldquo;forty-eight&rdquo; for &ldquo;fifty&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I wish to express my appreciation of the Minister's action in the matter and assure the House that, if this amendment and the one following it are accepted, no person will suffer any loss in respect of payment of children's allowances.  There are a few cases in which there may be a slight gain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the absence of Deputy McGilligan, I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 6 to insert before Section 9 a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The following shall be added to the &ldquo;Rules applicable to Schedule A&rdquo; (Schedule A, No. III) as set out in the First Schedule to the Income Tax Act, 1918, as amended by later enactments:&mdash;In computing the annual value or the profits of a mine from which minerals are extracted by underground adits, tunnels, wells, sinkings or borings the Commissioners shall make such deduction or allowance (not being less in any year than one-tenth of the entire capital outlay on such mine as is unexpired or has not been recouped out of profits at the beginning of each accounting period) as the Commissioners shall determine having regard to the expected life of the natural deposits of such minerals in such mine and the expected rate of extraction of such minerals therefrom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment asks the Minister to do here what has been done in other countries.  The Minister is familiar with the case made by representatives of the mine owners as, I think, he met them on a number of occasions during recent years.  Lest his memory may not be very clear as to the facts I shall briefly state the case for the amendment. Mining enterprise in this country has been mainly a history of failure due perhaps to lack of capital, lack of technical knowledge, the activities of foreign shareholders, want of proper equipment, etc.  During the first Great <Col N="1102" /> War there was a revival of mining here, but as soon as the conflict ended these industries were either abandoned or failed because of foreign competition. Since the outbreak of the present war, due to the difficulties of procuring supplies from outside, and prevailing high prices, a number of mining industries have been revived such as barytes, ware clay, colloidal, and talc.  However, they have achieved a degree of success which many people thought was not possible.</P>
    <P>In America and in other countries mining enterprises are treated in a special way.  In this State the Minister insists on exacting the full lb. of flesh from mining industries as well as from other industries.  In other countries it is recognised that mining industries are on a somewhat different plane to other industries and for that reason they get special concessions.</P>
    <P>In America mining enterprises are allowed to continue for ten years without paying any tax and in Germany from six to eight years.  In Canada and in other countries special concessions are given mining enterprises. Canada and the United States are two of the largest mining producing countries and there depreciation and depletion allowances have been instituted. In Canada, for instance, mining enterprises are free of tax for the first three years and in South Africa £20,000 is allowed tax free as a concession to assist small mines.  In this State the Minister has so far made no concession.  The Irish companies that want the concession now are exporting substantial quantities of their products.  Barytes produced here supply the home market to the extent of 18 per cent. and the other 82 per cent. is exported.  That applies to other companies such as Benbulbin Barytes Ltd., Irish Minerals Ltd., Cloyne Mineral Co., Ltd., the greater portion of whose products are exported.  If exports are to be continued after the war it is essential that these companies should have adequate capital with which to renew equipment and, generally, to meet the severe competition of other countries.  They cannot hope to be in a position to do that unless the Minister is prepared to <Col N="1103" /> make them some concession in the way of taxation.  They claim that they are entitled to the same concession as the American Government grants to mines there and that they should be free from taxation for ten years.</P>
    <P>This request is a most reasonable one. I am sure that it is the desire of the Minister and of the Government to provide as much employment as possible. The mining industry provides a large measure of employment and, with the assistance and co-operation of the State, by way of granting the facilities now asked for, the mining industry will be able to extend its operations and provide much more employment in future.  I understand that from a report made to the State Department at Washington it appears that British demands will be for 150,000 tons of barytes annually after the war.  If the barytes company in Sligo is encouraged by the Government it will be in a position to meet a substantial portion of that demand and, as time goes on, and when they are in a position to secure more modern equipment, it should be possible to increase the output considerably.  The same applies to companies engaged in coal mining and other enterprises with exportable surpluses. I earnestly appeal to the Minister to give special consideration to this amendment and to try to facilitate those companies.  They are carrying out an essential national service of great importance and I submit that it is the duty of the Minister to facilitate them in every possible way.  The greatest facility the Minister could extend to them at present would be to allow them to carry on free from the burden of taxation for a period of years.  Ten years is the period which is sought. That is the period which is regarded as the average life of a mine in other countries.  It is the period always used for accountancy purposes.  I ask the Minister seriously to consider this matter and to grant the mine owners the very reasonable concession they seek.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at the Deputy suggesting that a mining company should be left entirely free of tax&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that the Deputy was a reasonable man.  That has been my experience of him, generally, but the publicity agents of the company he has mentioned seem to have made a great impression upon him.  I thought that he was a little more reasonable and had more common sense.  I thought he was a person who would examine the arguments&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned what was happening in other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that the Deputy would examine a case before he would swallow it wholesale, as he has done in this instance.  Then he puts forward that case as a reasonable one.  Ten years is supposed to be the life of a particular class of mine.  The assets are supposed, at the ordinary rate of extraction, to last not more than ten years and the Deputy suggests that a mine which might yield very valuable profits to its owners should be free of tax completely for the whole period of its working.  I suggest to the Deputy that that is not a reasonable proposition.  No man in this House is more anxious to develop our mineral resources, as we know them, than I am, and I am prepared to meet in a reasonable way and to help people who are putting money into enterprises of that kind, but I am not prepared to do that in the way the Deputy suggests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is anything but reasonable in present circumstances. As the Ceann Comhairle reminded the House, it has been put in on Report Stage although it is of a fundamental character.  It would change the whole income-tax code as it has existed since the State came into existence and as it existed for many decades before that.  It is urged that such an amendment should be regarded as a reasonable amendment and should be <Col N="1105" /> considered on Report Stage.  I am really surprised at the Deputy having allowed an amendment of this kind to be fathered on him, particularly at this stage.  I cannot accept the amendment. For more than 12 months I have been seriously considering this question and I know that it is bound to have much wider reactions than the Deputy dreams of.  &ldquo;Wasting assets&rdquo; have given very great concern to many Governments and many Ministers for Finance for a long time.  &ldquo;Wasting assets&rdquo; cannot be confined to mineral resources.  In some cases &ldquo;wasting assets&rdquo; include leasehold property. If a person has a lease for a term of 50 years, his asset will disappear at the end of that time and he could argue that he should get consideration for that as a wasting asset.  If a man is engaged in the transport business and owns a few trucks, those trucks will last only about five years and could be reasonably regarded as &ldquo;wasting assets&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>So they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Where will you stop if you introduce this principle in respect of wasting assets?  The principle cannot be confined to mineral resources and it might have very serious reactions on the revenue of the State.  It is not a matter to be introduced as a sort of sideline; it is a matter which requires very serious consideration.  It is getting that consideration and it may take some time to arrive at a conclusion.  I am anxious to discover a way out but I do not see it at present.  It is not true to say that what the Deputy seeks has been allowed in other countries because one must compare like with like. We are told by interested parties that, in the U.S., Canada, Germany and France, wasting assets in respect of mineral resources get special consideration. It must be remembered that these countries have not the same system of taxation as we have.  Their system cannot be compared exactly with ours.  We are doing in other ways a considerable amount to help industries of this kind.  It is also worth noting that, so far as I am aware, out <Col N="1106" /> of the many mineral industrial concerns which have been working profitably over a long number of years here, only one has asked for any special consideration. Coal-mining companies which have been working satisfactorily for a great number of years have never asked for this concession and, surely, as much claim could be made for coal as a wasting mineral asset as for any other mineral.  The State is spending a considerable amount of money in developing our mineral resources. During the past three or four years, we formed at least two companies to develop our mineral resources, so that we are not unmindful of what should be done in that direction.  Section 8, which we are introducing, proposes to give additional benefits to owners of plant and machinery.  That may be of considerable assistance to the industry which the Deputy has in mind.  I cannot accept the amendment. I am examining the matter.  I realise that it is an important subject which will have to get a great deal of attention and I see no hope of an immediate conclusion to the examination that is being made.  It will take time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister concentrated on wasting assets in dealing with this amendment.  I agree that the examination of the question of wasting assets is very important.  Deputy Roddy made a big claim for the mining business but I do not think that the claim which he made was as sweeping as the Minister suggests.  In Great Britain, where mining conditions are not as widely different from ours as are conditions in the U.S., we have the case of the Cornish mines.  There is very definite demand there, practically amounting to pre-discussion of policy, that pre-production expenditure should be taken into consideration when dealing with mines as well as the cost of working during the earlier years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Has that request been acceded to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not been acceded to, but in that country the whole discussion of taxation in relation to industry has progressed enormously <Col N="1107" /> and, recently, very rapidly.  They realise that things are moving rapidly in the industrial world and they realise that whoever is left behind in the next year or two will be left behind for all time.  We have there the example of people with initiative, power and capital to guide us.  The question of initiative is, owing to our lack of capital and lack of experience, more important to us than it is to them.  Men who are prepared to plunge into industrial and mining enterprise ought to be encouraged as much as possible to let their initiative go in the new circumstances and to realise that there will be a modern approach to the question of taxation on industry.  The Minister indicated that there are many implications in amendments of this kind. We all agree as to that.  He also indicated that the difficulties were so many that it was not likely that any urgent decision would be taken.  In these matters we should prepare ourselves for development in the future, and the people on whom we will have to depend to take the initiative and to bear the expense in carrying out the work of development ought to be assisted at the earliest possible moment; they should be informed what the nature of the taxation on industry is likely to be.  It is most desirable that the Minister should get these discussions brought to a head and there should be the closest consultation with industrial organisations or individuals who are prepared to undertake ventures of various kinds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think everyone will agree that where mining operations are concerned there is usually a very considerable amount of expense in connection with pre-development work.  Those who may be anxious to develop the mines do not know exactly how things are likely to go.  In that connection, it is very desirable that they would be informed as to the nature of the taxation they may have to bear, and consideration will also have to be given to the important factor of wasting assets.  The same applies to the industrial side.  I am sure the Minister is considering these things, but I would like to urge <Col N="1108" /> upon him that time is an important factor.</P>
    <P>The Minister complains about this matter being raised now.  I should like to point out that the last three or four months have not been quite normal.  I think he will admit that the Finance Bill is being put rather quickly through the Parliament.  Perhaps the Minister has this to say for himself, that industrial bodies and manufacturers generally ought to be more alive in putting up their case, and putting it up in time but I think the Minister has a certain amount of responsibility for encouraging commercial and industrial bodies to take time by the forelock by inviting their representations rather than damping their enthusiasm by making them feel that they are raising problems that are too big for consideration.</P>
    <P>I simply support the general line that has been taken.  I feel we should be grateful to Deputy Roddy for raising the matter.  The Minister has told us he has been considering this question. Perhaps we could get him to agree that it is a matter of urgency and, as part of that urgency, if people outside, organised bodies or individuals, would begin to worry him a little more, then that would be all to the good, and in that way we might speed up decisions. Early decisions are very vital.</P>

      <P>I am anxious to get some information.  I observe that the Minister for Finance detects a difference between modern mine owners and the old-fashioned ones.  He is apparently beginning to wake up to the fact that there is a slight distinction between the old-fashioned industrialist, who believed it was his duty to earn a profit competitively and if he did not earn a profit the proper thing was to get out of the business and so make way for somebody who could, and the modern type.  He has not realised that the Fianna Fáil Government have begotten a new type of industrialist who, if he cannot make a profit, wants to raise the tariff to 25 per cent., and who, if that does not secure a profit, wants a quota.  If the quota is not sufficient to bring in the profit, the next thing that industrialist wants is exemption from <Col N="1109" /> income-tax and, should that not suffice, he desires a subsidy.  We all remember the Roscrea factory.  That type of industrialist wanted all his supplies free, wanted to be exempt from all taxes and to be paid substantial compensation if the Government did not continue to give all the supplies for nothing.  I am glad the Minister has awakened to the fact that there are two types of industrialist in this country, but I hope he will be conscious of his own responsibility for begetting the particular type to which I have referred.</P>
      <P>When we come to consider the question of exempting mines from taxation, I begin to wonder where that principle is to end.  I suppose a mine is a wasting asset, but I see other companies which have to undertake considerable preliminary expense and I observe that their entire profits are being swept away by excess profits tax and special war burdens, and though they are paying to the Government in taxes as much as three times what they are distributing in dividends, they are constrained to carry in their balance sheets substantial sums on the assets side for preliminary expenses. There is a case of hardship if ever there was one.  One would imagine that, before being mulcted in excess profits tax or corporation profits tax, they would be allowed to wipe off these preliminary expenses which they carry as fictitious assets.  Unless we are prepared to review the whole ground, these are some of the burdens which everyone may be called upon to share.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I hear gentlemen who are paying themselves 6 per cent. per annum, and sometimes more, coming here and claiming very substantial concessions by way of taxation because they have done this pious duty of launching out in a mining or industrial enterprise, I am entitled to ask, what induced them to embark on this enterprise?  Was it love of Cáitlín Ní Houlihán, or through a desire to increase their own incomes? Is there any Deputy so completely idiotic as to imagine that any gentlemen would embark on that type of enterprise without anticipating substantial profits for themselves?  And, more power to them, I say&mdash;the more <Col N="1110" /> profits they can earn, the better pleased I would be.  But that they should come to the House and ask that, in order to enable them to make substantial profits, the Exchequer should give a substantial grant by way of exemption from tax&mdash;there I would draw the line.</P>
    <P>However, if they can get away with that type of plunder, there is no reason why I should not come in some day and say that my pub is not paying quite a sufficient dividend and propose that I should get a new porter pump and new glasses.  Deputies will realise that public houses make a very substantial contribution to the social amenities of rural Ireland.  Just as in the case of the industrial concerns that have been referred to, I could claim that the pub also has its wasting assets and there is no reason why the pub should not also be favourably considered. There is no reason why the Government should not facilitate the owners of such premises in order to enable them to carry on their special trades throughout the country.  But if we come forward with this demand we shall be told: &ldquo;If your business is not paying, why do you not get out of it?&rdquo;  I am rather inclined to ask persons who make similar requests, if their business is uneconomic, if it cannot bear the same burden of taxation that everybody else is bearing, why did they embark upon it?  I venture to prophesy that if no such concession is ever made as is outlined in Deputy Roddy's amendment, that business will not close down.  So long as it is paying 6 per cent. or 10 per cent. per annum on the invested capital it will be carried on.</P>
    <P>I do suggest to the Minister for Finance, now that he has discovered that there are two types of industrialist in this country, the old-fashioned type who believes that the justification for his existence was that he was able to earn a profit and bear his fair and equal share of the burden of taxation, and the new type who believes that, in order to get a profit, he is entitled to be exempted from tax, he is entitled to be granted a general licence to plunder his neighbour, behind a tariff or quota &mdash;now that he has recognised these two <Col N="1111" /> types, he will learn to appreciate a little more the kind of industrialist that grew up in this country by their unaided efforts under free trade and be a little more wary of the exotic variety we have brought up in the glasshouse of protection during the last ten years. I am afraid that my friend Deputy Roddy will feel that I have spoken inimically to his amendment and I do not suppose there is much use in trying to disguise the fact that I have, but I can assure him that it is not because he sponsored it; it is because of the general reluctance which I feel for subscribing to the very popular fraud that the modern tariff-protected industrialist is in the business for love of Cáitlín Ní Houlihán, when I know he is in it for the profit he can and does get out of it.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister to consider that, notwithstanding what Deputy Dillon has said, it requires a certain amount of courage to invest money in mining enterprises considering the history of disastrous failure in this business.  Other countries make special concessions to mining enterprise and must recognise that here is a certain amount of hazard attached to the mining industry.  The Minister spoke about wasting assets.  I would remind the Minister that in Canada and the United States, two of the largest mineral-producing countries in the world, they have instituted depreciation and depletion allowances to mining companies.  Canada has further exempted from tax for the first three years all metalliferous mines which came into production since the 1st May, 1936.  This application, I think, has special reference to three companies&mdash;Benbulbin Barytes, Limited, Sligo; Irish Minerals, Limited, and Cloyne Mineral Company, Limited, all of whom engage in exporting products to other countries.  If these people have made a case for relief it is because of the fact that there are special considerations and special difficulties connected with the mining industry which are not common to other industries.  For instance, in Benbulbin Barytes mine in Sligo, at the end of last year they discovered that owing to a bog on top of the mountain over the mine, the water was leaking through with the result that the mine fissures became dangerous and they had to spend a considerable amount of capital in building an adit and making the mine safe.  These difficulties arise in other mining enterprises, difficulties which cannot be foreseen and which are not common to other types of industries. For these reasons, I ask the Minister to give the matter special consideration. Apparently, the Minister is not in a hurry with the matter, but I would remind him that the war might not last as long as he anticipates, and when the war is over these companies will be subject to the same type of foreign competition as the companies which were started during the last Great War were subjected to and it <Col N="1113" /> may be that if he delays too long over the matter they may be wiped out of existence altogether and then there will be an end for another period to mining efforts.  I do think that a very strong case can be made for special consideration for mining enterprises in this country and I hope the Minister will not delay too long over the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not delay any longer than is absolutely necessary to make the thorough investigation that has to be made because, as I said earlier, and I do not want to go over it again, it is a big, wide subject.  I do admit that certain mining enterprises probably are risky things for capitalists to put their money into but capitalists in these cases are usually people who are not fools.  If they have money to invest it means that they have probably made that money pretty hard.</P>

      <P>These people usually work hard to earn whatever money they have and if they do put it into a thing like a mining enterprise they consider the problem in all its aspects before they do so, as a rule. In the particular case that Deputy Roddy has in mind, I do know that there are, at any rate, some men&mdash;I do not think they are very wealthy men&mdash; who have put considerable sums of money into this particular industry and, despite what Deputy Dillon said, I do believe a lot of it is due to love for Cáitlín Ní Houlihán.  Cynic as I have often been in regard to certain people and certain enterprises, cynic as Deputy Dillon usually is with regard to all industrial enterprises, I believe in this case there are men who have put their hands in their pockets to develop an industry because they wanted to show that industrial and particularly mining development in Ireland can be made a success.</P>

There was here for very many years an opinion that no industrial enterprise could succeed in Ireland.</P>

      <P>Before the State was established here I saw many enterprises floated by moderately poor men who thought it was a good thing.  They listened to the preachings of those who were, at any rate, associated with the old Sinn Féin movement and they put money in Irish enterprise and many of the enterprises failed and they lost their money.  It was a considerable sum to these individuals.</P>
      <P>I remember seeing a cartoon in the old <i>Leprechaun</i> of Irish insurance companies that were started in this country over a period of years.  They are not industries but commercial enterprises.  That cartoon represented a graveyard with the names of all these Irish insurance companies on the tombstones.  There were, I think, at least 30 or 40 of them and the Irish people put sums of money into them, big or small sums of money, and they all went down.  It was not until very recent years that Irish insurance business was made a success in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one example.  It is not an industry, but a commercial enterprise.  The same thing applies to industry.  It was only within the last 20 years that we got <Col N="1115" /> in this country a real opportunity to give to industrial enterprise the help that was necessary to enable it to overcome the competition of subsidised industry the world over which was competing with our people inside their own shores.  That was necessary to enable industries to live during their formative years.  I am prepared to stand over and defend that.  I am prepared to defend giving special consideration to mineral development.  We have done that, and I am prepared to continue to do that as Minister and to ask the Dáil to continue to provide the money for that, as we are doing day by day.  We have done it this session.  We have given additional money for mining enterprise in this country to the companies that the State set up.</P>
      <P>What Deputy Roddy asks in this amendment raises a similar problem but in a very extended and large way. It would mean making a very big change in the whole code.  This question of wasting assets cannot be considered in relation to barytes mining alone.  To get any satisfactory solution of the question of wasting assets will take some time.  I am not going to ask the staff to waste time on the matter, but I am asking them to give it as thorough an investigation as they can and report to me, and they are doing it and they will do it.  But, considering the other heavy work they have to do day by day, it is not easy to get an expert and senior staff to give time to a problem of that kind.  They have made inquiries and are making other inquiries as to what the position is in the countries which Deputy Roddy suggested and other countries to see what is being done and, if there is any help or advice or information that we can get, we will turn it to advantage.  Speaking on behalf of the Government, I say that we are out to develop Irish resources, mineral and otherwise.  If we can help them by quotas or tariffs or in any other way we think necessary to meet the competition they have to meet, we will get the Dáil to give them that help in order to encourage people to put more money into the development of the industries of the country.</P>

      <P>In page 8, Section 13 (1) to insert before paragraph (f) the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(f)  where, in the case of a company which had one or more trade years, a person, who is a director required to devote substantially the whole of his time to the service of the company in a managerial or technical capacity, was not a director during the trade year, by reference to which the total deduction under paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) of this sub-section is computed, but was during that trade year employed by the company, then, notwithstanding anything contained in this sub-section, the Revenue Commissioners, if they so think fit, may increase the total deduction by such amount (not exceeding the remuneration paid to that person for the said trade year) as they think proper;</P>
      <P>This is introduced as a result of a promise I gave to Deputy Costello. Deputy M.E. Dockrell was also interested in the same matter and had an amendment down on similar lines to that of Deputy Costello last week.  This relates to director-controlled companies and to an employee who becomes a director, and is designed to enable certain difficulties that were raised in the amendments last week to be overcome.

      <P>In page 8, after line 45, Section 13 (1), to add a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(g)  where the assessable profits of a company are different as the result of the application of this sub-section from the profits assessable before this Act came into force, the profits arising in an accounting <Col N="1117" /> period which ended after December 31st, 1943, shall be apportioned between that part of the accounting period which was prior to December 31st, 1943, and the part which was subsequent to that date.</P>
    <P>With regard to the general matter, I do not think the Minister really realises how unfair the provisions of the Bill at present are, and it is because I think he has always taken up the attitude that he wants to be fair as between individuals and firms that I am encouraged to come back again to this particular matter in the way I do in these amendments.  The Minister says the 31st December, 1943, is the most convenient date for the application of this change in taxation and I agree that perhaps he is the best judge of that.  But, even then, there is a certain amount of retrospective taxation in it.  Even accepting this date, as I do, I want again to raise the question that the effect of the provision here ought to apply equally to various classes of people and various classes of firms.  It creates a rather impossible position for persons who make a certain distribution of income at a particular time of the year and then find, as a result of action here on the part of the Legislature, that they are to incur in respect of that period expenditure that they did not expect to incur.  However, there is a certain amount of retrospective taxation in this and let us agree that it is the best thing we can do about it.  The Minister's provisions propose to deal with people who have been evading taxation.  It will also affect people who have been acting quite genuinely and in a <i>bona fide</i> way.  Let us take these people who have been evading taxation.  My proposal here would have this effect that, at any rate, people who are evading taxation would be dealt with equally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Minister a case.  In connection with my first amendment, take the case of three persons who joined in the formation of a company in which the three of them were directors and they gave <Col N="1118" /> full service to the company in the trade year which ended before 31st August, 1939.  Therefore, they come under the provisions of Section 13 (c).  Let us say that the capital is £14,000, equally divided in ownership between the directors, and that the company made up its last accounts on the 31st January, 1944.  Its profits, before providing for remuneration for any of the directors, let us say, were £5,000. Each director was paid £1,000 for his general services.  Under the existing law, that £3,000 would be allowed as a charge, leaving a balance of £2,000. As that is less than the exemption limit of £2,500, the company would not pay excess corporation profits tax. But, if the Finance Bill passes in its present form, only £420 of the £3,000 paid to the directors will be allowed for.  That will leave a balance of £4,580, from which £2,500 will be deducted, and the company will then have to pay excess corporation profits tax on £2,080 for the whole of the accounting period ending 31st January, 1944.  That means that that company will now, under this Finance Bill, if passed, have to pay £1,040 that it did not expect to have to pay.  As I say, it made up its accounts to the 31st January, 1944.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another company, also formed by three persons with the same capital divided in the same way amongst the directors and paying the same directors' fees, which had no trade year before August, 1939, but had the good luck to make up its accounts for the year on 31st December, 1943, will not have to pay any excess corporation profits tax this year.  That is as far as this year is concerned.  My amendment suggests that the date, 31st December, 1943, should be taken as the date which would become operative for the actual beginning of the tax. In these circumstances, the company which made up its accounts to the 31st December, 1943, would not be affected in respect of the period back to that, but during the current year it would be; and the company that had made up its accounts to the 31st January, 1944, instead of being stuck for £1,040, which its friend and rival company, which ended up its accounts a month <Col N="1119" /> earlier, had to pay, would pay simply one-twelfth of the amount.  In other words, it would pay in respect of January, 1944; but both companies would begin to feel the incidence of this new piece of taxation from the 1st January, 1944.</P>
    <P>Now, let us say that these are two firms that are trying to evade taxes. Why should one escape that taxation because it makes up its accounts on a particular date, and the other firm have to pay £1,040, because it was so unlucky as to make up its accounts a month later?  Again, suppose that they are both honest and <i>bona fide</i> firms, trying to carry on their business as best they can: one of them will be stuck in the same way as I have described; it has already distributed the assets of the firm in a way that seemed good to it, or it might have put some money aside for further development.  Here, however, you have, in the case of two firms that are perfectly <i>bona fide</i>, one being stuck for a tax amounting to £1,040, while the other escapes that tax, merely because of a difference in the accounting period.  That is the point that I really want to press on the Minister in regard to the first amendment: that it is inequitable and unjust as between two pairs of thieves on the one hand and two pairs of honest men on the other hand.  I do not know really whether people in business ought to have been given notification that this thing was being given effect to, earlier than its publication through the medium of the Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>Well, then, I am sure that the Minister must have received a number of comments or recommendations in connection with the <Col N="1120" /> matter.  Again, however, as Deputy Costello pointed out the other day, in connection with the Budget, people are so bewildered by taxation at the present time that they do not realise what is happening, but I think that, in Parliament, we here should realise that it is inequitable and unjust, as between two firms, that one has to pay £1,040, which payment it would have escaped if it had been lucky enough to make up its accounts earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can say that both as a Minister and as an individual I do not wish to be unjust to individuals or companies, but here we are dealing with people who definitely did set out to evade the payment of taxes.  Deputy Mulcahy described them as honest men.  Perhaps they are, even though they got away, to use a vulgar phrase, with cutting the revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are out to do is to try to defeat devices taken by certain companies or firms in order to evade liability for excess corporation profits tax.  Of course, if we take the whole range of companies that are liable to excess corporation profits tax, it would be only a small proportion of these companies that have evaded payment, or have attempted to evade payment of the tax, but there definitely is a number of companies&mdash;even a considerable number&mdash;that have set themselves out to evade the payment of this taxation and that have got away with it.  We could not be just to all these companies, in the way Deputy Mulcahy desires, by fixing a certain date now, because some of these companies started to evade the tax, one might say, on the very first day it was imposed, while others took time to consider how they would get around it. They all started, on different dates, to evade the tax; but we are letting them get away with what might be described &mdash;I do not know if I am right in the description&mdash;as ill-gotten gains.  They were legally entitled to evade the tax. There is nothing new in that; it is done every day in the year, but it is the duty of the Minister for Finance and his advisers to try to find methods of stopping these evasions.  Every year, or practically every year, in connection <Col N="1121" /> with the Finance Bill, we have to bring in amendments of the law in order to meet the inventiveness and ingenuity of people who discover means of getting through or around the law, and to impose on them certain obligations with regard to taxation. Here, we are dealing definitely with evasions, and I say quite seriously to Deputy Mulcahy and every Deputy in the House that I see no way of being equitable or just, as between man and man, or company and company, and the State, except the one way of going back and making the tax retrospective, or this amendment retrospective until 1st January, 1941.  If we do that, it means that they are all on the same basis and that we will get back from them all the moneys that some of these firms have pocketed as a result of being able to evade the payment of these taxes.</P>

      <P>Oh, yes, they will find the money all right.  They will find it if we amend the law, but I see no other way of being just or equitable. What the Deputy suggests would allow some of them to get away with considerable sums of money. Others, I admit, as the Deputy suggests, would be stuck and have to pay £1,000, or whatever the sum may be&mdash; in some cases it might be a considerably larger sum.  The Deputy desires to be just and equitable, but his suggestion would not mean equity between the different companies.  Some of these companies got away with considerable sums of money because they started in time, and some may even get away with further sums of money, but the Deputy's suggestion would not mean equity as between the various companies that have evaded the payment of taxation under this arrangement.</P>

      <P>Well, take the case of a company that makes up its accounts on the 31st December, and which, let us say, on the 1st February, 1943, forms a subsidiary company in a legitimate and honest way of doing business.  Then, in order to have an accounting period for the old company and the subsidiary company, they have to make up their minds whether to close their accounts for both companies on the 31st December, 1943; in which circumstances the old company would make up its accounts for 12 months, and the subsidiary company would make up its accounts for 11 months, or else make up their minds to close their accounts on 31st January, 1944, in which case the old company would make up its accounts for 13 months, and the subsidiary company would make up its accounts for 12 months.  If they are lucky enough to make up their accounts for 31st December, 1943, then they may escape the Minister's new taxation, whereas, if they are unfortunate enough to say that they will make the 31st January the end of their accounting period, then they get caught for the whole of their accounting period.  There may be various methods of dealing <Col N="1123" /> with criminals but this is a kind of method we find it difficult to understand. However, if the Minister says that it is similar to the last case and that he is going to adopt a similar line of action in regard to both cases, I shall withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I think the same remarks would apply to this amendment as to the last.  A surprising number of these subsidiary companies have been started.  To my own personal knowledge in some cases, people I know personally&mdash;deliberately I would say, judging by the facts as I have seen them&mdash;started subsidiary companies and divided their own business into separate companies with a nominal capital for the purpose of getting the benefits of the £2,500 minimum standard and evading the payment of tax.  They are not, it is true, a great number in proportion to all the companies that exist in the country but a considerable number have been started by people from whom one would expect better.  Deputy Mulcahy knows some of them and I know some of them and really one would expect better from them.  They have done that deliberately to evade the payment of tax and we cannot let them get away with it.</P>

We are entirely with him, and desire to give him every assistance to find out and prevent the evasion of the law by companies of various kinds but we think that failure to apportion the tax over the various periods in this matter seems to introduce a principle that is contrary to the principles that have been operating in the past.  Retrospective legislation of any kind is bad but when it is retrospective legislation that will hit one company over a period of six months and another up to 18 months it makes <Col N="1124" /> the situation even worse.

      <P>Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a company (in this section referred to as the new company) applies in writing to the Revenue Commissioners to make an apportionment under this section, and</P>
      <P>(b)  the new company satisfies the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i)  that it was incorporated after the 31st day of August, 1939, to carry on a trade or business similar in character to, but <Col N="1125" /> smaller in scale than, the trade or business of a company (in this section referred to as the old company) which has been dissolved and which had one or more trade years, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  that it does so carry on such trade or business, and</P>
    <P>(iii)  that more than 50 per cent. of the ordinary issued capital of the new company is held by persons who held in the aggregate more than 50 per cent. of the ordinary issued capital of the old company, and</P>
    <P>(iv)  that a substantial part of the organisation of the old company has been taken over by the new company, and</P>
    <P>(v)  that the new company was incorporated not later than one month after the dissolution of the old company, and</P>
    <P>(c)  the new company furnishes to the Revenue Commissioners such accounts, particulars and information as the Revenue Commissioners require for the purposes of the application.</P>
    <P>the following provisions shall have effect&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  the Revenue Commissioners shall apportion to the new company an amount equal to so much of the profits of the old company for the trade year by reference to the profits of which the standard profits of the old company would have been computed if it had not been dissolved as the Revenue Commissioners consider appropriate to the trade or business carried on by the new company, and</P>
    <P>(2)  the amount so apportioned to the new company shall, if the new company so desires, be the standard profits of the new company in respect of every accounting period ending after the 1st day of January, 1941.</P>
    <P>I indicated my intention on the Committee Stage to introduce a new section of this kind.  It has been brought to my notice that a company <Col N="1126" /> which was carrying on a prosperous business before the war might find it impossible to carry on on the old scale as a result of the war.  A new business was then started which was in fact a continuance of the old business, but on a very different scale.  For legal reasons the older business had to be formally discontinued and great difficulty was found in bringing the standard of the older company into consideration after the new company was established.  It is to get over that difficulty that this amendment is introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I draw the Minister's attention to this point?  We are all agreed that excess profits duty can be a very heavy burden on a business recently established.  We are all agreed, too, that everybody has to accept very heavy burdens in these times and there is no serious objection to them provided they are equitably distributed.  Has the Minister's attention been directed to the case of companies started in the years before the war which really got no opportunity to earn profits and did not expect to earn profits in these years?  They were doing the preliminary work that every commercial enterprise must do and, for no patriotic or other motive other than for ordinary sound business principles, they were undertaking expenses in excess of their profits in anticipation of making substantial profits when they were under way.  Now these firms have no standards practically at all though they have substantial capital. They have in many cases pursued the perfectly legitimate accountancy procedure of bringing preliminary expenses into their balance sheet as an asset.  Anyone, however, who knows how to read a balance sheet realises that the retention of such an item in a balance sheet over a protracted period is very unsound business because it is a fictitious asset.  Yet certain of these companies, owing to <Col N="1127" /> the fact that they are limited to £2,500 as a standard before excess profits duty is levied upon them, are constrained to pay over almost their entire profits to the Government and they have no funds wherewith to write off this purely fictitious asset in the balance sheet.  Surely some consideration should be given to a business enterprise so circumstanced.</P>
      <P>I fully recognise that when the general principle was being established of a standard over and above which excess profits tax would be levied, it was extremely difficult in anticipation to legislate for the exceptional case.  Even to-day if there was only one firm concerned, I would agree that that was one of those distressing sets of circumstances in which the impossibility to legislate for the peculiar case was working a hardship, but that it was one of those hardships which it was very difficult to avoid.  Now there does appear to emerge a category of firms who are so circumstanced.  I suggest to the Minister that he should look into the question and see whether some concession could not be made on the lines that where a firm was in a position to satisfy the Revenue Commissioners that the item appearing in their balance sheet as preliminary expenses was not inflated and was a proper figure, the Exchequer would be prepared to make some concession towards the creation of a fund for the extinction of that item before the profits of the company were assessed for the collection of excess profits duty.</P>

      <P>I do not think the position of any of these companies is exactly as the Deputy suggests, because the circumstances in relation to a new company of the type the Deputy has in mind, a company which had not a standard before the war, were considered.  Under pressure in this House, I agreed to allow such companies to have a substituted standard of 10½ per cent. on the subscribed capital.  That is a very generous standard. I should be glad to examine any case of hardship which the Deputy may have come across or which was brought to his attention, but if he will look into <Col N="1128" /> the matter and examine it in the light of this 10½ per cent. on the subscribed capital as a substituted standard, I think he will agree with me when I say that I doubt if there is any of these companies which has a grievance.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides for the continuance in force, for a further period of 12 <Col N="1129" /> months, of the Emergency Powers Act which in the ordinary course of events is due to lapse on 2nd September next.  The emergency conditions which gave rise to the passing of this legislation still exist and it is essential that the special powers which have been vested in the Government should continue to be exercisable for the present. Under Section 2, the Oireachtas or the Government may terminate the currency of this legislation before the expiration of the full period of 12 months for which it is proposed to renew it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>When this Bill was introduced in 1939, there was a widespread recognition by all Parties that the Government should have ample powers to deal with the emergency situation and that it should not be handicapped by any legislative impediments in the speedy and efficient exercise of these powers.  One can quite understand, therefore, the circumstances under which these powers were given to the Government and can readily realise the necessity for them. So far as the general principles of the Bill were concerned, they were supported by all Parties.  We learned with great amazement and profound regret, however, that the Government had utilised these powers for a purpose entirely different from that which we believe was intended in the first instance.  We have seen this legislation used for a purpose entirely different from the purpose of national defence, entirely at variance with the objective of national unity and in fact, perverted, for the purpose of regulating, or purporting to regulate, the wage standards of workers, which, on the basis of the manner in which it was done, was another way of saying, for the purpose of depressing the standard of living of the workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government apparently felt it was entitled under the Emergency Powers Act to introduce Emergency Powers Orders for the purpose of keeping down the wages of the workers, on the one hand, while on the other hand, the Government has been conspicuously incapable of controlling prices.  The figures produced by the Department of Industry and Commerce show that, <Col N="1130" /> since 1939, the cost of living has increased by over 70 per cent. while in the same period wages have risen on an average by not more than 15 per cent., so that the gap between the substantial increase in the cost of living and the fragmentary increase in wages secured by workers over the same period represents a very substantial debasement of the standard of living of the workers.  I do not believe that the Bill was intended to be used in that way.  I do not believe that the legislature, when it gave the Government powers to deal with matters arising out of the emergency and the world war situation, intended that these powers should be utilised to peg down wages at an inordinately low level, while, at the same time, the prices of commodities were permitted to rise apparently unchecked.  If the Government had not misused these powers in that way, I should see no reason for any murmur of opposition to this Bill, but the fact that the Government have utilised them in this way makes it impossible for us to give to the Bill the wholehearted support which, in other circumstances, we should be only too glad to give.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Norton that the House unanimously agreed to give these powers to the Government, at a time when they appreciated that during a period of emergency the Government required to have extraordinary powers to deal with the rapidly changing circumstances which were bound to arise. Realising that they might be hampered by having to convene Parliament suddenly to deal with circumstances of the sort, the House very reasonably agreed to these provisions, trusting that they would not be abused.  I agree also with Deputy Norton that they have been very much abused in a rather extraordinary way and in a variety of aspects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention of the House to the way in which reputable traders have been dealt with and to the line of approach in dealing with people who have transgressed Emergency Powers Orders in relation to supply and distribution.  One appreciates the necessity of having Orders <Col N="1131" /> of that sort where goods are in short supply and prices have to be controlled, but one would expect that in the case of abuses&mdash;very often of a technical nature&mdash;when people have been brought into court and fined for overcharging, which sometimes may be due to a clerical error, a matter of accountancy, the matter, so far as the particular offence is concerned, would be finished.  But it goes further generally; the Minister for Supplies sits in judgment again, and he decides whether or not that particular licence should be revoked.  I think that is an instance of abuse in the administration of the emergency powers freely given in this House to the Government.  I think no Minister ought to put himself in the position of a judge.  I think that, once a citizen is tried in the courts of this country, that ought to be the end of his offence; the judge in the court ought to be the final arbiter so far as the administration of justice is concerned.  That is not the case in the administration of those emergency Orders, and the unfortunate trader very often gets a notice that his licence is to be withdrawn, which in effect means that he will be put out of business.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the House should be very critical of that aspect of the administration of the Orders.  The Minister ought not to arrogate to himself powers of that sort.  He leaves himself open to the suggestion&mdash;I am not suggesting it&mdash;that in his determination as to whether in fact a licence should be withdrawn or revoked he is acting in a partisan spirit.  It is not his function in any case, as a Minister, to administer justice, and, if the question of the revocation of a licence has to be considered, it ought to be put into the decree of the justice who deals with the matter.  At all events, the revocation should result from a recommendation made by the justice, and if the justice does not recommend a revocation of the licence I feel that the Minister ought not to revoke it.  It is grossly unfair to traders to do so, where only technical offences have been committed.</P>
    <P>I want to make it perfectly clear, so <Col N="1132" /> far as this Party is concerned, that we want to be helpful, and are all against anybody who is making use of the present situation to indulge in black market activity or racketeering of any sort.  We do not want to plead any extenuating circumstances in cases of that kind, but there is a number of instances where hardship has definitely occurred, and we feel that the Minister ought not to have acted in the manner in which he did act.  Those are matters for the jurisdiction of the court and not for the Minister.  The administration of the law in that way will eventually bring the law into contempt, and that is a very serious matter. Again, under emergency Orders, a number of prices have been fixed which affect primary producers in this country, and no opportunity has been afforded to those people to express their views before the Orders operate. I think there are abuses in the use of the powers given to the Government in that respect also.  In matters of this sort, the people who are primarily concerned ought to be consulted before the Orders operate.  Again, with the huge number of Orders that are machined out, an Order may sometimes go into operation a couple of months before it is printed and circulated, and it is difficult for people in business properly to understand and appreciate how they may be affected by it.  I may say too that, in the operation of the censorship, there are great grounds for complaint.  I suppose the House must agree to the continuance of those powers, but it is right and proper that we should express our protest against the manner in which they have been operated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe the Taoiseach or any other member of this House welcomed the Emergency Powers Bill, because, except in times of gravest crisis, such a departure as the powers conferred by that Bill would be greatly to be deplored in any democratic country, but the House, in view of the acute emergency created by the war, gave those powers to the Government.  I am not going to travel over the same ground as Deputy Hughes and Deputy Norton about the general administration of the powers, <Col N="1133" /> but I want to make some special comments. I do not think the powers conferred by this Bill have been properly used.  I think they have been used much too generally, and as a kind of short cut for many Ministers who were too lazy to bring their business into the Dáil.  Now, the number of Orders that have been issued is legion.  Some two years ago, I think, the Taoiseach undertook to proceed with their indexing and publication in a handy and accessible form.  It is only right to say that, in expressing the hope that he might be able to do so, he admitted that he foresaw difficulties which he knew might prove insurmountable.  I should be glad if he could tell us to-day whether he has investigated the possibilities of doing that, and what success has attended the efforts.  I think if we could introduce a slight variation into the present procedure connected with Orders made under this Bill, a good many of its objectionable features could be eliminated, and I should be glad to know if the Taoiseach would consider this proposal. If we could set up a special committee of this House, analogous to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, to meet in private as that Committee meets, and require Ministers at special intervals to appear before it with the Orders they had made in the intervening period since their last appearance, and justify them before that committee, giving that committee no greater power than the right to direct the Minister to submit to the Dáil any Order about which they disagreed with him, I believe a great deal of the objection to this whole system would be abandoned, and I believe that in practice we might work out a system of legislation which might be very advantageously used even in normal times.  The truth is that, with the development of social services and with the generally bureaucratic development of democratic government all over the world, it is not possible for any Parliament adequately to do, in full session, the detailed work that has now devolved upon all democratic Parliaments.  Whether we like it or not, in the post-war world, if democratic Parliaments are not to be crushed by the burden of detailed <Col N="1134" /> work, some system of enabling legislation to be made by Order will have to be worked out.  I suggest that the scheme which I am submitting to the House now may contain the germ of a permanent arrangement which would provide expeditious machinery for legislating by Order combined with the safeguard of enabling the elected representatives of the country to secure that any contentious legislation of that kind would be brought on the floor of the House for detailed review by Parliament in plenary session.</P>

    <P>The next point that I want to make is this.  We have laid on the Table of the House to-day &ldquo;Emergency Powers Order No. 260, 1943 (Seventh Amendment), 1944.&rdquo;  That means that anyone who wants to know what the law is in regard to that particular detail must collect the original Order, and the seven amending Orders.  He must, first of all, get a large sheet of paper in front of him and write out the substance of the first Order; he must then amend that in the sense of the first amending Order; he then must amend the amended form in the second amending Order which must be written out again, or at least part of it, and he must continue that process with every amending Order until he ultimately arrives at the present state of the law.  Now, of course, if you have a large Department of State, with an unlimited number of civil servants at your disposal, that operation is comparatively easy because they can maintain files in which these amendments in the draft Order are made and kept on record as each amendment issues. Therefore, when you want to know what the law is on some particular matter, you simply open the appropriate file and find on the top of it the most recent draft.  But, to the average lawyer practising in the Four Courts, never mind the average harassed grocer operating in a rural town, to ascertain what the present state of the law is, is virtually impossible.  It does not seem reasonable that, every time you want to know what your obligations are in connection with the sale of a stone of flour, you should have to pay two guineas to a solicitor and counsel to ascertain what the meaning <Col N="1135" /> of the most recent regulation controlling the price of flour is.  I, therefore, suggest to the Taoiseach that he should insist, where an Emergency Powers Order has been amended, that instead of producing an amending Order the original Order should be repealed, and the new Order should contain the law as the Government intended to amend it <i>in toto.</i>  I do not know what fascination this process of amendment has for bureaucrats because, so far as I know, it is just as easy to re-enact the whole Order as it is to prepare an amendment.  I suggest to the Taoiseach that it is far easier. We have all seen cases arising in which the Government have purported to make an amending Order but, through some extraordinary oversight, the amendment has been found by the courts to apply to perhaps 99/100ths of the total area affected by the original Order, while one microscopic section escaped the effect of the amending Order.  If the original Order were remade, with whatever amendment the Government had in mind, no question could arise of that happening in the future, and it would greatly simplify things for everyone.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes has mentioned the operation of the censorship in connection with these orders.  I specifically disclaim any intention of reopening the whole question of censorship.  I do not think that would be reasonable. The Taoiseach is not the Minister responsible for that Department.  I do, however, want to put to him a specific case which really does not come within the sphere of the censorship policy at all and it is this: unhappily, with the trend of world affairs, the casualty lists in the present war are growing, and must be expected to grow.  It is well known here, and all over the world, that a great many of our people have sons, husbands and relatives fighting on the battlefields of Europe at the present time.  When a father or a son dies on the battlefield, it would be some consolation to the bereaved parents or children, to know that they are entitled to notify their friends that their father, son or relative has died valiantly in the discharge of his duty, setting forth his rank, whether it be <Col N="1136" /> that of private or high officer, the place of his death and the circumstances of his dying.  Yet, the regulations made in this country forbid them to mention that he was on active service; they forbid them to mention his rank, and they forbid them to mention that he died upon the field of battle.  Now, I can conceive, though I could never agree, that at an earlier stage some advantage was to be derived from ignoring the fact that a number of our people were in the Army.  But, surely in the present state of the world, there is now no doubt what the true facts are, and it would not be any serious departure from the strict letter of security if we made human concessions to mitigate the suffering of our neighbours and permitted them to record honourably what they have every reason to be proud of.</P>
    <P>I make that representation to the Taoiseach in the belief that he has sufficient understanding of the poignant circumstances surrounding these cases to induce him at least to consider a relaxation of the regulations as they at the present time exist.  I know that it may be represented to him that, if any concession is made, he may be exposing himself to a deluge of propaganda which will pour through the breach made in the name of charity and understanding. For that reason I suggest to him that a course might be adopted which would meet the reasonable demands of humanitarian considerations, and at the same time provide security for those whose apprehensions would be aroused.  In full recognition of the unhappy fact that men are dying and must be expected to die, before the world war is at an end, a formula&mdash; a rigid formula&mdash;acceptable to the relatives of people who so die, should be worked out and offered to those who desire to communicate the knowledge of their bereavement to their friends through the public Press.  It could be done on the clear understanding that, for reasons of State, there could be no variation in that formula, which was designed to permit of the expression of justifiable pride in the sacrifice made by those who are gone.  We all recognise that individuals might prefer to choose their own words and might have <Col N="1137" /> some finesse of meaning which they were particularly desirous of expressing on such an occasion; but, in the circumstances, that privilege must be forgone and the acceptable, honourable form so devised would have to be accepted as adequate for all.</P>
    <P>I consider that that is a reasonable kind of proposal.  It is made designedly to avoid arousing feelings on any side of the House.  No matter how deeply we may differ in regard to many things, I have no doubt that, on all sides of the House, there is genuine sympathy for all our people who may be called upon to face bereavement and suffer loss in the course of the months that lie ahead.  It is in the hope that a reasonable concession to their grief may be obtained, by agreement and sympathy in the House, that I make the proposal I am now laying before the Dáil.  If the Taoiseach will consider these points, and answer them when replying, I shall appreciate it.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that, when speaking on this Emergency Powers (Continuance) Bill, a person is often subject to misrepresentation. That happened last year and, therefore, I wish to make it plain, as far as this Party is concerned, that we agree that such a Bill is necessary for the preservation of the State and the public safety in time of war.  On the other hand, we disagree with the way the Act has been administered in many cases and we believe that certain Ministers have misused the powers that the Act confers on them.  We are inclined to think that it gives power to Ministers to put forward and use their own ideas, regardless as to whether they are of benefit to the country or not.  For instance, not so long ago, we had the Minister for Supplies carrying through, under the Act, an Order fixing the price of wool.  He did not consult the representatives of the producers of that commodity, so surely we could not for one moment support an Act that would give such powers to that Minister or any other Minister to do things of that description.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year, when we voted against the Continuance Bill, propaganda went out to the effect that we were opening <Col N="1138" /> the prisons, letting out the prisoners, wrecking the State, and all that.  Of course, it was not my intention to vote against it on that point.  If there is a Vote to-day, I will vote against this Bill and my intention is the same.  I object to complete powers being handed over to Ministers to carry out their own ideas, without consulting the people primarily concerned.</P>
    <P>We believe that there is one Minister &mdash;the Minister for Defence&mdash;who should, be given these wholesale powers.  We believe it is necessary that his Department should have them, but we consider the other Ministers should not have them.  If the Taoiseach would agree that those other Ministers should at least have some consultation with the people concerned, before Emergency Powers Orders are made, we would agree to support the continuance of the Act; but, as it stands at the moment, it will not get our support.</P>
    <P>Very often, the Dáil is in session here when, over the wireless, an Emergency Powers Order is announced. Our Party expects that, when the Dáil is sitting, the House should be told of the Order, and it should be laid on the Table, before it is made known over the wireless.  When that is not done, it somehow takes away all powers from the Parliament elected by the people, and more or less shows that Parliament actually counts for nothing at all. It is for those reasons that we oppose the Bill.  We fully realise that the Emergency Powers Act is necessary, in some respects; but we believe that some Ministers are abusing their powers and using them to ride roughshod over matters that should be discussed in this House and of which this House should be made aware.</P>

      <P>This Bill is stated to be &ldquo;for the purpose of securing the public safety and the preservation of the State in time of war&rdquo;.  That is perfectly understandable, and, in recognition of that fact, this Party&mdash;and indeed, I think, all sides of this House&mdash;at an early stage in the present war handed these powers over to the Government.  They were intended for that purpose, but, unfortunately, <Col N="1139" /> since that time the powers have been used in many other ways.  Those ways have been mentioned by previous speakers, and I do not wish to labour the point.  Undoubtedly, many Orders have been made which might, and should, have been debated in this House.  There is the excuse that, owing to the pressure of business, the Government is rushed; but the fact remains that, by virtue of the Act, the Government should have been very careful not to use these powers except for the preservation of the State.  If that had been done, this side of the House would have had no complaint whatsoever.  We have seen Ministers doing many things which should not come under the Act at all, and, in that connection, I am constrained to add my voice to those which have raised the question of the censorship.</P>
      <P>Of course censorship is not the big concern of the Taoiseach, but he is the head of the State, and of the Government, and I think he must, in the long run, bear ultimate responsibility for it. Certainly we have seen some very extraordinary things done under the operation of the censorship.  Earlier this year we had the picture of the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures, by virtue of the powers of that Act, using it to say that a church in a certain town should call itself a certain name.  I do not want to open up that subject again, but can anybody seriously suggest that that or similar instances had anything to do with the preservation of the State or with its safety?  Of course it had nothing to do with it.  On these grounds I must charge the Government with the grossest abuse of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon referred to the position regarding obituary notices of citizens of this country who were serving in the British and Allied armies.  The Deputy made a nicely-worded plea for more generous treatment in that respect.  But I disagree with him when he suggested that the solution was to have a set obituary notice.  If that were agreed to I am afraid it would cause great pain to a number of people, at a time when they were feeling very sad, and wished to express something personal, if they had to have a set <Col N="1140" /> formula.  Even the present position might be better than having a set formula.  I wish to add to my plea to that of Deputy Dillon for wider and more generous treatment in this matter.  We have always prided ourselves on being generous in this country, but genuinely I cannot understand what effect the loosening of the present very harsh conditions in connection with obituary notices would have on the safety of the State.  I can not see that it would affect the position by one iota.  I say to the Government that the attitude taken up has been sorrowfully resented by people concerned.  I consider that the Government have in many instances grossly and unfairly used the very wide powers handed over to them for the safety of the State, having regard to the easy passage of certain Acts through the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think anybody will question the absolute necessity for emergency powers in a period like this. We have heard of complaints of overstepping the bounds in some things, but we must remember the reasons for that and the present shortage of many essential requirements.  We can also understand that mistakes may be made, but it is better to have Emergency Powers Orders, even if mistakes which cause hardship are made, than to have some commodities disappear and, as a result, hardship amongst the people.  My complaint is that there are not more Emergency Powers Orders and that they are not properly followed up.  For instance, an Order was made providing that workers were entitled to go before a tribunal to apply for a bonus on wages, taking into account the increase that has arisen in the cost of living.  Then another authority came along and filched from the workers the benefits they received.  When that matter is brought to the notice of the Government another Emergency Powers Order should be brought in to deal with it. In one case where a tribunal awarded a bonus of 8/- the local authority or commissioner filched 3/- or 4/- of that award by increasing rents.  As a result the applicants will have to go before the tribunal again to have the bonus <Col N="1141" /> adjusted, so that they may get the amount to which they are entitled as a cost-of-living bonus.  I also suggest that there should be an Emergency Powers Order made so that the benefits of legislation passed by this House should go directly to the people for whom it is intended, and not be filched from them by city managers acting as local managers.  These are reasons why I consider that we have not had sufficient Emergency Powers Orders.  The position should be watched so that the advantage of any social legislation should go to the proper place.</P>
      <P>Under Section 4 of the Finance Bill money for children's allowances is not taken into account for income-tax and supertax.  A citizen with six children gets 10/- under the Children's Allowances Act and that money is not considered for income-tax or supertax, but in the case of a worker earning 30/- weekly, with six children, for which he receives allowances amounting to 10/- weekly, a sum of 3/8 is immediately taken off by way of increased rent.  Instances like that should be dealt with by Emergency Powers Orders, so that the benefits of our social legislation and the decisions of tribunals dealing with the cost of living should pass directly to the people concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Principal Act which we are called upon to continue to-day was before the House I, while supporting the Bill, expressed the fear that it might be abused by a Party Government and at that time I expressed the hope that a Government representative of all Parties would be formed for the period of the emergency.  Unfortunately, we have experienced more than four years of emergency and we are still tied to the Party system of government, and, as a result, we have experienced during the past four years many grave abuses under the Emergency Powers Act.  It is not necessary to refer in detail to those abuses, they are so apparent to everybody.  On one occasion I had to draw attention in this House to the administration of the censorship regulations under which a member of the Irish hierarchy, appealing to farmers to increase production, was censored because a certain <Col N="1142" /> portion of his remarks was deemed to reflect upon the present Government.  While I agree that it is desirable, if not absolutely necessary, that a Government during a period of such emergency should have special powers to deal with the many difficult situations which might arise out of that emergency, it is highly dangerous to permit those powers to be abused by Ministers who, apparently, do not recognise the importance and far-reaching effect of the action they are taking.  It is typical of the attitude of the Government Party to have Deputy Corry to-day suggesting that the powers provided under the Emergency Powers Act should be used to enforce ordinary social legislation. That seems to be invading a normal function of this House.  Deputy Corry suggests that we should use the Emergency Powers Act to implement the Children's Allowances Act.  I think everybody will realise that that is going too far but it is just an indication of the trend which is developing as a result of the Emergency Powers Act.  We have the powers vested in the Government being used to supplant completely the powers of this House in regard to ordinary legislation.  I hold that any situation with which Parliament is competent to deal should be dealt with by Parliament and by Parliament alone and that it is only very special emergency cases that should be dealt with under the Emergency Powers Act. I think that was the intention of the House when the Act was originally passed and it was conveyed to the House by the Government that that was the manner in which it would be interpreted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we have the citizens of this country inundated by Emergency Powers Orders which it is impossible for the ordinary citizen to understand. I support wholeheartedly the plea of Deputy Dillon that as far as possible these Orders should be simplified and certainly, when it is found necessary to change an Order, the existing Order should, be repealed and a new Order made, which would give the ordinary businessman, farmer, or other citizen an opportunity of making himself acquainted with the <Col N="1143" /> provisions of the Order and of complying with the law.  I feel it is time to call a halt to the manner in which this Act is being abused.  Intentions have been expressed of abusing it still further.  I feel it would be a grave abuse to use the Emergency Powers Act for the purpose of suppressing elected local bodies such as county councils.  That intention has been publicly expressed by the Minister for Local Government, and he proposes to suppress these local authorities on very flimsy and far-fetched pretexts.  I feel that this House should assert its rights and should demand from the Government an assurance that Government Departments will not be allowed to use this Act to short circuit this House and to get regulations put into effect restricting the liberty of the people, without having to go through the searching investigation which they would receive if they were introduced as ordinary legislation.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to discuss the principle of this Bill.  I think that is agreed.  One of the great difficulties that arise in connection with these Orders is that there does not seem to be any attempt made to contact persons with practical experience before the Orders are made. I admit right away that in many cases time does not allow of getting in contact with people with experience in the particular phase of business that may be affected by the Order, but I think, where time does allow, if there were contact with such persons in the first instance, it might not be necessary to make the Order at all, and I am perfectly satisfied that there would be fewer amendments to original Orders than there are now. Every member of this House knows that twice and three times in the week one gets a bulky envelope containing a whole lot of Orders.  I do not know whether this can be got over, but it would seem as if they were deliberately drafted so that no ordinary person could make head or tail of them.  The amendments are worse still because they refer back to something that you probably have completely forgotten or you have lost the original Order.</P>

      <P>Yes, I will quote as one illustration an Emergency Powers Order made two or three years ago affecting sacks for corn.  In that Order it was stated that it would be illegal for any person other than a licensed firm of sack merchants to repair a sack.  If that Order had been literally followed out and strictly obeyed by those engaged in saving the harvest, it would mean that two men lifting a sack which was torn by a nail could not put a sod of straw into the hole to keep in the corn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>An Taoiseach smiles, and I do not blame him.  I have no hesitation in saying that as far as I was personally concerned I completely ignored the Order, because it would have meant that every corn merchant and every miller in the country would have to collect bundles of torn sacks or sacks holed by mice or rats until he had 100,500, or 1,000, and then send them to Dublin to a recognised seed merchant.  He would probably have got them back in time for the harvest the following year.  Of course, the people very sensibly carried on in the good old way, and if a sack got torn the man would produce a packing needle and cord out of his pocket and sew the sack, or he would get a wisp of straw from the nearest hay stack and stop the hole temporarily.  I mention that as an illustration of the sort of stupid thing that is put into these Orders.  Where time would allow, if there was contact with people in the particular business affected by the Order, a lot of these mistakes would be avoided, and there would be fewer amendments required to these original Orders than there are now.</P>

      <P>I remember being called out of bed one night by the local blacksmith.  He had done away with the bellows, the old form of working-up the necessary heat in his forge, and he had installed an electrical apparatus.  His chief worry was the shortage of electricity.  He told me he had nine mowing machines and other agricultural implements that <Col N="1145" /> needed repairing, and he could not do the work without an adequate supply of electricity.  He candidly admitted that his trade had increased possibly by 300 per cent.  He had four assistants, and he was charmed with his new method of working.  He said that human nature could not stand up to the type of work they were doing in the past.  He was quite willing now to work into the night in order to get the repairs done, but he needed the electricity.  The moving machines were lying there and the hay was ready to be cut, but the farmers could not cut it.</P>
      <P>This man is an expert, and he welds the broken parts, and in this way he meets the requirements of the country for some 20 miles around.  It is the greatest corn-growing district in Munster. I got through to the Electricity Supply Board offices in Limerick, and also in Dublin, and there was no chance of that man getting an increase in his supply.  It really amounts to a calamity in our area, owing to the scarcity of reaper and binder parts. The whole area is in a quandary.  That man should get precedence even over ordinary householders.</P>

      <P>I should like to refer to the wool position.  We have an inspector around our area, and if wool is not presented in good shape, or is not perhaps in a clean state, he can get a person fined.  At the same time there are a few merchants who, over the telephone, can purchase wool at a few pence a pound less than other people.  I understand that there was a Dublin man and a Wexford man employed. These are counties where wool is not purchased to any great extent. In South Tipperary we are great wool producers.  The price of wool has been altered, and I think it is the duty of the inspector to see that the altered prices are being observed.  It is hard to get the Blarney wool.  I should like <Col N="1146" /> the Government to pay particular attention to the needs of such men as the blacksmith to whom I have referred &mdash;men engaged in electric welding. Every effort should be made to give them adequate electricity supplies.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the general principle of this Bill, the need of such powers, has been admitted.  Of course, it is quite clear that from the moment those powers are used there will be a difference of opinion as to whether they are being used rightly or not.  We have differences of opinion when other legislation is going through, and we have to resolve these differences by some method, such as a majority decision. That procedure would be the ideal one for dealing with all these matters, but, unfortunately, conditions do not permit that procedure being adopted in the present circumstances.  We have to consider the urgency of certain matters in a time of emergency, and there are other considerations.</P>
      <P>The day appears to be coming when it will no longer be possible for the Dáil to hope to do all the work in the same manner as was possible when Parliaments had far less duties to perform than we have.  Deputy Dillon was not speaking of this emergency exactly, but of another period, the period that is to come.  He suggested that we might try to get some procedure by way of a committee to deal with these matters.  That point has been examined elsewhere.  Any of us who has had anything to do with subcommittees, which would report back to the House, is aware that very often when you think you are providing a short cut by way of such a sub-committee you are doing nothing of the kind, because the whole thing is opened up again.  If you had a committee of this House dealing with legislation, you would certainly find that those who were not on the committee would raise objections when the matter would come before the House.  For instance, I cannot imagine Deputy Dillon, if he were not a member of a committee, sitting quietly here and allowing things to go by with which he did not agree, simply because a special committee had handled them elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1147" /> I do not think the idea of such a committee is practicable&mdash;that it would, in fact, shorten the procedure. I admit that a committee might give a more complete examination to legislation and other matters, from the point of view of the House and all Parties, than is possible at the present time, but it would not be a means of saving time or enabling the work that has to be done in a time of emergency to be done more thoroughly and more effectively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think An Taoiseach has missed the point I made.  I suggested that it is quite possible that some system of legislation by Order may have to be tolerated permanently. If we were to contemplate that, then the Orders should be submitted to a committee from time to time and they, when they thought it necessary, could pick out any individual Order and say that that Order should be debated in the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that would help.  It is quite obvious that the differences that would arise would be differences on political grounds&mdash; that there would be differences arising from the political viewpoint&mdash;and the whole matter would be referred back. I doubt if we would get the degree of unanimity which would enable that system of a committee to work statisfactorily. However, whatever may have to be done with regard to the future, as regards the present I think it is impracticable.  There are powers in the case of certain Orders by which they can be brought to the attention of the Dáil.</P>
      <P>I think, after over four years' experience, and considering the problems with which we had to deal, that on the whole we should congratulate ourselves that we have got through without having a far greater degree of hardship than has been experienced. I think most Deputies will admit that. We have had, it is true, a very difficult time&mdash;five years of it.  I must say for myself, looking back, that I could not have hoped, and did not hope, that we would pass through five years of war with the social fabric as intact as it is at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1148" /> It has been suggested that when these Orders are made there should be more contacts with the parties affected.  There are two difficulties. The first is in regard to time.  Very often, one has to act quickly and one cannot make contacts with all the people who should be consulted.  Then, there is the consideration that there is a danger, in dealing with parties who may be affected, of attempts being made to act ahead of the Order.  Contacts could not be universally made and it might be said that those with whom contact was made would be in a position, because of the information they received, to anticipate the Orders, to their private advantage.  I think that contact is made wherever possible. It is not because of laziness that resort is had to the Order-procedure instead of bringing matters before the Dáil.  Orders are resorted to because, on account of the times and the circumstances, the matters in question could not be brought by way of ordinary legislation before the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The question of an index to those Orders has been referred to Deputy Dillon raised that matter some time ago.  For a couple of years, an annual index to the Orders has been published. An index to Orders issued up to 1943 was published last February. I asked a couple of times whether it would be possible to publish a half-yearly or quarterly index instead of an annual index.  Apparently, there would be considerable difficulty in getting that done.  One of the Deputies who spoke seemed to think that there was an illimitable number of civil servants waiting to do anything that required to be done.  Obviously, that is not correct. There is a limited number of civil servants and, if a Government is doing its work properly, it should try to keep that number down to essential requirements.</P>
    <P>A point was made by Deputy Dillon with which I am in full agreement.  I came in contact with the matter to which he referred in another place.  He referred to the necessity for reading three or four Acts or Orders, with amendments upon amendments, in order to discover the law at the moment.  I could never understand why <Col N="1149" /> the procedure adopted in another place was not adopted here.  When we had to amend statutes elsewhere, we adopted a very simple procedure: when the statute was amended, the statute, as amended, was substituted for the original one.</P>

      <P>The only objection I could see to the adoption of that procedure here was that it would mean using more paper.  Whether that would be a consideration of importance at another time, I do not know.  The old practice is there and it is very hard to get it rooted out.  When the Constitution is amended, it is revised at a certain stage and a new document is issued containing the Constitutional law as it stands at that moment.  I think that that is a sensible procedure and I do not know why draftsmen and Departments do not try to adopt it universally.  It might not be applicable in some special cases or there may be reasons which I have not yet heard for the continuance of the present practice.</P>

      <P>The adoption of the new procedure would mean that more time would be required.  It would mean more typewriting and printing. It is, obviously, easier to say that subsection so and so shall be altered by the insertion of such a word than to prepare a long document, covering 20 or 30 sections, which would have to be typewritten and reprinted.  I think that is the real reason why the other procedure is not adopted.  The present system merely involves the putting down of a few sentences on a piece of paper, but the other system would be much better from the point of view of <Col N="1150" /> the person who wants to ascertain the law at the precise moment.  If anybody were interested historically as to how amendments came to be made, they could refer to the previous Order which would be in existence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>An Taoiseach appreciates the difference between the adoption of that procedure in the case of an Order and in the case of a Bill.  If a Bill were brought in in that way, it would have to be passed through all its stages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that, but I think that a good deal could be done to apply the procedure I suggest to ordinary legislation as well as to Orders.  It would be merely a matter of getting a formula, such as we got in the case of the Constitution, which would apply to Bills which were being amended.  We could, I am sure, get a formula which would provide that, if an amendment of a sentence or two were made in a Bill, the law would be deemed to be amended in the full sense that the Deputy has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be practicable to do that in the case of Orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be done, too, I think, in the case of legislation. Elsewhere, when there are amendments to special portions of a very long statute, it is done by way of chapters. The chapter as amended is substituted for the original.  That might be applied here if the section were taken as the unit.  We are at one as regards the desirability of this change being made but there may be difficulties which neither I nor Deputy Dillon realises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Questions were raised regarding the censorship.  I suppose that these questions will be raised again on my Estimate so that there is not much point in anticipating them.  My own conviction is that we have been very fortunate in the censors we have.  I think that they have done their work really well.  If they had been less rigid, as some people would like to have them, I think that we would have found ourselves in all sorts of difficulties.  I am absolutely satisfied that the actuating motive in the mind of the responsible <Col N="1151" /> Minister and the censors all the time was the preservation of national unity, to secure that during this period of grave crisis we would maintain what was, perhaps, the greatest essential to the preservation of the State&mdash;internal agreement.  The powers of the censor were used to prevent anything which would in any way make for a different state of affairs.  If we were individually to act as censors, I think that we should, although animated by the same ideas, proceed in a different way in specific cases.  It would be almost impossible to get different individuals to operate precisely in the same way in particular cases even though they have the same general principles in mind. As I say, I have always felt that one of the great bulwarks we have had during this particular period of trial has been the censorship and, in particular, the manner in which it has been carried out.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon referred to the question of obituary notices and the publication of the deaths of those who have lost their lives in this war.  That is a very difficult matter.  The Deputy could see, the moment another Deputy spoke, how impracticable the idea of a formula or something of that kind would be.  The censorship has acted in a certain way during the past five years, and I think the best thing for the State would be to continue that and not make changes at this precise time.  I think it is better that we should continue to the end on the road along which we have been moving.  I appreciate and understand fully the point of view from which the Deputy approached the matter, but I do not think we could do anything in that regard which would be satisfactory from his point of view.</P>
    <P>I am not quite clear that I quite understood the purpose of raising the question of licences.  It is obvious that the Minister in giving licences, as indeed in regard to the whole of his operations during this particular time, has to keep in view the community as a whole and all the people affected by his actions.  We, each of us&mdash;for instance the Deputy who spoke about the blacksmith&mdash;knows that, when a special <Col N="1152" /> case of hardship is brought before us, very often we see the particular case in isolation.  We see that there is a certain hardship, but what we do not see is the hardship that would be inflicted on others if something else was done, if, for instance, even the remedies which have been suggested were carried out.  We are short of electric power at present.  The quantity available is much less than what we want.  Somebody has to go short, and the question is how you are to make that shortage fall with as little weight on the community as a whole and damage the community as a whole as little as possible.  The Minister has to ask himself whether, in the case of the blacksmith with the mowing machines and other implements to repair, his going short would be a lesser evil than, for instance, some other important form of industry on which it would have more general and wider reactions.</P>
    <P>It is true that we want to have the harvest reaped and to have the machinery that is necessary.  I know that considerations of that sort are in the Minister's mind when Orders of that kind are being made.  But it is extremely difficult and, the more you make exceptions, the more difficult you find it to have any rule at all; because the moment you make an exception you will find that there will be other ones like it.  A new set of border-line cases will arise the moment you make an exception. Generally, I dislike the application of rigid rules.  But whenever I try; in my own case, to avoid that and deal with each case separately, either the task becomes too great to be carried out, or else you have the almost impossible task of deciding between one type of exception and another that is closely related to it.  So that, while it falls sometimes very harshly and heavily on individuals, at the same time, from the community point of view, taking it as a whole, there is probably far less hardship in applying the same sort of rule to each individual case.  I am speaking generally.  I do not want that itself to be made into a general rule, because we have to consider not merely the interests of the community as a whole but, from time to time, we have <Col N="1153" /> to place side by side with that the interests of the individual citizen whose well-being it is our business to try to look after.  I do not think there was any other matter of importance raised. I merely jotted down some headings as I went along.  I do not think there was any other point raised to which I should refer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>An Taoiseach referred to the question of the revocation of licences and then went away from it. The point that was made was: why should not the justice, in dealing with an offence, be empowered to make a direction to the Department on the matter of the revocation of a licence; in other words, make a judicial decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that when the Minister is given the power of revocation of licences, he is given that power from an executive point of view.  He has to consider the interests of all the people.  For instance, if that were left in other hands, if it were taken out of the hands of the Minister, the general policy which the Minister wants to operate would not be possible.  It would mean that somebody who had not an opportunity of appreciating all the consequences of the offences that were committed would be interfering with the general application of that policy.  We have had, very unfortunately indeed, to pass an Act dealing with minimum penalties.  One does not like to do that, but if we did not do it, the result would be that the local justices or others might not appreciate the whole circumstances in the way that the Minister, whose business it is from day to day to see the situation as a whole, would.  Still, as I said, when one of us come across a hard individual case which we would like to remedy, we see it in isolation.  But the Minister, who is dealing with the community as a whole, has to see the picture as a whole.  It is not unfair, if he is giving a licence for a certain purpose, that he should have the power of revoking the licence if the purpose he has in mind is not being carried out.</P>

      <P>Tairgim:</P>
      <P>Go ndeontar suim ná raghaidh thar £12,750 chun slánuithe na suime is gá chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1945, chun Oifig Thaighde Eolaíochta Ré na Práinne, maraon le Deontas-i-gCabhair.</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £12,750 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1945, for the Emergency Scientific Research Bureau, including a Grant-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total provision for the year is £19,250 as compared with £32,850 for last year.  The reduction of £13,600 is due to the decrease in the Grant-in-Aid provided under sub-head B, and arises mainly from the transfer to the Turf Development Board, Limited, of the work on the production of charcoal at Turraun.  The programme of investigation for the year involves smaller decreases under some other headings, while increases are expected under <Col N="1156" /> such headings as producers, medical supplies, and explosives.  The total volume of work is not expected to be any lower than last year, as some of the larger investigations are being conducted in collaboration with other Departments which will bear the costs involved.</P>
    <P>The Emergency Scientific Research Bureau continues to deal with technical problems arising from the emergency, and to advise on difficulties due to shortages of materials.  The Grant-in-Aid is intended to cover the cost of such investigations and researches as may prove necessary, particularly in connection with problems relating to fuel, broadcasting, essential medical supplies, iron and steel, adhesives, fertilisers, explosives, and office work of the Bureau.</P>
    <P>Work has proceeded on the provision of substitute fuels for transport.  Improvements in the turf charcoal plant at Turraun have resulted in an output of high-grade charcoal at a rate of about 20 tons per week.  This fuel has been used in cross-draught producer plants with satisfactory results.  The responsibility for the operation of the plant was transferred to the Turf Development Board, Limited, on the 1st December, 1943, but the Bureau continues to supervise the technical aspects of the work. Attention is being given to the problems relating to the recovery and utilisation of the by-products of carbonisation. The examination of the manufacture of charcoal in hand-operated kilns has been continued, and the Bureau memorandum on the production of this fuel in portable kilns and in pits has been issued to a large number of inquirers.</P>
    <P>Improvements were made in a cross-draught producer fitted to a two-ton lorry, and satisfactory results were obtained from running tests.  The consumption of machine-won turf charcoal was 1.5 lbs. per mile.  Further investigations with a view to improving the design and effectiveness of producer units will be continued.  The experience gained in the course of this investigation has enabled the Bureau to give advice to Government Departments, and to deal with a number of outside <Col N="1157" /> technical inquiries.  Investigations are continuing on the properties of peat tar, and substitute materials for use in the manufacture of polishes and certain supplies required by the boot industry have been obtained from it. The Bureau's work on the production of phosphorus has proceeded satisfactorily, and the size of the plant has been increased.</P>
    <P>A spectrographic apparatus for the analysis of alloy steels has been set up, and has proved of value in the identification of steel samples.  Work on the home production of ferro-silicon, which is required by the foundries, was brought to the semi-technical scale, but in view of improvements in the supply position, trial of the process on a commercial scale was not justified. Experiments are in progress on the home manufacture of corrugated steel knives for the cutting of beet in the sugar factories.</P>
    <P>The Bureau assisted in an investigation of the possible effects on the health of the community of 100 per cent. extraction flour.  An investigation has recently been carried out by the flour millers, under the auspices of the Bureau, in connection with certain difficulties in home baking with the white flour as at present manufactured.</P>
    <P>Investigations completed in regard to the manufacture of storage batteries led to the general conclusion that acceptable substitutes for imported batteries could, if necessary, be produced at home.  A commercial firm is undertaking, with the Bureau's assistance, the remelting of scrap for the production of battery plates.</P>
    <P>The provision of certain essential medical supplies continues to have attention.  It has been found that the supply of liquid insulin can be maintained, in case of shortage, by importing a reserve stock of the solid material for dissolving and packing in this country.  A full-scale plant for the production of either from alcohol has been erected by Monarchana Alcóil na h-Éireann, Teóranta, working in collaboration with the Bureau, and investigations are now proceeding on the purification of the technical either produced <Col N="1158" /> in the course of experimental runs, so as to render it suitable for medical use.</P>
    <P>With a view to the production of an improved phosphatic fertiliser, the Bureau carried out experiments on a semi-technical scale on the heat treatment of Clare phosphate rock, either alone, or with sodium carbonate or lime.  The products obtained have been tested in the laboratory, and it is hoped to carry out extended field trials with the most promising of the materials.  Consideration has also been given to the production of calcium metaphosphate&mdash;for use as a fertiliser&mdash; from Clare phosphate, and it is hoped to conduct some experiments on this matter during the present year.  The better use of pyritic ores from Avoca in the production of sulphuric acid, required in the manufacture of superphosphate, is also being studied.</P>
    <P>Several investigations are in progress in regard to the home manufacture of adhesives for various industrial purposes, including boot and shoe manufacture. Formulae have been developed for liquid glue, a general adhesive of the nitro-cellulose type, an adhesive for use with cellophane and an adhesive for abrasive papers.</P>
    <P>The uncertainty in regard to imports of explosives has necessitated an examination of the possibilities of the home manufacture of substitute materials, for example, liquid oxygen, gunpowder and potassium chlorate. The manufacture of potassium chlorate has been studied on the semi-technical scale, and arrangements are being made for production on the large scale at an early date.</P>
    <P>Difficulties arose in connection with the supply of a preservative for fishing nets, and the Bureau has collaborated with the Irish Sea Fisheries Association, Limited, in developing a substitute process, which is now undergoing practical tests.</P>
    <P>Various other investigations are being conducted with a view to relieving difficulties arising from emergency conditions.  Attention is being given to the possibilities of improved methods for the production of acetone, a solvent required in many industrial processes.  Methods were <Col N="1159" /> developed for the preparation of butyl acetate and amyl acetate, and work is in progress on the production of other organic solvents required in industry. Experiments recently conducted on the manufacture of sodium hypochlorite solution are expected to provide against a failure of imported supplies of the chlorine products required by public authorities and creameries for water purification.  The geophysical survey is proceeding in collaboration with the Geological Survey, and a study of magnetic anomalies in the down-faulted area of the Carrickmacross-Kingscourt gypsum field is being made.  Numerous difficulties were encountered in attempts to increase the power of the transmitter for shortwave broadcasting but it is hoped to continue the work in the present year.</P>
    <P>The number of problems put before the Bureau by industrial firms continues to grow, indicating that the value of scientific advice and assistance is appreciated in industry.  A variety of minor investigations, resulting from inquiries of this nature, were successfully conducted.  These included the re-silvering of mirrors for cinema projectors, the manufacture of axle and cart greases, the production of sewing wax and of a thread lubricant for use in the boot and shoe industry, the manufacture of shoe polish, the polishing of spectacle lenses, and the production of certain supplies for use in hat manufacture.  The Bureau has also co-operated with Government Departments in the examination of such subjects as the drying of potatoes for pig food, the dehydration of vegetables, economy in the use of lubricating oil, and investigations necessary to ensure that materials likely to be of value to industry do not leave the country.</P>
    <P>As I explained on previous occasions when introducing this Vote, the Bureau's procedure when approached by a firm with a problem is to examine the matter and, from the experience and information available, to give advice to the firm on its difficulty.  This advice is given free.  If the problem requires investigation the firm or industry for whose benefit the work <Col N="1160" /> has been conducted is expected, where appropriate, to contribute to the cost. In most of these investigations the results obtained are likely to be of value in other directions, and the charges made are only a proportion of the total expenses.  Some of the investigations, however, are expected to benefit one concern only, and in these instances a larger proportion of the expenses is refunded.</P>
    <P>The Bureau has received every possible assistance from Government Departments and from the authorities and staffs of the universities.  Industrialists, scientists and private individuals have given considerable help, and much of the work of the Bureau would not be possible without this co-operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the House very fully appreciates the value of the work and the usefulness of the services that have been rendered by the Scientific Research Bureau.  Deputies will agree that whatever finances were necessary to keep the Bureau in operation have been wisely spent, and that the nation has got a very good return for the money expended.  The Bureau has solved many difficulties arising out of the shortage of materials and of essential equipment due to the emergency, and the substitution of other methods of treatment and other means of manufacture.  It has solved these difficulties in the main, of course, for industrial purposes.  In that connection, I regret that the Taoiseach and the Government have not seen fit to set up for agriculture a scientific bureau more or less on the same lines.  It is true that some of our agricultural problems have been tackled by the Bureau, but I am not very clear as to how direction is given as to the urgency of the problems that exist, the priority that is given to them, or what responsible authority directs the scientists to give attention to particular problems that urgently require attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to some research work in regard to the type of treatment given to Clare phosphates. We all appreciate that Clare phosphates are very highly insoluble and that they require a lot of sulphuric <Col N="1161" /> acid in their processing.  For that reason treatment along the old lines is rather expensive, and of course that expense must inevitably reflect itself in the price and the cost to the State. I think the Bureau in its research regarding the treatment of Clare phosphates should travel along the lines followed on the Continent in the treatment of phosphates, and that is roasting the rock with alkalis.  The fluorine present in the rock is gripped by the alkalis and that leaves the phosphate. I believe that gives a better product in the long run, an article that will be more soluble and more immediately available for plant food.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this problem of artificial manures to which I think I drew the Taoiseach's attention before by way of Parliamentary Question.  That is that I feel that some research or exploration work should be done regarding serpentine phosphates here.  It has been the experience of other countries that where iron and aluminium silicate or ores are present in the soil, a high degree of fixation occurs as far as the application of phosphates is concerned.  Where that fixation has occurred, it meant that these phosphates were not recoverable for plant life.  The user of phosphates living on that type of land is getting as low as 10 per cent. of the value of the phosphates.  I would say that in our circumstances with the present cost of living and the present cost of artificial manures, that represents a very big loss.  In some places that problem has been solved by the admixture with the phosphate rock of another type of rock such as donite or serpentine rock.  That has prevented fixation.  I think that in a big percentage of our land, mostly of the acid variety, there is a good deal of iron and aluminium present, and if the theory of agricultural scientists in other countries is correct, as I believe it is, then here in our circumstances a very big percentage of fixation is occurring in soil of that type and a large amount of wastage has occurred. I wonder if the Taoiseach would have the matter examined, in conjunction with whatever research is being carried out at present regarding the new treatment of Clare phosphates.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1162" /> I am glad that the new method of treating phosphates in the manufacture of superphosphates is being fully examined.  I think it ought to be vigorously pursued, because, as the Taoiseach will appreciate, one of the biggest difficulties in regard to food production is the lack of artificial manures, particularly in the tillage areas where there is a tradition of tillage and where there was not the same reserve of fertility as in the case of the older grasslands.  Because of that, the people best equipped, not merely from the point of view of knowledge, but of machinery and everything else, are suffering severe handicaps due to the lack of artificial manure.  I urge that the matter should be vigorously pursued and that whatever experimental work is being carried on should be brought to a conclusion as early as possible.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention of the Taoiseach to the fact that nothing is being done in the way of any attempt to expand our potash resources. A certain amount has been done, and is being done, in the matter of winning potash from seaweed, but the production is negligible in relation to our requirements and no expansion is being effected.  I wonder if any investigation is being made into the matter.  Are there any sources of supply available other than seaweed or has the Bureau carried out any investigation whatever in that respect?  I do not know how far the Bureau has helped to provide us with the small quantity of nitrate of ammonia available, but the amount available is very useful, and if an expansion of production could be brought about, it would be a tremendous asset in relation to food production next year.  It is a fundamental matter to which I ask the Taoiseach to urge the Bureau to direct its special attention.  Finally, I should like to know what facilities we have for training young scientific research workers and how they are recruited? I have had some inquiries with regard to the matter, and perhaps the Taoiseach could give the House some information about it.</P>

      <P>Is dóigh liom gurb é seo an Meastachán is suimiúla <Col N="1163" /> a bhíonn á phlé sa Dáil agus cruthaíonn sé dhúinn go bhfuil eolaithe ag baint leis an mBureau seo, agus ag cabhrú leis, atá chomh cliste agus chomh gasta agus chomh héirimiúil agus atá le fáil in aon tír ar dhruim an domhain.  Maidir leis an obair atá déanta ó cuireadh an Bureau ar bun, tá buíochas na tíre tuillte acu agus buíochas tuillte ag An Taoiseach toise an Bureau so a bhunú.  Is léir go bhfuil a lán bun-abhar sa tír gur féidir feidhm do bhaint astu chun rudaí do chur ar fáil go bhfuil géarghá leo agus nach raibh ar fáil againn go dtí seo.  Tá sé cruthaithe dhúinn, freisin, nach gá bheith ag brath ar an iasacht feasta agus go raibh rudaí annso againn i ngan fhios dúinn, a cheapamar ná beadh le fáil mara bhféadfaí a dtabhairt thar tír isteach. Níl mórán eile agam le rá ar an meastachan ach amháin go gceapaim go mba cheart an obair seo do choimeád ar siúl nuair a bheidh an cogadh thart. Tá cruthaithe dhúinn gur bhfiú an Bureau do chur ar bun agus, dar liomsa, ba cheart é chiomeád ar siúl agus é bhuanú tar éis an chogaidh. Beidh caoi níos fearr againn ná mar a bhí go dtí seo nuair a bheidh síocháin ann agus an gnáth-shaol ann arís ar an obair atá idir lámhaibh aige a chur chun críche níos fearr.</P>

      <P>The question of the fixation of phosphates was raised by Deputy Hughes.  Last year, I referred the matter to the Bureau, but I am not an expert and could not attempt to give any views on such matters.  The value of the raising of these questions by Deputies is that any questions raised will be sent on to the Bureau and to the Department of Agriculture when they have reference to that particular Department.  I understand that the Bureau has had a digest made of the information available on that question, and scientists appear to differ very widely on it.  In fact, no definite conclusions can be drawn at present from the views published and expressed. With regard to the Clare phosphates, some field experiments are being carried out and it is possible that we shall be able to get some better information than is at present available, <Col N="1164" /> and any views which may be held by different members can be tested.</P>

      <P>Yes.  But the whole question of the fixation of phosphates would come in in any case.  The question of the fixation of phosphates would probably be investigated side by side with the general examination of Clare phosphates.  I do not know that we shall be able to get any distance with it.  The Deputy must remember that the Bureau is an emergency Bureau which deals only with matters which fall directly within the emergency conditions.</P>

      <P>If there is good reason for it.  It may not emerge in that precise form.  There is in existence an Industrial Research Council and there will be a question of what permanent form that body should take.  That will be considered in due course.  A special research department for the Department of Agriculture has been suggested once or twice.  The universities are doing a certain amount of that work. There is the Albert College, which was handed over to the universities at one stage.  The question is whether it is necessary to add to that, and the particular way in which the addition should be made.  I think the Minister for Agriculture has been giving considerable consideration to the matter. I could not at this stage give any definite information as to what will be done, but we are dealing here only with the Scientific Research Bureau which is definitely working within the conditions of the emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that the House appreciates the work being done by it.  I have personally come in contact with the members on a number of occasions, and I could not praise too highly the energy and devotion of those on the board and their helpers in respect of the work they have undertaken.  We cannot appreciate to the full what they have <Col N="1165" /> done, and mention here and there of the various things gives but a very small idea of the work they have been doing.

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £2,814,124 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1945, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Supplies, including payment of certain Subsidies and Sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>The Department of Supplies, as everybody knows, is an emergency Department set up solely to deal with problems arising out of the emergency, problems which we hope will end with the emergency, and, when they end, the Department of Supplies will also cease to function.  It is charged with the duties of getting supplies of necessary goods from abroad, however, wherever and whenever possible, and transporting them to this country; with the organisation and the regulation to the best advantage of the distribution of available supplies, whether imported or home-produced.  It was recently given additional functions in connection with turf production under the auspices of the Turf Development Board, and is at all times responsible in the very important and highly controversial matter of price control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The function of regulating the distribution <Col N="1166" /> of available supplies is one which the Department of Supplies shares with the Department of Industry and Commerce.  As I told the Dáil on the occasion of the discussion on the Vote for the Department of Industry and Commerce, the line of demarcation between the functions of the two Departments is not very clearly drawn, but roughly, it leaves the control of industrial materials in the hands of the Department of Industry and Commerce, and the control of consumers' goods in the hands of the Department of Supplies.  There is, of course, a number of commodities, including most fuels and textiles, in which there is both an industrial and a consumers' interest.  Where there is a consumers' interest, the regulation of the distribution of the goods concerned is the function of the Department of Supplies.</P>
    <P>On previous occasions when moving the Vote for the Department of Supplies, I warned the Dáil, and, through the Dáil, the members of the public, that our supply difficulties would grow in intensity with the prolongation of the war.  The problems which were discussed here on previous occasions when the activities of the Department were under review still exist, but many new problems have been added to them since this time last year.  As I have on other occasions pointed out, we in this country are fighting a defensive action for the protection of the conditions of living of our people.  We are fighting that action against forces which are so strong that we have frequently no alternative to retreating. Whatever victories have been won or may be won in the future are merely negative, a mere avoidance of defeat, and on that account have tended to pass unnoticed, certainly unsung.  It is only when some new scarcity develops, when the public interest requires that some additional restriction should be imposed upon the sale or consumption of goods, that the members of the Dáil and the public take notice of what the Department of Supplies is doing, and then as a rule unfavourable notice.  Nobody can say how bad the conditions in this country might have been if the policy of the Government had been less sound, or <Col N="1167" /> the administration of the Department of Supplies less effective.  Anybody can contend that, with another policy or more effective administration, conditions might have been better, and it is, of course, impossible to prove them wrong.  Even comparisons with other countries are unreliable, because conditions elsewhere are different from those prevailing here, and there is in any event a lack of authentic information. It is, however, my duty to say, on behalf of the staff of the Department of Supplies, that they did their job as well as possible under all the circumstances.  No Minister charged with the responsibility of my office could have wished for a better organisation under his control.  Whatever faults may be found with the administration of the Department are faults of policy, for which the Minister alone is responsible.  Within the limits of the defined policy, the officers of the Department of Supplies have produced the best results possible.</P>
    <P>Our circumstances have worsened very materially since last year.  There is a number of factors which limit our capacity to secure supplies of goods overseas, and which in the course of the past 12 months operated to restrict our imports to a minimum.  The first of these factors is the shortage of oceangoing ships, and the second is the development in the restrictions on the release of materials imposed by foreign Governments.  Those restrictions existed before, but they were far more stringently applied during the course of the past 12 months than they had been previously.  During the financial year under review, no foreign ships imported goods from overseas to this country except petroleum products. The only means at our command for bringing in supplies from abroad were the ships operated by Irish Shipping Limited, and that was a very inadequate foundation for our security.  Irish Shipping Limited has acquired 14 ships since it was established, of which there are 11 in service.  One ship is under repair and two have been lost.  The Dáil is aware of the circumstances attending the loss of the <i>Irish Oak</i> and the <i>Irish Pine</i>, but they may not fully <Col N="1168" /> appreciate that those two ships were the biggest in our fleet, and the loss of their services represented a reduction in the carrying capacity of the fleet which was very substantial, far more substantial than the proportion of ships lost to the total number acquired might represent.  In fact, the carrying capacity of the ships at our disposal was reduced by almost 20 per cent. by the loss of those two vessels.  I know there are a number of Deputies who believe that our shipping position might have been better if that company had been formed; or if ships had been purchased, at an earlier date than that was, in fact, done.  That belief is based very largely on a misunderstanding. I do not think it is necessary to review now the considerations which led the Government to decide to rely upon neutral ships for the importation of goods, so long as they were available, or the considerations which induced us to avoid taking the risks associated with having ships carrying the Irish flag in belligerent waters.  What ever criticism on that decision may be offered now in retrospect, I think history will record that upon it, as well as upon a number of other decisions, rested the success of the efforts made by the Government to preserve the neutrality of this country in the war.  The misunderstanding of Deputies is, however, based upon the fact that they have not fully appreciated that the number of ships which, we, in this country, can operate&mdash;in fact, the number of ships which any neutral country can operate&mdash;in present circumstances is not determined by the number of ships which we can own or acquire, but by the facilities which the belligerent States are prepared to allow to us.  In fact, there is a number of ships upon offer at the present time which could be acquired, but which have not been acquired, because difficulties exist which preclude the possibility of utilising them in the service of this country.</P>
    <P>During the year which ended on the 31st May, the ships of Irish Shipping Limited carried to this country 204,000 tons of cargo.  That tonnage represents only a small fraction of normal <Col N="1169" /> imports to this country, but, nevertheless, if we had not been able to procure the goods which it represents, our circumstances to-day would be very much worse than they are.  The goods imported were all essential, the tonnage being utilised almost entirely for the importation of wheat, phosphates, newsprint, cotton and other textiles, agricultural seeds, metals and various industrial materials, such as paraffin wax.  Wheat, of course, represents by far the most important item in the list, and, to the extent of two-thirds the carrying capacity of the ships was utilised for the importation of wheat.</P>
    <P>The House is, I think, aware that the services operated by the smaller ships owned by Irish shipping companies to peninsular ports have been suspended.  I cannot say when it may be possible to resume trade with the peninsular ports in our own ships again.  The ships that were previously engaged in the peninsular trade are now engaged in the cross-Channel traffic from which British vessels were withdrawn under an order of the British Admiralty some time ago.</P>
    <P>I think the House should be aware, however, of the exceptional success, from the commercial point of view, of Irish Shipping, Limited.  The importance of the services provided by the ships of that company to the country is well known, but not so well known as the fact that the company has been run in a most efficient manner, a manner which has resulted in the realisation of profits on the enterprise, and which has so strengthened the financial basis of the organisation that its successful operation after the war is made more practicable than it might otherwise have been.  I think that the Dáil, and the public, should know and appreciate the manner in which the company has been run, and should allow me to express, on their behalf, to the directors of that company our thanks for the services which they have rendered, which they have given voluntarily and which has been of inestimable value to the nation.  In the second year of its existence, the company found it possible to reduce the freights charged for the transportation of goods by approximately 29 <Col N="1170" /> per cent.  In July of last year the rates were again reduced by 10 per cent, and the reduction effected in July was increased to 20 per cent. in October. The company has also firmly established itself in the marine insurance business.  It is now undertaking insurance for land-war risks on cargoes awaiting shipment which was the first type of business it engaged in.  It is undertaking insurance for war risks on the hulls of Irish ships and on neutral vessels trading to Ireland.  It undertook, at a later stage, war risks upon cargoes to this country, and has recently extended its business to include marine risks where only war risks were previously undertaken.  The rates charged by the company for marine insurance business are fully competitive and conform to open market rates.</P>
    <P>It would be impossible to give, in any detail, a picture of the difficulties which arose during the year by reason of the increasing restrictions imposed by other Governments upon the export of goods.  In a very wide range of commodities, international organs of control have been established, and these international organs decide not merely the quantity of goods which we may import, but also the sources from which we may draw them.  I think it is probable that these international organs, or a number of them, will remain in existence for some time after the duration of the war.  In fact, in some quarters there have been suggestions that they may become a permanent feature in international trade. The existence of these international organs of control, and the regulations which they make concerning the acquisition of goods abroad, make it difficult, in fact, impossible for us to increase by any activity on our part the inflow of the essential commodities that we require.</P>
    <P>The House is aware that in the course of the past year our fuel difficulties became exceptionally acute.  I do not propose now to give any detailed picture of the fuel situation, because I did so in a debate only a few weeks ago, and the situation has not materially changed since then. I informed the House that certain restrictions <Col N="1171" /> had been imposed on the use of coal and electricity.  In fact, it is not by any means clear that the economies then enforced were adequate to cope with the situation.  I stated on that occasion also that representations had been made to the British with a view to securing an increase in our supplies of fuel.  I am not yet in a position to make any statement as to the result of those representations; but we all appreciate the problems which, in present circumstances, confront the British Government in the matter of fuel supplies.  I have no doubt that they will be ready to make increased supplies available as soon as the conditions governing fuel supplies become easier.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have noted some days ago in the Press an announcement that the tea ration of ¾ oz. per week per head would be reduced from July 1st to a ration of ½ oz.  The position is that we receive from the tea control organisation established by the British Government supplies of tea which are roughly equivalent to ½ oz. per head per week.  We were able to increase the ration, first of all, to one oz. per week and latterly to ¾ oz. per week, by reason of the fact that in 1941 a substantial quantity of tea, which was purchased in India by an organisation which we set up for that purpose, was imported into this country.  With the development of the war situation in the Far East, the possibility of drawing additional supplies from India ceased, and since then no quantities of tea have been imported into this country, other than the periodic amounts allowed to us by the British authorities.</P>
    <P>We have now reached a situation in which the reserve stock of tea available to us permits of the maintenance of the ¾ oz. ration for four more months in all.  There is little prospect of obtaining increased supplies by direct imports.  Subject to the maintenance of the present quota of tea from Great Britain, the situation is that, from now on until the end of the war, we can have a tea ration of ½ oz. per head per week, except in four months.  For four months during that period, no matter how long it may be, <Col N="1172" /> we can have an extra ration of a ¼ oz., making ¾ oz. in all.  I informed the Dáil earlier in the year of that situation and stated that the Government had decided to put aside that small reserve supply of tea, so as to permit of an increased ration being given during the winter months.  At the time, that decision of the Government appeared to have received the approval of the Dáil; but if the matter is to be discussed further to-day, I would like the House to know precisely what the situation is.  There is no means at our disposal by which we can maintain the present ¾ oz. ration for more than a total of four months.</P>
    <P>In the case of other beverages, we have a supply of cocoa beans which will permit of the production of cocoa, at the maximum output of which the manufacturers in this country are capable, for about eight months.  I do not want Deputies to pay any special significance to that figure, as there is a possibility of increased imports.  The point I do wish to stress is that the maximum production capacity of all the manufacturing concerns in the country does not permit of the consumption of cocoa at a greater rate than about one-fifth of a pound per household per month.  It would be obvious, therefore, that it is not possible to effect such a substantial increase in the supply of cocoa that the deficiency in the tea ration can be made good from that source.</P>
    <P>There are, however, considerable stocks of coffee.  Even at the present very much increased rate of consumption, the available supplies of coffee in the country are sufficient to last for 15 months and there is, of course, also the possibility of increased supplies being obtained, if necessary.</P>
    <P>In the case of flour, the most important of the foodstuffs, the position is reasonably secure for this year.  During the 12 months of the financial year 1943-44, we consumed 411,000 tons of wheat.  As the House will remember, there was a change in the composition of the flour on sale during that period: we went back from the 100 per cent. flour to a new extraction and decided to utilise, in the production of flour, certain quantities of barley.  If that situation remains unchanged during <Col N="1173" /> the present financial year, we will require, to meet the full needs of our people, 460,000 tons&mdash;an increase of 49,000 tons upon the actual consumption of last year.  Unfortunately, the quantity of wheat from the native crop delivered to the Irish mills in 1943, was somewhat less than in 1942, and a very substantial tonnage of wheat had to be imported to maintain the supply.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that there has been a very considerable increase in the acreage sown with wheat in this year; but what the effects of the unfavourable weather conditions will be upon the yield of the crop it is difficult to see.  We are hoping that it will result in a substantial addition to the quantity of wheat coming from home sources.  We had to import more than 150,000 tons of wheat last year.  If we could save the shipping space represented by that tonnage, we could ease the conditions of our people in many respects.  I hope, therefore, that the yield from the native crop in this year, and the proportion of that crop sold to millers, will be such as to permit of a substantial reduction in the imports of wheat, if not their entire elimination. If we get that result, we will release shipping space which can be utilised for the importation of other necessary materials; and the difficulties of our people, including the maintenance of employment, will be minimised to that extent.</P>
    <P>There have been complaints from some quarters concerning the quality of the new flour.  It took the millers in this country some time to adjust their machinery to the production of the best type of flour from the new grist.  I may say that it took the millers here a substantially shorter time to effect that adjustment than it did the millers in Great Britain, the explanation being that the millers here had the advantage of the experience of the British millers in making the change.  I think it is possible to say that the initial difficulties have now been overcome and that the millers are now producing flour of uniformly good quality.</P>
    <P>In respect of other important rationed goods, such as butter, clothing, and soap, I have nothing particular <Col N="1174" /> to say.  There has been no material alteration in the position since we discussed it last year.</P>
    <P>Since last year, we effected the second issue of ration books.  That issue was an unqualified success.  The number of people who failed to receive ration books was very much less than on the occasion of the first issue and represented an insignificant fraction of the total number of people in the country.  On this occasion, we decided to issue a special householder's folder, which will permit of the rationing of goods on a household basis, if that should become necessary or be considered desirable.  I think I should pay tribute to the work done by Hospitals Trust Limited, who undertook the writing of the books on a contract basis and who carried through their contract with remarkable efficiency.  I should also pay a tribute to the Gárdaí, to the Post Office authorities and to other Departments, all of which co-operated in the very big task of effecting that issue of ration books in accordance with the time schedule which was prepared.</P>
    <P>I would like on the occasion of the introduction of this Estimate to make special reference to matters affecting the price control policy of the Government. We have had many discussions in the Dáil on the question of price control in the past, but I never felt satisfied that the Dáil gave it the serious consideration to which it is entitled. I know that a number of Deputies made speeches criticising the Government for the rise in prices, urging that prices should be kept down, Deputies who frequently made speeches urging that higher prices should be paid for farm produce, or that wage control regulations should be removed or that the Government should intervene directly to secure an increase in wages for workers.  On many occasions since the outbreak of the emergency in bringing in the Estimate for the Department of Supplies, I have spoken at length on the importance of price control, and endeavoured to outline the policy upon which the Department was working, inviting Deputies to criticise that policy or to offer their suggestions for <Col N="1175" /> its amendment.  I never felt that the Dáil gave that co-operation that was desired.  Many Deputies who spoke on the matter confined themselves merely to expressing their wishes that prices should not be allowed to rise or criticising the Government for not having kept prices down.  Deputies, quite obviously, had not adverted to the consequences that would follow on the adoption of their suggestions, as the consequences of any change in price control policy might be very considerable both in respect of social and economic conditions as well as in our financial administration.</P>
    <P>The causes of the rise in prices are well known to Deputies.  First of all, there is the increased cost of imports of the very essential goods that we purchase abroad, and that have to be obtained at whatever price they can be purchased at.  As they are not under our control, the only alternative is to take the goods at the price at which we can get them, or not to take them at all.  The second of the causes is the rise in prices paid for agricultural products.  The prices of agricultural products have been regulated, in so far as the Government interfered with them at all, with direct advertence to the possible effect on the maintenance or the increase of agricultural output, and only in a secondary way with regard to the very definite effect upon price control policy.  The third cause is the increased cost of production of manufactured goods, due to increased manufacturing costs, both absolute and relative to the decline of the volume of turnover; and the fourth is the increased cost of distribution, due to the higher costs operating in the distributive trades, and the reduced volume of goods being distributed.  Of these two factors the first, the cost of imports and the prices paid for agricultural products is by far the more important. Any system of price control represents an effort to replace the automatic mechanism of price balance which operates in normal times by artificial measures and expedients. That automatic mechanism is very easily disrupted, and was decisively disrupted at the outbreak of the war.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1176" /> That normal price balance, perfect or imperfect as it may be, results from every factor in our economy, including the volumes of imports, exports, production, wages, profit levels, the distribution system, conditions in foreign markets, conditions in the home market, the extent to which production or distribution is influenced by existing monopolies, by the development of competition, by a thousand and one factors, including the monetary medium, in which the total price structure forms itself with the usual manifold complexities of that medium.</P>
    <P>It follows from what I said that artificial measures or expedients adopted in the system of price control will be effective or ineffective according as they take account of all or only some of the factors to which I referred. Viewed in that light, a system of price control which is only partial control operating in place of normal price balance which, even before the outbreak of war, was for many economic and social reasons imperfect, cannot be relied upon to provide an infallible and equitable price structure.  At best it can only operate to prevent gross excesses and inequalities.  The Dáil, no doubt, will urge that we should do more than we have attempted to do. Deputies, in my opinion, have urged that before taking into full account all the consequences of a more stringent system.  To do more than we are attempting would require not only price control in the case of every single commodity and service, but a reorganisation of our whole economy, of which the price structure is merely one element of many, and the monetary system in which it is constructed, another element.  The system of price control now in force cannot be effective to bring about results for which so comprehensive an undertaking would be necessary.</P>
    <P>It may be conceded, as many Deputies contended from time to time, that the system could be applied more rigidly.  We could do that if we altogether abandoned democratic methods and practice, and operated by completely autocratic methods, by steam-rolling opposition, liquidating those who were unwilling to co-operate, <Col N="1177" /> and having resourse to unlimited bureaucratic machinery.  By these means and methods the price control system we have adopted might be made more efficient, and even more equitable from the point of view of immediate results.  If we have decided not to adopt these means. we have done so deliberately, and the shortcomings of the present method of control must be regarded as the cost of that choice.  Apart altogether from the question of more stringent application of the system of price control which we consider suitable to our circumstances, there have been suggestions put forward by Deputies that a more comprehensive system should be adopted, that we should change the present system of price control for another, but these contentions have never been followed up by an attempt on the part of the Deputies concerned to illustrate the consequences that would follow from the adoption of their suggestions.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of the war, I informed the Dáil of the decisions which the Government had taken in the matter of price control, and I asked the Dáil whether or not it agreed with those decisions.  So far as possible, I endeavoured to secure that the Government would be proceeding in accordance with a policy that was agreed upon by all sections, but I have never yet been able to get from any other Party a clear indication as to whether they had approved or disapproved of the decisions the Government then took.  On that occasion, the Government had two courses open to it.  It could have decided that the essential consideration was the keeping of prices at the lowest possible level, and it could have made arrangements to secure that result irrespective of the consequences on the employment of workers or the social conditions in the country generally.  In respect of a wide range of goods, we could, even now, effect a substantial reduction in prevailing prices&mdash;but at the cost of putting a very large number of people out of employment and of closing down a number of manufacturing concerns which are surplus to our present manufacturing requirements.  However, I <Col N="1178" /> told the Dáil at the time that the Government had decided that the maintenance of employment and of the social conditions in the country generally was more important than merely having the lowest possible level of prices.  I asked the Dáil if it agreed with that decision, and so far as any indication at all was given of the attitude of the various Parties, it seemed to me that they did agree.  Yet, on many occasions since, Deputies have criticised the rise in prices, and have blamed the Government for that rise in prices without adverting to the fact that they had voluntarily acquiesced in a policy which was designed to permit prices to rise rather than put people out of employment.</P>
    <P>We have now reached a stage at which we have got to reconsider that general policy.  We have got to decide whether the upward pressure of prices should be allowed to continue unabated or whether there is not a limit beyond which prices must not be allowed to go.  That question has been forced upon our attention by developments which have occurred in the course of the past couple of months&mdash;the extremely critical situation which has arisen in regard to the shortage of fuel supplies and the resulting imminence of a further serious decline in the volume of production and in the volume of turnover in the distributive trades, with the possibility of a rise in manufacturing and distributing costs.  Before considering that question, the Dáil should bear in mind that it touches every section of the community and that the conditions which force it upon us&mdash;the upward pressure on already high price levels&mdash;are strongly marked with the symptoms of that economic plague which is called inflation.</P>
    <P>When inflation sets in, nobody is immune from its consequences, least of all the workers and the fixed-income classes.  The accumulated profits of the past and the savings of all sections of the community are swept away.  Its aftermath is collapse of values, unemployment, social chaos and economic inertia which may destroy all prospects of future progress.  If inflation deals out any justice at all, it is that, in its <Col N="1179" /> passing, it sweeps away the profits accumulated by those individuals and business concerns who benefit temporarily by it, who pursue their own selfish ends and set out as deliberate carriers of the plague.  Nobody should have any illusions about the urgency of this question for every one of us.  I do not know if it is agreed that any further rise in the price-level must be prevented even at the cost of disimproving economic and social conditions for many sections of our people.  I do not know if it is agreed that there is a limit beyond which prices must not be allowed to go and that we are now perilously close to that limit.  I do not know if it is agreed that not only must excessive profits be eliminated but that the maintenance of reasonable profits can no longer be permitted at the cost of continually higher prices during the acute phase of the crisis which looms ahead of us.</P>
    <P>Recently, the Government announced the making of a standstill Order.  That Order attempted to fix the prices of all classes of goods and services at the levels which prevailed in May last. That Order was, apparently, welcomed by the Press and by the various political sections of our people.  Many of the Press commentators expressed the view that the Order had been made too late.  It was quite apparent that they had not recognised that the making of that Order represented a change in policy&mdash;a change in policy the significance of which the Dáil is now asked to consider.  The Government did not make that Order with the intention of effecting a change in permanent policy. It is hoped that the exceptionally difficult economic conditions which arose from the fuel scarcity will pass. Ordinarily, the Government would have contemplated the repeal of that standstill Order and reversion to the original system of price control if such should happen.  The welcome given to the standstill Order appears, however, to indicate that the Press and public would prefer, as a permanent arrangement, the system of price control which it visualises&mdash;one which ensures that there will be no increase in prices no matter what the consequences <Col N="1180" /> may be to individuals; one which involves that, if we cannot obtain abroad goods which can be sold at the prices at which they were sold previously, we shall do without those goods; one which involves that, if any factory cannot continue to manufacture and sell goods except at a loss, then that factory may close; one which involves that if any employer finds that he can work to those prices only by disemploying a considerable number of his workers, that disemployment will be allowed to happen.  We consider that it is possible to maintain that policy without serious economic or social consequences for a temporary period, but if it is to be continued as a permanent policy, which would appear to be the wish expressed in the newspapers by those who commented upon it, we want that to be determined with full knowledge of what the consequences will be.</P>
    <P>In the view of the Government, if this fuel crisis should prove to be only temporary, it would be the wiser course to place maintenance of employment and social conditions generally in priority to the maintenance of a low price-level.  If, however, the Dáil is of opinion that we should make the restriction of prices and the avoidance of further increases in price the predominant consideration, I want it to take that decision with its eyes open.  I think, however, there will be no disagreement upon the desirability of maintaining the policy represented in that standstill Order as a temporary measure during this temporary crisis &mdash;I hope, at any rate, the crisis will be temporary.  The need for the Order during that period will not be mistaken and the degree of co-operation and, if necessary, of sacrifice which it calls for from every member of the community, whether he is a trader in a big way or in a small way, will equally be clear.</P>
    <P>The greatest difficulty in any system of total price control under a democratic system of Government is the difficulty of enforcement, of securing universal compliance with the regulations, and of preventing evasion through unavoidable loopholes and the tricks of interpretation that make use <Col N="1181" /> of the maze of complexities in modern trade and commence.  To pursue that maze through all its intricacies is a drafting and administrative impossibility. And yet that difficulty is the easiest to overcome, granted only one condition, and that condition is that there should be good will and co-operation amongst all legitimate traders and business men; that they should act in accordance with the intention unmistakably behind the regulations and that they should join with the general public in bringing the moral force of their actions and opinions to bear upon those amongst them who seek to profit out of the distress of the times. Granted that condition, self-interest alone&mdash;putting it on no higher level&mdash; requires that inflation should be avoided at all costs.  There is no reason why a wide measure of success should not be accomplished by the present effort to limit the upward movement of prices before present conditions force it to develop further, because that is the aim of the present prices standstill Order.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter affecting price control to which I would like to refer.  In limiting the profit-making activities of manufacturing and trading companies, there were two possible courses which the Government could adopt.  We adopted one at the beginning of the war and subsequently changed to the other.  At the beginning we endeavoured to limit the profits earned by manufacturing concerns by reference to the capital employed in their businesses.</P>
    <P>The effect of limiting the profits of manufacturing concerns by reference to the capital employed meant that the profit taken on individual articles produced was not controlled and within the limit of profit laid down a company could still continue to operate&mdash;and operate profitably&mdash;even if the output was reduced considerably.  There was in that system no particular inducement to the individual manufacturer to increase or even to maintain his output, because the total profit he was permitted to earn was related to the capital invested and not to the output.</P>
    <P>We decided at a later stage that it was desirable to change the system of <Col N="1182" /> control so as to sanction a prescribed margin of profit upon production costs.  That system of control encouraged output.  It permitted the individual manufacturer to make an increased profit if, and only if, he increased his output, and it was considered that was a more desirable method because it had the effect of stimulating the efforts of manufacturers to obtain additional supplies of material, to overcome the emergency production difficulties and keep up the output and, consequently, employment in all their concerns.  That system of control did not operate to limit the total profit which a manufacturer could earn.  The profit fluctuated with the output of the concern, and the more successful manufacturer, the individual who succeeded in overcoming production and supply difficulties, could make more than his less enterprising colleague.</P>
    <P>Over and above both systems of control operated the excess profits tax. That tax is limited to pre-war profit standards.  Where a concern makes a profit over and above the standard profit, it is liable to a very heavy rate of tax.  The enactment, however, which imposed that tax contains one clause which is having an effect somewhat different from what was intended. Deputies will remember that in the early stages of the war it was urged by Deputy Dillon and other Deputies that traders and others should be permitted to accumulate certain reserves during a period of rising prices, when such accumulation would be possible, to enable them to meet the period of difficulty which will develop after the war when prices will fall.  I intimated that the Government were not prepared to agree to that course, expecting to be able to assist traders and manufacturers in the difficulties of the post-war period by <i>ad hoc</i> measures taken then.</P>
    <P>The Finance Act, which imposed the excess profits taxes, permitted a certain amount to be held to the credit of a concern, so that if, after the war, that firm operated at a loss, some repayment would be possible to offset that loss.  Certain manufacturers have seen the possibilities of that device. <Col N="1183" /> They realise that if they earn excessive profits and pay them to the Exchequer, they are putting themselves in the position in which they will have some competitive advantages over other firms in the same business after the war, visualising a situation in which they may sell goods in a competitive market at a loss and recover that loss from the Exchequer and thus re-establish themselves in the post-war market.  We have given consideration to that device and, while it is obvious that the provisions of the Finance Act cannot be altered in that respect without a breach of contract, we have decided that it is desirable to consider the possibility of enacting legislation which will secure the complete surrender to the Exchequer of all profits earned by any concern, whether manufacturing or trading, over and above what are deemed to be reasonable profits.</P>
    <P>That idea will, no doubt, commend itself in theory to Deputies, but in practice it means giving to the Minister for Supplies, or some other Minister, rather drastic powers, because the determination of what is a reasonable profit for any undertaking will have to be a responsibility of his, a responsibility which he will arbitrarily execute in an arrangement in which his decision will not be open to question.  If the Dáil is prepared to contemplate the giving of these powers to any Minister &mdash;powers to determine what is a reasonable profit under any circumstances for any concern; powers to require the surrender to the Exchequer of any profit over and above a reasonable profit&mdash;then I think we would not merely make our system of control more effective, but we would take a very effective step in reversing the inflationary tendencies now evident.</P>

      <P>I am emphasising this device which is commendable in theory but which offers, in practice, many objectionable features.  I am bringing it to the attention of the Dáil, because I would like an expression of opinion from the Dáil as to whether it would contemplate giving powers of that kind.  A defect in the present system of controlling the profits of manufacturers is that it is capable of being operated only in retrospect.  We may determine that a particular manufacturer is entitled to earn a stated profit and no more than that.  We may require him so to fix the prices of the commodities he produces and sells as to ensure that he will earn only the pre-determined profit.  We cannot at any time say that the manufacturer is maintaining his undertaking in that regard and adhering to the directions given to him by the Department of Supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister asking for an answer to that question to-day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to have an expression of opinion from the Dáil on the general issue of price control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>We would like to have a little more information on the matter that the Minister has mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to give that now.  I emphasise that the difficulty of enforcing the control of profits of manufacturers is that it can only be done after the event.  It is only when the annual accounts of the concern have been made up and audited that we can, in fact, ascertain whether the <Col N="1185" /> directions given to the manufacturer or the undertaking he entered into have been observed.</P>
      <P>At that stage we can under our present system require the manufacturer to put back any excess profit which he earned in the previous year so as to maintain prices at a lower level in the succeeding year than would otherwise be necessary, but even that does not work satisfactorily, because again it will be only at the end of the second year that it will be possible to determine absolutely whether the directions of the Department were carried out and there are, no doubt, some manufacturers who year after year will continue to earn profits in excess of those considered reasonable, in the expectation that at some stage the war will end, that all these emergency controls will disappear and that they will get away with something in the &ldquo;kitty.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is quite clear, therefore, that if we are going to impose a more rigid control it will be necessary to have some device by which excessive profits earned cannot under any circumstances accrue to the benefit of the firm concerned but will be absorbed for the benefit of the community as a whole. I think it will be obvious that if we had such a system the prospect of excessive profits being earned would be considerably reduced.</P>
      <P>It is true that a manufacturer may find it difficult so to adjust his prices as to earn the predetermined profit and no more than that.  He cannot tell exactly, until the end of his financial year whether his trading results worked out as he anticipated, but if the likelihood is that anything earned over and above the predetermined profit will be acquired 100 per cent. by the Exchequer then the tendency will always be to err upon the other side, whereas at the present time the tendency is always to err against the members of the public.  That is inevitable in the present system of price control.</P>

      <P>No.  It will be used for <Col N="1186" /> whatever purpose may be decided.  All moneys accruing to the Government, as the Deputy knows, must be paid into the Central Fund.  It is not intended to earmark it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was wondering whether the scheme suggested by the Minister was going to work hand in hand with a price subsidisation policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A policy of price subsidisation is practicable only in respect of a very limited range of commodities. There is a very large number of commodities which could not be subsidised by any practicable means.  However, I make this special reference to the price control activities of the Department of Supplies because I think the Dáil has never given serious consideration to the issues of policy that arise there; they have confined themselves in the past to criticism of the results of the system operated by the Government and the various efforts which have been made on previous occasions to point out the serious economic and social consequences that might follow from any other system of price control have not produced the results I anticipated in the ensuing debate.</P>
      <P>On this occasion I think the Dáil, aware of the fact that there has recently been a change in policy, a change represented by the standstill Order made in the last few weeks, should give more special attention to that branch of the Department's activities. I am not asking them to ignore the other activities of the Department, all of which are of very vital importance to the country but, in so far as they have all been discussed on many occasions in the past, some of them only quite recently, I think on this occasion it may be possible to have more attention devoted to the one aspect of the Department's activities which has been less frequently discussed on previous occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he would like to have the opinion of the House to-day as to whether a Department such as the Department of Supplies might, with regard to every firm, assess their profits and over a particular standard take, by way of taxation, all the profits that were <Col N="1187" /> shown.  The Minister may expect a discussion in the House to-day on price control and complain that there has not been any talk about it up to the present, but in fact it has been very difficult in the past for the House to understand how prices have been controlled.  I want to say on the point the Minister raised that nobody who has any contact with the business world, and who realises the difficulties they have in understanding the way in which prices have been controlled up to the present, would be in a position to say that they were prepared to give any Department of State at the present moment power to declare what were profits for the purpose of having profits over a particular level taken by way of taxation. Before the Minister threw such a suggestion into the debate we ought to have had more information with regard to his experience of the various ways in which he has attempted to control prices.  I think he ought to have been in a position to tell the House that he has had discussions with the various organised bodies of the commercial and manufacturing community here and should have given us an opportunity of hearing what subjects have been discussed and what viewpoints have been expressed there. It is very difficult to treat the question the Minister put to the House to-day seriously in the way he has put it.  If it is put up as a definite question then I want to say that, from my experience of the general situation, at any rate, I would not contemplate giving authority to any particular Department to assess what profits are for the purpose of taking all profits above a particular level by way of taxation.  We are prepared in every possible way to assist the Government in seeing, in the first place, that prices of various commodities are kept down to the lowest possible level consistent with the effective carrying on of business and the making of reasonable profits and in seeing that exaggerated profits are not taken or, if they are taken, that the taxation or any change of taxation that the Minister or the Government may determine will be imposed, but with due regard for <Col N="1188" /> what has been already submitted in the past, namely that profits may be made to-day and may be taken in taxation to-day which may be required for putting back into the business to-morrow.  But it is difficult to take the Minister's question to the House very seriously.  We are prepared to take it seriously if it is put up in a reasonable and serious way and with all the information that we think the House should have, that is, with a certain amount of statistical material behind it and a certain amount of information regarding the communications and exchanges of conversation that have gone on between the Minister and the various organised industrial or commercial bodies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is in the affirmative.  Before the recent restrictions on the manufacture of cement, due to difficulties in the coal and electricity supply position, the production of cement was about 180,000 tons per <Col N="1195" /> annum and was distributed freely through the recognised trade channels.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I informed the Dáil that we had ceased the production of cement in this month to save the electricity involved.  The intention is that the production of cement will be resumed next month.  To what extent it will be possible to resume has, however, still to be decided, but cement production will be resumed.  I think, however, that it may be taken for granted that, for some time to come, cement will be available only for important purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Fogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that there has been a campaign for non-payment of rates in County Dublin; and whether he is satisfied with the steps taken generally by the Commissioner for the Dublin County Council to ensure that ratepayers meet their due obligations, and, in particular, his recent action in enforcing the sale of a farm because of the continued failure of the owner to meet these obligations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that an organised campaign to withhold payment of rates existed in County Dublin and that since the appointment of the commissioner for the county council the collection of rates in the county has vastly improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The manner in which these rates are collected is one entirely for the local authority and I am sure that in carrying out his duties in this respect the commissioner gives due consideration to the circumstances of defaulting ratepayers.  Where, however, a ratepayer has failed to pay rates for a considerable number of years, I do not see that he should get special treatment as, by such default, additional burdens are placed on the general body of ratepayers who have met their obligations.  Where the commissioner finds it necessary to resort to the extreme course of recovering rates through the sale of property of defaulting ratepayers, he should have the full support and co-operation of the community in the adoption of this course.  It is the commissioner's bounden duty to collect the public rates.  For this purpose the law gives him power to distrain and enforce the sale of property and if, by organised action, these powers were to be circumvented and rendered ineffective, the results would be highly detrimental to the maintenance of the public services. I have, therefore, every commendation for a purchaser who has sufficient public spirit to acquire a <Col N="1198" /> holding which has been offered for sale because of the non-payment of rates and who is prepared to devote the holding to proper uses and meet the public charges assessed thereon.  I am sure the general body of ratepayers will share these views.</P>

      <P>This matter has been raised on several occasions recently, and I would refer the Deputy to the terms of the reply I gave to a question on the 2nd March last.  There is no evidence in my Department that accidents are happening daily which could be attributed to the slipperiness of the road surfaces.  Experience has shown that many horses used on roads are incorrectly shod. The Department of Agriculture issued a revised memorandum on this matter towards the end of last year, and I am arranging to send the Deputy a copy of it.</P>
      <P>The development of non-slippery economical road surfaces is constantly in the mind of road engineers, and although every new suggestion is carefully examined no definite progress has been made.  The surfaces of roads suitable for modern traffic are hard and smooth and, except in the case of very expensive surfaces, they become slippery in use.  The present surfaces of most of the main roads have been provided at considerable cost and they were not developed solely for the motorist.  They are dust-free, waterproof and of reasonable life&mdash;important factors in the life and economy of the community.  It is sometimes overlooked that the improvement in road surfaces has made haulage easier.  Less tractive effort is required and consequently horses that are properly shod can do more work for the same expenditure of energy than they did formerly on the more uneven, rougher roads.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will cause inquiries to be made into the delay in paying national health <Col N="1202" /> benefits to John Clarke, of 24 Lower Mountpleasant Avenue, Dublin, formerly employed as fitter in Maguire and Gatchell's, Dublin, and later at Harland and Wolff's, Belfast (National Health Card Number in Dublin, 55062, and 171105 in Blackpool).</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>John Clarke was formerly a member of the National Health Insurance Society.  He took up residence and employment in Belfast in January, 1942.  Under the reciprocal arrangements with Great Britain and Northern Ireland the insurance of a member of the National Health Insurance Society who takes up insurable employment in Great Britain or Northern Ireland must be transferred to the insurance fund in operation where he has taken up residence after the lapse of the third half-year of his new employment, if before that time he has not himself joined a British or Northern Irish society.  In Clarke's case the third half-year expired in July, 1943, and his insurance was transferred to Northern Ireland at that date, when he was established as a member of the Deposit Contributors' Fund Northern Ireland, which then became liable for any claim for benefit.</P>
      <P>He returned to Dublin in December, 1943, and claimed sickness benefit from the National Health Insurance Society. His claim and medical certificates were forwarded to the Ministry of Labour, Northern Ireland.  On inquiry as to why benefit was not paid, the Ministry of Labour has replied that under the National Health Insurance Acts in force in Northern Ireland, benefit is not payable to John Clarke while he is resident outside the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>He cannot again become a member of the National Health Insurance Society unless and until he takes up insurable employment in Éire.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice (a) whether he is aware of the exceptionally heavy burden which the <Col N="1206" /> Land Registration Fee Order, 1944, will place upon the solicitors' profession, and that the substantial increase of fees prescribed is regarded as a tax upon the registered owners of land, which will have the effect of compelling land owners on the grounds of the expense involved to avoid the maintenance of proper titles; (b) whether he will give his reasons for the new scale of fees, which represents increases varying from 300 per cent. to 700 per cent. as compared with the scale under the 1937 Order, S.R. &amp; O., 1937, No. 292; and (c) whether he will state if the Rules Committee of the Incorporated Law Society was consulted before the Order was made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland) Gerald Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Local Registration of Title Act, 1891, contemplates that the Land Registry fees shall be fixed so as to produce an annual sum not exceeding the total expenses of maintaining the Registry.  On a recent review of the position it was found that the annual expenses amounted to over £40,000, while the annual revenue from fees was under £20,000.  It was also found that the Fees Order then in operation not only failed to produce an adequate revenue but that it was not sufficiently detailed and precise, with the result that a good deal of time was wasted in many cases in settling the amounts to be paid in fees.  The new Fees Order was made in order to correct these defects.  At the same time, the staffing of the Registry was improved, at considerable cost, in order to ensure a better service.  The suggestion that the fees, as increased, impose an undue burden is, I think, unfounded.  The total revenue expected under the Order is equivalent to what would be realised by charging each registered owner a commuted fee of £1 once in about every ten years as the sole charge for registering his title, issuing his land certificate, recording his various transactions with the land and supplying him with copies of the folio. That can hardly be considered an excessive charge.  With reference to part (a) of the question, the Order does not impose any burden on the solicitors' profession.  With reference to the percentages mentioned in part (b), the average percentage of increase intended <Col N="1207" /> is about 100 per cent.  Increases beyond that figure in any particular items are offset by equivalent concessions in other items: such variations have been deliberately made in order to adjust the charges as equitably as possible between the various classes of transactions.  With reference to part (c), I do not think that there is any such committee in existence.  The other points in the question are, I think, covered by what I have already said.  I may add, however, that the position will be reviewed after the Order has been in force for a period which will enable its actual effects to be accurately observed.  If it is then found that the fees actually received give a surplus over expenditure the necessary adjustment will be made. Any definite suggestion for altering the incidence of the fees, as between the various classes of transactions, will also receive careful consideration.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister not agree that the fees in an ordinary case for the discharge of equities formerly ran from 6/- on a £50 case to £6 on a £3,000 case, while under the new Order the corresponding fees would run from £1 to £13 10s. 0d.?  That shows that there is an increase of more than 100 per cent.  Is the Minister aware that in a case which occurred recently the fee for transmission on death of a registered owner intestate was £12 6s. 0d. against a former fee of £3; that the fee for transfer by a person to whom the title was transmitted to a third party was also £12 6s. 0d. as against a former fee of £3; and that on an application to discharge equities the present fee is £13 10s. 0d. as against a former fee of 19/6?

      <P>I should like to remind the Minister that the rate of fees suggested in the question are not in any way exaggerated.  In fact, I think Deputy Coogan has understated the case.  I think the best way to indicate the manner in which the fees have been increased is to compare the fees in the Land Registry with the fees in the <Col N="1208" /> Registry of Deeds.  A deed was registered in the Registry of Deeds for 17/6, and on the new scale the same deed in the Land Registry would cost £30 for registration.  I would suggest to the Minister that if the Land Registry cannot be run without charging these exorbitant fees, he might consider introducing legislation to transfer the registration of all titles to the Registry of Deeds, and close up the Land Registry altogether.</P>

      <P>The Minister's reply is reasonable and acceptable, so far as the first two conditions are concerned. The third condition, that the soldier returns to his unit at the expiration of his off-duty hours, is the condition which is impossible.  Usually the soldiers are in charge of a corporal or sergeant, and they leave the farm in the charge of the corporal or sergeant. I think that ought to satisfy the Minister and that he should not hold the person for whom they work responsible for seeing that they return to barracks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister devoted the greater part of his speech in introducing this Estimate to what he termed price control, and it was no <Col N="1215" /> doubt a very important and a very interesting speech in so far as it dealt with that particular matter.  At the outset of that portion of his speech some of us thought that we were going to get a clear and explicit statement from the Minister of the Government's intentions with regard to price control for the future.  We know from experience that the Minister, when he desires, can be as clear and as lucid and as incisive as any member of this House, but it appeared to me that he went out of his way to be confusing. The first part of his speech, dealing with price control, with inflation and so on, he sought apparently completely to smother with the line which he took in the second part of his speech.  The Minister, I think, wanted to convey to the House and to the country that it is beyond the wit of man to get machinery to control prices.  Nobody believes that.  Prices have been controlled in other countries, very successfully controlled, and the Minister knows that quite well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister sought, again in his inimitable way, to put the blame for anything that might have happened with regard to soaring prices not on the Government or on himself or on his Department but on the other Parties in the House, and, with that way of his, when it suits him, of completely ignoring anything and everything which has been said in this House on the particular subject, he said: &ldquo;We have not yet been able to get in this House from any of the other Parties their ideas or their views on this question of price control.&rdquo; Now if there was anything which the other Parties in this House made clear to the Government over the last four and a half years, it was their views with regard to price control.  The Minister said: &ldquo;I do not know whether we can now get agreement on such-and-such a course&rdquo;, but he did not tell us of any clear-cut decision taken by the Government.  He talked about a new policy with regard to price control, but he did not indicate to the House what exactly that new policy is, or what is the machinery set up by his Department to give effect to what he called the new policy.  He did not indicate <Col N="1216" /> whether the Government has at long last realised that it was inequitable, to say the least of it, that they should take very effective and very efficient steps completely to control wages and salaries while at the same time taking no effective steps to control in any way the rise in prices.  In the whole course of his speech the Minister gave no indication as to what his Department proposes to do now.  He admitted that the matter had become a national danger; that prices had risen so steeply that they could no longer be ignored either by his Department or by the Government itself; that it was absolutely necessary in the national interest that there should be a complete departure from the policy pursued in connection with this matter for the past four and a half years.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about the dangers of inflation.  He talked about the sacrifices which would have to be made by certain classes of people if a new policy with regard to the control of prices were engaged in.  Is not the Minister aware of the sacrifices that have been made by nearly all sections of the community in this country as a result of the policy which was pursued by the Government over the last four and a half years?  Does not the Minister know the sacrifices that have had to be made by people whose wages were pegged down in some cases to the absolute pre-war level, without even an emergency bonus to meet the 80 per cent. or 90 per cent. increase in the cost of living?  Does not the Minister know that it has been practically impossible for the fathers or mothers of working-class families to purchase boots or shoes or clothes for their children or for themselves?  Does not the Minister know that, in the case of workingmen's shirts, which could be bought pre-war for 5/-, an inferior article is to-day costing 25/-?  Does not the Minister know that children's shoes and boots, which pre-war would probably last six to 12 months, will not now last six to 12 weeks?  Does not the Minister know that a suit of clothes which could be bought, hand-tailored, for six guineas a few years ago, now costs, for an inferior cloth&mdash;and we are not dealing with imported goods&mdash;<Col N="1217" /> anything from 12 to 15 guineas?  Does not the Minister know that it is almost impossible for a working-class family on a weekly wage of anything from 35/- to £3 a week to purchase those things?  Is not the House aware that, as a result of the cost of living being allowed to rise almost unchecked, we have had that position for the last four years?  That is one of the reasons why the Minister's standstill Order with regard to prices was so acceptable to all classes of the community.  I think the Minister will find that even a great number of people engaged in business, particularly those engaged in the distribution end of the business, will welcome that Order.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the latter part of the Minister's speech, where he sought to get the approval or the views of the House on a Bill dealing with excess profits which the Government are thinking of introducing.  It seems that the Minister's mind is the mind of the Government.  If we are going to get the type of legislation foreshadowed in the Finance Bill, and if all the excess profits are to be collared by the Minister for Finance and put into the Exchequer, then I imagine that Minister will be rather inclined to welcome excess profits.  The greater they are the bigger will be the windfall for the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I want to go back to the question of the consumption of wheat which, I understood the Minister to say, was 411,000 tons over last year.  Will the Minister say if that figure represents the production of the flour mills, or whether it includes the amount of grain which the farmer got ground himself?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That figure represents the amount of wheat that went to the flour mills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Merely the amount of wheat milled by the flour mills.  I take it that the Minister is not in a position to give even an approximate figure of the quantity of wheat which farmers got ground themselves. The Minister, in the course of his speech, did not deal with the sugar situation.  I am rather interested in <Col N="1218" /> getting some information from him on that.  We know that last year we had a record production of beet.  In spite of that, the Department is rationing sugar in a very rigid way. Not only is it doing that, but it is depriving certain classes of business, such as confectionery, catering and ice-cream production of their permits altogether.  If there is a great scarcity of sugar, will the Minister give the House figures showing the production of sugar in all the factories, as well as the consumption of sugar on the present rationing basis, to indicate whether there is a surplus on present production or not.  I would like to know whether all the sugar produced is being consumed in the country, or whether there is anything in the rumour which is circulating, particularly in the south of Ireland, that a very considerable quantity of it is being exported, either in the raw state or as an addition to a commodity which we export.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister considers it wise to do so, he might also tell us whether there is any truth in the rumour, current over the last week-end, that further travel restrictions are contemplated, and that an Order is to be made whereby people who want to travel will have to go to the Gárda station and show cause.  That, I understand, is due to the coal situation, not only to the quantity but to the quality of the coal available.  I ask the Minister to deal with that because rumours of the kind do a certain amount of harm and can cause a certain amount of congestion on the limited transport facilities at present available.  If people think that further restrictions are going to be imposed, they may try to anticipate them, with the result that you will have overloaded and, consequently, late trains. There are many other points that I might deal with, but I do not intend to do so.  It is not my desire to take up the time of the House, especially in view of the fact that many Deputies will desire to speak on this Estimate.  In conclusion, I would ask the Minister to deal with the point that I have raised about sugar.  A great many people seem to think that a full supply <Col N="1219" /> of sugar should be available for our own people, especially having regard to the fact that last year's production of sugar was a record one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>We all agree that the position, so far as the materials that we have to import are concerned, is a difficult one, and is bound to remain so as long as the war lasts.  As regards the supplies that we are getting in, I suggest to the Minister that they should be used in the best interests of the people, mainly for the carrying on of business and the keeping in employment of those who are engaged in those businesses or industries.  I want to deal now with the supplies of petrol.  A few evenings ago a deputation of men who have been engaged in turf-cutting since March last, waited on me, and asked if something could not be done to provide transport for the 500 or 600 tons of turf which they have cut and ricked on the roadside. So far they have failed to get lorries to take it away.  At a meeting of the county council yesterday a proposition was made that, through the Minister, the Great Southern Railways Company should be asked to put lorries at the disposal of private producers of turf so that the turf might be conveyed away from the bogs.  In many cases those private turf producers have been working since March last, but, for the reasons I have indicated, they have not, so far, been able to dispose of the turf.  Many of them are small working farmers, and at the moment their labours have not brought them in as much as a shilling.  I would be glad if the Minister could do something to place lorries at their disposal or, in cases where lorries are available in their localities, give an increased allocation of petrol so that this turf may be disposed of.  If those increased supplies of petrol were made available for a month or so, it should be possible for those men to dispose of the quantities of turf they have cut. As a matter of fact, I have here an order from a merchant in Dungarvan saying that he is prepared to take delivery of 500 or 600 tons of turf, and quoting a price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also want to ask the Minister <Col N="1220" /> whether he can give increased supplies of oil to those engaged in the dairy business.  I was told in the Department of Supplies that they cannot increase the present allocation.  The position is becoming very difficult for people who have large herds.  Deputies are aware that, for various reasons, it is difficult at the present time to get people to milk cows.  I fear that, if a small increased allocation of oil is not made available, many of those people will be forced out of production. A situation of that kind would have very serious effects in many directions. Due to the curtailment of supplies, it may be difficult for the Minister to do very much, but if there is any hope of an improvement in the position I hope that he will do his best to meet the demands of the people I speak for.</P>
    <P>Another matter that I want to bring to the Minister's notice concerns the supply of oil for harvesting.  For some years past we have experienced difficulty in getting permits.  I have already explained the position to the officials of the Department in Ballsbridge.  My suggestion to the Minister is that any owner operating machinery during the harvest period should have in stock at least a week's supply of oil&mdash;100 or over 100 gallons.  I make that suggestion for this reason: that between the date on which an owner applies to the Department for a further permit and the granting of it a certain period of time will elapse.  When the permission comes from the Department the owner has then to make a further application to the oil depôt for his supply.  The oil depôts will not send out the oil, as they are also curtailed.  I would ask the Minister, therefore, not to confine a man to a very low supply.  He should have at least 100 gallons in stock for every tractor and even more, if there was any danger in regard to the supply from the depôt.  That is a very important matter, as I know of occasions where machines were held up in the threshing period through running out of supplies of oil.</P>
    <P>I do not know if lubricating oil comes within the scope of the Minister's Department. Many tractor owners experience <Col N="1221" /> great difficulty in getting supplies at present.  I do not know if there are any laws or regulations governing the supply, but I should like the Minister to tell me the best steps that tractor owners might take to obtain adequate supplies.</P>
    <P>In regard to heavy nailed boots for farmers and county council workers, that matter does not demand much attention at present, on account of the fine weather; but there is no harm in drawing the Minister's attention to it in good time, so that by the end of the harvest, he will have gone into the matter and have arranged a supply of heavy farm boots, especially for field work during the winter months.</P>
    <P>As regards coal, on three or four occasions, I have asked several Departments about coal for blacksmiths.  The supply for the month of June has been cut out completely in many cases. Blacksmiths require more coal at the moment, as there is more road work for horses and cars than for years past.  I have complaints from 10 or 11 blacksmiths at present, that they cannot get coal for the banding of wheels.  Even yesterday morning, a blacksmith came to me and said he could not carry on. The Minister will agree that creamery work and other such business must be carried on and that that cannot be done except by hauling milk to the creameries in ordinary carts.  Particularly in dry weather, the bands become loose; so the Minister should try to make arrangements for a further increase of coal for blacksmiths for that particular work.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to culm for lime kilns does not arise at present, but there is no harm in raising it now, as in a month or six weeks' time, those concerned will be starting to burn for the winter months.  I would ask the Minister to do his best to meet the needs of the people on the lime question. We know that the lack of fertilisers has resulted in lime being very much used in recent years.  The Department should, as far as possible, meet the requirements of those engaged in the burning of lime, by making as much culm available as possible, so as to keep up production without a break.  It is a well-known fact that, if a kiln is <Col N="1222" /> left idle for a short period, certain heat goes out of it and it costs much more to burn the lime than if continuous heat is kept in the kiln.  Therefore, a reasonable amount of culm should be made available to keep the kilns in production when they start.</P>
    <P>Quite recently, I raised the question of an increased butter supply and asked the Minister for Agriculture on a few occasions to impose again a ban on the use of cream for anything other than the production of butter.  Many people are grumbling continuously, as they find the butter ration insufficient, particularly where men are coming in to work and where workers are going out on county council work.  Those people consider that the ration of butter at present is insufficient to meet their ordinary food demands.  I would suggest&mdash;and I suggested it before to the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;that the ban be placed again on cream and also that the Minister for Supplies, or whoever is responsible, control the home production of butter.  In many cases, we know that privileged people, who have the wherewithal to purchase farmers' butter, have been getting two rations.  That is very unfair to the ordinary worker and to employers who are keeping men on, so as to have them for the harvest.  It is hard to get them to bring their ration to the farmer's houses.  Some people are in a privileged position, with double their ration, while others have only half enough.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>In conclusion, I hope the Minister will see his way to increase the allowance of sugar in the harvest period.  Last year, I raised that point in the House and the Minister thought then that there would be a lot of Departmental work in increasing the ration during the harvest time.  The individual farmer or beet grower may have a varying amount of acres and I suggest that the allowance be made to growers on an acreage basis so that they would all get a fair crack of the whip.  I think the Minister will agree, particularly in the case of those who have hired men, that a small allowance <Col N="1223" /> of sugar on an acreage basis should be made to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. H.M. Dockrell Mr. H.M. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>While listening to the Minister I was wondering if some of his remarks about price control in connection with supplies should not really have been concerned with the Finance Bill.  I hope I am doing the Minister an injustice in thinking that they might be for the purpose of padding out his speech on supplies, and leaving the question of supplies for discussion by the House.  I have always a difficulty in deciding where Supplies begin and where the Department of Industry and Commerce ends. Be that as it may, continuing to examine the Minister's remarks, one is struck by this fact, that supplies must come in before price control is of any use.</P>
      <P>What we suffer from at present is an acute shortage of essential supplies. I cannot know, as far as certain essential supplies are concerned, whether the Government has any long-term policy, and is thinking for the coming year, or is merely continuing to carry on from day to day and from hand to mouth.  As an illustration, take the position regarding coal and turf.  In the present Estimate for the fuel production scheme we have an item of £980,000, as against £830,000 last year. The amount is up by £150,000.  Does that mean that more turf was produced, or that it has become more costly to win it?  The estimate for the Turf Development Board is up by £132,000.  When discussing this estimate last year we got to the point that there was a considerable lag in making good the loss which the Turf Development Board had incurred in selling turf at 64/- in this area and at other prices in other areas.  Another item that crops up under that heading concerns whatever losses county councils incurred in producing turf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That leads to the further question: What is the cost of a ton of turf?  I take it that the scheme has been running for the past four years.  We all remember with what energy the late Deputy Flinn threw himself into the work of getting the maximum production of turf by county councils. <Col N="1224" /> That was very good in the earlier stages, but one would have thought that we would now be settling down to some sort of level of production; that we would have got the top off the bogs, won turf during the producing period of the year, and got to the point of knowing what a ton of turf is costing.  Is not a ton of turf costing as much as a ton of coal could be bought for, if it could be brought in? The Minister will probably reply: &ldquo;Oh, of course Deputy Dockrell is talking nonsense.  He was talking about coal. There is not any coal to be got.&rdquo;  That is perfectly true.  What we want to hear about now is a long-term policy. The war will not last for ever.  We want to know what is going to happen when it ends, and when coal is coming in&mdash;I do not know if it will&mdash;at the pre-war price.  What will be the position? I understand that many processes have been perfected across the Channel by which certain residual products are extracted from coal, while the product that is left is practically as good for burning in grates and can probably be sold, if so desired, at a price considerably below the original cost of coal.  In other words, cooked coal has become a by-product of the original coal.  I do not know if that is a fact.  Could the Minister tell us if he will have to fill in all the bogs after the war, or is he going to put a certain percentage duty on coal and try to carry on with turf for the future?</P>
    <P>Still sticking to supplies, the next thing one would have hoped the Minister would tell us about was petrol. Are there any prospects of increased supplies of petrol being made available? I do not know if the Minister is aware of it, but the air is thick with rumours of improvement in the petrol situation.  Could the Minister give us any hope along those lines?  The Minister has not said anything about shipping.  Is there any long-term policy of co-operation with our nearest neighbours in connection with shipping? It is idle to suppose that this country can be run on the present shipping fleet, which is sadly depleted. For a long time to come, shipping will have to be availed of whenever and <Col N="1225" /> wherever it can be got.  That brings me back to the question of co-operation with our nearest neighbours.  Deputies will, no doubt, have, seen that long-term contracts for the supply of agricultural products have been entered into between Great Britain and the colonies.  I do not know if the Minister envisages an export of agricultural produce after the war, but the question which will arise in the immediate postwar period will be: who will give us supplies?  Has the Government had any conversations with the British Government along those lines?  If they are not on speaking terms with them, how about the Americans?  I should like to remind the Minister that this country is drained of supplies at present.  It is something like a cinder-heap. There is a facade which gives the appearance of supplies, but there is nothing in the country to keep production going for any time.  In the post-war period we shall be faced with problems of exchange.  How are we to get money to pay for supplies?  Where are we to get our shipping?  Will the Government be driven, in desperation, to arrange with other Governments long after every other country has finished its negotiations?</P>
    <P>I do not know whether I am a super-optimist or not but, if one reads the Press, one can see the view expressed that the war may be over this summer. That statement was made by a person who knows far more about the conduct of the war than I do and, possibly, more than any other member of the House, without reflecting on other Deputies.  One would like to know what plans the Government have for giving us supplies and for co-operating with industry.  The Government are supposed to have a plan for almost every conceivable situation, but some of us would really like to see the beginning of the unfolding of the Government plans for the immediate postwar period.  As I said, some people think we may be quite close to that period but, in any event, some plans should be unfolded by the Government for getting supplies immediately they become available after the cessation of hostilities.  I do not think that the Minister has given us any light on this most difficult and controversial subject <Col N="1226" /> and I should be pleased, if, when replying, he would give us some information on the Government's long-term policy regarding coal and turf, shipping and co-operation with our neighbours.</P>

      <P>The Minister, in the course of his speech to-day, dwelt on many matters which concerned the administration of his Department and wound up his speech by posing a question to the Dáil on what must be regarded as the whole basis on which the price policy of his Department rests.  Before I proceed to deal with the latter portion of the Minister's remarks, I should like to put a few questions to the Minister on other aspects of his Department's activities. The Minister pulled the curtain aside to a small extent so as to give us an insight into the price-control operations of his Department.  He stated at one time that price-control was based not upon the cost of production of an article or upon the material or labour-content of that article but upon a figure which would provide a return for the capital invested in a particular industrial or commercial enterprise. As the Minister subsequently discovered, and as he might well have discovered at the outset, you might have a situation in which a firm with a capital of £10,000 was producing goods to an actual value of £20,000 and getting an investment return on its original capital of £10,000.  That firm with a capital of £10,000, which had been producing goods to the value of £20,000, could easily have decided to reduce its production from £20,000 to £5,000 and still, under the Minister's earlier price-control policy, would have been entitled to get dividends based upon its £10,000 of invested capital while producing an output of £5,000 instead of a normal output of £20,000. I do not know to what extent we still have a price-policy based upon the provision of a return on invested capital without any regard to the volume of production.  If we have any legacy of that rather short-sighted price-control policy, I feel sure it must be in the drapery trade.  Every member of the House and every citizen has been concerned with, and has expressed amazement at, the enormous jump in the cost of wearing apparel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1227" /> Reference was made to-day to the fact that in 1939 you could buy a hand-tailored suit at six guineas, and to-day you will pay 12 to 15 guineas for a suit of inferior cloth.  I think that is a bare statement of fact.  Prices ranging from 12 to 15 guineas are being asked for suits in Dublin City and in provincial towns, and much better suits could have been procured before the war for six guineas.  The cloth in the suits for which 12 and 15 guineas are being demanded to-day is notoriously inferior to the cloth that could be purchased pre-war at £6 or six guineas.  What is the explanation?  It cannot be that the workers' wages have gone up.  Obviously that is not the explanation, since wages have not been increased by more than 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>If you go into the realm of children's clothing, you will find that the prices have increased enormously.  The position of poor parents who have to prepare children for certain religious functions is simply appalling in the existing circumstances.  The most many of them can do is to look at the shop window where the children's clothing is displayed and then walk away, consoling themselves with the thought that they cannot possibly buy the clothes this year, and they will have to try to provide some kind of substitute for the children who have to attend these functions.</P>
    <P>What is the basis of control in respect of the drapery trade?  If one looks at the balance sheets of drapery firms in Dublin city, one will find that they are making bigger profits than ever.  Firms which, with considerable difficulty, struggled to make a profit before the war, have been making handsome profits within the past few years, profits they never dreamed of. While the well-to-do draper in the city is lining his pockets, and while his bank account will show that he is not suffering in consequence of the emergency, the plight of the poor, the working-class people who are depending on small incomes, is such that they and their children are clad to-day much worse than in pre-war days.  I ask the Minister to take us into his <Col N="1228" /> confidence and tell us on what basis is price control applied in the drapery trade, and what situation justifies a demand of 12 or 15 guineas for a suit of clothes when a much better article could have been bought in pre-war days for £6.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that the cloth is not being imported; all our cloth is home produced.  I know of no set of circumstances operating in this country for the past four or five years which would justify the enormous increase which has taken place in the price of clothes in Dublin and in other cities and towns through the country. It may be that the big retail draper is not the only person who is doing well; it may be the manufacturers and the middlemen are also getting substantial slices of whatever profits are being made.  But so far as the masses of the people are concerned, it is extremely difficult for them to buy clothing, and those of them who have to rear families on £2, £3 or £5 a week are finding it utterly impossible to procure decent clothing for themselves or their children at present prices.</P>
    <P>In the course of questions to-day I addressed some supplementaries to the Minister, designed to ascertain the precise position in respect of the release of cement.  Of course, question time is not the best time to get a full exposition of the cement situation, but, in the course of his replies to the supplementary questions, the Minister indicated that the production of cement had been suspended this month for two reasons&mdash;one, because the cement factories were among the largest consumers of electrical energy, and the other because of the shortage of coal, which was an ingredient in the production of cement.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated also that cement production would be resumed next month and probably supplies will be available for important constructional schemes.  The phrase &ldquo;important constructional schemes&rdquo; can have two meanings.  It may mean that a scheme is important from the standpoint of the activity which will be carried on in the way of rebuilding, and it can be important in another respect. <Col N="1229" /> A scheme can be important from the point of view of providing employment. It is from the standpoint of providing employment that I shall put some considerations to the Minister.  At the present moment there is a cinema in course of erection in Athy on which about 30 men were employed.  These men would be unemployed or would be looking for benefit at the labour exchange or clamouring for passports to Britain if somebody had not decided to erect the cinema in Athy.  The work is now at an end because of the scarcity of cement.  From the point of view of the 30 men who were engaged in its erection, that cinema assumed considerable importance.  It represented the wherewithal to enable them to purchase food and clothing.  From the point of view of the State, it may be said that a cinema in Athy is not so urgent in present circumstances, and therefore they could not release supplies of cement.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to indicate, with the object of enabling those engaged in the building trade to know precisely where they stand, what are the Department's expectations with regard to supplies of cement during the next few months.  I appreciate the Minister's difficulty because of the shortage of electrical energy and the shortage of coal, but I think it would help to steady the position of the building trade if the Minister would indicate what he hopes for in the direction of making supplies of cement available.  Perhaps he could tell us when supplies are likely to be available. If the Minister could indicate that supplies will be available at an early date for all types of constructional work, it would be possible for those directing building operations so to arrange the work that such portions as depend on cement may be undertaken at a later date, while other work could proceed.</P>
    <P>The building trade is only a shadow of its former self, but it is a type of activity which gives employment at fairly decent wages.  Even the present reduced activity in the trade ought to be retained as far as possible.  I am sure the Minister will share my view that it is desirable that all possible information should be given to those <Col N="1230" /> engaged in the building trade in the hope that even the reduced volume of employment now given may be continued. Large numbers who were formerly engaged in the building trade are unable to find employment because of the general supply position.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister what the position is likely to be in relation to candle and paraffin supplies next winter.  Within recent months in rural areas it has been impossible to get candles, although strangely enough candles are procurable in the City of Dublin, an area well out of the reach of the people living in the rural areas.  Those people have told me, and I presume other Deputies as well, that it is impossible to purchase candles in rural areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>And even in winter.  I have had numerous complaints on that point.  The paraffin position towards the end of last winter appeared to be deteriorating and concern is being expressed in rural areas with regard to domestic lighting next winter.  I expect, paraffin being an imported commodity, that the Minister may have difficulties in saying at this stage what the position is likely to be.  But here again I think if the Minister can take the citizens into his confidence and give them some information as to the prospects of candle and paraffin supplies over the next winter period, he will do a great deal to steady public opinion in the matter.  He will do a great deal if he can reassure the people that their supplies of materials for domestic lighting will be perfectly safe over that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like some information from the Minister in respect of turf production. The season through which we have just passed was an excellent one from the standpoint of increasing turf production but, so far, I have not any figures which would indicate whether there has been an increase or decrease in the number of persons engaged in that work.  On the assumption that the number was the same as last year, there ought to be a substantial increase on last year's production.  It is not possible to say at this stage whether or not there has <Col N="1231" /> been such an increase without knowing the number of persons actually engaged.  Apart from the question of turf production, I would ask the Minister to state whether or not he anticipates, in view of the coal shortage and the utilisation of iron rations of timber and turf briquettes to supplement the attenuated coal supplies, that it will be possible to continue the existing turf ration over the winter period and whether in fact turf will be available in the City of Dublin to maintain the existing ration.  I understand that there is a substantial diminution in the quantity of turf held at the turf dumps.  Transport difficulties may be further accentuated and, therefore, the Minister should say at this stage whether or not we are likely to have a continuance of the present turf ration over the winter period.</P>
    <P>The fact that timber is now brought within the ambit of the rationing Order so far as certain city and urban areas are concerned might suggest that turf and timber supplies are short. If the Minister would give some indication as to his hopes regarding the supply of fuel, either in the form of turf or timber, over the winter period, I think the information would be very much welcomed by the public.</P>
    <P>On the general question of the Minister's past price-control policy and the price-control policy which he roughly sketched for us to-day, I think the House is in this difficulty, that we have never been able to get from the Minister any precise statement as to the principles upon which his price-control policy was based in the past. To-day we got a cameo picture of that policy when the Minister told us that it was based upon providing a definite return to firms engaged in production, not on the basis of their production, not on the basis of the cost of the article, not on the basis of the labour content, but on the basis of the capital invested in the concern.  He subsequently discovered that that was an unsafe price-control policy inasmuch as it was continuing to provide a return on invested capital without regard to whether the production increased or decreased.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1232" /> The Minister has now indicated that he is considering a scheme whereby all what are described as excess profits, that is, profits over and above what are reasonable profits, are to be surrendered to the Exchequer and, presumably, utilised for general Government purposes.  The Minister asked the House to give expression to its views on his new price-control policy, which he foreshadowed this evening, but I think the House will require a good deal more information from the Minister before it can commit itself to the acceptance of the principle of the policy he indicated or an acceptance of the details thereof.  We ought to have from the Minister, for instance, an indication of the price-control policy of the past, the methods by which that policy was operated, the extent to which it was successful, either generally or in particular cases, and the weaknesses disclosed in the application of the various price-control policies to particular industries.  If the House had information of that kind, we could at least mirror for ourselves a price-control policy in operation and measure the success or failure, either in whole or in part, of a price-control policy applied in the manner in which the Minister would indicate.  It is because of the fact that we have not had that information in the past and that we do not know at what points the Minister's price-control policy has broken down, that it is difficult to express an opinion in regard to the Minister's foreshadowed price-control policy of the future.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, I think it might be said that if a firm were allowed a reasonable ratio of profit, it ought to be satisfied with that ratio of profit and to recognise that, in an emergency situation of this kind, profits surplus to what was considered reasonable ought to be surrendered to the State. That appears to me to be, in the abstract, an essentially equitable arrangement, but an arrangement may be essentially equitable in theory and may not be possible of implementation.</P>
    <P>In the absence of some further information as to the methods of price control applied in the past I find it difficult, as Deputy Mulcahy found it <Col N="1233" /> difficulty, to express any opinion as to my attitude towards the foreshadowed price-control policy.  I think, however, that the Minister has been wise in recognising that prices have risen so rapidly and so steeply that it is impossible to contemplate further price increase unless at the cost of a further debasement of the standard of living of the masses of the people who depend on low and fixed incomes, to say nothing of the plight of those who have no incomes whatsoever.  According to the Minister's figures prices have increased on an average by over 70 per cent. over the past 4½ years.  Some items, such as clothing and fuel, have increased by much more than 70 per cent.  The average figure is to some extent illusory because some of the articles which people require at particular times have increased to an extent greater than the general average increase.  It is difficult, therefore, to imagine that the Government could contemplate the continuance of whatever price-control policy they have been pursuing, which would result in further increases in prices, without their being compelled to recognise, on the other hand, that such a policy, which appeared to operate from one standpoint, creating an upward movement in price levels, must be accompanied by a debasement of the standard of living of the masses of the people.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that the production policy pursued by the Government and the price control policy pursued by the Government were based upon cognisance of certain social advantages, such as the maintenance of workers in employment, the maintenance of units of production which were not highly efficient because they were carrying a labour content which, perhaps, was higher than the normal labour content would be if production were on a pre-war basis.  These are, admittedly, social advantages.  They have an effect of steadying the whole social and economic position, and it is not easy to see a State contemplating an abandonment of practices which helped to steady employment in any sphere of activity.  If the Minister wants to get the co-operation of the House on a price-control policy and to <Col N="1234" /> get a better public understanding of his difficulties and of the difficulties inherent in price control, he must give the House much more information than he has given.</P>
    <P>I hope, therefore, that in the course of his reply, or on some suitable occasion after the summer recess, the Minister will be able to indicate to the House in much greater detail than he did to-day the basis of his past price-control policy, and give us some indication of the weaknesses revealed in that policy, so that we can measure up to the advantages of the price-control policy which he indicated was likely to be adopted in future.  I think the Minister's whole purpose in this matter ought to be to create an informed public opinion which will understand the difficulties and the dangers, which will see the disadvantages and, at the same time, weigh up the advantages of a definite price-control policy.  The more information which the Minister can disseminate in the matter the more he will be able to create that informed public opinion.  As the Minister has indicated the direction in which his mind and the minds of the Government were travelling, he ought to avail of an early opportunity of taking the House further into his confidence and give us much more information as to the past price-control policy and much more definite details as to the principles and methods on which he hopes to implement the price-control policy which he outlined for us to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer, in the first instance, to a circular which has been sent to the county councils as to the production of turf and the supply of turf to their own institutions. I understand that that circular was sent out by the Department of Local Government on the instruction of the Minister for Supplies, and stated that the county councils are to endeavour to supply their own institutions from private sources, and that the turf produced by them is to be handed over to Fuel Importers Limited.  If that is the position, it will mean a very definite loss to the county councils.  If the county councils have, first, to supply the turf to Fuel Importers Limited, and afterwards are compelled to buy <Col N="1235" /> back that turf from Fuel Importers Limited to supply their own institutions, it will mean a difference of between 24/- and 30/- per ton in the price of the turf.  It seems rather a peculiar position to create in regard to county councils, which are at present engaged in producing turf not alone for their own institutions, but for the public at large as well, and whose overdrafts in that respect have not, in my opinion, at any rate, and in the opinion of the county councils, been dealt with properly by the Minister and his Department.</P>
      <P>Some two years ago I raised the whole question of the costings of turf brought by Fuel Importers, Ltd., into cities, put into dumps, and afterwards taken out again.  I understand that even at 64/- per ton that turf does not pay.  I have got figures in regard to one case in Cork which I have studied closely.  As against the 7/- or 8/- per day, which is the controlled wage price laid down for turf cutters, people who can pay from 17/6 to £1 per day to turf cutters can bring their turf into the city and sell it at the controlled price of 64/- and make a profit out of it. When you compare with that the 7/- or 8/- per day paid to the men on the bogs, the 16/6 per day to the workers in the city for taking it out of the wagons and throwing it into a heap, and the dead loss that is entailed in that, to my mind it is a shiftless procedure. I cannot describe it as anything else.  Instead of this endeavour to compel all turf to go through the hands of Fuel Importers, Ltd., it would be a far better system if you could get that turf delivered direct to the consumers from the bogs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey referred to the question of sugar.  I am all at one with the Minister if his policy is to see that there is sufficient sugar in this country to cover any period of scarcity that may arise if the factories break down or, as will definitely happen this year, we have only a 50 per cent. tonnage of beet despite the record acreage.  In my own constituency I have seen practically 25 per cent. of the crop ploughed up in the last fortnight because it was a complete failure.  I am also deeply <Col N="1236" /> concerned with the price policy for agricultural products as compared with the price policy for industrial products. In connection with Irish Steel, Ltd., for instance, I understand the overhead charges had to be based on the smaller quantity of material produced, thus driving up the price of iron enormously to the consumer.  I am glad to see that, owing to the large quantity of billets which we got in lately, the price of iron has fallen considerably. But I should like to know from the Minister on what basis he fixed the price for beet this year. I know that for the past two years he has not got any beet costings from the Beet Growers' Association.  I know, further, that there were no discussions between the Beet Growers' Association and the sugar company before the price was fixed this year.  I should like to know, in the first instance, on what basis the Minister fixed the price of beet.  I should like to know, secondly, whether in fixing that price he took into consideration a season like the present and the loss that may be entailed to beet growers generally by the fact that they will have only a 50 per cent. tonnage from their crop, and whether he is prepared to treat the agricultural community in the same way as the industrialists are being treated, and allow them compensation for that loss, which is not due to any fault of theirs. These are matters which deeply concern us as producers of agricultural products.  This year we find ourselves with a record acreage of beet but, owing to weather conditions during the past three months, the beet will not produce an average of four tons to the acre this year.  If a certain policy has been laid down with regard to industrial production, I think the same policy should apply to agricultural production, because the agricultural community are producing essential food for the people.  These are matters with which I should like the Minister to deal.</P>
    <P>One of the Deputies from Waterford spoke about the difficulties of getting supplies of kerosene.  I should like to pay this tribute to the Minister's Department in regard to kerosene supply. <Col N="1237" /> There is no difficulty whatever in tractor owners getting a sufficient supply of kerosene, or having any trouble whatever with the Department in connection with it, if they carry out the simple instructions which the Department has given them.  As I said, as one who has to deal with a very large area in which tractor work is carried on, if the people concerned send in their log-sheets in time, and while they have a sufficient supply on hand, there is no difficulty whatever, and I think that we have now come to the period where the black-marketeers in kerosene are practically wiped off the map, and I am very glad of it.  I certainly must pay that tribute to the kerosene section of the Minister's Department; its work is second to none anywhere.  At any rate, that has been my personal experience.</P>
    <P>I am rather worried, however, about what I consider to be the wastage of petrol in the bringing in of long-distance stuff to the cities.  I find, for instance, that the Great Southern Railways Company are getting as much as 19 gallons of petrol in order to bring in one lorry-load of turf to Cork City. Now, I do not know which of the two would be best for heating purposes, but I think that to use 19 gallons of petrol to bring in that turf to Cork City is over-stepping the mark.  Of course, the Minister can give us figures with regard to the areas from which the turf is being drawn, but I can tell him that yesterday, in the Cork County Council, we had a very definite complaint with regard to the heating of turf ricks on the bog, owing to lack of transport facilities and the hold-up of turf production in those particular bogs on that account.  We have had an exceptional season, and whatever argument there may or may not have been in previous years about turf, this is a year in which turf can be produced easily and with very little trouble, and I think it would be a scandal if that turf is now left to deteriorate on the bogs for want of proper transport facilities to get it out. I think that any hold-up in that respect should be dealt with immediately and very firmly.  I have heard statements by county surveyors in Cork as to the <Col N="1238" /> difficulty of getting transport for the removal of turf from the bogs.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I should also like to have a definite statement from the Minister as to the instructions issued to the county councils in regard to supplying their own institutions with turf. I think that the institutions maintained by a county council should have first call on the turf produced, in the first instance, at the expense of the ratepayers of the county, and that any endeavour to blackmail&mdash;I cannot describe it by any other word&mdash;the county council and compel it to pay so much a day to bring the turf into Cork City and then pay for its re-delivery out to these institutions is something that should not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>If there is turf in the hands of private suppliers or private individuals, which can be purchased, then I suggest that Fuel Importers, Limited, should purchase it themselves.  If there are private owners or holders of turf in Cork, it should be an easy matter for Fuel Importers Limited, to get in touch with these people and let them supply the county institutions. As a matter of fact, we found yesterday that the county council had to give up a lot of contracts as a result of the disorder in the Department of Supplies, and I should like to have some definite information on that point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, Sir, I should like to direct the Minister's attention to one minor matter&mdash;indeed, it is not a minor matter from my point of view, but, possibly, might be from the point of view of the nation&mdash;and that is the fuel position in County Monaghan. Up to this year, the scarcity of fuel in that county has been greatly mitigated by the quantity of timber that was available there.  The cutting of that timber, however, has gone on during the last three years of the emergency, with the result that the supply of timber has been greatly reduced, and now we are in the position in that county of actually cutting the roads in order to get at the turf which lies under them.  That, I think, should be eloquent of the extremities to which the local authority there has been driven in order to get supplies of turf <Col N="1239" /> for the people of the county.  I think that every available inch of bog in the county is being, or has been, exploited during the last three months at least, in order to secure the maximum quantity of mud turf for the people there, and I invite the Minister to direct the attention of the appropriate division of his Department to the making of a survey of the fuel situation in that county so that plans may be made to supplement the supplies available when winter comes.  I forbear from engaging in a protracted discussion of the situation there, because I am sure that the Minister has available a sufficient number of officials to deal with it.</P>
      <P>Now, I want to direct the attention of this House to the studied policy of the Minister during the last few years, of using the medium either of Radio Éireann or Dáil Éireann to &ldquo;cry havoc&rdquo; and tell the people of this country that the situation is terrible, that it is one of despair, that it is frightful in general, and that he despairs of being able to cope with it; and then, six months afterwards, we have An Taoiseach getting up and saying that the situation has been saved, and that it is all due to Deputy Seán Lemass, who is one of the most remarkable men, because, faced with the situation which prevailed six months ago, he was able to cope with it and to carry the nation through to safety &mdash;all due to the ability of this remarkable man, Deputy Seán Lemass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that connection, I think this is the third time we have been told that there is not an ounce of coal to come in and that, as a result, many industries will have to close down.  If it is true that fuel is so short, why is it that the streets of Ballaghaderreen are lit with electricity in broad moonlight, when you can barely see the lamps burning because of the bright moonlight?  We are familiar with the black-out that prevailed here at the beginning of the war and that still prevails in Great Britain, where all public lighting is quenched so that no, light can be seen by an enemy.  Surely there would be nothing wrong in directing the local inspectors of the Electricity Supply Board to turn <Col N="1240" /> off the street lights in rural towns on the occasion of a full moon. I understand that in certain towns the local inspector, doing what any commonsense man would do, when he saw the streets lighted up in brilliant moonlight, turned off the lamps but they were immediately turned on again under orders from another Department. It is very hard to carry conviction to your neighbours to measure every sod of turf that they put on the fire and to use every conceivable expedient before they burn more fuel, if they see large quantities of electric power being wasted nightly on the streets of small towns.  I declare that there is as much electricity being wasted on the streets of small towns in rural Ireland as would provide an increase of 50 per cent. in the domestic ration of the citizens of that small town.  Now, I think every Deputy is anxious to co-operate and everyone is willing to bear his share of the inconvenience inseparable from this emergency, but it is truly madness that women should be driven to the utmost extremity to cook their children's food when they see outside their bedroom windows the very power which they require to heat the baby's milk being used in illuminating streets which do not require illumination.</P>
    <P>The other side of the story is this. I have very little patience with people who say to the Minister for Supplies: &ldquo;Tell us what the position is going to be in regard to supplies of paraffin and candles next winter.&rdquo;  How can the Minister tell anybody what the position will be in regard to these supplies next winter?  The Minister for Supplies has to depend on whatever supplies of paraffin oil and candles Great Britain and the United States are willing to deliver to this country.  I think it is no small tribute to the Minister that he has been able to prevail upon them to continue such deliveries up to the present.  I wish him the best of good luck in his efforts to get further supplies of these commodities from Britain and the United States.  The best I think that any man could say is that, bearing in mind the liberality and the generosity of these two countries in the past, we may reasonably expect them to send us whatever they can <Col N="1241" /> spare us in the future.  In regard to candles, I understand that the Department took the very sensible step of suspending the distribution of candles during mid-summer with a view to saving up whatever candles may be available for the winter months.</P>
    <P>In that connection, when the Minister proposes to release candles, surely he might relate the distribution of paraffin wax candles to the needs of the rural community as indicated by their tea cards.  I can only tell him what I have been doing in regard to my own business.  If I put up whatever modicum of paraffin wax candles I get on the counter, the whole week's supply would be gone in ten minutes. The method I adopt is that I give candles to anybody who has a tea card in my shop as nearly as I can in proportion to the number of people on the tea card.  Ordinarily, I give two candles per week to whoever is on the tea card&mdash;that is, as far as they go.  In many cases, that does not permit of everybody who has a tea card getting two candles per week, but at least it does ensure that one person will not get a whole packet while others will have none at all.  When I mention the tea card, I should perhaps explain that the system we operate is that when a person registers with us for tea, we give him a card indicating the number of persons in the house who are entitled each to the ¾ oz. of tea. That is ready evidence of the number of persons for whom candles are required.</P>
    <P>To-day we are asked in Dáil Eireann by the Minister to say whether we agree with the proposal that he should be invested with power to determine in respect of each individual firm what is a fair profit, and to direct each shopkeeper to surrender to the Exchequer any sum in excess of what he deems to be a fair profit.  Outside Bedlam there was never such a proposal. It is daft.  Surely, the Minister himself must realise that it is daft.  If we do set up in this country a system of <i>ad hoc</i> taxation, you might as well put us all in Maryborough Jail.  Every sentence that is imposed by a court of summary jurisdiction takes the form of a fine, or the alternative of six <Col N="1242" /> months' imprisonment, but if you are going to give the Minister for Supplies a power of this character to determine what he considers a fair profit for every trader, you might as well give him the power of <i>lettre de cachet</i> and lock us all up for the duration.  That kind of &ldquo;codology&rdquo; is adumbrated for the purpose of creating the impression that the whole system of price-control is one of infinite complexity, that nobody can understand it, that it is impossible to try, that it is insoluble, and that we must provide the Minister with a scimitar to cut the Gordian knot, and to lay down for the whole community a universally low standard of prices.  To anybody engaged in business, that is just all &ldquo;cod.&rdquo;  This universal standard of prices is all &ldquo;cod.&rdquo;  It is being attempted for the purpose of creating an impression, and, if possible, of shutting the mouths of the Labour Party.  But there is as much chance of any Government enforcing a standstill Order of that kind as there is of my pushing over St. Patrick's Cathedral with my left hand.</P>
    <P>How is any man to determine what prices were being charged in French-park for rings for chickens' legs three weeks ago?  If you are not in a position to establish what they definitely cost in any shop, how can you enforce the Order at all?  That may be an extreme case but what is the use of making Orders the enforcement of which, as regards at least 40 per cent. of their operation, is utterly impossible. The only purpose it serves is to make the law disreputable in the eyes of the people.  This business of ordaining a price for a particular commodity is not satisfactory.  Take the case of a man who wants to pay a black market price for that commodity and keep within the law, a man such as was described in the <i>Sunday Dispatch</i> last Sunday.  He goes and purchases the article at the fixed price, then plays a game of poker with the seller and loses in the course of the game the difference between the fixed price and the black market price of the commodity.  I should like to see your price fixer trying to deal with that situation.  He would be asked did he ever play poker <Col N="1243" /> and, if he did, did he always go while the going was good and leave the winner with the winnings.  If not, he should.  Price fixation is an extremely difficult matter, we all know.  For that reason I tell the Minister regularly every year when this Estimate comes before the House to face that fact and to prepare a limited schedule of commodities of fundamental importance, effectively control their prices and let the rest of the commodities rip because he cannot control them.  The most effective way of keeping prices down is to let prices rip to a point where the average citizen will not attempt to buy these commodities&mdash; then they become a drug on the market and they will be unloaded quickly enough&mdash;or to induce so large a supply, as was done in the case of oats, as to create a surplus on the market.  Do Deputies remember the time we controlled the price of oats here?  The net result of controlling the price of oats was that there was not a bag of oatmeal to be got in the country.  That was a case in which by taking off price control, you could stimulate a supply.  I urged on the Minister to take control off the price of oats, and for a long time that proposal was resisted.  Eventually, as usual, they gave in and with loud protestatious that I had never mentioned the subject of oats, did exactly as I told them, with the result that, in 12 months, we had a surplus of oatmeal, and at this moment oatmeal millers are running around with their hats in their hands offering to sell oatmeal below the fixed price.</P>
    <P>There are certain other commodities in respect of which it is impossible to create a surplus because we are dependent on exterior sources of supply, and no matter what the price trend of them is, it will not evoke substantially increased supplies, though it may precipitate a certain measure of smuggling across the Border.  We have to face the fact that supplies of these commodities have virtually ceased and there is no use in trying to ensure that the masses of the people will continue to have them.  In so far as they are luxuries, we shall have to make up our minds that people will have to <Col N="1244" /> do without them, but now we come to things like clothing, fuel, flour and sugar.  Look at sugar.  That is a commodity control of which has been taken right from the point of production to the point of sale.  Has any Deputy heard of any serious trouble in regard to the average individual getting his sugar at the fixed price?  I have not. It is the one commodity which is flowing steadily into consumption at the fixed price and of which everybody is getting the quota to which he is entitled.</P>
    <P>Why do you not do that with flour? Why do you not do that with utility clothing?  Do Deputies remember the story of the utility shirt?  Do they remember when the Minister evolved the brilliant idea that he was going to supply cloth at a subsidised price to a selection of manufacturers and going to determine, at the end of the financial year, whether they had made too much money on the shirt?  I came in here and pointed out that the shirt which was costing at that time, I think, 50/- a dozen to produce and put on the delivery wagons was selling in the retail shops in Dublin at 14/6, and was being sold by the wholesalers to the retailers at 10/-.  The 4/2 shirt was being distributed by the wholesaler to the retailers at 10/- and by the retailers to the consumer at 14/6. When I drew his attention to it, the Minister said: &ldquo;I cannot do a ha'porth about it until I see their balance sheets after six months.&rdquo;  When he saw them, he had a fit, and it then struck him that it was possible to say to the manufacturer who made the shirt costing 4/2: &ldquo;We will allow you a shilling on the shirt, the wholesaler a shilling and the retailer two shillings,&rdquo; making the shirt 8/2 and let them fight it out between them as to how they would divide the 4/-.  If any wholesaler was fool enough to pay more than the 1/- profit allowed to the manufacturer, or any retailer fool enough to pay more than the 1/- profit allowed to the wholesaler, one thing was certain: the consumer, the man going to wear the shirt, would pay 8/2 and no more.</P>
    <P>They are doing that and no reasonable shopkeeper in the country complains in the least.  On the contrary, it has been the greatest possible relief <Col N="1245" /> to me, as a shopkeeper, to get the shirt in now with the price marked clearly on it, so that no question arises as to whether there is any huggermugger or profiteering.  Why is that not done in respect of a range of utility clothing?  It has been done in regard to boots, and most excellently, though, if anything, the margin of profit allowed on boots is too big.  My experience, however, is that almost invariably the manufacturers stick their fingers in the eye of the Department first.  They get away with about 18 months' plunder and after I have &ldquo;larruped&rdquo; the Department hard enough for 18 months, they wake up and chew the profits down.  They are allowing the boot manufacturers and the boot retailers too wide a margin of profit.  I, as a boot retailer, am making and have been making too much money, and the Minister ought to look to that.</P>
    <P>The profit margins in the drapery trade are not unduly wide, in my judgment, mainly because the quantity of merchandise available to the drapers has been so drastically reduced, but it is a generous margin of profit as I see it at present.  On balance, I think it is not inequitable and if you were materially to reduce it, I think one of the consequences must be a reduction of employment in that end of the distributive trade.  I urge the Minister again in regard to flour to take over the industry, to set up a flour-milling board and to operate it on a non-profit basis.  In regard to boots and drapery, I think the policy of marking the fixed price as at present is the right policy. The only point is that the Minister should keep under constant review the profit margins allowed.  He ought to be able to find in the trade certain individuals who would tell him honestly what their experience of these profit margins is.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, I beg of him to disembarrass himself of the effort to control the price of everything.  It cannot be done, and it is making the law disreputable in the eyes of the mass of the people, because they know it is not being done, and if you once create a situation in which everybody is breaking the law in some particular, you are preparing a situation in which the bulk of the people will break the law <Col N="1246" /> in whatever particular suits them. Unless you can get universal observance of the law, its enforcement becomes practically impossible, and if the law is manifestly absurd, the result is that it gradually loses its sanctity and you find respectable men, who ought to abhor the very thought of breaking the law in any particular, calmly doing it habitually, shrugging their shoulders and saying: &ldquo;Nobody could abide by the regulations the Department are making at present.&rdquo; In my submission to the House, this arises almost exclusively from the attempt of the Department to regulate the price of everything.</P>
    <P>I want now to draw attention to the habit of varying price Orders.  Take jam, for instance.  The Minister was born a draper, so he is probably not familiar with the trade of the grocer as I am.  There are probably 32 varieties of jams.  If you do a busy trade, you learn all the prices of jams, and the moment a person asks for blackberry jam you say immediately: &ldquo;? per 2 lb. pot.&rdquo;  Then the Minister changes the prices and makes the price of that jam 1/7½d. per 2 lb. pot, and the next busy day you are very likely to charge a halfpenny too much for that pot of jam in the rush.  But you discipline yourself and try to learn off the altered prices.  Within a week the whole thing is changed again, and not infrequently, where you have strawberry and apple, raspberry and apple, and a few more jams of that character grouped under one heading, you suddenly find strawberry and apple lifted into another grade, and raspberry and apple left where it was; so that, whereas heretofore strawberry and apple and raspberry and apple were grouped together at 1/11, strawberry and apple now becomes 2/2, and raspberry and apple remains at 1/11, with the result that, with the best intentions in the world, you find individual assistants making a mistake.</P>
    <P>It has this double evil: (1) that you have broken the law; and (2) even if you do go for somebody who has made the mistake, you cannot but have the feeling at the back of your head: &ldquo;But for the grace of God, I would have done it myself.&rdquo;  You cannot wax <Col N="1247" /> very eloquent about a subordinate's failure if you know in your heart and soul that if you were placed in the same position it is seven chances out of ten you would have done the same yourself.  I recognise that you cannot always avoid these changes, but I would suggest that if, in an industry like the jam industry, all those prices are fixed, say, on 1st March, and then they come back on 1st April and say: &ldquo;We want to make a little amendment to this,&rdquo; the Minister should reply: &ldquo;No; we will amend them once every three months, but no more.  It may mean that if an error has been made in this quarter you will be able to put up a case for adding a halfpenny to the price of jam in the ensuing quarter; but I will not have weekly changes, and you will have to do the best you can.&rdquo;  That, of course, applies to a wide range of commodities of that kind, and the point is that frequent changes in price give rise to errors.</P>
    <P>I want to say a word with regard to inspectors.  I said here in the House and elsewhere once before that I distinguish, in the case of inspectors of the Department of Supplies, between the conduct of some of the young fellows and that of the more experienced men.  Some of those people are&mdash;it is as well to be plain-spoken and honest about it&mdash;desperately unpopular in the country.  I fully sympathise with those men on the extremely disagreeable duties they have to perform.  No man likes to be going around on an eternal inquisition of the character those men have to conduct, and my experience of meeting the more mature inspectors of the Department of Supplies has been that, if they are treated reasonably and are allowed to believe that the person they are interviewing is desirous of co-operating and of giving them the information it is their duty to collect, they are reasonable men; they have due regard for the exigencies of the business with which they are dealing, and due regard for the nervousness of the merchant who feels he may have got himself into serious trouble either because of his guilty conduct or because he is apprehensive that he has put his foot in it, <Col N="1248" /> and in any case they have no desire to insult or irritate him but only to do their duty.  But then there is another type of &ldquo;tulip&rdquo; who is so intoxicated by the fact that he has become an inspector of the Department of Supplies that it is not beyond him to suspend the conversation by saying: &ldquo;It is my duty to inform you that anything you say will be taken down in writing and used in evidence against you.&rdquo;  Well, the least choleric of men who is doing his best to be civil, and to recognise the difficulties, is liable to lose his temper in those circumstances; he is liable to take a ledger and hurl it at the inspector, and perhaps I had better not mention what one is inclined to say in those circumstances.  We all recognise the difficulties the administration have; the Minister ought to recognise the difficulties which a great many people in rural Ireland have as well.  I know the case of a woman who, on seeing some inspector of the Department come in&mdash;no doubt he had the most benevolent intentions&mdash;faded away and did not get up out of her bed for three weeks.  I do not think anything the inspector said in that case was responsible, but the very sight of him put the heart across that woman. Cognisance should be had of that, and I strongly urge on the Minister to ensure that, particularly in rural Ireland, the duties of inspection will be done by the seasoned and experienced officers of his Department, even if on occasion it may be necessary to send two men, allowing the junior to do the routine work and the senior to conduct whatever discussions or inquiries it may be the duty of the staff to pursue on an occasion of that kind.</P>
    <P>There are two other matters I want to mention.  One is the price of pollard. I told you six months ago to bring down the price of pollard.  You brought it down from 18/6 to 16/6, but you have not brought it down enough, and if you keep the pollard there it will heat.  The mills are packed with it; they cannot sell it, and they will not sell it at the present price.  You ought to bring down the price of pollard by 2/- to 4/- a cwt. if you want to pass it into consumption.  It is much better to lose a bit of money on the pollard than to have to throw it all out.  I have <Col N="1249" /> been telling you that for six months. You will bring it down sooner or later, and the sooner you bring it down the sooner you will bring it into consumption. If the price is kept at the present level, the pollard will be suitable for nothing but to be thrown on the dunghill.</P>
    <P>The last thing I want to say is this: my experience is that a great deal of the inflated prices we are required to pay at the present time for a variety of commodities coming into this country is due to the freights charged by Irish Shipping, Limited.  It is time the Minister showed his hand in regard to this matter.  I have tried my level best to get, by inquiry from the Minister or his Department, the facts about Irish Shipping, but I cannot get them.  I urge that the freights charged by Irish Shipping constitute a heavy tax on the people of this country, and have been designed to secure the amortisation of the cost of the ships in ten trips.  I protest against that, more especially as those immense freight rates are yielding to those who manage the ships a percentage commission for the work they do.  If those facts are not correct I ask the Minister to tell Dáil Éireann what the facts are.  I have tried by every expedient I could to get the fact officially, to get the truth.  I failed; all I have succeeded in collecting so far is a pot-luck rumour.  I put that rumour before the House now with the object of giving the Minister an opportunity to confirm or rebut it.  Commodities like cornflour, cotton textiles and dried fruit are coming in here, and in many cases the freight rate from Lisbon is four to six times the cost of the merchandise.</P>
    <P>That is bad enough, but, when you add to that the fact that those who are charging those freights are getting a percentage commission on them, I say that any man who is managing a ship operating between Lisbon and this country is making a fortune on every individual trip, and those are the gentlemen who are held up to the country as the public-spirited souls who are acting on the board of Irish Shipping without compensation of any kind.  It is right that Dáil Eireann <Col N="1250" /> should keep in mind what the situation is.  It is true that a group of shipping owners in this country are sitting on the board of Irish Shipping Limited without remuneration of any kind, but the system whereby ships are worked by Irish Shipping Limited is that those individual ship owners are asked to manage the ships for Irish Shipping Limited on a commission basis, and I allege that they collect commission on those freights.  I urge that those freights are unduly inflated, and I urge that they are largely responsible for the excessive cost of cotton cloth and of a variety of other commodities such as cornflour, which our people, particularly the poor, habituaily use and must use.  I ask the Minister to give the House a full statement of what the position of Irish Shipping is, what the freight rates charged by them are, the profits that have been made since the body was established, and most decidedly, a detailed account of the commissions earned by those who have been managing the ships on behalf of Irish Shipping Limited.  If the Minister will take some at least of the suggestions I have put before him it will be no longer necessary for him to envisage a situation in which he will become the tax gatherer <i>ad hoc</i> of every business concern in this country, nor will it be necessary for him to beat his bosom in public at frequent intervals and announce that havoc and ruin are upon the country and that he stands alone and unsupported in the gap.  We are all aware that the difficulties are considerable, and every section of the community is prepared to help if given honest information on what the situation truly is.  The suggestions that I have made would, I believe, contribute greatly to a solution of many of the Minister's problems, and provided he would truly state any other problems that lie ahead, I have no doubt that other Deputies would offer him many suggestions which, if accepted, would prove equally fruitful and desirable in their results.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister gave a comprehensive survey of the work of his Department, and dilated at great length on some of its principal activities. The information he gave was, <Col N="1251" /> in many respects, invaluable, although I may be regarded as challenging him on certain details.  Before proceeding to deal with the work of the Minister's Department, I would like to refer in some detail to the administration of certain regulations made by the Minister. Some of these regulations are, undoubtedly, irritating to people who have to work hard for a living.  When shopkeepers offend against the regulations, they certainly should be prosecuted, but, after all, they are entitled to the same justice as any other section of the community.  It appears to me that it should be the aim of the Minister and his Department, especially during this period of emergency, to make it as easy as possible for the people to pursue their ordinary avocations. Sundry prosecutions have been brought against shopkeepers for the most trivial offences.  The time of the courts is wasted, and industrious people have to endure prosecutions in relation to matters which are of little or no value to the State, or to the Department of Supplies.  It may be argued, and naturally would be argued by the officials of the Department, that the law must be enforced.  There is, however, an old maxim which says that &ldquo;the law takes no notice of trifles.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been asked to bring to the notice of the Minister and his Department complaints made by certain people engaged in the tailoring trade. The austerity suit was introduced in Great Britain.  Shortly afterwards the Minister curtailed the number of pockets to be inserted in an emergency suit.  The British public resented the austerity suit so much that it had to be withdrawn.  In this country a number of tailors have been summoned for adding an extra pocket to a suit, or, perhaps, an extra one-eighth of an inch to the length of a trousers.  We do not know, of course, what is the amount of inspectorial and legal costs incurred in bringing cases to court, but I imagine it must be fairly substantial. I put it to the Minister: Is it really worth while continuing a restriction of that kind when it has been abandoned in Great Britain?  I suggest to <Col N="1252" /> him that, perhaps, he could now see his way to relax, or abolish, that restriction altogether; that he might follow the example of Great Britain, and let people have an extra pocket in their coats if they want it, or an extra one-eighth of an inch in the length of a trousers if customers so desire it.</P>
    <P>Another matter that I want to bring to the Minister's notice concerns a tailor who, for example, employs two or three assistants.  A man in that position has recently been asked by the Department to take out a manufacturer's licence.  I understand such a request has been made to other men in a small way of business.  This man did not understand what the object was, and he asked me to raise the matter by way of Parliamentary Question. Instead of doing so, I am availing of this opportunity to raise it on the Estimate for the Department.  The Minister, I am sure, will be able to give me some information which will satisfy my informant.</P>
    <P>So much for the details.  I notice that the Estimate for the Minister's Department shows the substantial increase of £784,728 over last year.  Half of the increase is represented by the increase in the cost of food subsidies.  I assume that was inevitable in present circumstances.  I did not hear the Minister's explanation of that item when introducing the Estimate, but I assume the increase is inevitable in view of the circumstances of the time and of the difficulty in procuring food supplies from outside as well as their high cost at the moment.  The next largest item in the increase is represented by the cost of the production of turf for use in the non-turf areas.  The increase is £131,000.  This is the fourth year in which we have been engaged in the production of turf.  It appears to me that the costs of turf production are increasing year by year, even though we have had four years' experience of the work.  I should imagine that after that experience, turf production should have reached a higher degree of efficiency than we have succeeded in achieving, and that we should have succeeded in bringing down the costs of production.  But, <Col N="1253" /> evidently, the costs are being added to each year.</P>
    <P>I suggested, on a former occasion, that, so long as the county councils are obliged to embark on turf production, the difficulty of bringing down the costs of production will remain, and that it would be advisable, in the interests of economy, if the Minister were to devise some alternative organisation for providing our people with cheaper turf.  I admit that, since I made that suggestion, the transport problem has become more difficult, and that other restrictions have added to the uncertainty of the position, but, at all events, after four years' experience, the cost of production is apparently still increasing. In the ordinary and normal course of events one would expect that after the experience the Minister has gained, he ought to be able to bring down the costs of production substantially.</P>
    <P>I submit that there is no justification whatever for the present high cost of turf.  I admit that the situation this year is abnormal.  Last year, when transport conditions were reasonably normal, there was certainly no justification at all for the high price which people had to pay for turf in the City of Dublin and in other non-turf areas. I suggested before that if the Minister could organise a group of private producers&mdash;and in my opinion that could be done&mdash;he could obtain turf at a much cheaper price than it is possible to obtain it through the instrumentality of the county councils.  As a rule, the cost of producing county council turf is from 25 to 50 per cent. higher than that of private producers.  In fact, in some cases it is very much higher, but, at all events, there is that big margin of difference.  I think that if groups of private producers were organised in the different areas in the country it would be possible for the Minister to obtain much cheaper turf than he is getting at present.  I will admit, quite candidly, that this year the position is exceedingly difficult and awkward on account of the transport situation, but, even allowing for that and other difficulties, I still hold it should be possible for the Minister to obtain turf at a lower price than he is getting it through the instrumentality of the county councils.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1254" /> Deputy Dockrell asked a very pertinent question to-day, and if I recollect arightly he asked the same question last year.  The question was: what does it cost to produce a ton of turf and bring it to the City of Dublin? The Minister, I think, gave an approximate figure of the transport costs last year, but, so far as I recollect, he did not answer Deputy Dockrell's question. I know that last year turf was actually sold and delivered to a merchant in a town in the West of Ireland at the low price of 9/- and 10/- a ton, and that it was sold and delivered in other towns in the West at 15/- a ton.  I admit that the distance the turf had to be transported was short&mdash;up to five or six miles&mdash;but, even so, it was sold and delivered at those prices.  The merchant who bought it at 9/- and 10/- a ton is quite prepared to show to the Minister, his officials, or anybody else the invoices to prove that.  I do not imagine that the price of turf for those towns will be very much higher this year.  It will probably be on about the same level as last year.  There is something wrong with the whole system of turf production.  No serious attempt has been made to bring down the cost of production or the sale price of turf.</P>
    <P>The Minister invited the Dáil to express an opinion on the question of price control.  Even assuming that one were inclined to express an opinion on it, one would be very reluctant to do so after listening to Deputy Dillon, who is very experienced on this subject and, as a merchant in a very big way of business, has occasion daily to watch and observe prices.  I agree with Deputy Norton that it is a subject on which no member of the Dáil could express an opinion, until more information is placed at our disposal than the Minister has given up to the present.</P>
    <P>I admit at once that, in regard to price control in this country, we are in an entirely different position from the people in Great Britain, where prices are fixed for all the products and goods of the country and where they are regulated from the moment they are produced until they are consumed. Because of that difference, it is very hard to operate an effective <Col N="1255" /> system of price control here.  Whether the Minister has been wise in pegging prices down to the May level, or whether he has done an injustice to some manufacturers, I am not in a position to say.  I must refrain from expressing an opinion until I have more information than the Minister has given up to the present.</P>
    <P>There are very general complaints throughout the country about high prices for all classes of commodities, many of which were mentioned by previous speakers.  The prices seem to be out of all relation to what should be the cost of production or manufacture. I do not know what happens to the intervening margins, but even Deputy Dillon himself has admitted that the prices he is charging for certain articles in his own shop&mdash;prices which have been fixed by the Minister&mdash;are excessive.  He confessed that he was making an excessive profit on some of those articles; so seemingly even the officials of the Department, notwithstanding three or four years' experience in price fixing, are not yet absolutely proficient in that business.</P>
    <P>I have been asked to bring the question of butter coupons to the notice of the Minister.  Some retailers complain because they are obliged to return butter coupons in exactly the same way as sugar coupons.  They think butter coupons should be dealt with in the same way as tea coupons&mdash;that the people engaged in the sale should be allowed to retain them.  They have a grievance on that particular score and I would like the Minister to look into it at his leisure.</P>
    <P>I have also been asked to raise the question of domestic lighting.  I know it is difficult for the Minister to give any indication as to the prospects regarding supplies of paraffin and candles during the coming winter. Some traders down the country are naturally anxious to know the Minister's outlook on the matter, as their customers are already making anxious inquiries from them and they are not in a position to give any definite information. It would be advisable if, in view of the anxiety and perturbation that exist in the country, the <Col N="1256" /> Minister would make a statement on the subject, holding out some hope of a reasonable supply of paraffin and candles&mdash;even of a more plentiful supply than during the late months of last spring.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon raised the question of freight charges.  It is a subject about which I know very little, though I have had some experience of the abnormal freights charged by Irish ships.  The freights are almost as high as the cost of the commodities imported. I intended to make inquiries from other sources as to why the freights were so high.  I was asked some time ago by certain traders down the country to raise this question, but I had not an opportunity of getting in touch with any of the Minister's officials.  If I had had that opportunity, probably I would not have raised the matter here now. However, as it has been raised publicly by Deputy Dillon I will await with interest the Minister's explanation for what appear to be excessively high freights.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the fuel situation, it is of interest to note, in this Book of Estimates, that the only reduction in any particular branch of the Department is the reduction in the provision for camps for turf workers.  I think £28,000 was provided for this purpose last year, while it is only £1,000 for the current year.  I was not present for the Minister's opening statement and do not know if he explained the position. There may be some insurmountable difficulty in regard to the provision of accommodation for turf workers.  Any approach to the question of increasing turf production lies in the provision of accommodation for the workers as near as possible to the bogs.  A big effort should be made to overcome any difficulties that may arise.  I have had experience of the difficulty of bringing men long distances to work. There is a variety of problems arising &mdash;the expense of conveying them by lorry, their having very little time to rest and their having to be up and on the road at a very early hour in the morning.  Every possible effort should be made to provide accommodation for <Col N="1257" /> them at the scene of their work.  This is, I think, the only outstanding reduction in the present Estimate, and I am calling the Minister's attention to it in regard to planning for future supplies, so that he may do whatever he finds possible and overcome whatever difficulties may arise.</P>
      <P>There is grave dissatisfaction in regard to the manner in which the distribution of essential supplies is regulated and the manner in which the Department's regulations are enforced. Every Deputy is familiar with these difficulties.  We have cases of small retailers and producers&mdash;such as bakers&mdash;having to keep very complicated records and finding it almost impossible to keep those records according to the desire of the Department.</P>
      <P>I agree whole-heartedly with Deputy Dillon, that not only should the regulations be made as clear as possible for the officials enforcing them, but they should have regard to the difficulties under which ordinary citizens labour. I know that in every branch of business with which the Department has to deal considerable efforts are made to outwit the officials and to evade the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that respect I have sympathy with the Minister's difficulties.  One example which is familiar to all Deputies is that which occurred some years ago regarding supplies of sugar for jam making, when practically every citizen appeared to be engaged extensively in jam production.  On that occasion I think there was something wrong in the approach of the Department to the situation.  It should be obvious to the Department, when it was possible to obtain sugar simply by filling in a form, that numbers of people would endeavour to obtain it in that way. Now that the supply of sugar for jam making has been cut off a certain number of people will suffer a grave injustice. I refer to those who have fairly extensive fruit gardens, in which supplies of fruit are apparently allowed to go to waste when sugar is not available.  It should be easy to allocate a certain amount of sugar to people who can prove that they have fruit trees.  I know that it would be <Col N="1258" /> physically impossible to allocate supplies of sugar fairly amongst people who might claim that they were going to purchase fruit for jam making, but those with a certain minimum amount of fruit in their gardens are certainly entitled to consideration if it is possible to make sugar available.  That is particularly desirable this season, having regard to the fact that supplies of butter are very low and that other foodstuffs will be difficult to obtain later on.  It is wholly undesirable that perishable fruit should be allowed to be wasted and for that reason, some regulation might be made to provide a minimum amount of sugar for those who have fruit trees.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with what Deputy Corry said, that the prospect of sugar supplies this year is not too bright. There is no doubt that a large percentage of the acreage under sugar beet had to be ploughed up, or, if not ploughed up, is in a very precarious position owing to the prolonged drought.  That statement applies not only to sugar beet, but to other important crops.  To a certain extent it applies to the wheat crop.  In considering the supply position for the coming year the Minister will have to have regard to the fact that the supply of home-grown wheat and other grain crops, and also potatoes may not be as good as we would have anticipated from the acreage sown.  We have gone through an exceptional year so far as climatic conditions go.  I was interested to hear Deputy Dillon speak of the wastage of electric power by having public lighting in small towns at night, when there is hardly any public need for such lighting.  That is one of the inconsistencies which prevail in regard to supplies of electricity. While we have the Department of Suplies appealing feverishly to the public to conserve supplies, in many directions there is wilful public waste.  We should set an example by avoiding waste in every possible way.  I find it very hard to understand how some of the regulations made by the Department can be justified.  I have the deepest sympathy with traders and others engaged in the distribution of supplies in their endeavours to comply <Col N="1259" /> with these regulations.  That fact was brought to my notice in regard to fixing the price of shoeing iron and iron for cars.  An Order was made last March fixing the price at 83/- per cwt., but in May the price was reduced to 76/- per cwt.  Merchants who had laid in considerable supplies of iron for the purpose of meeting demands for such essential supplies in their districts found that they had to sell at a reduced price, thus suffering the loss entailed by the reduction in price.</P>
    <P>I think it is wrong to penalise retailers for endeavouring to obtain supplies for their customers by reducing the price without, at the same time, making provision for some rebate in respect of supplies which the retailers may have in hand.  That kind of regulation tends to discourage merchants from endeavouring to satisfy the needs of their customers, and from obtaining the supplies that their customers demand. It is wrong to impose a penalty of that kind upon any section of the community, no matter what business they may be engaged in.</P>
    <P>A company engaged in the marketing of turf found that, although they were compelled to draw the turf 10 miles&mdash; which would mean travelling 20 miles on the double journey&mdash;they were allowed only a halfpenny per ton per mile for the drawing of that turf.  That is to say, there was a margin of only 10d. per ton between the price they had to pay for the turf and the price which they could charge.  Regulations of this kind, which impose penalties and restrict ordinary business, do not serve any useful purpose and it is desirable that the Minister for Supplies should get reliable information in every area as to the actual conditions under which the people are working before taking action.  In regard to that question of turf, the Minister may not have known the exact position from which the turf had to be drawn or the exact distance and a sufficient margin was not, therefore, allowed.  It is essential that the Minister should be correctly informed before imposing restrictions of this kind, which have the effect of curtailing business and, in many cases, restricting the amount of goods available <Col N="1260" /> to consumers in a particular district.</P>
    <P>I agree with the suggestion that something radical and far-reaching should be done in regard to the control of prices so as to prevent undue profits being made.  Suggestions have been made from different parts of the House and the Minister has invited the views of Deputies in regard to a proposal which he put up himself for instituting a flexible system of taxation for what he called &ldquo;excess profits.&rdquo;  If there is to be a system by which the different firms engaged in the same line of production will be affected, we should have regard to a matter which has come under my notice.  I have been informed that the large flour millers have made very large profits, based upon the price fixed for flour.  As against that, I have been told that some of the smaller millers have not been able to make very large profits. There is, therefore, a position of difficulty to be met so as to provide a margin which would be fair to the small producer and which, at the same time, would not be excessive to the larger producer, whose overhead costs are lower than those of the small producer. The Minister's proposal to levy taxation as he thinks fit would hardly commend itself to this House or to the country generally.  Already, we have found that, whenever the Minister was given far-reaching powers, they were used in a manner which inflicted very grave hardship on people endeavouring to carry on their business honestly, fairly and in the best interests of the community.  I do not think that this House would welcome any increase or extension of the Minister's power in regard to the imposition of a levy on profits.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that, so far as some essential requirements are concerned, such as clothing and boots&mdash; particularly children's boots&mdash;prices have become almost prohibitive.  Not only that but the quality of the goods has become so inferior that they are hardly worth purchasing at all.  In this respect, the poorer sections of the community are finding life more and more difficult.  It should be possible to make out a list of goods which are <Col N="1261" /> absolute necessaries of life and to fix a price for such goods which it would be possible for the mass of the people to pay.  As an example, I mention boots for children and strong boots for farmers and workmen&mdash;agricultural workers and other manual workers&mdash; who are exceptionally heavy on footwear. I think that a special effort should be made to keep the prices of these commodities at a low level. There is no doubt that men who have to go out in all kinds of weather to work in the bogs or on the land, particularly in the winter time, should have good boots.  Their very lives depend on having boots capable of keeping out the water.  I think whatever sacrifices have to be made, even if it were necessary to increase the price of some other commodity, we should keep the price of those essential commodities as low as possible so that the people who are engaged in important national work should be properly shod. Again, children who have to travel to school in all kinds of weather should be assured of boots at a reasonable price and of a reasonably good quality.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to rubber boots. It is known that supplies of rubber are very low, but certain things, such as tyres, are still available, and if any rubber can be made available a certain amount should be allocated for the manufacture of rubber boots which should be distributed to those doing work of a nature which demands such footwear&mdash;workers, for example, engaged in drainage work in the winter months and workers on the land.  A certain percentage of the workers on the land should be assured of rubber boots, if they can be made available.</P>
    <P>I had this matter brought very forcibly to my notice by a farmer engaged extensively in wheat production.  During the past year this farmer produced 1,000 barrels of wheat.  When I called to his place he and his sons and workers were carting manure.  It was in the winter months, and they were top-dressing the land with the manure for winter wheat and beet.  The men were sinking six or eight inches in the ground while they were taking the manure from the heap.  The farmer put it to me that if supplies of rubber could be made available from any <Col N="1262" /> source, workers such as his were entitled to such footwear as would give them ample protection.  The ordinary boots provided are not suitable for men engaged in such work.  That is only one example of the needs of people who are serving the best interests of the country during this emergency.</P>
    <P>We must also consider the position of farmers and farm workers in regard to tea and sugar supplies.  Here we have a problem which is very difficult to solve.  It is the problem of farm workers who are partly boarded by the farmer and partly boarded in their own homes, inasmuch as they must have one meal each day in their own homes and three meals on Sundays. In many cases those workers object to handing over their coupons to the farmer who is boarding them.  The farmer, on the other hand, cannot provide them with tea or sugar out of the limited ration he obtains for his own family, although many farmers endeavour to do so.  That is a very difficult problem.  The Minister may suggest that the problem could be met by the farmer insisting on the men boarding themselves in their own home, but there are difficulties in the way there. In some parts of the country it is not the custom, and in other parts of the country the men could not do it, because they have to travel a long way to their work.</P>
    <P>Then we have to consider the position of casual workers employed just for the harvest operations.  They could not be expected to supply coupons for the farmers.  So far as they are concerned, a special allowance should be made.  The allowance should be given to each farmer for harvesting operations, and it could be based on the acreage of cereal crops. It might be a small scale allowance, but no matter how small, it would be welcome.  I believe that suggestion is deserving of consideration because it would meet cases of real hardship.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>In my constituency there is no turf available, but almost every day in the week people see train loads of timber leaving different parts of County Wexford on the way to Dublin. <Col N="1263" /> I know that Dublin people have very little fuel, but the people in the towns in Wexford, and in the country districts as well, cannot see why timber should be taken every day in the week from the State forests in Wexford and brought to Dublin.  The farmers in Wexford complain that they cannot get fuel for threshing or any other purpose. I must ask the Minister seriously to consider putting a stop to the export of timber out of a county like Wexford where there is no turf.  Any turf that is burned there has to be brought from Kerry or Donegal, and there is no reason why timber suitable only for fuel should be taken out of the county. I have brought the matter to the Minister's notice on several occasions, but nothing has been done about it.</P>
      <P>We are likely to have a more serious state of affairs in the coming winter so far as fuel is concerned.  That serious position confronts both urban and rural areas.  In those circumstances, there is no reason why the Wexford timber should be taken out in such large quantities for a Dublin destination. We have no objection to the Dublin people getting a fuel supply, but we feel that it should be got from some other parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a lot of talk here to-day about turf.  I would like to suggest how it might be possible to handle the turf more efficiently and cheaply.  The turf that is transported from the different turf-producing areas should go direct to the fuel merchants' yards.  At the present time all the turf brought into County Wexford has to be conveyed to the fuel dump and afterwards carted in small lots to the fuel merchants' yards.  I think the Minister should make an Order compelling these fuel merchants to take the turf direct from the railway station or from the lorry into their yards, if they have accommodation, and to store it in their yards. Many of them, to my knowledge, have large sheds which formerly they used for the storage of coal, and, for some reason or other that I cannot understand, they consistently refuse to store more than a ton or two of turf.  We hear complaints, which are justified in many cases, that during the winter months people are getting wet turf. <Col N="1264" /> The turf must be wet if in very wet weather small lots of turf are taken out of the fuel dumps and delivered around to the different houses in the towns.</P>
    <P>That is the main reason why there is so much wet turf and so many complaints in winter about wet turf.  The fuel merchants should be compelled to take this turf and to provide storage and cover for it.  They must have a certain profit out of handling turf and delivering it to their customers around the different towns.  I see no adequate reason why they should not be compelled to bring it, in the first instance, into their stores and keep it under cover until it is needed.  I believe there is a certain additional allowance for doing that.  I do not know whether the allowance is sufficient or not, but for whatever reason, the same thing has gone on for three years and people are talking about it and wondering why the Minister for Supplies, when he is doing such good work, does not see his way to do this.  I think he knows all about it and I hope that he will again consider the matter and compel these fuel merchants to store the turf.  A great number of them are not at all inclined to handle the turf at all and would not handle it were it not for the fact that they cannot get coal.  They have handled coal all their lives and they are hostile to turf.  I know of a case in Wexford where the turf merchants had not three days' supply of turf in their yards.  Great hardship would be caused in these towns if a snow-storm should occur.  The turf dumps are a mile or two outside the town and the turf could not possibly be got in.  These merchants had any amount of accommodation in their yards but they refused point blank, to my own knowledge, to take turf from the railway station and bring it to their yards.  It could be delivered by the turf board during the summer months.  I mentioned this matter before and I hope I will not have to refer to it again because it is an outstanding scandal that this is not insisted upon.</P>
    <P>I wish to bring to the Minister's notice the question of the provision of steel milk cans used by farmers for the delivery of milk to creameries and <Col N="1265" /> railway stations.  There is a great shortage of these steel cans.  I know that it is almost impossible to get them but I would suggest to the Minister that he did receive some cream separators from Sweden during the past year and that it might be possible, in the coming harvest, to get some steel milk cans from Sweden instead of the cream separators. Farmers are finding it difficult to get any receptacles for conveying their milk to the creameries and if that were allowed to continue much longer there might be a great wastage of milk because it could not be conveyed to the cities or towns or creameries.  I hope something may be done about that matter.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the supply of nuts and bolts.  I think there is a factory in Limerick that manufactured nuts and bolts.  At present there is a great shortage of nuts and bolts used in farm machinery.  Farmers find it absolutely impossible to get nuts or bolts to repair their farm machinery. The hardware merchants have no stocks of them.  They are not available in the country.  If the Minister could make a supply of iron available to this factory in Limerick that formerly manufactured nuts and bolts, it would be a good thing.  They are needed immediately.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of leather for the repair of boots.  Some short time ago new regulations were made by the Department of Supplies with regard to the distribution of sole leather for repairs.  They do not seem to be working properly.  There is still a number of small boot repairers over the country who cannot get leather. The larger merchants are not compelled to issue a ration to all their previous customers.  There are boot repairers who are not getting their full supplies and I am told that there is some black marketing in leather.  I hope that something will be done to give each person engaged in boot repairing a ration.  They are all entitled to live. In some cases the families have been repairing boots for generations, and some of them cannot get any leather, especially sole leather.  It does not <Col N="1266" /> apply generally but it applies to a number, especially the smaller boot repairers.  It is no use leaving it to the wholesale merchant to act fairly with every one of them.  To my own knowledge they are not doing it.</P>
    <P>On the question of electricity a Deputy mentioned that in the smaller towns electricity was still being used all night.  That is true.  There is a number of pilot lights kept going in some small towns all night.  There seems to be no reason in the world why electricity should be used all night in small towns.  There are no motor cars on the roads.  There is an adequate Civic Guard force to protect the population of these towns and there seems to be no reason why the pilot lights should be kept burning all night.  With the long summer days and short nights, they could easily do without any lights but I have seen them burning from 10 at night until 4 or 5 or 6 o'clock in the morning.  A lot of electricity could be saved in that direction.</P>
    <P>The criticism of the Department of Supplies is, I think, in many directions unjustified.  I often wonder what the country would do if we had not a Department of Supplies.  I am sure that if we had not that Department during the last four years we would have had many revolutions in the country.  We could not have carried on without the Department of Supplies. I must say, to the credit of the Department of Supplies and of the officers, that they have worked very hard.  I often marvel, and I think many other Deputies marvel, as to how they got through the intricate work and built up the machinery that they have built up over the last few years.  Were it not for the efficient staffs that there are in that Department, certainly the country would be much worse off and, instead of having small difficulties in some directions, we would have serious difficulties. Taking the Department as a whole, they have given marvellous service to the community.  I think no other Department of State has, since the emergency, given anything like the service the Department of Supplies has given and are continuing to give.  They <Col N="1267" /> may annoy people sometimes but, taking them on the whole, they have given great service to the rank and file of the community.  Merchants complain because they are visited by inspectors.  Other people complain because they cannot get something they want.  They blame the Department of Supplies.  I suppose it is well to have someone to blame.  The Department has developed a thick skin by now as a result of all the abuse that has been showered on them over the last few years.  No matter what goes short, no matter what goes wrong, the Minister for Supplies is blamed.  From the opposite benches, the Minister was blamed because he did not bring in coal in 1937 or 1938, or something like that.  The Phoenix Park, or ten Phoenix Parks, would not have held all the coal that would have been needed to supply the country in the last five years.  It is nonsensical to talk at this stage, after five years of war, about scarcity of coal.</P>
    <P>The beet crop this year is not very promising and it looks as if next year's supply of sugar will be only 50 per cent. of a normal year's supply.  The Minister will not be able to give Deputy Cogan's constituents any sugar for jam, because he will not have it. I think that the people are satisfied to do without sugar for jam making.  If they can get it, well and good, but I do not think they can get it.  I do not see any hope of any sugar being made available for jam out of this year's supply.  I hope that the Minister will give some attention to the question which I raised with regard to timber being transported by rail, supplemented by lorries, out of County Wexford where we have no turf of our own and little or no timber fuel.  I hope that will not happen again.</P>
    <P>It is up to Deputies to defend the Department and tell the people when a thing is in short supply that it must be rationed and that the difficulties have to be put up with.  Generally speaking, we find that the people understand these things.  We will always, of course, have a few grousers but, generally speaking, the people have accepted the position.  It is my <Col N="1268" /> experience, from mixing with all sections of the people, that you will find more grousers in this House than amongst the rank and file of the people; that you will find Deputies trying to manufacture grievances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Allen that a Department of Supplies is very necessary during a war period, but a &ldquo;Department of No Supplies&rdquo; is of very little use, and I think we can apply that description to the present Department of Supplies.  There is another source of supply which, to my mind, is of far more importance to the community unfortunately, and that is the black market.  The black market supplies everything.  Whether it is tea, soap, tobacco, or anything else, you will get it at a huge price in the black market.  I agree that the Department of Supplies has many difficulties to contend with and has eased the situation in many ways, but it has definitely failed to control supplies. As I have said, supplies of tobacco, tea, tyres, candles, soap, and other essentials can be got practically in every village and town but at a price almost beyond what the people are able to pay.  They have to pay it, however, or do without the articles and they cannot do without them. Therefore, I say that the Department of Supplies has failed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no reason why the Department could not put through the ordinary trade channels those commodities which are to be got in the black market.  There is no use in blaming the people on the Border for supplying the black market.  The supplies come directly from Dublin.  The stuff is coming <Col N="1269" /> across and being manufactured in Dublin, but it is not going through the wholesalers to the small retailers in the country.  A small quantity is given to the small shopkeepers throughout the country in order to keep them quiet. But the vast bulk of the commodities is being sold direct to the black market by the wholesalers in Dublin, and I am not a bit afraid to say that.  Lorries come down from Dublin to distribute the stuff.  The people are being fleeced and the Department is not doing its duty.  In every country during a scarcity there is such a thing as a black market for a year or two but, after four or five years, the Department should have curbed this.  Racketeers are fleecing the public and lining their own pockets.  That should not be tolerated in a Christian country.  The Department has not done its duty and it is not doing it to-day.  At the same time, the Department has thousands of officials all over the country going into the ordinary decent traders, who always carried on business honestly, and causing them endless trouble.  In the same villages and towns you will find racketeers who are carrying on this dirty practice in an open manner and the officials passing them by or, if they visit them occasionally, they never seem to be able to catch them. Even three or four hours after the visit of such an official you can get all the commodities you want, whether tyres, soap, candles or anything else.  I think there is something wrong when these officials can call to these places and cannot find the stuff and the ordinary country &ldquo;mug&rdquo; can get the articles three or four hours afterwards.  I think there are some officials who are not doing their duty and I should like to see the officials doing their duty honestly.  I should like to see the racketeers put behind prison bars, not for a year or two, but for five or ten years, because they are nothing more than barefaced robbers.  They are fleecing the public and getting away with it.  I think the Minister should tighten things up.  I do not know whether black marketing is rife all over the country.  It may be because I live near Dublin but, so far as I can see, it is just as rife to-day as it was <Col N="1270" /> two years ago and something should be done about it.  One of the greatest grievances in country districts is that men who have to travel long distances to work on bogs and in other places cannot get bicycle tyres.  If they do get them, it is only after waiting for months and months, and then they only get a cheap kind of tyre at a big price. In most cases they have to buy them in the black market.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister if it is true that we are exporting to Great Britain a fairly large quantity of motor and bicycle tyres manufactured here.  I have not the slightest objection to that happening so long as we are able to get necessary commodities from Great Britain in return. But I should like the Minister to state whether we are exporting motor and bicycle tyres or have been exporting them during the past year.  I have it on first-rate authority that many of the large stores in Great Britain are handling a large quantity of bicycle and motor tyres which were made here. I have it from men who came home from that country and who have been engaged in handling them.  I should like to have that cleared up and to know from the Minister whether we are exporting them or not.  I have no objection, if Great Britain gives us some of the necessaries of life, to giving her in return something that she needs.  But I ask the Minister to be straight and fair with the people.  If we are exporting stuff to Great Britain, why not say so?  Do not do it in an underhand way.  Do not pretend that we would not help Great Britain during the war while, at the same time, we are exporting motor and bicycles tyres that we need at home.  I should like to clear this up now and not wait until after the war, when it will be too late.  I should also like to know if we are exporting sugar. It is my firm belief that we are exporting fairly large quantities of sugar. As I said, I have no objection, but it should be done over and above board.</P>
    <P>I am not at all satisfied with the price being charged for boots and clothing.  The price charged for boots is certainly disgraceful.  Before the war you could buy a pair of boots for <Col N="1271" /> 10/- or 12/- which would last for three years.  At present you have to pay from 35/- to £2 for a pair of boots and they will not last for three months. The same thing applies to clothes.  Four years ago you could buy a good suit for £3 10s.  At present you have to pay from £12 to £15 for a very much inferior suit.  Something should be done to curb that.  I should also like to raise the question of petrol for Deputies.  I am convinced that there is a fair amount of petrol here, and it is very unfair to Deputies, who have been elected by the people to do their work, not to be allowed petrol.</P>
    <P>I see no earthly reason why a Deputy, who is the representative of a vast number of people in this House, should not be allowed at least eight gallons of petrol a month to enable him to travel through his constituency and see the people he represents and help them in their difficulties.  I think it is most unfair that Deputies elected by the people to this House should have their cars locked up because they cannot get petrol, when they can see Army lorries, from Cork to Donegal, doing no work at all, so far as anybody can see, and sometimes with only one soldier sitting in them, being supplied with seemingly unlimited petrol. Petrol seems to be pumped into these Army lorries without any regard for the scarcity that we are told exists, and, as I say, you will see these Army lorries being driven through the country with, sometimes, only one soldier in the lorry.  I suggest that there is as much petrol wasted in two days by these Army lorries as would keep a Deputy of this House supplied for 12 months.  I think that we, as the representatives of the people, are entitled to at least eight gallons of petrol a month, and I think it is the duty of the Minister, now that a fair amount of petrol is coming in, to see that we are supplied with at least that much, because I believe we are entitled to it.</P>
    <P>There are several other things to which I have strong objection in connection with this matter of supplies, but everybody in the House seems to have been lulled into a state of <Col N="1272" /> quietude here to-day.  It would appear that they do not want to say things that might hurt, but it is the things that hurt that are generally the best, if one wants anything to be done.  I think the Minister himself will agree that he is well able to face any hurtful comment that may be made on him or his Department, and so, so far as I can see, hurtful remarks simply roll off the Minister like water off a duck's back.  Take the matter of the supply of anthracite, which affects many people in this country at the present moment.  I, myself, for instance, at great expense, put in an anthracite-burning cooker and sealed off my fireplace, but the supply of anthracite is now cut off and I have no means of cooking.  I do not suppose there are so very many anthracite-burning cookers installed in this country, and surely there ought to be enough anthracite in the country to keep these few hundreds of anthracite-burning cookers going.  Many people installed these cookers at great expense, and now find that they cannot get fuel for them.  I think that we should get more consideration in that regard.</P>
    <P>In general, it appears to me that too much bluff has been carried on in this country during the last four or five years.  I think that the Minister for Supplies is the most politically suited Minister for that Department who could be suggested for it, because he can always get up, not in this House, but in a Fianna Fáil club and make a very doleful speech, saying that we have no coal, no anthracite, or anything else, and get away with it, and then, in a few days after the Minister's statement at the meeting of some Fianna Fáil club, we find that the situation is not half as bad as he made it out to be.  It is my belief that all that kind of thing was designed with the object of showing what wonderful men the members of the Fianna Fáil Party were: that they were up to their eyes in trouble, that no supplies could be got, and that if we had not this wonderful man, Deputy Seán Lemass, as Minister for Supplies, the country would be damned and ruined entirely. For instance, we were told at one time that there was no more coal to come from England, but shortly afterwards <Col N="1273" /> we found out that the same amount of coal was coming in from England as before, and when the Minister was asked about that he simply smiled. You had the same position in connection with petrol.</P>
    <P>I say that England is giving us a decent return for the goods we are sending to her, and I think that it will be found that, considering all the circumstances, our neighbour across the water has been more than generous to us.  She has given employment to the many thousands of our people who went over there because they could not get employment at home, and has given them good wages, which they could not get here, and a proportion of which they are sending home to keep their people.  Of course, we dare not say these things because, we are told, they are politically and nationally wrong. All that kind of stuff should stop.  Let us give credit where credit is due.  Our neighbour across the water is meeting us more than half way, and I think we ought to admit it, but of course Fianna Fáil must always be trying to fool the people, and mostly the people who have to live on doles and sops.  The people are constantly being told that had it not been for three or four people in this country we could never have kept up our supplies: that these three or four people shook their fists at John Bull and he trembled, whereas the actual fact is that had it not been for John Bull this country would not be where it is to-day, and I defy contradiction on that.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Dockrell was speaking he asked where we would get supplies after the war, what means we would have of getting them, or whether any country would give us any credit.  I wish to refer him to his paper, the <i>Irish Times,</i> which quoted, some time ago, the London <i>Economist,</i>, which said that after the war we would be one of the few creditor countries in the world, and it gloated and was proud of the fact that we would be one of the few creditor countries in the world. Another question the Deputy asked was what would we do with our bogs after the war.  Now, I have another aspect of the bog situation to put to <Col N="1274" /> the Minister, so far as my own constituency is concerned.  In County Meath there is not enough bog land to supply the needs of that county, but the county council is cutting away there and, if they keep on cutting and if the war should last much longer, it will mean that there will be no bogs left there at all.  Even in Westmeath, which is able to supply its own requirements of turf, if the war should last too long we will arrive at the position where that county will not be able to supply its own requirements in regard to turf.  I suggest that in those areas where turbary is getting scarce there should be an immediate shutdown, if we are to look to the future, on the production of national turf, and that those bogs, where the area is small, should be left for private use and development.  For instance, there is a bog in the parish of Streete at a place called Inny Junction, which is only about 15 acres in extent.  To some people that might appear to be a vast area, but I understand that it is proposed to put a settlement there of people for the purpose of cutting national turf.  I am not objecting to that, but I think that experience will show that if the war should last for another couple of years that bog will be done away with in no time.</P>
      <P>I am not one of those who subscribe to the notion that we have vast and unlimited quantities of turf in this country, sufficient to provide all our fuel requirements, to supply electricity, and so on.  I do not subscribe to that idea at all.  We are living under emergency conditions at the moment, but emergencies will arise again, and the Government should endeavour to preserve those bogs with a view to future emergencies, and have some national policy of importing all the coal we can get the moment the war is over.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to take advantage of this debate to draw the attention of the Minister to one particular matter.  Recently, I think, a drive was made by the Department of Supplies to take certain small caterers off the list of people who have been receiving tea and sugar for the last five years, <Col N="1275" /> and as a result of that, in my constituency at least, certain caterers have been harshly dealt with.  The Minister's Department recently sent out forms asking that certain data as to their supplies of tea or sugar, going back to 1941 or 1942&mdash;I forget the exact date&mdash;should be furnished by these people, and because they were not able to state the amount of tea or sugar that they were receiving at that basic period, they were cut off from their supplies.  When protests were made, the answer of the Minister was that they should supply an auditor's report. Now, I suggest that in the circumstances of these people that is absolutely Gilbertian.  The idea of asking small caterers in a small town or village to supply the Minister with an auditor's report of the amount of tea and sugar that they got at a basic period, going back to two or three years ago, is ridiculous.  Some of these people do not know what an auditor is.  They never had an auditor in their places in their lives.  There was really no necessity for them to have an auditor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a great many cases these people paid cash down for the tea and sugar they bought during the basic year and I think the Minister should accept their word for it.  In many cases the word of the person from whom they bought the goods was submitted, but the Department refused to accept it. I would ask the Minister to reconsider these cases.  I do not want to mention the names of individuals in this House, but certain names have been submitted to me of people whom I know and who have been carrying on the business of catering for a very long period.  There is one case of a lady in the village of Camolin in County Wexford.  She is the only caterer in the village.  Two or three fairs are held in that particular area during the month and at the present moment there is nobody in a position to cater for the people attending these fairs. I could quote another case from Blackwater and various other cases.  I would ask the Minister not to be so drastic in the application of regulations <Col N="1276" /> in cases like that.  Surely it is too much to ask persons such as these to supply an auditor's report.  They never had access to an auditor in their lives.</P>
    <P>I should also like to ask the Minister what steps, if any, the Department takes to secure that farm labourers and road workers get cycle tyres.  We heard a great deal from time to time about the importance of farmers and farm labourers during the last five years.  Everybody in this House and outside it recognises the importance of the farmer and the farm labourer during the present emergency but, at the same time, he seems to be neglected in so far as the supply of cycle tyres is concerned.  Those who have access to country constituencies hear complaints day after day about the difficulty farm labourers and road workers experience in securing tyres. I would suggest to the Minister that he should provide some means whereby a certain number of tyres would be allocated specially and definitely for road workers and farm labourers in each county.  Deputy Giles referred to the black market, but I do not think the black market is confined to Dublin. We have a black market in various places.  One hears that tyres, tea, sugar and commodities of that kind can be procured at a very high price. One hears that tea is available at 15/- or 20/- per lb.  I suggest to the Minister that, after four and a half years of war, his inspectors at this stage should surely be able to lay their hands on people who indulge in blackmarketing.</P>
    <P>Last year Deputy Norton put down a question relating to the manufacture and export of powdered milk.  I should like to ask the Minister if powdered milk is still being manufactured and exported.  If so, I think the Minister should take steps to stop it, because everybody familiar with conditions in the country knows that the drought which we have now for a considerable time has been responsible for a reduction in the milk yield.  It is expected that there will be a shortage of butter next year in consequence of that.  I would suggest to the Minister that now is the time to conserve all the butter possible in order that people may not <Col N="1277" /> be without butter during the winter. It would be a very peculiar state of affairs if we persisted in manufacturing and exporting powdered milk when there is a scarcity and there will be a scarcity of milk and of butter in the coming winter.  I ask the Minister now if powdered milk is still being manufactured and exported, that steps should be taken to prevent it so that people may have a decent supply of butter during the coming winter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few matters to which I want to direct the Minister's attention but, before doing so, I should like to refer to a previous debate in which a Deputy raised the question of the Secretary of the Department of Supplies being closely connected with a company.  On that occasion I raised the question of the propriety of civil servants being placed in the position of directors of certain State companies.  Unfortunately, I might have conveyed the impression that I wished to criticise the present Secretary of the Department of Supplies. I should like to make it perfectly clear now that that was not my intention, and that I know of no public servant who has a better record or who has given more distinguished or unselfish service to the country than the present Secretary of the Department. On that particular occasion, due to the atmosphere which prevailed, it might have been assumed that I agreed with the particular Deputy who brought the matter up.  I should like to say definitely now that I have the highest respect and esteem, and always have had, for the Secretary of the Department of Supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few points in connection with the fuel situation which I should like to bring to the Minister's notice particularly in connection with certain villages and towns in County Dublin. In a number of these villages and towns some of the inhabitants at week-ends or during the hours in which they are not engaged at their ordinary work, cut turf either individually or with their neighbours.  While that is a highly desirable activity, a large number of other people are not able to devote the necessary time at <Col N="1278" /> the week-ends or during the week to the production of fuel.  Old people particularly are unable to go to the bogs even if the bog is in close proximity to their homes and, if they were able to go to the bog, they would be incapable of such laborious work. I should like the Minister and the Department to take steps to ensure that these towns and villages will not be left without fuel in the coming winter.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the case of one town here before and it was brought to my notice again last week, namely Lucan. While I explained to these people that there seemed to be some valid reason for the arrangement, the people there are unconvinced that there is not waste involved in transporting turf through the town into Dublin.  There are a number of villages also in which small industries are carried on and the people engaged in these industries are not able themselves to produce fuel at the week-end or during the week, with the result that in the coming winter they face acute hardship unless sufficient turf or other fuel is made available.  The agricultural labourer or person living outside a village is able to secure fuel through cutting timber or getting a small allowance from the farmer for whom he works, but small groups of people who are engaged in certain industrial work are unable to devote the time necessary or to secure transport to the bogs, and I should like to impress on the Minister the desirability of ensuring that sufficient fuel is available for such people.</P>
    <P>Another point in connection with turf production which appears to have been overlooked until recently, and in respect of which there is even at the moment dissatisfaction, so far as the bogs around Dublin are concerned, is the provision of suitable roads, both main and side-roads, into the bogs to enable the turf to be brought out. These roads for the most part have been neglected and, in numerous cases, are merely paths.  Many people who are producing turf have serious difficulty in getting to the bogs, and having gone to trouble to help the community by producing turf for their own, and possibly their friends', needs, I think some facilities ought to be afforded <Col N="1279" /> them, so that they can transport the turf with the least possible difficulty from the bog to the roadside or loading bank, so that the production of turf will be made easier for them and a drive for greater production facilitated, because these people waste considerable time and energy transporting the turf from the bog to the loading bank, due to the state of the roads.</P>
    <P>A number of traders have come to me in connection with the distribution of sweets.  They have considerable difficulty in getting sufficient sweets from the wholesalers, and, as sweets are not rationed, they have no method of compelling the wholesalers to give them what they consider a fair proportion of their pre-war or earlier years' allowances.  Some steps should be taken to ensure that wholesalers are prevented from going into the business of selling sweets as retailers, as a number of these wholesalers have done, or, at any rate, to ensure that, before they do so, sufficient quantities are made available for people whose sole livelihood is the retailing of sweets or who were in business prior to the emergency.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish mentioned the matter, which was also brought to my notice, of sugar supplies to small caterers in seaside resorts who display notices to the effect that teas will be served.  If these people, having got their ration of sugar, have to look for an increase, or if they consider that the allowance granted is not sufficient, they are asked to furnish an auditor's report.  As Deputy Corish pointed out, many of these people never heard of an auditor, and those who did never had occasion to employ an auditor, and that requirement is an extreme hardship on them.  If they are able to give fairly satisfactory proof, it ought to be accepted.</P>
    <P>With regard to price control, I do not now propose to go into the large issues to which the Minister referred, or to deal with the difficulties which he magnified in his opening address, but there is one commodity which appears to everybody to have gone practically uncontrolled since the start of the war, that is, clothing.  I do not <Col N="1280" /> know whether the Minister has bought any suits since the war, but, in the last couple of years, the price of suits has practically doubled, and there appears to be no valid reason why retailers should be allowed to charge the prices they are now charging, and no necessity for increasing prices to the level which they have recently reached.  I do not know whether they have increased commensurately the pay of their workers&mdash;I have no information that they have&mdash; and certainly no information is available that the price of cloth in unmade-up condition has increased to such an extent as would justify the very steep increase in the price of clothes recently.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to condemn some of the irresponsible statements made by Deputy Giles and definitely dissociate myself from them. There are a few Deputies who are allowed a certain licence and Deputy Giles appears to be one of them, but I do not wish to find myself associated with his statements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one important point to which I want to refer as I will not have the opportunity of putting down a Parliamentary Question in regard to it.  It is the matter of scythe blades for mowing grass.  In my part of the country and in most of the counties in Connacht, the grass is generally cut by hand and there is a very severe shortage of these blades at present.  I should like to know if the Minister can do anything about it.  Bad as the shortage is, the price is exorbitant. What is called the Tyzack blade costs anything from £1 to 35/-.  A few decent shopkeepers will sell the blades at 25/-, but even that is exorbitant. Considering that last year they could be bought at from 10/- to 15/-, I cannot understand why this year we should have to pay 25/- to 35/- for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to remind the Minister that there is yet much dissatisfaction with regard to the prices of boots, shoes and clothes.  Whether that dissatisfaction is based on wrong information or not, I do not know, but the people in my part of the country are of the opinion that the prices of these <Col N="1281" /> articles are exorbitant and that the business folk concerned are allowed too large a profit.  I have had contact with different business people and some say that even at the controlled price they can make over 100 per cent. profit. How true that is, I do not know, but I cannot see why they should tell lies.  I do not know anything about the business, but I paid ten guineas for the suit I am wearing, and I was told by a neighbour of mine who carries on business in the city here that if I had got it in Dublin I would have paid 15 guineas for it.  I was leaving an order for a suit and he asked me what I paid for the suit I was wearing.  When I told him, he said: &ldquo;If you had got a suit of the same quality here, it would have cost you 15 guineas.&rdquo; I would not be so much surprised at that state of affairs down the country, where an official of the Department of Supplies might call at a particular establishment only once in three months, but it seems strange that those excessive prices can be charged in the City of Dublin.  The Minister has now brought in a new Order controlling the price of every article on the market at the May, 1944, level. While I fully realise the necessity for such an Order, I did expect that the Minister, before bringing it into operation, would revise the prices of certain articles such as clothes and other items which in my opinion are exorbitant.  I think it is unfair to control prices at the May, 1944, level, because it was undoubtedly too high.</P>
    <P>I should also like to mention that it is very difficult to get supplies of horse-shoe iron, horse-shoe nails and blacksmiths' coal.  That may not be the fault of the Minister, but the people in the trade would welcome any steps he may be able to take to remedy the situation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Giles was of opinion that we should be very proud of the fact that we can go over to England and earn our living there.  He seemed to think that for that reason we should take off our hats to the British authorities. I never heard of anybody going over to England and getting work there simply because the English people love us.  They need us, and that is the only <Col N="1282" /> reason why our people get work there. Those of our people who get work in England have to earn whatever they find in their pay envelopes at the end of the week.</P>
    <P>Those are the only points to which I wished to refer.  I would again earnestly request the Minister to do what he can to ensure supplies of horse-shoe iron, horse-shoe nails, coal for blacksmiths, and, in particular, scythe blades, because I promised the people concerned that I would put down a Parliamentary question, but owing to the fact that the Dáil may adjourn very soon I could not receive an answer before the recess.  I trust that the Minister will give due consideration to the matters I have mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to call the attention of the Minister to the fact that in my part of the country last year a number of traders were very irritated by visits from the Department's inspectors just a few days before Christmas.  It is undoubtedly very irritating that those visits from inspectors should take place when the shop is full of customers.  It may be argued that the inspectors have to go through their ordinary routine, but I think that during Christmas week they could find sufficient work in compiling their reports on previous inspections instead of visiting busy shops and taking up the time of the owner or manager.  I hope that will not occur in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of turf production, we all know that it is a very big and difficult job to supply the need of cities like Dublin, Limerick and other non-turf areas.  Numerous complaints are being made regarding the quality of the turf supplied, and it is difficult to understand why anything other than grade A turf should be transported to Dublin and other cities.  Where there is grade B turf, it should be allowed to remain on the bogs until it is sufficiently dry, and in the matter of transport preference should be given to grade A turf.  In the case of bogs, such as those in my county, where only grade A turf is produced, they should be given first preference for transport facilities.  It is questionable whether or not the present system of turf production <Col N="1283" /> by the county councils is the proper one.  In my opinion, classification by weight is very deceptive.  The county surveyors are only human beings, and are naturally anxious to show the best returns, so that when the turf is classified by weight there is undoubtedly a tendency to allow a certain amount of moisture to remain in it.  The gangers and supervisors know very well that it is up to them also to produce big quantities.  I think it would be a much better system if the turf were graded according to quality.  Turf which appears to be fairly dry may not be of very good burning quality, and it is desirable that the turf which is brought to Dublin and other cities should be of the best grade.  I think the prevailing system of grading turf by weight instead of by quality is responsible for the high moisture content.  I know that in the Turf Development Board and in the Minister's Department there are plenty of people who are capable of seeing that the turf is properly graded according to quality, and that only the very best turf comes to Dublin.  I am very much interested in the future of the turf industry in this country, and I am quite sure that there are numerous people in our towns who, if they were supplied with turf that was up to the standard that they believed it should be, would never go back to any other fuel.  As I have said, I am not finding fault with anybody, but while we have the weight system the tendency is there not to dry the turf as well as it should be dried.</P>
    <P>There is another matter, of which I have been reminded by what Deputy Cafferky said, that I desire to bring to the Minister's attention.  I am sure that applications are flowing in by the hundred to the Minister for Agriculture for reapers and binders.  Of course, we know that the demand cannot be nearly supplied.  I wonder would it be possible to get our manufacturers of machinery implements to undertake the manufacture of the ordinary reaping gear for the ordinary mowing machine.  During the past year or two this reaping gear has been in short supply; and, in fact, could not be procured at all.  If it were possible <Col N="1284" /> to get material to make it, it certainly would be very beneficial to have it this year when there will be such a large acreage of grain crop to be reaped.  I know that there are smiths all over the country who are quite capable of making these parts if they could get the material.  One of the big difficulties is to find a second seat for these machines.  I am certain there must be a big number of old discarded machines through the country from which the seats could be collected, so that the gear that I speak of might be utilised.  Instead of looking for tractors, reapers and binders or horse-reapers, particularly in the areas where we have the small type of farmer, it would be very useful indeed if we had supplies of this reaping gear. To a considerable extent, it would help to meet the demand there is on the Minister for Agriculture to supply what he is not able to get in from outside.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>In discussing this Estimate I am sure the Deputies have no desire to minimise in any way the difficulties and complexities of the problems that are the responsibility of the Minister for Supplies.  We all appreciate that he has a difficult and complex job to tackle.  I suppose, no matter what efforts are made, there will always be a certain amount of criticism of the Minister.  He said himself that he appreciated that that was so.  I agree with him that, so far as the members of the House are concerned, whatever criticism we have to offer relates to policy rather than to the work of his officials.  I think we all appreciate that their efforts are of the highest standard.  Deputies who have to visit the Department have experienced from the officials nothing but courtesy and a desire to meet the representations they make on behalf of individual citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to a matter that I am about to refer to, I want an assurance from the Minister that there is no deliberate intention on his part or on the part of the Government behind it.  The matter is this: that I feel a definite attempt is being made to make use of, to convert, the Department of Supplies into a <Col N="1285" /> political organisation&mdash;that if representations are made to the Department by a Fianna Fáil Deputy and by a Deputy from another Party, there is a subtle difference in the letter that is received by the Fianna Fáil Deputy and the letter that is received by the Deputy of another Party.  I have had the experience myself of comparing the letters, and I think it is highly improper. It may have been accidental, but if that is deliberate policy it is highly improper.  This House should be vigorous in its condemnation of any attempt to make use of any Department of State for political purposes. The sort of reply that I have referred to conveys the idea that the representations made by the Fianna Fáil Deputy had the desired effect, while the letter going out to another Deputy conveys the simple information that the Minister has made a decision on the matter in question.  I want the House to appreciate that there is a subtle difference so far as the draft of the two letters is concerned.  I want to condemn vigorously any attempt on the part of the Minister's Department to make use of a State Department&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as other Departments are concerned, I have not got a trace of that in them.  I have compared replies received by individuals down the country which emanated from the Minister's Department.  It may be accidental as I have said, but I want an assurance from the Minister, when replying, that that is not deliberate policy, because if it were, it would be contemptible and highly improper if any Department of State were going to be used as a political Department.  The <Col N="1286" /> Departments here are national services maintained by the taxpayers.  They are not the property of any political Party and neither is the Civil Service the particular service of any political Party. They are all State services.  I want to make it perfectly clear that so far as civil servants are concerned their attitude to Deputies generally could not be questioned.  They are courteous and anxious to do what they can for them. I am merely referring to the letters that are sent out in reply to representations that are made, and I would be glad to have an assurance from the Minister on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister invited the House to discuss price control and the operation of the Standstill Order.  Unfortunately, I was not present to hear the Minister's statement, but I understand that he dealt at length with this whole problem of price control.  I agree that it is not a simple matter.  It is highly complex and has a variety of aspects. I am not satisfied that many of the prices in operation, and fixed by Order of the Minister, are justified in present circumstances.  Other Deputies have referred to the price of clothes.  When one takes into account the price of the raw material, and makes allowance for whatever increase has resulted from increases in wages, I do not think that the ultimate price charged for clothes can be justified in our circumstances. The price of raw materials for the agricultural industry can scarcely be justified either.  We have been told that the farmer and the agricultural community generally are comparatively well-off to-day.  That may appear to be so, judging by the substanstial increase in the prices which the agricultural community are receiving for their produce.  It may appear at first sight that they are well-off, but the costs of production are a very different matter at the present time.  In my opinion they are proportionately higher than the prices which the farmer is receiving for his produce.  That is a very serious matter.  Some Deputies mentioned sweets.  I know a particular agent of a big manufacturer here, who was working on a salary and commission basis, and who went around the country for weeks <Col N="1287" /> boasting that the amount of commission he was drawing on the sale of sweets ran into four figures.  He was showing his cheque around to the public.  Just imagine a man selling sweets on salary and commission and his commission running into four figures.  I do not know much about sweets, but that indicates that there must be a very substantial margin to play with between the traveller and his agents.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons why I say there is room for considerable criticism in regard to the system of price control is that the Minister has not taken the people sufficiently into his confidence. He may tell us that he has had consultations, but I do not think he has consulted people sufficiently on these problems.  He should have at his disposal advisory committees on all these matters&mdash;even from his own point of view, to save himself from criticism. If Deputies understood that there were properly constituted advisory committees, representing the producers and consumers, they would have to accept the decision, if the Minister were able to say: &ldquo;I have all that machinery and have put the problem before them; they gave me advice on it and the decision I have put into operation is their decision.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister feels that he himself and his civil servants are so expert on these complex matters that they are capable of making a decision, without consulting with other people at all.  Sometimes, when individuals are consulted, they do not appear to be the right individuals in the circumstances. My criticism all along, so far as the fixing of prices is concerned, is that the Minister should look into it from the consumers' point of view, taking all the ramifications into account.  It is a matter of consulting the right people and the Minister has not gone far enough at all in that direction.  Where there is a shortage of essential goods and where there must be control, to ensure equitable distribution and a fair price, one can understand that drastic action is very often necessary; but there are sometimes complaints that severe <Col N="1288" /> measures are taken against individuals in this respect.</P>
    <P>Some decent, reputable traders have been brought into public odium.  The Minister should have some regard for that aspect of the problem, as it gives the poorer classes the impression that some man is robbing them.  Sometimes, we hear too much about racketeers and the black market, and every man in the commercial life of the country is suspect.  It is true that there are people in the black market here, and getting away with it, very few of them being caught; but, unfortunately, in our attempt to stop them, we have brought into court reputable traders and honest men under certain emergency Orders, holding them up to disgrace and to public odium.  That is bad policy and creates a false impression on the public generally.  If we have not some regard for the good conduct of an individual who is supplying a large area of the country, it does not look very well for the future of the country.  We deliberately give people the wrong impression that a man is taking advantage of a situation, when he is brought to court merely for accidentally overcharging a penny or two.</P>
    <P>I have in mind a particular man, who is a tremendous asset to a backward part of the country.  He does not happen to be in my constituency, but I know the facts very well in his particular case.  The auditor stated in court that he had examined 1,500 items in that man's books and there were two cases of overcharging&mdash;one of 2d. and another of 3d.  The Minister's inspectors, having gone through the books and gone through the 1,500 items, saw fit to prosecute.  Does this House approve of that method of trying to enforce Emergency Powers Orders?  Surely, that is not the type of individual to bring into court and hold up to all the odium attaching to that sort of prosecution?  It reminds me of the busy policeman, chasing a fellow who has no lamp on his bicycle, while there is a robbery going on at the other end of the street.  That is the result of the close supervision that the Department is giving to matters of that sort at the present time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1289" /> We are told stories, and I have heard that there is a certain attempt now made that is completely foreign to the methods of administration in this country&mdash;that is, the <i>agent provocateur.</i> I know one particular case, in the town of Athy, where attempts were made to provoke an individual to commit a crime of that sort.  I am sure that does not meet with the Minister's approval and I have no doubt that he has not given any such instructions; but where a number of individuals is employed on temporary work of that sort, we must be careful that they are thoroughly instructed as to the manner in which they should carry out their duties.</P>
    <P>In regard to the keeping of records, the small rural shopkeepers and hucksters have experienced a lot of difficulty.  Some of them are almost illiterate and do not understand these records.  The inspectors have not been at all helpful, but apparently, are anxious all the time to catch someone and get a case, at all costs.  That is a wrong attitude.  The inspectors should adopt an attitude of helpfulness, especially where there is no desire on the part of an individual citizen to break the regulations in any way.  If he has failed to comply with an Order through ignorance, or through failure to appreciate its implications, and has no desire to overcharge, and if the inspectors are satisfied that he is a good citizen, there should be co-operation and anxiety to help that trader in his difficulties.</P>
    <P>I have had experience of one particular man who has a grocer's establishment and a chemist's shop.  He looks after the chemist's end of the business himself and has a manager for the grocery department.  He got into some difficulty about his records and was very worried about them.  He remembered that, over the wireless, the Minister asked for the co-operation of traders in the matter of supply and distribution.  On the Minister's invitation, he wrote to the Department, saying that he had got into difficulties about his records and indicated generally what was wrong&mdash;that he had trusted the manager to look after the records.  He asked for an inspection of the whole matter, so as to have his <Col N="1290" /> records straightened out, to see that he complied with the regulations.  Two inspectors were sent down, as a result of that invitation, and there was a prosecution of that man, who was sincerely worried about his position.  It was merely a technical offence, a matter of complying with certain regulations, as he had not overcharged. His manager had assured him that everything was all right and, when he discovered they were not right and invited the co-operation of the Department, taking the Minister at his word, he was prosecuted.  If that is the policy of the Department it is not going to get co-operation along such lines.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Beegan's remarks with some interest.  In his own way Deputy Beegan makes very useful suggestions.  The suggestion he made about grading turf was not made here for the first time.  It is altogether wrong to have turf sold on a weight basis.  That is an inducement to people who produce and sell turf to preserve the moisture, rather than to dry it out.  Human nature being what it is, we should take the human aspect into account, that people will be tempted to sell water instead of turf. While we base the unit of sale on a weight basis rather than the volume we are going to have bad turf with a high moisture content.  I do not come from a turf district, but practical men who come from turf districts offered suggestions to the Minister over and over again.  They know what they are talking about; they know everything about turf because they have been watching it being produced all their lives.  When suggestions come from practical men they should be examined. If they are not examined what is the use of discussing this question or what is the purpose of this Parliament?  Is the advice of sincere men to be turned down because armchair producers in some Department in Dublin decide otherwise?  I have not yet met technicians who were not beaten by practical men who knew the ins and outs of production from start to finish. Invariably it is found that technicians and practical men agree in the end. Where there is a difference of opinion <Col N="1291" /> practical men's suggestions are always found to be sound.  One man may have certain theories, but practical experience is better.  Deputy Beegan dealt with the position in a practical way when he said that even county surveyors, in order to show good results to county councils and county managers, would be tempted to preserve the water rather than to dry it out of turf.</P>
    <P>The Minister was very complimentary to the new Shipping Board.  I suppose so far as the operation of the ships goes the position is highly satisfactory. Deputy Dillon suggested that although the members of the board give their services free, and have not looked for any reward, there are other ways and means of making money out of it.  I am sure the Minister will deal with that aspect in his reply.  He informed the House that the British Admiralty had withdrawn shipping from here.  I imagine that is because of the Second Front operations.  Can the Minister give any information as to when that shipping may be restored and as to future supplies of petrol, kerosene and coal?  It would be of interest to the House and the country if the Minister could make a statement holding out any hope in that respect. On the question of supplies and distribution, the Minister indicated that two-thirds of our shipping capacity is being used in the transport of imported wheat.  That is a very impressive figure, notwithstanding all our efforts at wheat production.  One of the problems confronting the country, particularly the agricultural industry, concerns supplies of artificial manure. Despite the substantial subsidies being paid for the production of phosphates we are still severely handicapped by shortage, and I appeal to the Minister to make every possible effort to get increased supplies of artificial manures.  We got a very small quantity of nitrate of ammonia, but it was negligible having regard to our requirements. I often felt that the efforts made by the Department to secure essential supplies of that kind, particularly sulphate of ammonia, could be made in a more impressive way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1292" /> Speaking in the National University some months ago the Minister boasted that our exports were double our imports, and that when dealing with post-war supplies we were building up sterling assets that could be used to secure capital imports.  Strange to say the first day the House assembled after the general election the Minister for Agriculture remarked, possibly in the heat of the moment, that imports did not matter.  I do not know which policy is the policy of the Government &mdash;that of the Minister for Supplies or that of the Minister for Agriculture. I would not be inclined to rely too much on the building up of sterling assets, or that we will be permitted to use these assets in the post-war period. No matter how willing the British Government would be to agree to the use of the assets they may find it expedient to liquidate their debts in goods, so that our aim ought to be to extend production, particularly agricultural production, because that will always be the great medium of foreign exchange.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am arguing that we cannot import if we do not export. Supplies generally are our biggest problem, and the raw materials for agricultural production are artificial manures.  They are essential imports. We have failed to secure supplies of sulphate of ammonia except in small quantities.  Two or three years ago, when we were discussing this matter, the Minister pointed out that our power to bargain was nil and that the sooner we made up our minds about that the better.  I do not think that the method which the Government and the Minister have adopted of making representations in the matter of supplies to the British Government through civil servants is the most effective method that could be adopted.  I pointed out here before <Col N="1293" /> that, notwithstanding what the Minister said about our power to bargain being nil because the commodities we exported in the past&mdash;butter, eggs, bacon and so forth&mdash;have now disappeared, we have an outstanding bargaining weapon in our dairy stock. We should appreciate the problem which Great Britain has had during the war, and still has, regarding her milk supply and we should have regard to her public health policy to increase the consumption of milk.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether or not the Minister realises that Great Britain is surreptitiously raiding this country of her best milkers and of her best maiden heifers.  I am not against that.  I believe that it could be developed still further and that not merely could we supply our own requirements but that we could have a substantial and profitable monopoly export-trade as well. This is the only country where Britain in the past got basic stock for dairy purposes and it is the only country in which it is likely to get such stock in the future.  Strange as it may seem, we are able to produce better and more suitable stock for this purpose than they are capable of producing themselves. There are qualities in our soil peculiarly suitable to that purpose and we have not utilised that asset to the extent we might.  They have been taking all the available surplus dairy stock for the past three or four years and we could have said that we appreciated that they had a milk problem and try to utilise that as a bargaining weapon.</P>
      <P>As regards supplies of nitrogenous manure, that is a synthetic product manufactured by Imperial Chemicals.  A good deal of sulphate of ammonia has found its way from across the Border into the black market here and I think that that position could have been rectified by Ministerial contacts with the other side.  The British have never acted the part of Shylock or looked for their pound of flesh.  If we put up a reasonable business proposition, they were always prepared to have a deal with us.  While the Minister fails to make any effort in that respect, I shall continue to be critical of the methods used in attempting to secure essential supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1294" /> As pointed out by the Minister for Finance, Great Britain has, notwithstanding all the difficulties, released a considerable volume of essential goods to this country.  On that basis, one could argue convincingly on the lines on which I am attempting to argue. Definite efforts should have been made to obtain supplies on the lines I have pointed out.  It should have been explained that we were anxious to cooperate so far as food production was concerned, and that we could only cooperate on the basis of some effort on their part to supply us with essential raw materials.  Whatever surplus resulted from those efforts would be to their advantage because we can only consume what will fill the stomachs of our people.  If our resources were properly organised and utilised, we should have a very substantial surplus for export.  Much more could have been made of that situation than was made, and the House is entitled to be critical of the Minister's attitude. Sending a civil servant to the telephone at this end to get in touch with his counterpart on the other side, or with the High Commissioner, is not sufficient.  In the post-war period, capital goods to replace worn-out machinery, provide for the mechanisation of agriculture and to replenish the larder of industry must, eventually, be paid for out of our surplus agricultural production.  Bearing that in mind, the Minister seemed at one time to have been thinking along the line that we were building up sterling assets which could be used in that period.  Even at the present time, we should be making better use of our position.</P>
    <P>The whole method of producing and selling turf appears to be very costly. Deputy Beegan is perfectly right when he says that there is no justification for the weight basis in regard to turf. It is an inducement to preserve the water in turf rather than produce good, dry turf.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LaurenceJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. L.J. Walsh Mr. L.J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L.J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I had no intention of taking part in this debate but I think I should be failing in my duty if I did not challenge Deputy Hughes to produce proof of the charges he has made <Col N="1295" /> against what I consider one of the best Departments of State&mdash;the Department of Supplies.  I think that every Deputy must have had experience of dealing with that Department and I challenge Deputy Hughes or any other Deputy to produce proof that favouritism is shown to Government Deputies in that Department. I think that that was a very unfair charge to make against a Department and, particularly, against officials who cannot defend themselves. It is fortunate for that Department that it has a very able Minister who can defend it against all comers and against all forms of attack.</P>
      <P>We hear a great deal about supplies and about fault being found with the Department for taking action against certain people for overcharging.  It strikes me that if some Deputies had their way we would have the quota removed and the black market welcomed and certain individuals would be waxing fat upon the people.  I have no doubt the Minister will not give way to those appeals.  I urge the Minister not to waver in his determination to protect the plain people against the racketeers and those who carry on the black market in this State. The Minister for Supplies would be failing in his duty if he relaxed by one iota the instructions he has issued to his Department to see that the people are protected from these perils. There is no Deputy who is not well aware that, in every city, town and village in this State, there are people watching for an opportunity to indulge in the black market and wax fat upon the people.  In my view the Department of Supplies deserves the gratitude of the people for the way in which it has protected them during this emergency.  I only hope that the Minister will continue to see that those instructions are enforced and that the people will be amply protected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that the Minister is aware of the important part that cement plays in the life of the community.  I do not think there is any item in the country outside the range of foodstuffs which is of more importance, especially from the point <Col N="1296" /> of view of employment.  The lack of cement has paralysed the building industry and I would be failing in my duty if I did not emphasise the grave unemployment which the lack of that one commodity is causing.  I will ask the Minister to use his very great powers to see that cement is brought back into the market as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the remarks made by Deputy Dockrell.  I hope the Minister will be in a position to tell us to-night that the supply of cement will be resumed as speedily as possible.  I am quite aware that owing to circumstances over which the Minister has no control the supply of cement has ceased.  Let us hope that that is only a temporary thing.  I must impress on the Minister the necessity of conserving whatever cement supplies remain for the use of builders who at the moment are engaged in the building of houses.  Some of these houses are very near completion, but, owing to the scarcity of cement, the builders will not be in a position to finish those houses which are so badly needed by the people. These people have to put up with great inconvenience occupying rooms, often enough in tenements, while waiting for the houses to be completed.</P>
      <P>Another reason why I should like the Minister to clarify the situation as soon as possible is that the employers who answered the call sent out by the Minister, when he exhorted them to keep in employment as many of their men as possible, should be given an opportunity of seeing where they stand.  I am interested in the building trade and I know that many employers, when they have a good staff, do not like to dismiss anyone.  At the same time they cannot continue paying men who are doing very little work, if any.  These employers enter into contracts after very severe competition. They would like to know their position in regard to future supplies of cement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister asked for our ideas in relation to price control.  That is a very difficult matter on which to give an opinion.  We Irish people have never <Col N="1297" /> been amenable to discipline and we might as well own up to that.  When the Minister controls prices he is blamed, and he is also blamed if he does not control them; if he prosecutes people he is blamed, and if he does not prosecute them he is still blamed.  We draw all sorts of comparisons with the British.  The first thing we try to do is to circumvent whatever Orders are made by the Minister.  I have witnessed people giving 1/- or 2/- more for a certain commodity notwithstanding that they were warned by the Civic Guards that they should not do so.  At times I have the utmost sympathy with the Minister in his difficulties.  I hope Deputies on the opposite benches will not be offended at what I am going to say.  You are all shouting: &ldquo;Stand by Dev.&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ireland needs Dev. and we should obey him.&rdquo;  So far as I can see, people obey him only on the day of the election and they do not seem anxious to obey his orders when his Government is elected.  The extraordinary thing is that many of the people who are his greatest supporters are the very first to go against the Orders made by his responsible Ministers, and those who, possibly, vote against the Government are the people who, as far as is humanly possible, are anxious to carry out whatever Orders are made by the Minister.</P>
    <P>As regards turf, many suggestions have been made about the quality and the quantity of turf.  We are told it should be graded.  I know very little about turf, but I can tell by experience I have had in other directions that so far as turf is concerned you could not grade it, and I say that with all respect to Deputy Beegan.  In the first place, you would lose a lot of time examining the turf and you would have to deal with it almost sod by sod. You must take into consideration also the question of the spread ground.  If people were to allow turf to remain on the spread ground until it was absolutely devoid of moisture, you would cover all Ireland with it.  You must get the stuff away in order to make room for the new turf.  It has been suggested by Deputy Allen that as the turf comes in from the turf-producing areas it should be put into <Col N="1298" /> the merchants' yards.  Most of the merchants can accommodate only very little turf.  When 20, 30 or 40 wagons arrive you have to get the turf to the dump.  There is a certain amount of waste and the cost is increased by the handling.</P>
    <P>That is what you are up against, and Deputies must recognise the fact that, as regards the turf produced in Donegal or Galway, if any of us got a present of it, it would cost us about £4 before we had it delivered in our backyard.  It has to be handled for the purpose of transport and again handled when put into ricks, and we must take into consideration the segregation of the wet from the dry turf and conveying it to the dumps. Every operation adds to the expense. I cannot see how we can have cheap turf.  It was stated that turf was sold at 25/- to 30/- per ton.  I rather think it was 25/- to 30/- per creel&mdash;some little cart holding 4 cwt. or 5 cwt.  I would like to see turf sold at 35/- or £2 a ton, but I cannot see how it could be done.</P>
    <P>Neither can I see how the private producer can produce turf in the way suggested here.  Deputies have mentioned the organisation of private producers in order to produce sufficient turf to meet at least some of our requirements.  It is all right for private producers to produce sufficient turf for themselves, but where is the guarantee that in the winter 450,000 people in Dublin, 40,000 people in other cities and 15,000 to 20,000 people in various towns throughout the country will be supplied with all the turf they need?  I suggest there must be some central authority, someone in supreme command, some big organisation that the Minister can hold responsible for the production of turf.  It is a good thing to have as many private producers as possible; each in his own area will help to fill a gap, as it were, and relieve the situation as far as possible; but I have come to the conclusion that although it may be a little more expensive, you must have some central authority that will guarantee to the people in our cities and towns a sufficient quantity of turf when they need it.  As regards the question of coal for steam threshing engines, I wonder could the Minister <Col N="1299" /> take steps to have a certain quantity of coal imported for that specific purpose. There is a certain amount of reluctance on the part of owners of threshing sets to use turf and sticks owing to the danger of fire during threshing operations.  I would ask the Minister to do all that is humanly possible to have a sufficient quantity of coal for these threshing engines imported between now and the threshing season.</P>
    <P>We all know that there is a shortage of many commodities.  We all know that many things are dear.  Of course, that is due to the difficulties of getting raw material.  It was stated to-day that the cost of a suit of clothes at the present time is from 12 to 15 guineas. I think that is exaggerated.  I think you can get a very good suit of clothes for from eight to nine guineas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to get the raw materials and consequently everything has increased in price.  Reference has been made to the increased cost of turf.  The men who are making the turf are entitled to increased wages to meet the high cost of living.  Nobody will begrudge them their few shillings a week but that is one of the factors that contribute to the increased cost of turf.  We cannot have it every way.  I would particularly press upon the Minister that he should clarify the position so far as cement is concerned because that is one of the things that affect employment at the present time.  Those engaged in the building trade are handicapped enough by lack of materials, especially timber and other goods required for the building trade without having this primarily essential commodity taken off the market.  I hope the Minister will be in a position to announce at an early date that the various factories in the country will be able to resume the manufacture of cement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I, perhaps, was unduly optimistic in raising the general question of price control policy in the <Col N="1300" /> course of this discussion because there is, I understand, a general feeling that it is desirable to terminate this session of the Dáil and, consequently, there is a natural reluctance on the part of Deputies to initiate a debate upon what is a matter of intricate policy.  I think Deputies, however, might have left it at that rather than make the excuse that they had not got enough information to enable them to offer a firm opinion upon the issues of policy to which I referred.  I do not think that there is much difficulty in procuring the information necessary to arrive at a decision, and in fact these issues were raised by me in the Dáil before, and I presume Deputies at the time gave them consideration.  Certainly, the Parties that have frequently referred to price control in the past, who have criticised the Government's administration of price control, might reasonably be expected to have considered these issues on their own initiative, not when they were raised by a Minister in the course of debate.  No information is required to enable the various Parties in this Dáil to decide upon the main issue of the price control policy.  There are only two courses possible.  These courses were explained to the Dáil before.  They were explained again this morning.</P>
      <P>We can have a policy designed to maintain employment even if it means higher prices or we can have a policy designed to keep prices down even if it means more unemployment.  No information is required to enable a decision to be made as between one course and the other.  The Government decided in favour of a policy of maintaining employment even if it meant higher prices.  We knew that that policy would lead to a rise in prices to a level higher than would otherwise be necessary.  We knew we would be criticised by people who would object to that rise in the prices level, that we would have statements made, such as were made to-day by Deputy Morrissey, that the cost of living was being allowed to rise unchecked and that the resulting price situation would be attributed to Government incompetence rather than to a deliberate decision on policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1301" /> Now we have, in the circumstances created by the shortage of fuel and electricity, decided temporarily on the reverse policy.  We have decided that, instead of maintaining employment even if it means higher prices, we will for the time being keep prices at a standstill even if it means unemployment, even if it means that we have to do without certain supplies or to face a reduced output of certain goods. Deputies have been non-committal in relation to that policy.  Deputy Dillon said that it is an impracticable policy, that the Government were foolish to have decided upon it because the Department of Supplies could not administer it.  I agree with him if it is to be regarded as a permanent arrangement.  I think it is a practicable policy for a temporary period because the social and economic consequences of it in a temporary period will be offset by the voluntary action of employers in maintaining their workers on their wage lists provided they can feel that, at a later stage, the original policy of the Government will be restored.</P>
    <P>It is, however, between these two policies that choice must be made.  It is between these two policies that the Government chose in the past and those who want to criticise the Government must also choose between them. They certainly cannot have the advantages of both policies and if they are prepared to agree with our view that the circumstances of this country required that we should maintain employment at the maximum level even if it meant letting prices go higher than they otherwise need be, then we ask them not at the same time to criticise the Government for not keeping prices at the lowest possible level.  We could undoubtedly bring prices down substantially but at the expense of closing down a large number of factories and putting a big number of people out of employment, cutting every uneconomic and unnecessary cost in every sphere.</P>
    <P>This matter of price control must not be mixed up with the subsidiary matter of profit control.  There is a problem in relation to profit control which I also put to the Dáil and on which I asked the opinion of the Parties in <Col N="1302" /> Opposition.  We controlled the profits of trading firms, whether manufacturing or distributing firms, by making arrangements with them or giving them directions as to the maximum amount of profit they can make in a trading period.  But, as I explained to the Dáil, one can never find out if, in fact, these arrangements are being adhered to until the period is over, until it is possible to get the accounts for the period and examine them and see whether the firm did or did not exceed the profit which was deemed to be reasonable.</P>
    <P>The weakness of our system of control is that, at that stage, the only alternative is to require the firm to give back the excess profit, if there was an excess profit, by maintaining prices in the subsequent period at a lower level than would otherwise have been approved.  It is true that some proportion of the excess profits is taken by the excess profits tax for the benefit of the Exchequer.  But, even in connection with that tax, there is, as I explained previously, a repayment clause which requires the Exchequer to repay the amount of such tax to the firm concerned if, in some subsequent period, that firm makes losses.  Quite a number of firms, appreciating the importance of having that credit established during the war because of the possibility of losses in the immediate post-war period, are not on that account as concerned as they should be in keeping profits within the limits deemed reasonable.  You, therefore, have a position in which the penalty for taking profit in excess of that considered reasonable is not sufficiently severe to deter firms from taking the risk that will develop.  Can we improve the penalty?  It is because I believe that we can improve the penalty and make it unlikely that firms will take the risk that I offered the suggestion to-day that we should have some device by which the whole of any amount earned by a firm in profits over and above the amount considered reasonable should be absorbed into the Exchequer.</P>

Our obligation is only to repay, in the event of losses, a substantial portion of the amount paid in taxation.  In Great Britain it must be repaid whether there is a loss or not.</P>

      <P>Reference was made to the prices charged for drapery goods, particularly for boots and shoes.  The House is aware that an elaborate system of control was brought into operation in respect of drapery goods in July last year which involved the fixation not merely of manufacturers' prices of all commodities, but the determination of margins which could be charged by wholesale and retail traders.  That system has been in operation only since July.  While I am prepared to agree that the margins fixed were liberal, it is not yet evident that these margins were such as to enable the traders concerned to make an undue profit.  I do not say that that case cannot be made.  In fact, I am arranging to have the question of the margins allowed to these wholesale and retail traders re-examined with a view to reduction.  I think they can stand a reduction.  But it will be understood that these margins were fixed upon the normal practice of these traders.  There is this difference, that, in normal times, although a trader in drapery goods might endeavour to secure 50 per cent. upon the cost of goods when determining the selling price, in practice he would sell certain ranges below that margin and secure an over-all return upon all his sales of less than that.  At present it is possible for a trader to secure the fixed <Col N="1305" /> margin upon all goods sold and, consequently, he earns a somewhat higher profit than he would in normal times, even though theoretically working on the same margin.  However, the margins fixed for the distributive traders in respect of drapery and boots are to be reviewed in the light of the experience since the control came into operation.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Dillon that the price of pollard is too high.  However, we did not fix the price of pollard in relation to its economic value or to its cost of production.  We fixed it in relation to what the Minister for Finance is prepared to lose on the sale of pollard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in the case of pollard.  Pollard is the by-product of a subsidised commodity and the higher the price we can get for it, the less has to be paid in subsidy, and the lower the price we get for it, the more has to be paid in subsidy.  The price fixed was deemed to be the price at which the material could be sold having regard to the price of other feeding stuffs.  It was not sold at that price.  This year there happens to be a fair supply of other feeding stuffs and the demand for pollard is less than had been anticipated when the decision was taken to increase the extraction from flour. The decision, however, is mainly one for the Minister for Finance, because of course, if the price has to be reduced, it means that he has to foot a larger bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Even the information it does contain might have been of some use to the Deputy.  The Deputy got all his facts wrong.  I think he was referring to the peninsular trade.  In fact, none of the ships of Irish Shipping, Limited, have been engaged upon that trade.  Traffic to peninsular ports has been taken by means of smaller ships owned by private shipping companies, although these ships at present operate under Government direction.  The ships of Irish Shipping, Limited, are engaged entirely on the Atlantic trade. Managers of the ships are not paid upon a percentage basis.  I understand that the practice is that there is a management fee fixed at a flat rate per ship per year.  Certainly the total of the management fees would be considerably less than 1 per cent. of the freights earned.  Deputy Dillon says, however, that freights are high and that Irish Shipping, Limited, are making substantial profits, or rather that they were endeavouring to secure that the entire cost of these ships would be liquidated by the freight earned by ten voyages.  That is so wide of the mark that it is impossible to know what he is driving at. Freights are high for a number of reasons.  I must concede that the ships were dear.  We purchased these ships in abnormal circumstances and paid a price for them far above what would have been the normal peacetime price for vessels of the same size. The cost of operating these ships is high.  The ships, as I say, are operated under abnormal circumstances.  They are not allowed to take an outward cargo.  The entire cost of operating these ships, both out and in, must be borne by the cargo inward, as there is no outward cargo at all.  They have to follow a roundabout route which is determined by the Government of another country and not by ourselves.  That route, moreover, is <Col N="1307" /> not the most economical route, and the high war risk insurance charges have to be met both in respect of the ships and the cargoes carried by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>But they are not any higher than they would be if they were not being paid to the company itself.  The net result of all this is that freight charges are substantially higher now than they would be in peace times.  There is very little profit made by the company on freights, and although I concede that the company is making big profits, it is mainly as a result of their entry into the marine insurance business, and not on freight charges, and its insurance charges at the open market rates. Nobody in this country has to pay more in insurance, and it is by reason of the entry of this company into the marine insurance business that its strong financial position has been realised, and that is costing the persons who are importing goods to this country not a single penny, besides which, it has caused the retention in this country of huge sums of money that would have had to be paid and would have left this country in other circumstances which, fortunately, did not arise.</P>

      <P>The company insures the ships and their cargoes, and also the aeroplanes operated by Aer Lingus, Teoranta.  I was asked by a Deputy whether it would be possible to maintain the turf ration this year.  I think so but, although it has been a good year, we are faced with the problem of transport.  The supply of turf has <Col N="1308" /> never been a problem of production, but mainly of transport.  Even though all the turf we require may be there, it still has to be transported.  However, we think we can do it, but we aim not merely to transport the amount of turf required to maintain the ration, but an additional 200,000 tons to supply fuel for industries to which coal can no longer be supplied. It is partly as a result of the arrangements that had to be made to get that additional 200,000 tons that the change in regard to the supply to the institutions of local authorities was decided upon.  These local institutions always wanted to buy their supplies from private producers, but they were prevented from doing that because it was felt that it would tend to force up the price of privately-produced fuel, and that the charge would be unduly high.  We have now decided to allow them to do so in order to release the supplies of national turf that were previously kept for them.  Deputy Roddy asked why turf is costing more this year than previously. It is because of the rise in the rate of wages.  That is the only reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not let these local institutions buy turf for their requirements in their own areas?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The turf to which I am referring is required immediately for industrial purposes, and I want to put emphasis on the word &ldquo;immediately.&rdquo; If we had more time we could, perhaps, retain the original policy, but it is because of the fact that on the 1st July, we want this supply of turf for industrial purposes that we have decided to allow the county councils to make arrangements to replace that turf by getting it from private producers for the winter months.  Deputy Roddy also asked about the different prices as between privately-produced turf and county council turf.  County council workers operate on the basis of a 48-hour week, or on the basis <Col N="1309" /> of a 54-hour week, whatever the local basis may be.  It will be obvious that private producers, producing the quantity of turf that the county councils produced, would be charging much the same price as the county councils.  It is the vast quantity that we require which makes it necessary to adopt the more costly methods the county councils are employing.  If we only wanted the quantity that private producers are capable of supplying, then we could get it at a much lower price, but it is because we want very much more turf than that, that we cannot hope to meet our needs from the production of private producers alone.  In fact, the various attempts that have been made to organise private producers and get them to extend their production of turf for national fuel were not very successful. I do not say that they were unsuccessful, but they did not produce anything like the quantity of turf required for national fuel.  The cost of the production of turf, of course, varies from bog to bog, and nobody could attempt to say what it would be without knowing the circumstances of each bog.</P>
      <P>I was also asked by a Deputy about the provision of petrol for the transport of turf from the bogs.  That petrol is available, and has been available during the present month.  I do not know what the position is in regard to the availability of lorries.  That may be a local transport problem, which I cannot deal with now, but so far as the transport of turf from the bog to the town is concerned, petrol will be available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps so, but I suggest that it might be better for the Deputy to take up that matter with the Great Southern Railways.  With regard to the position of sugar, may I say, in reply both to Deputy Morrissey and Deputy Giles, that no sugar is being exported?  We do export condensed milk, in the manufacture of which a certain quantity of sugar is used.  We have always had an export <Col N="1310" /> trade in condensed milk, and we propose to continue it because it must be remembered that, in return for the condensed milk we export to Great Britain, we get back from the British tin containers for its preservation.  It is an obvious and practical arrangement that we should continue that export when, in return, we are getting the tin containers, not merely for the condensed milk which we export, but also for the condensed milk for our home supplies.</P>
      <P>With regard to supplies of sugar for caterers, it was obvious that the demand on hotels, restaurants, and other caterers, would increase as a result of the limitation on the supply of such commodities as sugar, tea, and so on, to the ordinary households.  More people are eating out, and the demand on hotels and restaurants has been increasing because they need more for their increased custom resulting from the limitation on households, and every one of these hotels and restaurants seems to be having a business boom, which leads them to adopt every possible device to get more sugar.  One of the devices adopted by them was to make an inaccurate return of the amount they got in the datum year. Where we found that they had made inaccurate returns, we endeavoured to penalise them by cutting down their current ration, to recover the amount they had been getting in excess.  That seems to me to be only fair, and I think it would be very unfair to other traders that those traders who had got an unfair advantage as a result of inaccurate returns should not be penalised when the matter was discovered.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cosgrave referred to certain difficulties in connection with the distribution of sweets. Most of these difficulties are due to the fact that a number of sweet manufacturers who are entitled to a supply of <Col N="1311" /> sugar as manufacturers and who are also sweet retailers, have been diverting a larger proportion of their output to their own retail shops at the expense of other retail customers.  We are getting after these people and we shall make some arrangement which will ensure that the retail customers of these manufacturers will get their proper supplies.</P>
      <P>Deputies will appreciate the impossibility of making any specific statement as to the likelihood of an adequate supply of paraffin oil or candles for domestic lighting purposes in the coming winter.  I think we shall have a situation in which we shall be able to give as large, if not a larger, ration of paraffin oil during the winter months as last year or the previous year but the stuff is not here yet. Deputies will appreciate that that hope on my part is of no real significance until the material has arrived.  Indications are, however, that we may get a supply of paraffin oil which will enable us to give as good a domestic ration for lighting purposes as last year, possibly better.  As a matter of fact, in the case of candles we are making arrangements for the importation of materials required for candle manufacturing.  If these materials arrive, we shall be able to increase the output of candles.  I am hoping that they will arrive although certain difficulties have arisen in connection with that matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not enough candles to ration and I can see no method by which we could ration candles.  Anyway, it would be ludicrous to ration candles because we might find ourselves in the position in which we could give only one candle every three months or some such insignificant ration.  We would have to get a much larger quantity of candles before we could enforce any rationing system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell, and I think Deputy Coburn, urged that we should try to increase the output of cement, and Deputy Norton asked that we should <Col N="1312" /> give some definite indication as to what the situation in regard to cement is likely to be.  I mentioned in the Dáil a short time ago that we had stopped the manufacture of cement.  By that device, we saved 2,000,000 units of electricity this month.  I stated at the time that we could not hope to continue that saving.  The manufacture of cement must be resumed.  In fact, we shall have to begin the manufacture of cement earlier than anticipated because stocks in the hands of the wholesale distributors appear to be less than was assumed, but the extent to which it will be possible to maintain the output of cement is somewhat difficult to forecast.  Every effort will be made to maintain cement production at the maximum level because we appreciate its importance in relation to employment.  I think we shall be able to ease the situation in July because there is a certain quantity of clinkers which requires only to be ground.  It might be described as partially manufactured cement which can be turned into cement by the use of much less electricity than the complete manufacture of cement would require. I might say, however, with regard to Deputy Norton's representations as to the building of a cinema at Athy, that I would regard such a project as occupying a very low place in the priority list.  In any event, I would probably be doing the promoters a good turn by withholding cement in that case because they would not be able to get electricity at present to run the cinema.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1313" /> Deputy Dillon urged that we ought to curtail public lighting.  We have tried to curtail public lighting.  In fact the distribution of electricity for this month is based on the assumption that its use for public lighting will be reduced by one half.  We are not imposing by Government Order any specific restriction on public lighting, but we are endeavouring to secure the co-operation of public authorities in a reduction in the consumption of electricity for that purpose.  The Electricity Supply Board is conducting a campaign along those lines and is endeavouring to secure the maximum saving.  So far as the total cessation of public lighting is concerned my Department would have no objection.  The objection came from the Department of Justice which visualised a very difficult police problem in the absence of public lighting, and also from certain other Departments. It was considered undesirable to cut out all public lighting but the consumption of electricity for public lighting is almost insignificant in relation to the consumption for domestic use and industrial purposes. The total consumption for public lighting is about 100,000 units.  That is very small in relation to the total consumption of householders and industrial users.  When I mention that for the manufacture of cement alone the normal consumption is 2,000,000 units per month, the small proportion required for public lighting purposes will be realised.</P>

      <P>It includes public lighting for the whole State.  Deputy Giles asked about the exportation of motor and cycle tyres.  I explained the situation in regard to that matter to the Dáil before.  When the Japanese invaded Burma, our supplies of raw rubber were dried up and there was no prospect of getting further supplies. We did, however, succeed in making arrangements under which we got certain quantities of rubber partly for the manufacture of tyres for our own use, and partly for the manufacture of tyres for export.  If we were not prepared to export tyres, we would get no rubber, <Col N="1314" /> so that instead of losing tyres by that arrangement we are getting tyres which we could not procure otherwise.</P>
      <P>The only other matter which calls for comment is that some Deputies referred to the possibility of discourtesy on the part of inspectors of the Department. Inspectors are given specific instructions to be not merely courteous in their relations with traders but that their function is not so much to catch out traders as to help them.  I am quite certain that most of the complaints that are made concerning the conduct of the Department's inspectors come from people who have been irritated by the fact that they have been caught out.  Traders, however, must be equally courteous to the inspectors.  Our Department's function is to enforce these regulations, and I shall not accept from anybody the contention that failure to keep records is a trivial offence.  Anybody who gets a supply of tea, sugar or butter for the purpose of distributing them to their customers and who decides that he is going to black market portion of these supplies, has first to fake the records.  Failure to keep proper records is the first step in any black-marketing operation. When a trader is found to have faked his records so that a quantity of tea, sugar or butter supplied to him cannot be accounted for, that leads to a prosecution. If the failure is due to a mistake or to inability to understand the forms there is no prosecution.  In that case the inspector fills up the forms for the trader and explains how he is to deal with them in future.  Where, however, the failure is clearly a cover-up for the illegal sale of some of the commodities concerned we prosecute and it is only where there is positive evidence of deliberate irregularity and excessive prices that the prosecution is followed by withdrawal of the trading licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the matter of prices control, Deputy Hughes appears to have the impression that we do not consult with traders or with advisory committees. We have so many advisory committees that it would take me half an hour to read out the list: I told Deputy Hughes before that there was full consultation in these matters, but I cannot <Col N="1315" /> get the Deputy to understand that. In matters affecting various trades there is full consultation, not merely with advisory committees established by the trades but very frequently with every individual firm in the trade concerned. I think I told the Dáil before that most business people complain that they spend more time in serving on these advisory committees than they do in the management of their own business.</P>

      <P>As far as tyres are concerned, I cannot promise any system of allocation for road workers or farm workers.  I have been frequently urged to allocate tyres to workers on essential services, but there are not enough tyres to enable that to be done.  If we were to adopt a system of that kind for road workers or turf workers, we would leave many other classes, whose work is equally essential and who require tyres equally as urgently for their work, without any supplies at all.  The only practical system is to distribute the tyres to the various traders in relation to the traders' previous sales and to rely on the traders, subject to the maintenance of records and the check on the records which the Department imposes, to see that they go to the people in greatest need of them.  I am not quite sure that I understand the point about the powdered milk.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked your permission, Sir, to raise the subject matter of Question No. 18 on the Order Paper, because I regarded it as a matter of very great importance at present for a number of reasons which I propose to set out as briefly as I can.  I asked the question for several reasons, the first being to try to ascertain from the Parliamentary Secretary if he is aware of the very considerable dissatisfaction that exists throughout the country with the method by which the emergency old age pension allowances are being investigated and paid.  My second reason was that it appears to me that an injustice is being inflicted on applicants for these allowances in that they have to undergo a further means test to satisfy the local authorities that they qualify for these allowances, and the third reason is that I believe&mdash;and I think this opinion is widely shared throughout the country &mdash;that these allowances ought to be paid in the post office to persons in receipt of 10/- per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understood the Parliamentary Secretary to say that he was not aware <Col N="1318" /> that there was any dissatisfaction.  I am afraid I can only differ from him on that point.  I do not intend to say anything further on it, except that I am quite satisfied that there is very considerable dissatisfaction with the whole scheme.  It was intimated in the Press a considerable time ago that the allowances would be payable from early in April.  In fact, in certain parts of the country, the allowances have not yet been paid, or at least were not paid up to last Saturday.  It is also a fact that a number of people were unaware of the method by which they should seek payment and were unaware, as I have personal knowledge, that they could be regarded as eligible for such allowances.  It is a further fact&mdash;and I say this with considerable pride&mdash;that a large number of people would suffer any humiliation in the matter of poverty rather than apply to the public assistance authority for assistance.  I am glad to know that that is so, and I say it without desiring to cast the least reflection on the unfortunate people who have no option but to apply for home assistance, because I think their position is one which commands sympathy in every quarter of the House and outside it.</P>
    <P>The applicant for an old age pension has to satisfy the pensions committee or the investigation officer, and ultimately the Parliamentary Secretary himself, that he or she does not possess means exceeding £15 per year.  I think it would not require very much imagination to regard that as a state of necessity, without any further inquisitions into the means of a person in that position.  Means of £15 odd per year is the figure beyond which it is not possible to get an old age pension of 10/- per week and all the public demands in recent months have been made with a view to an alteration or raising of that amount.  When the question of an emergency old age pension allowance comes up for consideration, that, in my opinion, is the figure which should he regarded as rendering all applicants for this money eligible.  The fact that they have 10/- per week is proof that their means do not exceed £15 per year.  I am satisfied that an applicant has to prove the most <Col N="1319" /> complete poverty before he or she can qualify for this allowance and I regard that as a reversal of the whole policy in relation to the payment of this allowance.  An arrangement should have been made to pay this money at the post office.  The present method is unsatisfactory.  It is unfair to the old people and it tends to maintain for them the stigma which many of them rightly object to.</P>
    <P>There is nothing further I need say on the matter, except to ask the Parliamentary Secretary very sincerely to have the whole matter reconsidered, to take steps at the very earliest possible date to have it reconsidered in such a way that these allowances will be paid at the post office, that the people who receive 10/- per week at present, having had to submit to a means test already, should not be compelled to submit to an additional means test&mdash;a rather odious means test in certain cases&mdash;in order to obtain this money.  I urge him to put the matter beyond all doubt and to consent to the money being paid to the post office and to leave whatever financial adjustments are necessary to be undertaken afterwards so as to give effect to the spirit of the scheme in the manner in which it should be given effect to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJosephBroderi" hpid="Mr. Broderick Mr. Broderick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to supplement what Deputy Murphy has said.  The Parliamentary Secretary has stated that he is not aware of any dissatisfaction, but he ought to be aware of it on the basis of evidence submitted by the Cork County Council in a letter setting out all the points in respect of which there is dissatisfaction which were brought to the notice of the Minister for Local Government during last week's debate and to which he did not reply.  Persons have to apply to the home assistance officer for payment of this half-crown allowance.  The pension is payable at the post office and frequently the home assistance officer lives six or seven miles away, which means that applicants have to pay ? each way in bus fares, so that they get nothing at all.  The council of which both Deputy Murphy and I have the honour <Col N="1320" /> to be members has made an offer to the Minister, which we would like him to consider very carefully, and that is that the pension officer should pay out the 2/6 on our undertaking to reimburse the State.  I think that is the best way of getting over the difficulty. Again, to emphasise what Deputy Murphy said on the question of the means test, your letter to the managers of the different counties&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's letter was of a very rigid nature.  In the first place it said that they must await applications, and no steps were taken to inform the people that they were entitled to this 2/6&mdash;no steps other than the activities of various politicians going through the country. Many people are still unaware that they are entitled to this amount.  The next point is that it is obligatory on the manager to satisfy himself, on the conditions laid down by the Minister, that those people are entitled to this benefit, which brings us to the second means test.  I think all those points negative any benefits that are to be derived from the extra 2/6.  In the first place, there is the humiliation of having to apply to the board of assistance; in the second place, there is the difficulty of collecting the amount owing to the necessity of going to the home assistance office; thirdly, there is the question of the means test.  All those things go as far as possible to negative the benefits of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>When this scheme was first announced through the newspapers I thought that the old age pensioners were to be paid this extra 2/6 in consequence of the increased cost of living.  It was understood by everybody who was drawing the old age pension that that amount would be automatically paid with the pension, <Col N="1321" /> and even now a great many people are not aware that it is necessary for them to get an application form from the county manager before they can claim this extra 2/6.  I know many people in my own native county who, up to yesterday, were not aware that it was necessary for them to fill up an application form.  Like Deputy Murphy and Deputy Broderick, I know many people who will never make such an application. They have never before applied for home help&mdash;they would consider it a humiliation to have to do so.  We all know that a great many poor people in this country have been striving to live for years, almost in poverty, rather than apply for home assistance.  As Deputy Murphy has pointed out, it is absolutely necessary for some people to apply for home help, and there is really no disgrace about it.  Nevertheless, there are many people in the country who are too proud to make such an application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first instance, before the old age pension was granted, a very rigorous means test was applied.  Anybody who is a member of an old age pensions' committee knows the gruelling time that an applicant for old age pension has to go through.  In those circumstances, one would think that the extra 2/6 would automatically be paid. Those people have to go to the post office on Thursday or Friday as the case may be to draw their pensions, and they should not be asked to go to the home assistance office to draw the 2/6.  Owing to the way in which this scheme is being administered, the Minister and his Department have done nothing but humiliate those whom it is supposed to benefit.  Last week, when the Estimate for the Department of Local Government was under consideration, various Deputies drew the Minister's attention to the position which existed in the country in consequence of the way this scheme was being applied, and the Minister did not give any satisfactory reply.  As a matter of fact, he dealt very lightly with it in the course of his speech.  I join with Deputy Murphy and Deputy Broderick now in urging the Parliamentary Secretary to ask the Minister and his Department to make some Order whereby this 2/6 would be given <Col N="1322" /> automatically, through the Post Office, to those who are already in receipt of old age pensions, and who, apparently, even the Minister and his Department think are entitled to an increased sum owing to the increased cost of living.</P>

      <P>It is refreshing to observe the innocence with which Deputies approach this question, in the light of the fact that the Estimate providing the money to make this supplementary allowance operative was before the House as late as last week, and that this specific matter was raised by many Deputies and dealt with in considerable detail by the Minister in his reply.  The House unanimously approved of the Minister's Estimate&mdash;and mind you, that Estimate included under sub-head J, as I mentioned to Deputy Murphy to-day, the condition that &ldquo;the supplemental allowances will be payable by public assistance authorities to persons of the classes indicated who are members of necessitous households, and reside in areas to which the scheme of food allowances (provided for in Vote 71) does not extend.&rdquo;  That scheme of administration was accepted by the House as late as last week.</P>

The fact remains that, as late as last week, the House unanimously <Col N="1323" /> accepted this method of administration.</P>

      <P>I believe that, if Deputy Murphy had been here last week and had heard the Minister's reply, this question would not have been raised on the adjournment.  The Minister fully explained the position last week, but Deputy Murphy was not here, and now we have a repetition of the debate on an Estimate which occupied a considerable portion of the time of the House last week.  There is very little I can add to what the Minister said then.  In fact, I do not think I can usefully add anything.  I realise that Deputy Murphy has not yet had an opportunity of reading what the Minister said.  I do think that, when he reads the Minister's speech, he will appreciate the futility of raising this matter again by means of a question on the adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJosephBroderi" hpid="Mr. Broderick Mr. Broderick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say, in reply to the Parliamentary Secretary, that the Cork County Council offered to reimburse the State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps Deputy Broderick would allow me to make the very brief statement that I have to make.  It is true that only members of necessitous households will be eligible for this supplementary allowance.  That is set out in the sub-head under which the money is provided.  The Dáil has approved of that and, therefore, I do not know how Deputies propose to alter that condition.  It is true that the scheme provides that 25 per cent. of the cost is to be raised by the local authority out of the rates, and that the House has approved of the administration of this supplementary allowance through the public assistance authority.  If the public assistance authority is to be responsible for making a rate to meet 25 per cent. of the cost, then it must make the necessary inquiries in order to satisfy <Col N="1324" /> itself that the people who are going to benefit by the supplementary allowance will, in fact, be in need of it.  That is all it is required to do. Presumably, Deputies are aware that this supplementary allowance is not in substitution for home assistance, and neither is it necessary that an applicant for the supplementary allowance should be in receipt of home assistance. But it is necessary that the public assistance authority should investigate each claim, and satisfy itself that there is need in the home in which this 2/6 per week is to be added to the pension.  I may mention that the 2/6 per week may be paid in cases other than those receiving the 10/- a week pension.  A public assistance authority may find that recipients of a lesser amount of pension than 10/- a week are in need of the additional 2/6.  So far the discussion seems to have been based on the assumption that only recipients of 10/- a week will be eligible for the allowance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I would draw the attention of the House to two points particularly in the letter which was issued on the 16th March, 1944, on this matter. The first point to which I wish to draw the attention of the House is in reply to the statement made by Deputy Broderick, that the local authority must await an application from a proposed beneficiary.  The letter says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The local authorities may await a submission by pensioners or persons in receipt of disablement benefit resident in the rural portion of their districts of applications for supplementary allowance.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The local authorities may await&rdquo;. Now, there is a difference, I think, between the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; and the word &ldquo;must&rdquo;, and I think I may leave it at that.  Clearly, if a local authority is already satisfied, through the machinery of its public assistance administration or public assistance <Col N="1325" /> officers, that certain old age pensioners are in immediate and urgent want, it need not necessarily wait for an application within the terms of that letter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJosephBroderi" hpid="Mr. Broderick Mr. Broderick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>In effect, it does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like to draw the attention of Deputies to another paragraph in the letter which says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Any supplementary allowance given must not be in substitution for any home assistance which may ordinarily be given by the public assistance authority in cases coming within the categories mentioned.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, if the terms of that letter have been departed from: if the spirit of that communication has not been observed, well, that is a matter that we can look into when we receive complaints on that score.  I do not question the accuracy of Deputy Broderick's statement.  I have not personal knowledge of it, but I am quite sure that what he says is strictly true: that the Cork County Council, the local authority of which he is a member, has made representations on behalf of the public assistance authority.  What I want to convey to Deputy Murphy is that we have not had complaints from private individuals, but local authorities have complained because they would prefer not to have the trouble of administering this supplementary allowance.  I do <Col N="1326" /> not deny that we have had complaints from local authorities, but I repeat that we have not had complaints from applicants who would be entitled to benefit under the scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJosephBroderi" hpid="Mr. Broderick Mr. Broderick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>You have that letter from the Cork County Council in the Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not denying that, though I do want to say that it has not come to my personal knowledge.  I do not doubt for a moment what the Deputy says, but that does not alter the position.  My statement was that individuals have not complained.  Presumably, one local authority has complained. I cannot hold out any hope to the House that there will be any alteration in the administration of this scheme.  As long as the local authority is responsible for a proportion of the cost of these supplementary allowances, it will have to satisfy itself that the beneficiaries are entitled to benefit.  The local authority will have to raise 25 per cent. of the cost, and the State will refund 75 per cent. of the cost of the scheme.  It is unlikely, until, at any rate, we have had much more experience of the administration of this benefit, that there will be any alteration in the method of administration.</P>
