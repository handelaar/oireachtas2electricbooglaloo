      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that many urgent and needed road works which may be performed under the Minor Improvement Schemes have been abandoned because of the refusal of one or more of the parties to give the necessary consent to the execution of the work; and if, in view of the hardships inflicted on the consenting parties by the said refusal, he will consider the advisability of acquiring compulsory powers in such cases.</P>

      <P>I am aware that cases of the kind referred to by the Deputy sometimes occur. Since, however, the primary purpose of these schemes is the relief of unemployment and as the number of cases in which compulsion would be necessary is relatively small, I do not propose to seek compulsory powers to deal with them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether he is aware that the quantity of turf produced in 1943 could have been considerably increased if workers had been given a reasonable supply of cycle tyres; and whether, in view of the urgency for increasing production during the present year, he will now review this position and instruct retailers of cycle tyres to give preference to such persons during this turf season.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say to what extent, if any, the production of turf in 1943 was affected by the shortage of bicycle tyres.  The maximum quantity of rubber consistent with the maintenance of essential transport services has been allocated for the production of bicycle tyres.  As regards distribution, I would refer the Deputy to the replies which I gave on the 20th October, 24th November, and the 1st December, <Col N="3" /> 1943, to questions regarding distribution of cycle tyres, in which I indicated that it would be quite impracticable to differentiate between the many and varied classes of persons requiring bicycles for essential purposes, or to give preference in such distribution to any particular class.</P>

      <P>Up to 26th May, 1941, the briquettes produced at the Lullymore Factory were disposed of through the normal channels of the trade, for the most part to regular coal and turf merchants in Dublin City.  Since 26th May, 1941, the entire output of the factory has been taken by Fuel Importers (Éire), Ltd., with the exception of a small quantity of broken briquettes which were disposed of locally and a limited quantity which was made available to the Great Southern Railways and <Col N="4" /> to the Emergency Scientific Research Bureau for experimental purposes.</P>
      <P>The briquettes purchased by Fuel Importers (Éire), Ltd., are held as part of the fuel reserve; the only sales being those made through licensed fuel merchants to charitable organisations of different denominations for free distribution to the necessitous poor.

      <P>I have in my hand a card&mdash;it is numbered in the 400's&mdash;and the person who paid 2/- for this card is entitled to and receives a bag of briquettes delivered to his home. Those briquettes were not weighed on delivery.  Persons have been prosecuted for selling briquettes and other turf commodities under weight. I wonder whether the Minister will make investigations as to whether they carry out distributions to the necessitous poor.  The card in my hand is from a home where the income is over £5 a week.  I have additional cards where the weekly income of the family is £10 a week.  Would the Minister distinguish them as necessitous poor or just poor?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he has considered the desirability of holidays with pay for agricultural workers; and, if so, whether, in view of the vital service being rendered by these workers to the whole community, and the necessity of encouraging them to remain on the land, he is prepared to <Col N="6" /> bring them within the provisions of the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1939.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1939, was being framed the desirability of bringing agricultural workers within its scope was fully considered and it was decided that, having regard to the conditions under which farm work is carried on in this country, that course was impracticable.  I do not consider that any change has taken place in the circumstances since then which would justify a departure from that decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether representations were made to him on behalf of Cavan Urban District Council to have the legal expenses incurred in connection with the Cavan Convent Fire Inquiry defrayed out of the Exchequer; if he has refused this request; and whether, having regard to the fact that the inquiry tribunal was set up by a resolution of the Houses of the Oireachtas, and one of its objects was the guarding against the occurrence of such a calamity in Government controlled institutions of the kind in the future, he will reconsider his decision and thus relieve the ratepayers of Cavan Urban District of the heavy burden of 2/3 in the £ incurred in assisting the tribunal in the investigation of the cause of the fire.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.  The request for payment of legal expenses was not acceded to because I had no power to defray expenses of the Cavan Urban Council or other witnesses at the inquiry.  The urban district council appeared before the inquiry on their own initiative as was only to be expected they would since they are the responsible fire fighting authority in the urban district, and the expenses involved in doing so fall to be met by the council as any other legal expenses incurred by them in the discharge of their duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the latter part of the question, the Deputy is apparently unaware that on the 9th December last the urban council unanimously passed <Col N="8" /> a resolution requesting sanction to temporary borrowing for the purpose of meeting the legal expenses incurred by them in being represented at the inquiry.  In the circumstances of the case borrowing was sanctioned on the 12th January last, the loan to be repayable over a period of three years. The annual charge on the rates for that period would be about 7d. in the £.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, did the Minister, before making his decision, advert to the fact that when introducing the resolution in the Dáil on 3rd March he stated that the object was not to find a scapegoat or to attach blame to any particular party?  How can he reconcile the imposition of a rate of 2/3 in the £ with that statement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty whatsoever.  The purpose of the inquiry was to ascertain the causes of the lamentable tragedy and to see what steps could be taken to prevent a recurrence of such happenings in the future.  The fact that the Cavan Urban District Council felt called upon to be represented at the inquiry is a different matter.  So far as the imposition of a rate of 2/3 in the £ is concerned, I am not imposing the rate.  The urban district council must meet its liabilities.  They incurred the liabilities and in those circumstances they must meet them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health why he refused to sanction an increase in wages of 4/- per week to road gangers and machinery workers in the employment of the Wexford Council, after it had been recommended and approved of by the council and county manager respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>When an additional increase of 4/- a week was sanctioned for road labourers, bringing their pay to 39/- a week, the road gangers already had 44/- a week.  The rate of pay to road gangers is generally 1/- a day more than road labourers, and a further bonus of 4/- a week would represent a higher rate than appeared to be necessary.  The rate of bonus sanctioned in the case of gangers was accordingly 2/- a week.  That rate was also approved in the case of machinery workers, who are receiving wages ranging from 43/- to 75/- a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to understand from the Minister's reply that he considers that 44/- a week or 48/- a week would be too much to give a man who is trying to keep his wife and family? Would the Minister say how he reconciles that answer with the answer given to me on 3rd November last, when he stated that that was more or less a matter for the local authorities? Is the Minister further aware that special provision was made by the Wexford County Council to enable them to pay in the coming year the increase for which they asked sanction?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to all these supplementary questions, all I can say is that there is obviously in present circumstances need to relate more closely the remuneration paid to road workers and persons in ancillary positions to the wages which it has been decided can be paid to agricultural labourers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister give us some idea as to the particular class of worker to which he compares a ganger?  He has already, as far as I can ascertain, sent a circular or sent some intimation to county managers that when an increase is conceded to agricultural labourers some increase can be given to road workers and those in positions such as foremen. Surely it is not suggested that £2 4/- or £2 6/- or £2 8/- is too much for a man with a wife and family.  Is the Minister further aware that, in consequence of the scarcity of petrol, there is more work and responsibility <Col N="10" /> placed upon the gangers' shoulders now than there was pre-war?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit, Sir, that the Minister in his reply has compared the increase given to road workers with the increase given to agricultural labourers.  I asked him if he is now in a position to state what is the proportionate increase given to agricultural labourers since the beginning of this war or the beginning of the emergency and the increase given to road workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I say that that is a question of which I should be given notice.  I might say that I am surprised that Deputies who used to contend that the agricultural labourer was the most underpaid employee in the country should now be suggesting that some other better-off persons should enjoy the same relative increases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>From what the Minister has just said it is obvious that he is merely trying to explain away the fact that he is completely ignorant of the increases granted to agricultural labourers since the beginning of this emergency.  The Minister, in his reply to the question on the Paper, compared the increase given to agricultural labourers with the increase given to road workers.  I am asking the Minister, arising out of that specific question, whether he will state for the information of the House the increases over pre-war rates granted to agricultural workers and road workers respectively?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if his attention has been called to the fact that a considerable number of non-manual workers have suffered the loss of their benefit rights under the National Health Insurance Acts because of their remuneration being brought above the sum of £250 per annum as a result of bonuses granted under the provisions of Emergency Powers (No. 260) Order, 1943; and, if so, whether, in view of the hardship which this involves for the workers concerned, he is prepared to take steps to remedy the grievance by ensuring that in such circumstances they shall not be excluded from the provisions of the National Health Acts.</P>

      <P>Representations on this matter were received from Cumann an Arachais Náisiúnta ar Shláinte.  As regards the latter part of the question non-manual workers are not automatically excluded from health insurance when their remuneration exceeds £250 a year.  Such persons on ceasing to be compulsorily insurable remain insured persons, and retain any title to benefit arising out of their previous insurance, for a period of 12 calendar months from the date of the last contribution paid in respect of them.  This period of 12 months is extended by any periods of incapacity, of which due notice is given, which occur whilst they remain insured persons.  It is open to the persons affected, if they so desire, to become voluntary contributors provided they satisfy the necessary conditions. By doing so they will safeguard their rights to future benefits under the Acts.</P>

      <P>Marriage allowance is a contribution towards the cost of maintenance and accommodation of a soldier's family and as such it is paid to the wives of all soldiers on the married establishment irrespective of their places of residence provided that they are not separated from their husbands for reasons other than the exigencies of Army service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a soldier had been resident in <Col N="16" /> Great Britain and left his home in that country to enlist in the Defence Forces, marriage allowance is paid to his wife even if she continues to reside in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>If a soldier's family resides in Ireland and if his wife, who previously resided in Great Britain, returns to live with her own relations on account of a serious breakdown in the state of her health, she would still be paid marriage allowance, or if she returns to Great Britain for domestic reasons of a temporary nature, for example, to take care of a sick relative, payment of her allowance would continue for a period of three months.</P>
    <P>If, however, a soldier's wife has been living in Ireland and she goes to Great Britain to obtain employment it cannot be contended that her separation from her husband is due to the exigencies of Army service and in such a case the payment of her allowance is stopped.  It is not agreed that in such a case where the wife leaves her husband, her home and her family, the stoppage of payment of her allowance is not consonant with recognition of the importance of the family unit, and it is not proposed to alter the existing regulations or procedure in this connection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Kenny Estate, Rossdarragh, Record No. S. 8291, comprises 547 acres vested in the Land <Col N="19" /> Commission but for which a division scheme has not yet been completed. In the usual course the lands were put up on 4th February last for letting by public auction in portions for grazing and conacre for the present season. No adequate bids were made at the auction, save in the case of some 65 statute acres let in conacre for £160. This letting was subsequently surrendered by the lessee owing, it is understood, to inducements made to him locally.</P>
      <P>Some time after the auction a group of six local farmers approached the auctioneer, who made a letting of 380 acres to them at an agreed price.  Lettings of the tillage portion not disposed of at the auction were made by the auctioneer about the same time to some of the local small farmers who had it last year.  The 65 acres surrendered were also let to the parties who had rented that area last year, at the same rate as they had been let at the auction.  Thus the position now is that the whole estate of 547 acres is let to local people.</P>
      <P>There is no foundation for the suggestion that &ldquo;outsiders were brought in by the Land Commission for the purpose of pushing up the price&rdquo;. Obviously at a public auction it is open for anyone, local or otherwise, to bid and all bidders are welcome. The local people cannot reasonably expect to get the land below its public letting value, and the Land Commission will not countenance any attempt to intimidate bidders.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (2) to insert the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2) Sub-section (1) of Section 3 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the addition to paragraph (e) of the following words, that is to say &ldquo;including the operation of lighting and extinguishing streets lamps maintained by a local authority where such work is done by persons who are the whole-time employees of such local authority employed to perform such work.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The grounds on which I move this amendment were indicated on Second Reading.  It appears to us that it was intended that certain categories of workers should be covered by the provisions of the original Act but that, for certain reasons, they were not brought within the framework of that Act.  This is an attempt to remedy that omission.  <i>(Amendment read.)</i> It is my submission that, inasmuch as the Principal Act specifically includes under the definition of &ldquo;industrial work&rdquo; the work performed by local authorities, it is invidious and unfair to this particular section of the employees of local authorities that they should be excluded from the benefits of the provisions of that Act.  I think that advantage should be taken of the present occasion, when the original Act is being amended, to have them specifically included, and that will be effected if this amendment be adopted. In clause 3 of the Principal Act, where the forms of agricultural work are defined, it is laid down that work done for or in connection with a local authority is industrial work.  In the <Col N="24" /> actual interpretation of that Act, certain doubts have arisen as to the applicability of that section to the class of workers covered by this amendment &mdash;lamp-lighters.  A similar question arose in regard to another section of workers, and was contested in the courts.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why this particular class&mdash;lamp-lighters&mdash;should not be brought within the scope of the Principal Act.  The reason given by the Minister on Second Reading was that certain difficulties might arise in regard to the hours of work of these men.  While that difficulty may present itself, it is merely, a drafting difficulty which is implicity in the task of drafting any Act which sets out to remove grievances of a complicated nature.  Inasmuch as the Principal Act does distinguish between two main classes of workers&mdash; those on ordinary, daily work and those on shift work&mdash;and makes special provisions in the case of shift workers, I cannot see any reason why, if this amendment were accepted, the necessary consequential amendments in the Principal Act could not be drafted and included in the present Bill so as to permit of the inclusion of this class of workers&mdash;lamp-lighters&mdash; on a basis somewhat similar to that of shift workers.  These consequential amendments would follow from the adoption of this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1937" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Senior) Mr. Larkin (Senior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Senior)</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be agreed that the men who do the electric lighting of our city under the Electricity Supply Board are within the Act and this amendment merely affects those men engaged in lamp lighting.  On occasions, they do material, industrial work.  If a lamp has gone out and needs to be refurbished, these men, who are practical men, have to get to the inner workings of the lamp and apply their knowledge and technique to its correction. I should be glad if the Minister could see his way to include these men.  They have long hours.  They go out on different shifts but their work is in nowise different from that of the men engaged in connection with safety lamps in the street.  These may <Col N="25" /> have to go down at all hours of the night and correct them.  That is done by electrical workers or men associated with electrical workers.  Then we have the case of the gas workers. I do not think that you could argue that, where you have two different classes of workers providing the lighting service for the community, there should be discrimination.  I do not think there would be any difficulty in drafting an amendment if the Minister appreciated the position.</P>

      <P>I do not think that Deputy Larkin (Junior) was correct in saying that certain categories of workers, intended to be covered by the 1936 Act, were found, in the event, not to be covered, and that it is necessary to remedy that position.  So far as I know, no category of workers intended to be covered by that Act is uncovered. The 1936 Act was intended to be one of a series.  That fact is sometimes lost sight of.  The Government accepted the position that it was responsible for imposing by law minimum conditions of employment in respect of all those who work for wages. It recognised, however, that the conditions of employment of various classes of workers required different treatment, that you could not have the same code of law for industrial workers as for shop workers, that you could not have the same code for shop workers and transport workers or for transport workers and domestic workers.  The 1936 Act dealt with industrial workers.  Subsequently, shop workers were the subject of legislation, and the much more intricate problems connected with transport and other classes of workers were being considered when the programme was interrupted by the emergency.  It was decided not to proceed with the programme until something approaching normal conditions had been restored. Now, I think it is very undesirable to attempt to include within the scope of an Act designed to protect the conditions of industrial workers those who are not industrial workers.  Their circumstances are different, and the form of legislation designed to secure protection for them must be different.  I <Col N="26" /> think that these workers are within the class that we describe as domestic workers.  That term may be a bit confusing, but it serves.</P>

      <P>They are not industrial workers.  Neither is it correct for Deputy Larkin to say that these particular individuals have long hours. They have, in fact, a 44-hour week which is less than the maximum prescribed in the 1936 Act.  So far as I know the only difference which would arise if they were brought within the scope of the 1936 Act is that instead of three and a half hours on a Sunday they would work three hours.  If they worked three and a half hours on a Sunday they would be entitled under the 1936 Act to 24 hours continuous rest.  Therefore, if they were brought within the scope of the Act the only alteration in their conditions of employment which the Dublin Corporation would have to impose, in the case of these workers, would be to reduce the duration of their work on Sundays from three and a half hours to three hours.</P>

      <P>Two spells of one and three-quarter hours each.  I do not want to be taken as saying that there is not some case for reconsidering the position of these workers.  I have not examined it for the purpose of determining whether there is or is not, but I do propose to resist the attempt to deal with whatever problem is there by dragging these workers within the scope of the 1936 Act, an Act which was designed to deal solely with the case of industrial workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pointed out, on the Second Reading of this Bill, that this legislation was designed to create minimum conditions of employment enforceable by law, and that there was, of course, nothing which prevented better conditions being secured by negotiation or by the willingness of employers to afford better conditions.  It seems to <Col N="27" /> me that, instead of trying to deal with this class of worker to which the 1936 Act was not intended to apply, by an amendment of this kind to that Act, that the employing authority should be approached.</P>

      <P>The class of worker which comes within the scope of the 1936 Act is not decided by reference to the person who employs him.  The same employer may employ industrial workers, shop workers, agricultural workers and transport workers.  The definition was drawn up in relation to the class of work done, and not to the class of person who gave the employment. Conceivably the Dublin Corporation has workers of every class.  I imagine they are mostly industrial workers who come within the scope of the 1936 Act.  Even a farmer may employ a worker on industrial work.  If so that worker will be entitled to all the protection which the 1936 Act gives.  Similarly, an industrialist might employ a farm worker who would be outside the scope of the Act.  While that is so we must not try to deal with the employment of non-industrial workers by bringing them within the scope of the 1936 Act.  I appreciate, of course, that these men have some grievance.  Some representations have been made to me with reference to their grievances, but I do not think that this is the way to remedy them. Representations with regard to them might perhaps be made to the local authority.  I should say that it is intended that this series of Acts will be continued, and that the problem of other classes of workers, not now protected, will be considered.  Legislation affording them protection, similar in principle if not similar in kind to that which the 1936 Act gives to industrial workers, will be introduced.  I would, therefore, urge on Deputies the desirability of leaving these non-industrial workers to await the protection of their conditions of employment by legislation.</P>

      <P>While we may agree that the main purpose of the Principal Act was to deal with industrial workers, that, I submit, depends completely on the definition of industrial work and of industrial workers. I think the Minister will agree that the definitions contained in the Principal Act are not in any way exhaustive either as regards industrial work or industrial undertakings and to that extent there is, if you like, room for certain improvements so as to give a clear definition of what is an industrial worker.  There is this to be borne in mind.  In the Principal Act you have first of all a definition of industrial worker.  Then you define industrial work by setting down general clauses in connection with cleaning, repair, etc., which deal with a whole series of different trades in industries.  That seems to me to show clearly that both the Minister and those who drafted the Act recognised the difficulties that were there.  If we are going to take the position that a lamp-lighter, caretaker or a watchman is not an industrial worker, how are we going to justify the section in the Principal Act which says that the work done in connection with the cleaning of an industrial undertaking is industrial work?  A watchman in an industrial undertaking has to perform a certain amount of industrial work.  It is recognised that watchmen carry out certain work which, I think, everyone will accept as industrial work, such as stoking up fires and activities of that kind.  In view of that, I submit that when the Principal Act was being <Col N="29" /> drafted there were those difficulties so far as the definitions were concerned. The position is that those difficulties have been allowed to continue.</P>
      <P>The suggestion has been made by the Minister that we might get them remedied by going to the local authority.  The local authority is likely to stand on its legal rights, so that there would be nothing left to the trade union but to go to court and perhaps incur very heavy legal costs.  If it was not the intention to include lamp-lighters under the Principal Act, at any rate it was intended, by the general definition, to cover certain groups of work performed for the local authority. I submit that within that general definition there may be industrial and non-industrial workers.  Therefore, I say, lamp-lighters should be given the benefit of that definition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points on which I would like to correct the Deputy, first of all with regard to the particular form of the definition section in the Principal Act.  It was not intended that that should be restrictive in any way.  We recognised the impracticability of getting a completely satisfactory definition of industrial work, and so the Act was framed, leaving it by implication to the courts to decide what was or what was not industrial work.  In order to minimise litigation, we did set out in the body of the Act all the activities that were on the face of them industrial work and in relation to these activities we removed the question from the discreation of the courts. Deputy Larkin (Junior) referred to the cost that might fall on a trade union if it went to the courts to have the position clarified.  I do not think that they need incur any costs.  Up to the present all the cases taken to the courts for the purpose of clarifying the definition have been taken by the Attorney-General, and in every instance where a <i>prima facie</i> case can be put forward that there is a doubt, I can assure the House action will be taken in the courts to get that doubt removed.  There has been quite a number of these actions, which have resulted in a clarification of the position.</P>

      <P>The Minister is no doubt aware of the action taken by Reddy and others against the Dublin Corporation under the penal sections of the Act and the High Court declined to hear it, because the judge considered that he had not the power to hear it.  They then applied to the Supreme Court and that court threw it out as well.  Eventually the trade union appealed to the Minister. I think the Minister is slightly incorrect in saying that these actions were taken for interpretation purposes. The courts declined to deal with the case on the ground that they had no jurisdiction under the Act to hear it. The union appealed to the Minister to prosecute.  The penal section of the Act says that a prosecution for any offence may be brought at the suit of the Minister, but the Department was doubtful whether an offence had been committed.  The position was that the parties concerned were unable to bring a prosecution.  The facts were presented to the Department of Industry and Commerce, but they declined to bring a prosecution because they did not consider an offence had been committed.</P>

      <P>It was intended that the normal practice would be that proceedings would be instituted by the Minister.  In the case the Deputy referred to there was, subsequent to certain action in the court, an application made to me that I should prosecute the employer concerned.  I was advised by the law officers that such action was not likely to succeed as, on the face of it, the persons concerned did not come within the scope of the Act.</P>

      <P>Through our conversations, and also through correspondence with the Minister's Department, we know you have been extremely careful never at any time to give an interpretation, but we have found officers of the Department who have taken it on themselves to give an interpretation. The case we are arguing to-day is such a plain case that it does not require to be brought to the court for the purpose of interpretation.  It is simply a matter of common acceptance.  I cannot distinguish between a man dealing <Col N="31" /> with electric lights and the other type of lamp-lighter.  The man dealing with electricity is in the Act, but the man dealing with gas appliances for the lighting of the city is outside it.  It seems an absurdity, and I suggest the Minister should reconsider the matter. There are only 12 or 20 men affected. They are working along with men who receive the benefits that the Government were good enough to extend to them under the Act.  The whole thing creates a certain amount of irritation. You say that some day you hope to give them all these social benefits. Why not start now?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (2) to insert the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3) Sub-section (1) of Section 3 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion before paragraph (n)  of the following new paragraph, that is to say,</P>
      <P>(n)  Caretakers continuously employed by a local authority for more than eight hours in the day and for more than 48 hours in the week;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In substance, this amendment is somewhat similar to amendment No. 1, <Col N="32" /> except for this point, that there is an urgent need of the type of caretakers who are referred to in the amendment being given the benefit of the Act in so far as they work a seven-day week and they can obtain considerable improvements in their conditions of employment if the Act is extended to them.  I can see there are more difficulties from the point of view of the Minister in this instance than exist in the case of lamp-lighters, but there are certain points which strengthen our case.  Caretakers, in addition to supervising buildings, have also to clean them and attend to the grounds around them.  They have to inspect the condition of the buildings and are responsible for immediate repairs to sewers, manholes, gulleys, and must remedy stoppages in the sewerage system.  In the case of anything serious, the matter has to be reported to the regular staffs, who then intervene to remedy whatever is wrong.  The caretakers supervise and regulate the time clocks and the lighting of the building.  They really have a multiplicity of duties, which go far beyond the range usually regarded as being the duties of a caretaker.</P>
    <P>This is an effort to improve the lot of workers who undoubtedly work exceptionally arduous hours.  Not only are they on duty seven days of the week, but formerly they were on duty for 24 hours each day and, if they want to go away for a brief space of time, they have to make a special request for permission to leave.  That, I think, is objectionable; it is a thing to which no workers should submit.</P>
    <P>If we take into account the number of hours per day and the number of days per week, we will realise how intolerable the position is from the point of view of the caretaker.  There is little more that can be said in support of this amendment than what has been said in relation to the previous one from the point of view of trying to clarify and make more definite the position of these workers under the Act.  I submit that, while the principle of the main Act is quite clear, it is apparent that certain defects exist, and we should now take advantage of this opportunity to remedy any weaknesses <Col N="33" /> which have become apparent.  I suggest it is unfair to deny to special categories of workers the benefits of the Act.  I have in mind more particularly at the moment such workers as caretakers continuously employed by local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Once again my contention is that the conditions of employment of caretakers are so fundamentally different to those of industrial workers that the same legislation cannot cover both.  In principle the 1936 Act set out to provide certain essential conditions, subject to the exceptions that had to be made to deal with particular cases, and these conditions were a 48-hour week and day work.  These were the two principal conditions which the Act set out to impose, that industrial workers should work 48 hours a week and that that work should be done in the day time. Quite clearly, caretakers are in a different category.  I do not know that it would be suggested that they should be limited to a 48-hour week.  The nature of their work is quite different from that of an individual in a factory. They reside in the place where they work.  Caretakers are given free residence and fuel in the block of flats which they are responsible for supervising. Whether their hours of work are too long or not, I do not think it will be seriously suggested that 48 hours of that type of work has the same nervous or physical results as 48 hours of manual or mechanical work in a factory.</P>
      <P>I think Deputy Larkin was up against that difficulty in drafting his amendment, and so he got himself into a position in his amendment which is almost impossible, because he tried to define these caretakers as workers who work more than 48 hours a week and by that definition he hopes to get them under the Act.  If they do come under the Act, they can only work a 48-hour week and, by his definition, are outside the Act again, and the problem of drafting, inevitably, will arise for anybody who tries to apply by such a device this Act to persons who cannot be described as industrial workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="34" /> I do not know if there is anything more that I have to say on that question. These corporation workers did contend to me, in their representations, that certain parts of their work constituted industrial work within the definition.  I got legal advice about that, and the advice was that we could not hope to sustain that contention in court.  I feel, however, that even if that were not so we would have to consider the position of these workers, generally, because, apart from questions of more frequent or longer periods of leave for these workers, we could not apply to them the conditions of the 1936 Act, which was designed to deal with the case of industrial workers.  I do not think it would be contended by these caretakers, or by anybody speaking on their behalf, that they should work only on the basis of a 48-hour week, as in the case of day workers.  Clearly, some of these people must be on duty during hours which would be illegal according to the terms of the 1936 Act, and, having regard to the nature and character of their work, it might be contended that by being merely on duty and standing by, as it were, in their own residences, the conditions of the 1936 Act should not apply to them at all.</P>
    <P>That is the problem relating to caretakers, but I think that it is a much wider question than that which is merely concerned with such people as are employed by the Dublin Corporation. Possibly, there are people, employed in such a capacity by other private persons, who are in a much worse position than that of caretakers employed by the Dublin Corporation. In that connection, I might say that the case of domestic workers will also have to be considered at some stage, and that some legislation will have to be designed and enacted to deal with their case also.  I admit, however, that it is not easy to design a measure which will be related to the situation and which, at the same time, will be so adapted as to cover all the circumstances which may arise in connection with that type of employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir.  It is not the same thing.  At least, I, personally, feel that this is a different matter, because here I have a very good headline to follow, in so far as I am merely attempting to add one other section to a section in the Principal Act&mdash;an amendment which is almost in complete consonance with Section 3 of the Principal Act.  Accordingly, I move the following additional amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>2a. Before sub-section (2) to insert the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Sub-section (1) of Section (3) of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion after paragraph (n) of the following new paragraph, that is to say, &ldquo;(n) the work performed by watchmen employed in an industrial undertaking&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have already referred to the fact that there is a clause in the Principal Act referring to the cleaning of any place where industrial work is carried on.  My amendment is to the effect that sub-section (1) of Section (3) of the Principal Act shall be amended by the insertion, after paragraph (n) of the following new paragraph, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(n) The work performed by watchmen employed in an industrial undertaking.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>When it is noted that that amendment will follow upon a clause of the original paragraph, which refers to the cleaning of any place where industrial work is carried on, one can see that there is a close connection here and that there is a sound argument why this amendment should be accepted.  I, personally, cannot see how, in any way, the principle to which the Minister has referred, as having been in mind when the Principal Act was drafted, can be in any way contravened by extending this clause in the case of work performed by watchmen employed in industrial undertakings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see how it can be justified <Col N="36" /> that these things should apply to the cleaning of a place where industrial work is carried on, and why the work of a watchman should be excluded, since watchmen have to do a certain amount of cleaning up also.  The Minister, of course, may say that the question of the hours of watchmen gives rise to certain difficulties.  Admittedly so, but so did the work of shift-men give rise to difficulties.  In the case of shifts, you had to cover a period of 24 hours in the day, but in the case of the majority of watchmen their hours of work start pretty early in the evening in most cases, and do not finish until the next morning, and the majority of them do not enjoy the ten-hour day which, normally, might not be in operation, but which is largely in operation in connection with these workers.  There are certain exceptions, for instance, such as one with which I met last week.  That was a case of a watchman who was working 14 hours a night for seven days of the week.  I may say that, when the attention of this man's employer was called to it, he immediately corrected it, as soon as he realised the unfairness of it.  Quite rightly, however, the employer concerned asked me to quote the particular paragraph of the Act which would apply in that case.  I was unable to quote it for him, and I am still waiting to be able to quote it.</P>
    <P>I do feel, however, that in so far as these watchmen are concerned, the principle of this amendment is one which the Minister would feel difficulty in resisting in view of what he has already put in the Principal Act. Secondly, on the question of hours, I think that if the principal embodied in this amendment were to be accepted, it would be quite easy to make some consequential minor amendments in the Principal Act which would allow for certain difficulties which do arise in regard to hours of working in connection with these people.</P>
    <P>After all, if we can legislate and insert certain sections in the Principal Act, one covering certain classes of workers and laying down a 48-hour week, and so on, and another covering shift-workers and based on a 56-hour week, surely there would be <Col N="37" /> no insuperable difficulty in allowing for the peculiar conditions under which watchmen have to work.  I think that it should not be impossible to bring about conditions under which a nine-hour or ten-hour day should apply to these people, because it would not be a question of a double shift, but would merely mean knocking off an hour or two from the work of these men so as to limit their hours of work to nine hours per night or even ten hours per night.  That would bring the time down from the abnormal number of hours per week that these people work now.  It would mean a break of some kind in the seven days, because many of these watchmen do work the whole seven days of the week and most of them work six days of the week.  Many of these people are working all night for seven days of the week&mdash;just going to bed for a few hours, and then going to work again&mdash;during the whole year. It must be remembered also that most of these people are old and have given a long period of service to the nation, and that they should now be entitled to more easement and more accommodation in their work, instead of being put to work long hours which would be a great strain on younger men.  In many cases, also, these watchmen have to perform a great deal of work, such as the banking of fires, looking after these fires, and so on, and, generally they are doing work which is not only essential in many undertakings but of great importance with regard to the security of the people's property, generally. Therefore, I suggest that the Minister should accept the principle of this amendment, and then we can see about getting over any difficulty which may arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not dispute with the Deputy on the principle.  I agree with him that there is in relation to that class of worker, as in relation to the other classes mentioned, a need for examining the extent to which we should, by legislation, deal with their conditions of employment.  It will be clear, however, that the mere passage of this amendment would achieve nothing but a preposterous situation. <Col N="38" /> If we put the amendment in the Bill, we would just create a situation in which a watchman could not be employed at all except between 8 o'clock in the morning and 8 o'clock in the evening.  He could not be employed at night.  We would have to follow the amendment by inserting in the Act a whole code of provisions relating to the employment of watchmen&mdash;their hours of work, the breaks in their hours of work and the number of hours per night, per week or per month they might do.  I think the way we should do that is by a separate measure and not as part of this measure.</P>
      <P>There may be, and probably are, special cases which will have to be dealt with, too.  There are, no doubt, some watchmen who are employed in the daytime, although it is probably true that most of them are employed at night, when the normal day's work ceases, and there may even be special cases of watchmen employed in unusual circumstances in transport undertakings or other organisations, who may have to work only at particular periods of the week or particular periods of the month.  We would have to get information about all these cases before we could attempt to make a general provision applying to all watchmen, and, even if we were prepared to do all the consequential amendment of the main Act which would follow the adoption of this amendment, it would be unsafe to do it without some more elaborate examination of the possible consequences than we have attempted so far.</P>

      <P>I submit that if a man is working for a factory but outside it, and if he goes into the factory and assists in any way, he is an industrial worker.  If he goes in for only one hour, he comes under the Act and we can claim all the benefits of the Act for that man.  I have in mind the case of a man working in a big industrial plant who is the only man disqualified under the Act.  He is doing 102 hours a week and we can find no remedy for his position except to close down the whole plant.  Take, for instance, firms like the tobacco firms, where conditions are much superior to those in any other industry.  A caretaker is employed, <Col N="39" /> but there is also a watchman who may be on for a certain number of hours a day.  There is a watchman there all the time, and he is included as an industrial worker.  He goes on at night, but in no case does that man touch the boilers or do stoking or banking up.  In the case of the industrial paperworks, however, if the man does not get the boilers ready to give a certain pressure of steam in the morning, the workers are held back.  It may involve only a half an hour's or 20 minutes' work, but his doing that work during the watching hours means that steam is raised for the men when they come in.  Is he not part of the industrial undertaking?</P>
      <P>The same applies to the Port and Docks Board.  We had the case of one man doing 104 hours.  There are only 8,736 hours in the year, and there is no difficulty in bringing these men under the Act.  If you take the ordinary number of hours in the week, 168, and break them up as you wish, we can very easily, by agreement with the Minister, get a position under which we can include these men.  It is absolutely inhuman to allow the present position to continue year after year, because the Minister undertook to try to extend the benefits of the Act to all workers.  Why are these men excluded?  As Deputy Larkin (Junior) says, some of them have given 20 and 30 years' service.  They are then told: &ldquo;You go watching next week,&rdquo; and they are doing more work watching now than they were when doing their ordinary day's work.  That is not fair; it is dishonest and unjust to everybody. A watchman with a uniform on is supposed to do only eight hours a day, and he also serves who only stands and waits.  The policeman is not always locking people up.  It is possible to provide regulated hours for policemen and even for soldiers and sailors, but it is not possible for other human beings who, in view of a watchman's responsibilities, are giving very valuable service to the community.  I know a watchman who has to go around every 20 minutes and lock 20 time locks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the case of a firm like the Gas <Col N="40" /> Company.  Is it fair that a man standing all day at the gate checking out loads of coke should not be an industrial worker or that the man who watches the plant at night&mdash;the plant is working continuously&mdash;should not be included?  My friend Deputy O'Leary could speak of the mills, where there are watchmen whose duties are laborious.  The Gas Company can pay a sufficient wage to meet this difficulty, but these men are not included. The only way by which they can be included is to stop the industry and that is not the wise way.  The wise way is to bring all watchmen in industrial plants under the Act and I ask the Minister to consider doing so.</P>

      <P>They cannot just come under this Act.  I am not disputing with the Deputy at all the necessity for legislation.  I have already recounted the progress made with the series of Acts we contemplate.  When we had finished the enactment of the 1936 Act and the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Act, it was quite obvious that it was going to require a certain amount of detailed examination before we would get a satisfactory measure to deal with other workers.  At that stage, we decided there was no reason why we should delay conferring upon these other workers the benefits of an annual holiday, with pay, and certain provisions of the 1936 Act.  That was done by the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1939, which extended these benefits to all workers straight away.  That step was taken because it was recognised that certain inquiries would have to be instituted and a certain time would be involved by an examination of the problems created by transport workers, domestic workers and certain other classes who had yet to be covered.  I agree that these have yet to be covered and I agree that it is desirable and necessary that they should be covered, but I do not think the right way to do it is by attempting to bring them under the 1936 Act merely because there has been delay in dealing with them under another Act.</P>

      <P>It does not matter.  They are not working in the day.  The Minister's whole case is the difficulty of providing for these people, of bringing them within the four corners of the Act, but the Minister had to face very big difficulties when he brought in the original Bill.  He had to face difficulties which many people in the country thought were insuperable, difficulties which many people said would completely dislocate industry and business.  Of course, they did not do any such thing.  What rather frightens me is that when a case is put up to the Minister, the Minister seems to indicate that particular type of work or worker will require a separate Act.</P>

      <P>May I remind the Deputy of our experience with the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Acts?  As a result of strong representation here, I did something against my own judgement, that is, attempted <Col N="42" /> to cover hotel workers in an Act designed for shop workers.  We found that we had in fact attempted the impossible and we had to undo it again. I think that the varying circumstances of different occupations will involve separate legislation for each.</P>

      <P>I think there is one type of work that could be brought within the terms of the 1936 Act and that refers to the type of person mentioned in the amendment. Take my constituency, in which there is a factory, at which a number of people are employed.  Every person working there, with one exception, gets the benefit of the 1936 Act.  The man is not only a caretaker and watchman, but, as Deputy Larkin pointed out, has to do essential industrial work, without which the working of the whole factory would be hampered.</P>

      <P>The question at issue between those supporting the amendment and the Minister is that the Minister says, because a man works at night, he could not be included. We say that the Minister has already provided for night work in the Act.  I do not believe the Minister questions the position of the man mentioned by Deputy Larkin, and that that man could be classed under the Act as doing industrial work.  The Minister stated that it was practically impossible, or only with great difficulty, to have an amendment framed that would be workable within the four corners of the 1936 Act.  I do not believe it is beyond the Minister's power to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister told us of his difficulty and he put that forward as an excuse for an injustice continuing. He stated that there was difficulty in amending the Act so that it would cover the people enumerated in the amendment.  Can he conceive <Col N="43" /> the injustice he is doing some people? I have in mind a type of watchman upon whom hardship is inflicted because the Act of 1936 does not apply to his case.  Take the position of a watchman under a public body.  He goes to work at six o'clock in the evening and is on duty until eight o'clock in the morning.  The Minister contends that that work is not as important as that of a time keeper. Surely there is no sense in that kind of argument.  That man works 14 hours.  Nobody can say whether he works at night or in the day.  As the Minister pointed out, shift-work continues at night yet, after working for 14 hours, the type of man I refer to is to get nothing extra.  In other Acts of Parliament the Minister gave administrative decisions to facilitate the people concerned in getting judicial decisions.</P>
      <P>Why does he not do something like that in this case?  He could make an administrative decision and let that be taken forward for a judicial decision, to see if it would be supported.  Although people are employed at a particular work and are doing that work just the same as others who get the benefit of the 1936 Act, because there is an administrative decision against them, the Minister does not facilitate them in getting a judicial decision in the courts.  Surely that is an injustice. The framework is there, but the Minister says he does not want to interfere with it.  Accordingly, the injustice must continue.  It should be possible within the power that the Minister has, even as a temporary measure, to bring such people within the Act and to remove the injustice.</P>

      <P>In my opinion nobody attempting to draft legislation of this kind would proceed on the basis that there is any similarity between work done in the day-time, such as digging a drain in a street, and the work of a man who is there when day work finishes, to see that nobody falls into it.  I think it cannot be contended that the restrictions it is necessary to impose on one type of work apply without modification to the other type of work. The other point is that we by the Act <Col N="44" /> prescribe minimum conditions and not maximum conditions.  There is nothing to prevent public authorities doing what Deputy Hogan referred to, improving the conditions of these night workers.</P>

      <P>I agree that it is desirable that matters relating to conditions of employment should be regularised by the preparation, the introduction and the enactment of a code generally applicable, and that everybody would appreciate the reasons for. It is, however, a far more complicated matter than appears at first sight and, as I pointed out, we have already had the experience of having to retrace our steps in one respect, where we were persuaded by arguments such as we had to-day to go too far&mdash;at least, to proceed along the lines of applying a code designed to meet the conditions of one set of workers to another set whose circumstances were somewhat different.  Even when we have completed the series of Acts we have in mind, I think that there will be odd employments here and there which we will have left out. Nevertheless, we could design for each type of employment legislation to apply, in a broad sense, the same principles to all concerned.</P>

Take the case yesterday&mdash;though we cannot try it here&mdash;of James Murray: that man was deliberately denied his right to six days' work so as to evade the provisions of the Act.

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It seems to me that the Minister is more lacking in his reply to this amendment than in the case of any amendment so far. First of all, he says that the Principal Act is incomplete, that it is one of a series.  The Principal Act was passed in 1936&mdash;eight years ago, which is quite a considerable time, even if we allow for the four years of difficulties, when the attention of his Department might be taken up with other matters. During that period, the Department has found it possible to find that a section of workers was included which should not have been there, and that section is being taken out&mdash;the Minister is going to exclude fishing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To my mind, the Minister does not deny the soundness of the argument that watchmen have got a very strong <Col N="47" /> claim&mdash;especially watchmen in industrial undertakings&mdash;to be given the benefits of the Principal Act.  The Minister says, however, that there is the difficulty of hours.  That position is not one that has arisen overnight. I think it has been queried and questioned with regard to watchmen almost since the passing of the Principal Act, right through the whole period of eight years.  I do not wish to cast doubt on the Minister's good intentions; but if eight years have elapsed and nothing has been done to remedy a situation which he himself admits requires correction, while on the other hand action is taken to exclude a section of workers, it strikes me as being very peculiar.  The other point he makes is that one cannot control these watchmen because they work at night; but he answers that argument himself by admitting that he has already dealt with shift workers.</P>
    <P>This amendment is confined to watchmen in industrial undertakings. It does not deal with watchmen of all types, in all types of employment and in all parts of the country.  On the Minister's own ground, namely, that cleaners in industrial undertakings are included in the Act, if they can make a claim for inclusion and have it accepted, surely, in principle there is nothing to exclude watchmen? We, have, then, only the difficulty of the hours.</P>
    <P>If the Minister can find a solution for that already, by having two separate sections in the original Act, one dealing with day workers working an eight hour day and a 48 hour week and the other dealing with shift workers working a 56 hour basis, worked any time within 24 hours, day or night, surely ways and means can be found to deal with the problem that would arise in this case?  It is admitted in principle that watchmen in industrial undertakings are, in general, <Col N="48" /> within the definition of industrial workers as laid down by the Principal Act and, if there is any good intention on the part of the Minister, it should be possible to find a solution. If that solution has not been found in the last eight years, how long more are we to wait?</P>
    <P>When it comes to the question of limiting the Act and of taking away certain benefits that apparently were given by mistake, the Minister seems to move fairly quickly.  The difficulty mentioned now has been known to his Department for eight years, ever since the Principal Act was passed, yet nothing has been done.  This problem of the watchmen in industrial undertakings is a far more grievous one than even that of the actual industrial workers themselves, who were the main object of concern when the Minister drafted the Principal Act, as the majority of industrial workers had in or about the conditions which they are given under the Act.  Here we are dealing with men who are required to work 108 hours per week, as contained in some of the standard wages Orders officially accorded by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that we have a remedy.  We can rectify this tomorrow and we can stop the most important public undertaking in the City of Dublin, for the sake of ten or 15 men.  That is the remedy, yet we suggest that there is an easier remedy, that there has been ample time to consider this problem, that there is no insuperable difficulty in getting a formula which will allow for and meet any peculiarity in these hours.  The Minister says that we should wait a little longer, to let him complete the series.  In this case, I am not prepared to withdraw the amendment, as I think the Minister's own argument strengthens the case made for its insertion.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy Keyes, I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 3 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 9 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion therein before sub-section (3) of the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2b) Whenever a dispute exists between a worker and an employer <Col N="51" /> as to whether such worker is doing industrial work within the meaning of this Act it shall be competent for such worker or for an official of a registered trade union of which such worker is a member to take proceedings in the High Court for the purpose of obtaining a declaration that he is an industrial worker to whom this Act applies.</P>
    <P>This amendment has reference to the question of interpretation.  Here it is suggested that every workman, or the registered trade union acting for him should, if they so desire, have power to seek an interpretation from the courts. Earlier on the Minister explained the difficulty and said that when a case was brought to his notice he had to seek legal advice and that, if the legal advice did not sustain the position, he could not succeed.  It might frequently happen that either a workman or a trade union was prepared to take a chance with court proceedings in the hope of getting a decision.  It is with the object of giving them power to test that possibility under the Act that this amendment is proposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it desirable that the suggestion should be reconsidered. May I say that it is not clear that under the Act the individual workman or his trade union has not got power to institute proceedings?  The fact is that up to the present in every case proceedings have been instituted by the Minister for Industry and Commerce as a result of representations made to him by a workman or by a trade union representing a workman. That system means that the cost of the proceedings is borne by the State and not by the individual workman or by the trade union acting for him&mdash;and the cost of proceedings in the High Court is fairly heavy.  I think, certainly, that the normal practice should be that the State having enacted this legislation, should enforce it and that an individual who feels that he is deprived of rights under it, should appeal to the responsible Minister who in the name of the people should proceed to procure for that individual his <Col N="52" /> rights through the court at the public expense.  I think that that is a sounder principle than that we should either put the onus on the individual to protect himself or even make it clear that he can do so if he wishes, because I can visualise if the worker has the right to proceed, a tendency developing in the Department of Finance, which has to act as the guardian of the public purse, to say when representations are made to the Minister: &ldquo;The individual himself has the power to initiate proceedings to have his grievance redressed, let him therefore do so.&rdquo;  I think the obligation should be on the Government to take action and bear the expense of prosecuting the action.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. L. Cosgrave Mr. L. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment because the case I mentioned to the Minister earlier was one in which the employees of the local authority desired an interpretation of the Act enabling them to come under the definition of industrial workers, and that the Dublin Corporation was a local authority within the meaning of the Act.  The position was that they could not frame a claim about monetary loss.  I have not the full particulars of the case but their claim probably was really in respect of time worked more than for monetary loss. They could not, therefore, frame a claim for monetary loss.  They then applied generally and the judge of the High Court said that under the 1926 rules he had no authority to hear them. Counsel on both sides argued that he had.  The Minister will appreciate that that is an unusual position.  However, the judge declined to hear them and the matter went to the Supreme Court where a like decision resulted.  The position is that the Minister may bring a prosecution.  He can either bring it on their behalf or on his own behalf. In this case they offered to defray the full costs themselves but the Minister was advised apparently that no prosecution lay.</P>

In every <Col N="53" /> case where there was a doubt we have proceeded in order to get a clear decision on the matter.  There have been a large number of friendly actions and action would have been taken in this case if there was any doubt at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Sir John Esmonde Sir John Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the amendment on the following grounds.  Unfortunately I was in only for part of the discussion on the other amendment and for a time I was puzzled as to the necessity for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it very inadvisable that legislation should go out from this House in an undefined and inexact form, because it then requires a considerable amount of expenses in order to establish what the Legislature meant.  We should try to frame our legislation so as to remove all possible doubt.  I think the doubt arises in this case because of the manner in which the original section was drafted, that is, Section 3 of the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936.  The section purports to define industrial work but what it in fact says is, that &ldquo;industrial work is every kind of work except the following&rdquo;&mdash;and it then proceeds to exclude a number of classes of work.  It says: &ldquo;The expression industrial work' does not include agricultural, commercial nor domestic work nor mining nor the transport of persons or goods, but subject to that limitation the said expression includes <Col N="54" /> all forms of industrial work&rdquo;&mdash;making use of the very words which the section purports to define.  My suggestion to the Minister is that all this difficulty could be got over and doubts and expenses reduced to a minimum, if for the purposes of Section 3 you define what is meant by agricultural work, commercial work, etc.  You would then have that definition as an exclusion, not involving our general code of laws or the entire Act but merely for the purposes of the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an attempt made to define agricultural, commercial and domestic work in the sub-sections of that section but the doubt has not been as to whether they were included but what the facts were in a particular case&mdash;whether particular workers engaged in certain activities were or were not doing industrial work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Sir John Esmonde Sir John Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty of the Minister is that these are all forms of industrial work.  You are defining what industrial work is and then you say that the expression includes all forms of industrial work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no absolute definition&mdash;that is true.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Sir John Esmonde Sir John Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have thought that the class of employee we were discussing just now, namely, a watchman, would automatically come under this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Then you start the argument all over again as to what is industrial work.  I think it is a question of looking into the original Section 3.  I think everybody seems to be agreed that we should make it as clear as possible in this Bill, though far be it from me to keep work from the lawyers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>In this case I am on the side of the lawyers.  We are dealing here with the question whether we have the right to proceed to challenge a certain interpretation.  I do not <Col N="55" /> think that any legislation passed by this House could override the Constitution. You can amend the Constitution, but I do not think any court of law could refuse to hear any person who feels injured in this matter.  That is my interpretation of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two matters arising.  One is the right of the individual to recover moneys due to him. That is specifically safeguarded in legislation.  The other is the right to institute prosecutions against an employer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite clear in my mind as to what is at issue.  My point is that if any individual feels that he has a legal right to something which he is being denied, liberty to proceed to assert that right cannot be denied either to an organisation or an individual. Lawyers, with all due respect, have built up a wall of privilege.  It is very difficult to get inside that wall of privilege, but in the last analysis, surely a citizen is a citizen.  If I go into certain courts, I cannot plead unless I have a solicitor and senior and junior counsel.  The law does not say so, and I have challenged that on many occasions&mdash;too often for my own comfort.  The point is an individual has been injured. Surely he has the right to go before a court of law and demand a hearing. In this case he is stopped.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, it has been decided in a way which you do not try to follow.  A few months ago, after we had a long discussion between several unions over the case of a man who had been unjustly treated under <Col N="56" /> this Act, it was agreed that we would toss up to see what union would proceed. It was decided that one union would take the action.  I do not know why, because they had less at stake than other unions.  However, there was an individual picked out, and his name was given as being the plaintiff. Strange to relate, the plaintiff who proceeded to fight the case was a man who had himself offended against the law.  He not only had 1,800 hours' work; he had 2,800 hours in the one year.  Of that 1,000 hours over the 1,800 which would qualify him for his holidays seven-tenths was at time-and-a-half rates and the remainder was at full-time rates.  In other words, he had worked two years in one, and if I had been the judge I know what I would have done with him under the law. Here is a man who had taken two men's jobs.  He was then looking for holidays.  The Government, under the advice of their learned counsel and the Attorney-General, proceeded to pick out this gentleman to fight a test case. I would have thought they would have picked out a man who had not got the 1,800 hours&mdash;a man who was entitled to a holiday.  The other man could have well paid for a holiday, because he had been paid more than the legislators here.  How long have they been deciding to take that case we had yesterday of Thomas Murray against the Corporation of Dublin? You cannot proceed against the Corporation of Dublin on this particular ground.  I know an employer who is breaking the law day and night, and I find that there is dilatoriness&mdash;I will not say anything worse than that&mdash;in proceeding against him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want the right to assert my rights; the union to which I belong, when they have a case, will proceed whether you like it or not.  We do not care what the cost is.  Individuals in the State have their rights, and you should protect them.  As has been done in many cases, the right should be given to collective organisations to protect their members.  If you would agree to this amendment, I do not see how it would interfere with you in any way.  Do not stand in our way, because to fight you will be more difficult than to fight the case.  I suggest <Col N="57" /> to Deputy Esmonde, who has legal training, and to Deputy Cosgrave, that if they consider the matter they would agree, as would any senior man at the Bar, that in law we could not be stopped.</P>

She is working continuously, breaking the law knowingly, and her employer is breaking the law knowingly. The Minister's officers do not take any notice, or do not get to know about it.  Is that girl and her employer to be allowed to continue to break the law?  Take the case of the firm up in Cork Street, which has now been closed, and which was working all night on Saturday and all day on Sunday.  Attention was called to it day after day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The girls there worked from 6 o'clock on Saturday night until 6 o'clock on Sunday night, without even getting out to their services or devotions, and yet no action was taken.  I say that you must loosen this thing up, and give us a chance to go after those gentlemen.  Only a few months ago I called the attention of the Department to a factory which started up on the north side, employing girls at 7/6 a week, who were working up to their ankles in water, with their shoulders sopping wet.  I had a case before me yesterday of a man getting robbed of what he is entitled to in the way of average holiday money.  What remedy is there if the Department does not <Col N="58" /> take the matter up?  I cannot proceed in his name, although sometimes we do spend money on unorganised workers. This man claims an average of £4 a week.  The employer does not put up in the factory the contract of service between that man and the employer. He breaks that law.  When that man gets a week's holidays, he is given £3, and when he says: &ldquo;That is not my average wage under the Act,&rdquo; the reply is: &ldquo;If you do not like it, get out.&rdquo;  What are you to do if you cannot protect that kind of individual? If that case were loosened up, I could get behind that man, but as things are I cannot do so, so I have to move your Department.</P>

      <P>I want to remove a misconception which may arise out of Deputy Larkin's remarks.  Lawyers may be a non-incorporated trade union, but a trade union we are at all events.  Perhaps Deputy Larkin is well aware of it, because I saw him appearing in person in his own case some years ago, and he did it very well.  It is open to any member of the public to go into any court in this land and plead his own case without the assistance of any lawyer.  I merely mention that in case a different opinion may go forth on the authority of Deputy Larkin.  That being the case, I think we offer facilities and privileges to the public that are offered by very few other trade unions.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy Keyes, I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (2) and substitute the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2) Sub-section (1) of this section shall come into operation on the date which this Act becomes law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is a very simple one, and yet a very important one.  It deals <Col N="59" /> with a matter which has been the subject of continuous criticism in this House on a number of occasions during recent months when amending legislation was brought in.  It is to prevent what is to my mind an abuse of legislation by the putting into force of retrospective legislation to the detriment of the interests of the citizen. When this Bill was introduced it was explained by the Minister that certain loopholes in the Principal Act had to be closed, loopholes which it was not intended should be left there.  It is recognised in the Bill that at the present time certain proceedings might be in the course of hearing or about to be determined, and it makes provision not to interfere with such cases. At the same time it does set down that this amending Bill shall be deemed to come into force from the date of the Principal Act and, at one stroke, wipes out all claims except those in which proceedings have actually been commenced before the 16th February, and denies to any citizen who may be aggrieved under the Principal Act the right to claim what he feels he is justly entitled to claim.</P>
    <P>I can quite understand either the Minister or the Government taking the view that if a genuine and honest mistake is made it should be rectified. I do not suppose that legislators or senior officers of Departments are immune from making mistakes.  It seems not only unfair but to be treading on most dangerous ground when we allow ourselves to be inveigled by specious excuses into violating one of the fundamental principles of legislation, namely, that we shall not take advantage of our position to give retrospective effect to legislation which is of a debarring or penalising nature.</P>
    <P>In this Bill, the first thing we do is to take out of the Principal Act a section of workers who were formerly included.  I do not know whether there are many fishermen about to insist upon or to claim their rights under the Principal Act before it is amended but there might be quite a few.  I am quite sure that neither the Minister nor the Department could assure us that at this particular <Col N="60" /> moment there is no fisherman in the State who is not contemplating enforcing certain claims to which he thinks he is entitled at this moment under the Principal Act or seeking advice on the subject.  It is quite possible that when the Principal Act was passed it was not intended to give these benefits to a fisherman but, nevertheless, for a period of eight years that law has remained on the Statute Book.  Now the fisherman proceeds to take advantage of it and, before the matter can be brought to a decision, we step in and say &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  I wish to submit again what I have submitted before, that if we have made mistakes let us correct them but let us not at the same time go about it the wrong way, trying to deny the fact that we have committed the mistakes and trying to cover them up.  Of course, it is quite correct, as was pointed out in regard to another amending Bill here, that we may save the State considerable sums of money.  I think in regard to all the claims that possibly might lie under the Principal Act before it is amended by the present Bill, the total sum of money would not be so very great and in most cases it will not be the State that will have to provide the money, it will possibly be some of the gentlemen to whom we referred in another debate as earning very high profits during the present period. Even so, the amount involved will not be very considerable and, for the sake of the principle involved, namely, that we should not commit ourselves to the deleterious practice of giving effect to retrospective legislation, especially in amending Acts, I would urge the support of the House for this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Sir John Esmonde Sir John Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>When I first read the Bill I formed the same opinion in regard to the retrospective nature of this section as has been expressed by the mover of the amendment. I do not suppose there are many cases, if any, involved, but I am against retrospective legislation of this kind on two grounds.  First of all the undoubted harm it must do to certain individuals who were following their rights prior to the passing of the legislation and, secondly, that if we allow this through without any comment, in <Col N="61" /> a much more serious matter later on, involving many more serious points perhaps, it will be quoted as a precedent that it went through in connection with this Bill as it has gone through in connection with other Bills. Usually, when the Government deem it necessary to bring in legislation, shall we say, to nullify the effect of our Supreme Court, which was the final analysis on all litigation, in connection with any particular case in which individuals have incurred expenses, on the grounds of equity, the Government see that they are reimbursed.  I think that happened in connection with one Act.</P>
      <P>The point about it is that we should not recognise as part of our enacting procedure, particularly in connection with amending Bills, that everything that is in an amending Bill must at once be retrospective to the date of the original Act.  It is a very dangerous precedent, as I think the Minister will readily agree.  I am quite prepared to admit that in this case it probably does not affect any individual at all; there may be no cases pending.  Of course, there is a way out of the difficulty and it is this, that if in good faith, any person commences to take proceedings or incurs expenses, replying on what, up to the present time, would have been a correct interpretation of this section, he should be provided for in some form or another.  As I say, retrospective legislation is very dangerous because our Supreme Court make a decision in a particular case and we can immediately pass an Act of Parliament after a considerable amount of costs has been incurred and this will be pointed to as a precedent.  I would like to be satisfied that it is not generally the policy of the Government in amending legislation automatically to make everything retrospective, that it is only done owing to the necessities of the particular case or subject to qualification.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two changes being made by this Bill.  The first relates to fishermen.  There is, I am sure, nobody in this State engaged in the business of fishing who, up to the date of the introduction of this <Col N="62" /> amending Bill, had the slightest idea that fishing was covered by the 1936 Act and there is no case pending in court concerning it.  The other amendment relates to continuous process shift work and it is a much more important case because there claims have been made in the courts and, even though the verdicts given by two judges who heard two similar kinds of cases appear to be in confict, nevertheless, because there is the doubt and because there is some reason to assume that the final decision of the court would be that the Act was not as we intended it to be, it is necessary to make this provision in order to ensure that retrospective claims for a very considerable amount might not be made on behalf of people who, until the date when this Bill was introduced, did not know that they would have such claims to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Sir John Esmonde Sir John Esmonde">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The case that arose there was whether persons engaged in continuous process shift work were engaged upon ordinary time or upon overtime in respect of the number of hours they worked in each week in excess of 48.  Now, clearly, if the position were left unchanged, conceivably every worker employed in every continuous process industry since 1936 could now proceed against his employer for payment of the amount of overtime due to him over all that period of years and that would amount to a very substantial sum indeed.  The position of the employer would be several degrees worse than if this amending Bill had never been introduced because, until it was introduced, neither the employers nor the vast majority of the workers in these industries contemplated that the courts might put an interpretation upon the Act which would give them such a claim.  In one case the court did put that interpretation upon the Act and the worker recovered a substantial sum of money from his employer in respect of overtime.  In another case, a worker who took a similar action failed to recover and got a decision against him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="63" /> This sub-section is, in fact, the kernel of the Bill, because it seems to me that essential justice requires that, having now revealed the fact that the drafting of the original Act was open to this possible misinterpretation of our intentions, we must proceed to put it right so that there cannot be effect given to that accumulation of claims which may have arisen since 1936 and which, in the case of an industry like the sugar industry, would amount to a substantial sum of money.  A considerable sum of money would have to be paid by consumers of sugar in this year, although the claims originated in previous years and the sugar produced has already been sold and consumed. It seems to me that, whatever the claims in law might be, the claims in equity are in favour of the course which we have adopted&mdash;that is, to put the law right retrospectively. Wherever anybody has taken a case to the courts and got a decision in his favour, that decision will stand and, wherever anybody has taken a case which is not yet decided, that case will be decided as if this amending Bill had never been introduced or passed.</P>
    <P>Those who became aware of a possible defect in the Act and took action to enforce their claims are fully protected. But where people were not aware that they had any claim and learned that they might have only when this amending Bill was introduced, there appears to be no basis in equity to support the contention that the amendment of the Act should not be retrospective.  That sub-section is, in fact, the primary reason why this amending Bill was necessary.  It is the kernel of the whole measure and I cannot agree to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line 26, page 2, to delete the words &ldquo;sums of money payable <Col N="66" /> annually or otherwise&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;annual payments (payable either in one sum or in two or more instalments)&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have found it necessary to introduce an amendment to Section 6&mdash; amendment No. 5&mdash;and arising out of that amendment it is necessary to amend the definition section.  As the Bill stood before amendment No. 5 was put on the paper, the council would find it necessary to obtain the sanction of the Minister to the payment of instalments in the case of a renewal of a scholarship.  While I consider that, in general, as the Minister would be the ultimate authority, his sanction should be necessary in the case of renewal of scholarships, that sanction could, of course, be given at the beginning of the year. It was not the intention that, if the instalments were paid monthly or quarterly, every such instalment should require the sanction of the Minister.  The intention is that, as the schemes in general will have to be sanctioned by the Minister, so also the renewal of scholarships should be sanctioned by him.  Amendment No. 5 which seeks to introduce this change has rendered it necessary to amend the definition section.  The words &ldquo;annual payments&rdquo; are now introduced.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (3) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Minister shall consult with the corporation or council carrying such scheme into operation, before making any alteration in the scheme, as provided in the immediately preceding sub-section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have put down this amendment principally because of the power that the <Col N="67" /> Minister is taking in Section 2.  Under paragraph (a) of that section the Minister may approve of such a scheme; under paragraph (b) of it he may modify or alter such scheme in such a manner as he thinks proper and approve of such scheme as so modified or altered; and under paragraph (c) he may refuse to approve of such scheme.  I think that when a local body approves of a scholarship scheme it would be desirable, before the Minister decides to make a change in it and certainly in the case where he refuses to approve of it, that he should consult with the corporation or the county council concerned.  Under the Bill as it stands the Minister may refuse to approve of a scheme.  In that case the county council or corporation has the right to resubmit a scheme.</P>
    <P>I take it that, under the section, local authorities could continue submitting and resubmitting schemes according as the Minister rejected them, and that that could go on <i>ad infinitum.</i>  If the Minister accepts my amendment the opportunity for consultation will be provided, and hence it is far more likely that agreement with regard to schemes will be reached between the local body and the Minister. Under the Bill as it stands, if you get a stubborn Minister and a stubborn local authority they may remain at loggerheads for a very considerable time.  The net result of that will be that a scholarship scheme will not be put into operation or, at any rate, that it may be unduly delayed.</P>

      <P>As regards Deputy Cosgrave's amendment, I am not prepared to accept it.  As the Bill now stands, the council first prepares a scheme and submits it to the Minister.  After the Minister has given his approval, the council may then take the further step of determining to carry it into operation. Therefore, after the Minister has given his approval to a scheme the council is not bound, according to sub-section (3) of the Bill, lines 10 to 12, to carry it into operation.  Deputies will see that a council is quite free to decide whether or not it will carry into execution a scheme that has been approved of.</P>

      <P>I think I can assure the Deputy that, if schemes have not been put into operation, it has not been the fault of the Minister.  It has been the fault of local authorities who, in some cases over a period of years, have refused, for reasons which may have seemed good to them, to put forward schemes.  As a matter of fact, the Department of Education has done everything possible to try to meet councils. It is because there was a doubt as to whether, in the long run, the Minister had authority to see that in matters of detail his opinion should rule that it was found necessary to introduce this measure.  There was also the question of the validation of existing schemes, as the position seems not to have been left very clear subsequent to the passing of legislation dealing with local authorities in 1940 and 1941.</P>
      <P>The position is that a council sends in a scheme.  Some of the councils are excellent in the way they deal with this matter.  For instance, no fault is to be found with the Dublin Corporation, but those who represent Dublin here must not assume that every other council is equally faultless.  I have to deal with the councils as a whole. Sometimes a scheme is not sent in until the month of November.  The examination takes place in April.  One of the things that I hope will result when this measure becomes law is that we will be able to get councils to see that if they are going to have schemes they ought to send them in at the earliest possible date.  If the Deputy's amendment were accepted, apart from the fact that I do not see how it is going to solve the problem of the stubborn Minister and the stubborn council to which he referred, it would bind the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>It binds the Minister to have prior consultation.  I have no intention of interfering arbitrarily with the councils.  I may disagree with their schemes on certain points, but that does not mean that I refuse approval.  If I think that councils are doing something inequitable or unfair &mdash;that they are making distinctions between candidates or potential applicants which do not seem reasonable&mdash; I think I am bound to advise that I am not of their opinion and that they ought to amend their scheme.  It is only where some serious question of principle was at stake that the Minister would, I think, refuse approval. Normally, what would happen is that the Minister would advise the council that he felt that the scheme might be improved in certain directions.  The council may or may not accept that advice.  If it is a very serious matter involving, as I have said, a question of principle, the Minister may feel it necessary&mdash;although I am sure he would be at least as anxious as the members of a council to have a scheme in operation&mdash;to refuse his approval. That is why we have treated the councils with every leniency.  In fact, our attitude has been not to give members of councils, who do not seem to be anxious to put schemes into operation, any pretext or excuse for deciding, through any grudge or pretext they may find in their consultations with us, not to have any scheme at all.  We have been anxious to avoid that position.</P>
      <P>Apart from the fact that this amendment would bind me to prior consultation and that there would be no finality, there is the question of time. Time is very limited, and I repeat that I am as anxious as the councils to have schemes in operation, but I fear that if I were bound to consult with them to the degree that the Deputy suggests in his amendment it would merely mean that we would not have the schemes ready in time.</P>

      <P>Even at present councils are often late in coming forward with their schemes.  To give an example. Some councils have apparently been of opinion that it was equitable to put into the schemes that boys or girls attending secondary schools should be excluded from the benefits of secondary scholarships.  I think that the mere fact that the child happens to be attending a secondary school is not a sufficient reason for excluding that child from being a candidate.  We know that the Christian Brothers' schools, for example, prepare candidates, and I daresay that it is in the secondary schools which they manage in which the candidates are prepared very often, not necessarily in the national schools.  If discrimination is to be made, one can understand a certain discrimination on the ground of means &mdash;perhaps not so much a discrimination as a setting aside of a certain number of places for smaller or rural schools.  The former, however, is a condition which, I know, councils definitely have tried to insert in their schemes and with which I do not agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other similar matters which arise, and my only interest is to do what I consider best in the interests of education, and to see that the children who are specially marked out for advancement should get every possible opportunity, consistent with whatever reasonable conditions and limitations the council may put down. But I would not be frank with the House if I did not state that the object of this measure is to make it quite clear to all the councils that, from the legal point of view, the Minister will have the ultimate authority, not only in regard to the scheme in general but in regard to seeing that the details of the scheme are right and proper, and that the council carries out the scheme according to its published conditions. That is why I find it necessary to bring in the matter of renewals, because the council's scheme, as published, may be very excellent, but in the carrying out of it, it may be found it has not been adhered to, and that there is some inequity.  Therefore I must ask the House to agree that I, or whoever may be the Minister, <Col N="71" /> should have the ultimate authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has referred to the undesirability of certain local authorities inserting certain areas.  I agree that is undesirable, but I should like to call attention to one aspect of this problem, and I think the local authorities had this aspect in mind when they attempted to do that. There are many children living in remote districts where the facilities, even in the primary schools, are not the same as those in a modern town, where you have a better type of school, and may be a better type of teacher.  If there is an examination, the student who comes from a remote district is definitely at a disadvantage compared with the child who lives up against a school in a town.  We must take into consideration the children living a considerable distance from the school. Very often these remote schools are not as good as the schools in more populous centres.  I suggest that the local authority very often acted in perfect good faith when trying to draw a distinction and give these children from the remote districts an opportunity to get a scholarship.  The Minister should not overlook that.  I think the House would be anxious to ensure that children in such circumstances would get a fair chance.  We must consider the handicaps of such children, and I think the House will agree they should be given a reasonable opportunity to secure scholarships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy Hughes.  Following the statement made by the Minister with regard to the small schools, where councils discriminate in favour of primary schools as against secondary schools&mdash; in favour of the children in the country who have not an opportunity of getting secondary education under any conditions&mdash;I hope that in future the Department will not object to councils providing for scholarships for the smaller schools as against the larger schools in urban areas.  All the councils who provide these scholarships feel they should do something <Col N="72" /> for the primary schools as against the secondary school pupils.  It is not that they have the slightest objection to giving the Christian Brothers' pupils scholarships&mdash;they realise that such pupils receive a first-class education&mdash; but children living in remote rural areas have no means of getting secondary education and, if the county council so desires, these children should have an opportunity of getting some of these scholarships and should not be compelled to complete against the secondary school pupils.</P>
      <P>I believe the Minister will find, if he insists on what he has now stated&mdash; that there should be no discrimination or nothing in favour of small schools and primary school pupils&mdash; that very few schemes will be put up by the county councils in the future. It is not mandatory in this legislation and the councils are quite entitled to adopt that attitude, and they will do it.  It will be found in any county council area, although it is a county-at-large charge, that probably seven-tenths or eight-tenths of the funds put up for scholarships are contributed by the rural dwellers.  There is no reason why their children, the pupils of primary schools, should not have some advantage over the pupils attending the secondary schools, if the council of that area, in their scheme, so desires.</P>

      <P>(6) The preparation of a scheme shall be a reserved function both in the case of the corporation of a county borough and in the case of the council of a county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the discussion on the Second Reading there appeared to be a misunderstanding as between the Minister and Deputies as to what functions the members of local authorities had in connection with the preparation of schemes.  I think it is quite clear from Section 7 that the raising of the money is to be a function of the <Col N="73" /> elected councils.  I should like to draw the Minister's special attention to columns 1945 and 1946 of the Parliamentary Debates of March 1st, in which he read extracts from a circular, and introduced it in the following words:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... as regards committees the appointment of permissive committees by county councils has also given rise to some misunderstanding.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I submit that the Minister's statement has given rise to more misunderstanding, because it is not clear now whether elected councils in the case of the county boroughs of Dublin or Cork have that power&mdash;that is, to appoint committees to prepare a scholarship scheme.  If the Minister states definitely that they have such power under the circular referred to, then the amendment I am now moving can be altered to provide for this, but in the absence of that assurance I feel that I am interpreting the general feelings of Deputies as expressed on the last occasion, that is, that the conditions to appear in the scheme to be submitted for the Minister's approval should be drawn up by or have the approval of the elected representatives, acting on the advice of the scholarship committee.  When the scheme has been so approved, it will be for the manager to award the scholarship, strictly in accordance with the terms of the scheme.  I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to accepting the principle of the amendment, but I think that the form in which the Deputy has drafted it is not, perhaps, quite satisfactory from my point of view.  The question as between the manager and the council, of course, will depend very largely, as the Local Government circular says, on the relations between them, but in order that it should be made quite clear in the Bill what the legal position is, I think it would be better if we refer the question to the draftsman and ask him to redraft it in such a way as to make it clear that the preparation of a scheme, and the necessary procedure in connection with it, <Col N="74" /> should be a matter for the council: that is, that it should be a reserved function.  If we are going to adopt that principle, I should like to have it put in the clearest possible language and I think that the draftsman may be able to make it copper-fast.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), line 43, after the word &ldquo;prescribe&rdquo; to insert the following words: &ldquo;after consultation with the corporation of a county borough or council of a county&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is more or less similar to the previous one, except that it refers particularly to the clause where the Minister may prescribe, either generally or in regard to any particular scheme or class of schemes, under the Act, examinations, tests and age limits for scholarships, and so on. I consider, somewhat like Deputies Allen and Hughes, that if a Minister has full power to prescribe any scheme he likes, he may prescribe a scholarship scheme for a rural area or outlying areas that would be wholly unsuited to the needs of the rural community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned earlier in his remarks that his only desire was to assist education.  I can assure him that, of course, is our desire also. Nevertheless, a scheme in which children from a rural area are entitled to the benefits does not provide for some of the necessary requirements which their life afterwards in a rural area will make imperative.  I think that the Minister should, at any rate, consult the councils concerned.  I would respectfully draw attention to the fact that the word &ldquo;consultation&rdquo; here does not make it imperative on the Minister to take into consideration either the direction or the wishes of the county council or corporation, as <Col N="75" /> the case may be, but at any rate it gives him an opportunity to get their opinions as to what are the requirements which they believe are necessary for their own areas.  I think it is not too much to expect that the Minister should have some consideration for local applicants, such as Deputies Hughes and Allen mentioned, because the result of this section, if not amended, may be that local bodies will not bother to send in any scheme.</P>

      <P>If local authorities take such a superficial view of their responsibilities, it is extraordinary that members of the House should clamour that the preparation of a scholarship scheme should be made a reserved function.  The councils ought to be as anxious as I am to have these schemes, and to do more, if that is reasonably possible, than is being done at present. Unfortunately, experience has shown that the &ldquo;bureaucrats&rdquo; in this matter, very often, are more enlightened than the public representatives. As I have said already, the Dublin Corporation and other local authorities have at all times carried out their duties excellently, but we have other councils which have not carried out their duties so well.  However, I really do not wish to go into that question.  I simply wish to say, with regard to the two counties, about which the two Deputies asked me&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Counties like Mayo and Monaghan&mdash;counties consisting of small farmers&mdash;have schemes under which, not alone is a certain proportion of the scholarships set aside for rural schools&mdash;in County Mayo, at any rate&mdash;but there is even a reservation for schools, according to the number of teachers in the schools, and there is also a further reservation for vocational schools.  So that, if councils have the idea that they must persist in the purpose of distributing the money, as they consider it, over the county, I think that if they make a reasonable proposal to allocate a certain number of scholarships to rural schools there will be no objection. But why on earth, if there are brilliant children in town schools, should they be deprived of scholarships because the representatives of the rural community want to see that the scholarship money is distributed over the county?  The position is that if we have brilliant children we ought to give them every opportunity, once they conform to the basic conditions which may be necessary as regards means and residence, and I think we ought to be extremely careful not to attempt to impose anything in the way of discrimination against these children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the fact that you have counties such as I have mentioned, and others also, such as Dublin, for instance, to which Deputy Cosgrave referred, in which a certain number of scholarships go to the rural areas, shows that the Department is quite anxious <Col N="77" /> to go as far as possible to secure that local councils will have their wishes acceded to, but I think that Deputies and councillors from rural areas ought not to be unreasonable and that they ought to have regard to the ultimate purpose of these schemes, which is to give an opportunity to children, who have the intellectual equipment, to go forward; and, probably, now and again, it may happen that a student of that kind might come along, whose future work for the country would be of far greater value than the entire value of all the scholarship money that had been granted by the local authority concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like the Minister to misinterpret me.  So far as my own area is concerned, I know that the position is quite all right, because we have a certain number of scholarships for agricultural students, and in the portion of the county which is an urban area there are scholarships suitable for their requirements. I think it advisable, however, that in cases like this, where the Minister is prescribing regulations, he should try to take the county council or the corporation, as the case may be, into his confidence.  That is the reason I put down the amendment&mdash;so that there would not be any dispute or any pique as between local bodies and the Department of Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the argument which the Minister has used against Deputy Allen and myself is rather poor.  It is, in fact, no answer at all to suggest that, because there was no scholarship scheme in Wexford or Carlow, we had made no case.  We are not legislating here for Wexford or Carlow in particular and, so far as I am concerned, I have always tried to influence the local authority in favour of spending money on scholarships.  If the Minister were in my position, he could do no more than that.  With regard to what the Minister says about discrimination, I agree, and I qualified what I said by stating that I did not want any exceptions made.  The Minister stressed the argument as to the <Col N="78" /> possibility of there being a brilliant child in a particular area.  That is true, but it may also happen that that child may have an advantage because it is favourably circumstanced with regard to a good school.  That is merely what we are stressing&mdash;that you can not overlook the possibility that there might be a brilliant child in a rural area, and because the facilities are not there in the shape of a secondary school, it is unfair to put him into competition with others.  He has only a primary education and he is put into competition with a child who has all the advantages of the facilities of an urban area.  We are merely drawing the Minister's attention to that aspect, that while it would be invidious and undesirable to draw distinctions, we feel that we should ensure that the child in a remote area is given an opportunity, having regard to his circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not know that we had no scholarship scheme last year in Wexford, but I believe that what happened was that all the money formerly devoted to these scholarships was devoted to agricultural scholarships. There are 30 agricultural scholarships in operation in the county, so that the Minister is not correct in saying there was no scheme there.  There is a secondary school scheme in operation, although no money was devoted to it last year. There are, however, a number of pupils from previous years and there is a scheme operating.  I admit that in the past there was no difficulty with the Department of Education with regard to framing such a scheme and giving a preference to the small schools but if it is the Minister's point of view that there should be no discrimination in favour of the small schools of the primary schools, I disagree with him.  The council should, and I hope always will, be allowed to discriminate in favour of the primary school child, even though I agree that scholarships for secondary school pupils should also be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a council wishes to discriminate in favour of a primary school, it should be allowed to do so, because the primary <Col N="79" /> school children can never have the opportunity of getting secondary education.  Their parents may never be able to give it to them, whereas in the case of the boy or girl attending the town school, the opportunity is at his or her door all the time.  Most county councils provide university scholarships and a boy or girl attending a secondary school can go straight to the university without any scholarship to a secondary school.  That is the argument of the local council, and I hope the policy of the Department will be left as it has been up to now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what scholarships Deputy Allen refers to.  I have no official knowledge of any scheme in Wexford.  I do not even know whether the scheme is under the agricultural committee or not.  There is no scheme as is generally contemplated for scholarships to secondary or vocational schools.  The Wexford Council apparently has not thought fit to consult the Department on the matter, and we will leave it at that.  I should like to say to Deputy L. Cosgrave that I hope he will not take my remarks as being intended to suggest that he wished to have any discrimination in this matter, but I omitted to explain to him, in connection with Section 5, that the section deals with specific matters of educational importance, first, the question of the tests to be applied, and secondly, the question of the age limits.</P>
      <P>This section has been put in so that it will be made clear that, while, under Section 4, certain conditions and so on may be laid down in regard to schemes, under Section 5 there are two specific matters in regard to which I think the Minister, by virtue of his position, ought not alone to be the final authority in regard to the schemes generally but ought to be in a position to advise the councils in advance as to what his requirements are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the tests, it has always been the procedure that the examination tests were carried out by either officers of the Department of Education or persons appointed by the Department.  With regard to the age <Col N="80" /> limits, it seems to me that this is a matter in respect of which the Minister for Education can fairly claim to say in advance what he thinks they ought to be, having regard to the general age at which children enter secondary and vocational schools and so on, so that if I were to accept Deputy L. Cosgrave's amendment, it would be in regard to consultation on these two matters, which I think he will admit, having heard what I have said, are of a specifically educational nature.</P>
    <P>You will forgive me, Sir, for going back on it, but I should have mentioned, in reply to Deputy Larkin, that under paragraph (e) of Section 4, with regard to the point raised by Deputy A. Byrne, as to parents who are slightly over the limit of means, an exception may be made.  Supposing the limit is £200 and a parent with an income of £200 has a child who gets a scholarship.  It might be considered by a council that that brought the income of the family up to £240, and that it was unfair in these circumstances that a child of a parent with an income, say, of £210&mdash;although technically outside the limit laid down in the conditions of the scheme, but having perhaps a fairly large family&mdash;might not be entitled to enter for a scholarship. That is a matter upon which I would hesitate to lay down any principle.  It was raised by Deputy A. Byrne, who had in mind certain cases in Dublin.  The object is to enable councils like the Dublin Corporation, if they so wish, owing to some special circumstances which we cannot foresee, even though a parent might be slightly outside the limit, to go outside their own published conditions.  The matter could then be considered when it came up in a formal way, but obviously it would be a very serious thing, and only in very exceptional circumstances would one care to contemplate departure from the published conditions. I should like to assure Deputy Larkin and Deputy A. Byrne that there is provision by which a council might submit a special proposal of that nature if it wished.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the manner in which the Minister met representations made to him under this section on the Second Reading.  The Minister said he wanted power to prevent a local authority from awarding a scholarship to people to whom it should not be awarded.  I am not objecting to giving <Col N="82" /> the Minister that power, but I am objecting to the Minister interfering with local authorities who comply fully with schemes drawn up by the committees and which are approved by the Minister.  I suggest that if the Minister has in mind local authorities who are not complying with the regulations it would be unfair to penalise others who are doing so.  There ought to be some other method of dealing with such matters.  I think managers would be in a position to rectify any noncompliance with the regulations by councils.  I do not know if the Minister has lost confidence in the managers. I think they have power to prevent any breach of the regulations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Doyle for some reason seems to consider that exception ought to be taken to the general powers of the Minister in regard to the sanctioning of schemes.  I know that Dublin Corporation has always insisted that it was within its rights to regulate its scholarships, and that that was a matter upon which the sanction of the Minister did not properly arise.</P>
      <P>I stated several times that I have no quarrel with the Dublin Corporation. In one case an important council found itself in a position to award an additional scholarship.  Instead of awarding it to the next candidate on the list in the order of merit the scholarship was awarded to one lower down.  If a council at this stage in our history seeks to circumvent the published regulations, and to depart from the rule that scholarships must be awarded in strict order of merit, it is perhaps not beyond possibility that in case of a renewal of a scholarship some similar situation might arise.  A candidate more worthy than another might be refused a renewal, and the scholarship might be awarded to a less worthy candidate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Deputy ought not to press the amendment.  It is unfortunately the case that by correspondence and consultation we have tried up to the present to get the councils to meet our view or they tried to get us to accept their views.  There must be some finality and, if the Minister is to have general powers to be the final <Col N="83" /> authority in regard to scholarship schemes, I do not see how it would be reasonable or consistent not to place upon him the responsibility of having to sanction the renewal of scholarships. Otherwise it would simply mean that we would have an anomaly for which I do not see any necessity.</P>

I understood from the Deputy Leader of the Government that consideration would be given to that matter.  This morning we hear that the most important Estimate, in present circumstances, that could come before the Dáil was to be taken to-day.  That is the first notification which anybody got of that.  It was assumed that the Drainage Bill would be the business before the House today-and properly so-yet here we have an Estimate for £1,250,000, dealing with the greatest industry in the country, without any notice.</P>
      <P>I had a ring this afternoon from a Deputy in Connacht who, ever since he came into this House, has never failed to speak on this particular Estimate, and his views have always been of a certain amount of value.

I notified the Leaders of the Opposition yesterday morning that this Estimates was to be taken this evening and, seeing that there are three Private Members' Motions on agricultural matters to be taken later, I think it would be as well to bring them in under the discussion on the main Estimate for Agriculture. If they were left on the Order Paper, taking them in the order of priority, they could not be discussed before next July.  These motions dealing with the price of milk, would, in my opinion have to be discussed right away if <Col N="86" /> they were to be of any value, as the 1st April is the latest date for making a decision on that.</P>

The Parliamentary Secretary may think that it is sufficient to give notice the day before.  We have not the facilities of Government to notify Deputies away through the country that this was being taken to-day.  The request made was that, on the last day of a Dáil week, we would get some idea of the business for the following week.  That is a reasonable request.

I do not think it is the intention of Parliament that Deputies coming up from the country might buy a newspaper and see that such-and-such business might be taken.  It is all very well to say that the Leaders of Opposition Parties are communicated with as to what business may be taken.  That means that another private branch exchange is needed to inform the Deputies in the country.</P>
      <P>I think we should be in a position, even now while in the House, to know what is going to happen next week, but we do not know.

As long as I have been here, I have never known from one day to another what would be discussed.  I cannot see what the difficulty is.  I know that the business is arranged between the Parties, but how are the Deputies individually to know?

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum, not exceeding £845,230, be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1945, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture, and of certain Services administered by that Office, including sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any Deputy looking at the Estimate will see that there are three main divisions under which the moneys provided for this Department are spent, namely, research work, agricultural education and development, and the administration of Acts and Statutory Orders. There is a net decrease on the whole Estimate of £110,124 as compared with last year's Estimate.  There are two rather large sums that I want to mention first.  Last year almost £200,000 was provided for the import of nitrate of soda and, as we are not getting any nitrate of soda now and we do not foresee any possibility of getting it for the coming year, that is not included.  On the other hand, there is a sum of about £100,000 extra for the manufacture of <Col N="89" /> superphosphate from imported phosphates and pyrites and native pyrites from Avoca.  That leaves us £100,000 on the right side so far as fertilisers are concerned.</P>
    <P>There are some sub-heads which show an increase, namely: sub-head A, Salaries, Wages and Allowances; sub-head F (1), Agricultural Schools and Farms; sub-head F (2), Grants to Private Agricultural Schools; sub-head H, Grants to County Committees of Agriculture; sub-head J, National Stud; sub-head O (10), Emergency Powers (Tillage) Orders. These between them give us an increase over last year of £50,000, roughly.  Then there are smaller increases under other sub-heads amounting to about £8,000, making the total increase under various sub-heads £58,000.  As against that, we have the decrease that I have already mentioned on sub-head G (3), Fertilisers, of about £100,000.  There are also decreases under sub-head M (4), Loans and Grants for Agricultural Purposes; sub-head O (4), Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat) etc., Acts; sub-head O (6), Acquisition of Lands (Allotments) (Amendment) Act; Potato Subsidies, and other sub-heads, which between them make up about £52,000.  There is an increase in the Appropriations-in-Aid of £16,000, so that all the savings as it were, including the increase in the Appropriations-in-Aid, amount to £168,000, while the excess expenditure over last year amounts to £58,000, giving us a net saving this year of £110,000.</P>
    <P>So far as sub-head A is concerned, there are the ordinary increments and emergency bonus for the staff.  The personnel of the staff has only increased by 12, and these are in the minor grades.  That accounts for the increase under that sub-head.  In addition to that, salaries are provided for under many other sub-heads that any Deputy can see by looking through the Estimate.  The amount under these various sub-heads, apart from sub-head A, for salaries for officials, is £262,693.  If we add the £216,365 under sub-head A, we get a total of £479,058 for salaries, wages and allowances <Col N="90" /> of all the personnel of the Department.</P>
    <P>I want to comment on some sub-heads. It is not possible to go through the whole lot without taking up too much of the time of the House. As to sub-head E (3), for instance, Deputies may be interested to know whether any of these international organisations are working or not, or what is the object of keeping them going at the moment.  The first is the International Institute of Agriculture (Rome) and the subscription is £420. This is an old-established institute which goes back before the League of Nations or any of these other institutions&mdash;it goes back to 1905.  It aims at supplying reliable information on world conditions as respects production, imports, exports and prices of agricultural produce; on the progress of agricultural science and the improvement of agricultural practice, including research work in regard to plant diseases and pests; and on agricultural co-operation, insurance, credit, and other questions of agricultural interest.  The annual subscription payable by this country is 8,000 gold Swiss francs, or £420.</P>
    <P>The next is the International Seed Testing Association (Stockholm).  This is an association of which most countries in the world are members. It deals with fixed standards for seed testing.  Conferences are held every three years to discuss the rules to be laid down, etc.  The annual subscription is only £20.  Then there are the International Dairy Federation (Brussels) and the International Veterinary Bureau (Paris).  There is only a token amount down for these because it is not likely that we will be able to get in touch with either of these organisations during the coming year.  For the World's Poultry Science Association (London) a sum of £5 is down.  That is the subscription payable by this country as a patron of the organisation, but other liabilities are involved as well.  The association is a link between scientists and practical poultry workers in Ireland, England, Scotland, Australia, Canada and South Africa.</P>
    <P>Then we have the various Imperial Agricultural Bureaux, the financial <Col N="91" /> contributions to which originated in 1928 when the Irish Government, with the other Governments concerned, undertook to subscribe a total sum of £20,000 per annum towards the expenses of eight Imperial Agricultural Bureaux.  At a later stage the contributions were increased to £21,800.  The main functions of the bureaux and associated bodies are to undertake the work of collecting and disseminating the results of work of economic importance carried out in all parts of the world in these special branches of agricultural, etc., science, with which the several bureaux are concerned. You have the Imperial Mycological Institute, the Imperial Institute of Entomology, the Farnham House Laboratory, and the Imperial Agricultural Bureaux.  The South American Potato Fund is the next one.  This deals with research into the production of varieties of potatoes free from the influence of various climatic conditions, such as frost, or the influence of various pests, etc.</P>
    <P>The amount provided for the International Beet Conference is merely a token Estimate, because the conference has not been working since the emergency commenced.  The countries attached to that conference are Ireland, Great Britain, Australia, New Zealand, Argentine, Brazil and Uruguay.  The sum provided under sub-head E (4)&mdash;Miscellaneous Investigations, Inquiries and Reports&mdash;is required for experiments in grass ensilage, potato ensilage and trials in storage of onions, etc.</P>
    <P>The next sub head to which I want to refer is F (4)&mdash;Scholarships in Agriculture, etc.  A number of scholarships in agriculture, horticulture and dairy science are granted annually by the Department.  The scholarships in agriculture and horticulture are tenable at University College, Dublin, and the scholarships in dairy science at University College, Cork.  There are usually 20 scholars provided for. They receive free tuition, and a maintenance allowance of £64 3s. 4d. per session.  They also get a free railway voucher when going on vacation and on returning when the holidays are over.  As regards the training of instructors <Col N="92" /> in horticulture, for which £700 is provided, the purpose of the sub-head is to qualify young men in horticulture who are afterwards open for employment by county committees of agriculture or in similar posts.  Four men complete their training each year and these are replaced by other scholarship holders.</P>
    <P>Sub-head G (1)&mdash;Improvement of Milk Production-is connected with cow-testing associations.  There are about 200 cow-testing associations in the country at the moment, and about 50,000 cows are under test. Members of the associations are required to enter for tests all the dairy cows, pedigree and non-pedigree, in their herds.  The income of each association includes the following:&mdash;(a) a fee of 2/- for each member in respect of each cow of his under test; (b) a grant of 4/- from the Department in respect of each cow under test; (c) a grant of £26 10s. from the Department to supplement the salary paid by the association to its supervisor, plus 1/- for each cow under test in excess of 250 cows.  These societies are also helped by the county committees of agriculture.  The committees of agriculture make allocations of funds for the purchase of the requisite initial milk-testing and tattooing apparatus and materials for the use of cow-testing associations.</P>
    <P>The next sub-head to which I should like to refer is G (3)&mdash;Fertilisers Subsidies&mdash;for which £500,000 is provided. The provision for subsidies on imports of phosphates and pyrites and on Avoca pyrites, as already mentioned, is approximately £100,000 more than last year.  A manufacturing programme for the production in the 1944 season of the same quantities of subsidised artificial fertilisers as were distributed during the 1943 season has been approved.  The analyses and prices of the fertilisers will be the same as they were in 1943.  The quantities of pyrites and phosphates already imported, together with the probable production of Clare phosphates, will be sufficient to complete the programme.  There will, therefore, be available for distribution this year 31,000 tons of 30 per cent. superphosphate on the same <Col N="93" /> basis as last year and 18,000 tons of compound fertilisers having an analysis of 20 per cent. soluble phosphate, 2 per cent. citric soluble phosphate, 2 per cent. insoluble phosphate, 2½ per cent. nitrogen and 1 per cent. potash.  It is proposed to reserve 14,000 tons of this fertiliser for the beet crop, 2,950 tons for the production of seed potatoes, 450 tons for root seed production and 600 tons for unemployed allotment holders.  There will also be available 3,800 tons of potato fertiliser having an analysis of 14 per cent. soluble phosphate, 2 per cent. citric soluble phosphate and 5 per cent. nitrogen for the poorer districts adjacent to the western seaboard.  The retail selling prices of the fertilisers will be £13 per ton for 30 per cent. superphosphate and £14 per ton for compound fertilisers and potato fertilisers, ex railway or canal station, nearest to the premises of the vendor.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention that advantage is being taken at the moment by certain people of the present scarcity of fertilisers to sell spurious products as fertilisers at high prices.  In order to put an end to this practice, an Emergency Powers Order has been made which (a) prohibits the manufacture of fertilisers (except kelp) save under licence, and (b) requires the seller of a fertiliser, other than seaweed, farmyard manure and kelp, to give to the purchaser a full statement of analysis.  The Order will, of course, carry the usual penalties.</P>
    <P>We pass on to sub-head H&mdash;Grants to County Committees of Agriculture. The normal grant here, that is the grant on a £ for £ basis of the rate struck in the county, is £112,200.  There is then a special temporary grant of £2,500, and a special grant to provide lime for agricultural purposes amounting to £75,000.  There is an increase in the first and in the third case, and a decrease in the second case.  Every county must strike a rate of 2d. in the £ for county committee purposes, but they are authorised to strike more than 2d.  A rate of 2d. in the £ would bring in approximately £73,000, and the difference between that figure and the £112,000 provided shows that the great majority of counties are striking <Col N="94" /> more than the minimum rate at the moment.  The special temporary grant is for distribution amongst such committees as are in urgent need of financial assistance.  There are a few counties which find it very hard to make ends meet.  The poorer counties are not able to raise sufficient money for this purpose, and they get a special grant.  The special grant to provide lime for agricultural purposes has been provided each year for a number of years back.  I am sure Deputies are aware of how the scheme works.  The county committee advertises for tenders for the supply of lime, and selects what the committee believes to be the best tenders in a particular county.  Then the county committee is enabled by this grant to sell lime to the farmers below cost believes to be the best tenders in a particular county.  Then the county committee is enabled by this grant to sell lime to the farmers below cost price.  In that way, more lime is being used than otherwise would be used.  The costs are higher this year than they were last year, and I felt that we should try to make it easier on the farmer by meeting at least some of those high costs.  For that reason there is a little bit more given for lime this year than last year to meet those extra costs.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The county manager has power, under a certain Order that was made, either to take over a lime-kiln by agreement or by compulsion, and work it.  That is being done, I think, in some counties.  The next matter with which I want to deal is sub-head J, National Stud.  That is a new sub-head. I think I mentioned this some time ago, but it is possible that every Deputy was not here at the time, and it is no harm to mention it again. Negotiations were carried on with the British Government for a number of years&mdash;in fact since 1922, I think-to get the farm at Tully, County Kildare, which was used by the British Government as a stud farm, handed over to this Government.  It was impossible to reach any agreement until quite recently, and the farm was taken over on 1st January.  The farm stock, implements and machinery were taken <Col N="95" /> over at an agreed valuation of £6,960 9s. 3d. The greater part of that &mdash;a little over £5,000&mdash;was for farm stock, that is for cattle and working horses.  The thoroughbred stock had already been removed, so perhaps it was a way of getting over the difficulty that had been there for 20 years&mdash;the difficulty as to who owned the blood-stock. The British Government have agreed to pay us a sum for user in lieu of rent over the years that they held it. That amount has not been agreed on yet, but the general principles on which the amount will be calculated have been agreed.  I do not know exactly what the amount will be.  This farm, as Deputies know, is adjacent to Kildare town, and comprises about 870 acres of land&mdash;very good land, most of it.  It has been run as a stud farm since 1916, and the Government has decided to continue to operate it as a stud farm.  That will mean, of course, getting the necessary stock, and it may take a long time to build up a proper stud there.  Proposals will be brought before the Dáil, I hope in the very near future, for putting this farm on a regular basis, and giving the Dáil our proposals as to how the place should be managed, and so on.  I need not deal with that point at the moment because it will come up again, but in the meantime the farm is being managed by a temporary farm manager, and there are expenses with regard to fencing, drains, and so on.  The grooms, stud hands and labourers were kept on, with the exception of some of the older employees, who retired at the changeover, and who were looked after by the British Government.  They got gratuities and so on from the British authorities on retiring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We took over 26 hands in all.  A sum of £3,700 is required for the wages of the staff for 1944-45, and there is a provision of £12,750 for general expenses. That is made up of £11,000 for the purchase of cattle; seeds, manures and feeding stuffs, £650; implements and tools, £600; and miscellaneous, £500.  Unfortunately, under the system of Government accounting, we do not give at this point what we expect to get back from the <Col N="96" /> farm.  That will come in under Appro priations-in-Aid.  I do not know indeed whether we can promise that the farm will pay in this particular year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Did all the blood-stock go to England?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They had all gone for some time.  I now come to sub-head M (1)&mdash; Miscellaneous work, £20,002.  This in cludes £13,100 for advertising and publicity, including food production propaganda. Of this £13,100, £3,100 is for general advertising, that is, for advertising, say, under the Livestock Breeding Act, announcing that bulls should be shown for licences, and so on.  Then there is a special amount of £10,000 for publicity in connection with increased food production.  Those advertisements for increased food production are operated through the Press, the cinema, the radio and by means of posters.  Tenders are sought from advertising agents with regard to advertising through the Press.  As a matter of fact, the cost would be the same, because the rates on all papers are much the same, but the most attractive display submitted by an applicant secures the tender.  Then through that advertising agent, whoever he may be, the advertising in the Press is done through the morning papers, through 50 provincial papers, and also through weekly journals connected with agriculture, economics, and so on.  The cinema advertising in 1943-44 principally took the shape of a special film connected with wheat growing.  It was exhibited rent free in practically every house in Ireland.  There were also other advertising films.  Radio propaganda took the form of a series of weekly talks and discussions.  Tenders were also invited for the display of posters, and posters are exhibited in railway stations, trams and buses, post offices, national schools, and public houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now come to sub-head M (4)&mdash; Loans and Grants for Agricultural Purposes.  The rate of interest here has been reduced recently to 4½ per cent. The first scheme mentioned here is: Loans for the Purchase of Stallions. A sum of £700 is provided.  Officers of the Department purchase those stallions <Col N="97" /> at sales both in this country and more frequently in Great Britain, and then they are resold to applicants, usually at a considerably lower price than that at which they are bought. The purchaser puts down one-third of the price that he has to pay, and he gets the other two-thirds by way of a loan which is paid back in five equal annual instalments, with interest at 4½ per cent.  The next item is: Loans for the Purchase of Premium Bulls. In this case the buyer of a premium bull puts down one-third of the purchase price, and gets a loan of the remainder, which he repays in two equal annual instalments, also at 4½ per cent. interest.  Then we have loans for the purchase of hand sprayers.  The number of sprayer loans has continuously decreased, and the provision has been reduced from £1,400 to £1,000.  Those loans are also repayable in two equal annual instalments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the reduction due to the fact that sprayers are not available in the same numbers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No. So far, I think we have been able to supply the number required.  The next item is: Loans for the Purchase of Other Agricultural Implements.  Any farm implement costing less than £40 is dealt with by the Department, and any implement costing more than £40 is dealt with by the Agricultural Credit Corporation. In this case the applicant puts down one-fourth of the price in cash, and he gets the other three-fourths by way of a loan, which he pays in three equal annual instalments, also at 4½ per cent. interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next sub-head with which I want to deal is M (9)&mdash;temporary scheme in connection with farm improvements, £52,560.  That is not the total amount which is spent under the farm improvements scheme, because in the Emergency Schemes Vote there is an amount of £350,000 for this purpose. That is the same as was provided last year.  This scheme appears to be working very well, if we are to judge from the number of applicants.  The number of applicants is very big.  In fact, <Col N="98" /> every year we have to close down at a certain date and say we cannot take any more, because there is great difficulty in providing not so much perhaps the money as the staff to deal with those various schemes.  The scheme, although it has been operating for some three or four years, may still be regarded as in the experimental stage, and every year we have been adding to it works that might be carried out.  This year we have added silos, liquid manure tanks, and the laying of concrete floors in farm buildings.</P>
    <P>There are other improvements.  In fact, the principal improvements that the scheme dealt with were drainage and reclamation.  A number of applicants made the point that drainage could not be satisfactorily carried out during the time of year that this money was available. It was available only in the winter-time.  We have now extended the time and it may be possible to get some of these works done.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head M (10)&mdash;Potato Reserve Scheme&mdash;there is a token sum of £5.  That is a scheme for the provision of a reserve of potatoes for Dublin and other cities and towns in case there might be a scarcity later on.  The merchants who come under this scheme have purchased up to 5,000 tons of potatoes which are left in the pit and which will be called on if a scarcity should occur.  It would not appear, from the indications, that there is any grave cause for anxiety in regard to the potato supply but, in any case, it is well to have this reserve on hands.</P>
    <P>There is also a token sum of £5 under sub-head O (5)&mdash;Fertiliser Credits (Wheat) Scheme&mdash;which I should like to explain.  Deputies probably know what the scheme is. When a grower delivers his wheat to a miller or to a miller's agent or to an authorised seed assembler, he gets a docket stating the number of barrels delivered.  Whenever fertilisers are available in large quantities again&mdash; probably that will be when the war is over&mdash;the docket will be exchangeable for a credit voucher for the purchase of artificial manures.  It will be useful then in aiding landowners to restore to the full soil fertility which they feel <Col N="99" /> has been lost by extensive cereal growing during the emergency.  I need hardly say that the docket is available for the 1944 wheat crop in addition to the 55/- per barrel that has already been announced and which will be paid in cash.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head O (6)&mdash;Acquisition of Land (Allotments) (Amendment) Act, there is a reduction of £13,600 in the provision for free seeds, manures, implements, etc., compared with 1943-44. During the 1943 season 85 of the 87 local authorities in the country operated schemes, and in addition there were 45 associations that provided schemes, apart from local authorities, were 45 associations that provided schemes, apart from local authorities, but the total number of allotments cultivated by approved unemployed persons was 20,181, representing a decrease of 3,297 as compared with 1942.  There was a slight increase&mdash;a few hundred&mdash;in the number of allotments cultivated by employed persons. Arrangements are being made, of course, for the continuation of the scheme in 1944, but it is not anticipated now that there will be any increase in the number of allotments worked during this year as compared with last year.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head O (7)&mdash;Flax Act, 1936-there is provision of £3,680.  The area under flax in 1943 increased to about 27,500 acres.  This flax is exported, but against that we get, perhaps not our full requirements, but supplies of fibre for the manufacture of twine and yarn for binder twine and thread-making.  In that way the flax fulfils a useful purpose.  There are adequate supplies of seed and potash for this year's flax crop now available.</P>
    <P>I wish now to deal with some of the items of produce that are dealt with under agriculture.  The first is dairy produce.  We can all agree that dairying remains, as it has been for many generations, the keystone of our agricultural industry.  It not only provides an income for those who deal in milk production but it also is necessary for the production of cattle so that the cattle trade depends on dairying.  It is also a very important factor in the bacon, poultry and egg <Col N="100" /> industries.  As far as one can calculate, there are about 90,000 households dependent to a great extent on the production of creamery butter and to these we must add a large number, which it would be difficult to calculate, who count farm butter as a very important item in their farming economy.  Its influence on other branches also makes it a very important matter.  After the last war the world price of creamery butter remained very satisfactory until about 1929.  About that time there was a general depression in world agriculture which struck the dairy business in particular, and there was a very marked fall in the price of butter.  It was hoped for some time that that might be a temporary matter but after a few years it became apparent that it was going to be a prolonged depression.  In 1932 the Stabilisation Act was passed which had as its object to keep the price of butter on the home market at a remunerative level, that is, as far as the producer was concerned.  We had to put up with what we got for our exported butter because the export market was not under our control.  That stabilisation did not prove sufficient.  Within a year or so it was necessary for the Exchequer to come to the assistance of the dairy farmer and from the end of 1932 until the present time there has been a certain amount voted every year to subsidise the price of butter. In 1939 there was a new crisis, if you like.  It is difficult now to imagine that our crisis in September, 1939, was caused by the fact that we had too much butter and could not dispose of it.  We had a big exportable surplus and there was no way of disposing of it, for there seemed to be nobody to take it.  Of course, that position righted itself after a while. A few years later, the tables were turned the other way.  We came to a point at which we had to stop the export of butter because we were no longer getting fats from other sources.</P>
    <P>All these fats and oils which were imported prior to the war had stopped and the only fat we had, for all purposes, was butter.  Then, butter commenced to get scarce.  During all that time from 1932 when somebody had to <Col N="101" /> interfere in the butter business the big consideration was to get a fair balance between the producer and the consumer. In September, 1939, the price of milk at the creamery was 5.4d. per gallon.  There have been various increases since then.  In April, 1942, the price went up to 7d. per gallon; in September, 1942, to 9d., and in December, 1943, to 1/-.  It will go back on the 1st April to 10½d.  From the 1st April onwards, the price of milk to the creamery will be 10½d., which is practically double what it was when the war commenced.  To a great extent, the consumer has had to meet this increase; to some extent, the Exchequer.  The consumer was paying 1/6 in December, 1939.  He is now paying 2/4.  The Exchequer will pay £70,000 during the coming year, as compared with £500,000 in 1939.</P>
    <P>The production of creamery butter has varied downwards since 1936 or thereabouts; before that, it was moving upwards.  To the 31st March, 1944 &mdash;there are not many days of the year remaining and we can make an estimate for the entire period&mdash;production will be about 601,000 cwts.  During the previous year, up to the end of March, 1943, it was 611,000 cwts.  The year before that, it was 658,000 cwts.  For the purpose of comparison, I may say that production, before the war commenced, was 714,000 cwts, so that during the period of the war it has gone down more than 100,000 cwts., or about 17 per cent.  It has not yet got the same shake that it got when the big crash came in 1929.  If we take the year ended 31st March, 1932, only 605,000 cwts. were produced.  There was a sudden crash at that time.  During the past three or four years, production has gone down gradually.  I am glad to be able to state that for January and February this year production is up 14 per cent. on that of last year.  These are, however, months of very poor production and I should not like to argue from that increase that we shall have greater production in 1944 than we had in 1943.  It is, however, a good omen and we may hope that, with the increased price, we shall get as much in 1944 as we got in 1943.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="102" /> We had in cold storage for this winter&mdash;we take our cold storage figures in November each year&mdash;172,000 cwts. of butter.  That was slightly higher than the figure for the winter before&mdash;about 3,000 cwts. higher.  But we had not sufficient butter cold-stored and it is intended to continue the present ration for some time into the summer until we see how we stand. We feel that, if we could get 210,000 cwts. into cold storage, we could give a ration of half a pound during the winter.  I think that Deputies will agree that it is more important to get half a pound of butter in the winter than it would be to get the same amount in summer, because in winter more fats are needed.  In addition, more farm butter will be available in summer and that will make up for the deficiency to some extent.  The strange thing about this storage question is that, in the winter of 1940-41, when there were no imports, we stored 88,000 cwts., which is practically half what we stored this year.  We had then no rationing and no imports and we had plenty of butter.  It is difficult to understand these matters.  It was reported to me the other day that some people think that butter is being exported.  No creamery butter has been exported since April, 1942&mdash;two years ago.  Perhaps it is going too far to say that no creamery butter has been exported, because a very small quantity goes out under licence, with people leaving the country.  So far as my recollection serves, that does not amount to one cwt. in the month.  We closed down on the export of butter in July, 1941, with the exception of contracts already made.  These contracts accounted for a little over 3,000 cwts., which we exported between that time and April, 1942.  For a long time, therefore, we may say that no creamery butter has been allowed out of this country.  A small quantity of farmers' butter&mdash;factory butter, as it is called&mdash;has been exported every year up to the present time.  Recently it has amounted to only a few hundred cwts.  It is very inferior stuff and it goes out in tins and is also used for ships' stores. There are, of course, other milk products going out.  No cheese is going <Col N="103" /> out.  A certain amount of condensed milk is going out.  We have a factory in Limerick which can be run only on a quantitative basis and the amount of condensed milk which would be used here would enable that factory to be run only for about a couple of months in the year.</P>
    <P>It would have to be closed for the remainder of the year.  A balance must be struck between the advantages and disadvantages.  The factory gives very good employment.  It fills a very useful function in providing condensed milk for us that could hardly be provided unless there were some exports as there would be difficulty in getting certain materials which are necessary such as tins.  Unless we allowed these exports, it is unlikely that we should be provided with these materials and we should have to make up our minds to go without condensed milk.  Condensed milk is useful to certain people and it is particularly useful as a stand-by in case of emergency.  If we were to place these advantages against the consideration of the amount of butter that could be supplied if the milk were not to go out&mdash; the amount would not be very big&mdash; the balance would, I think, be in favour of allowing the export to continue. There is also an export of milk powder.  I was very much misrepresented when I spoke about this matter before, and I hope Deputies will not misrepresent me on this occasion.  An agreement was made some years before the war between the exporters of milk powder and certain manufacturers of baby powders in Great Britain.  That agreement still holds.  If we were to stop the export of milk powders we would get no more baby powders in. Deputies may say to me: &ldquo;Then, why not keep the milk powders here for our own babies and not allow them out or the others in.&rdquo;  I have always been afraid to face that issue because of the fact that mothers have such faith in certain powders for their children.  If anything happened to them I was afraid that I would be blamed as being responsible.  Now, the misrepresentation that I refer to is this: At the last election I said what I have just stated, <Col N="104" /> but a certain Deputy in this House said afterwards that I now proposed to kill the babies as well as everything else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not propose to do that.  In fact.  I was doing the opposite. With regard to liquid milk supplies, they were better in 1943 than in the previous year.  There was no serious shortage at any particular place at any particular time.  As a matter of fact, as Deputies will remember, there was at this time last year&mdash;in January and February, 1943&mdash;a shortage of milk for some time in Dublin.  We avoided that this year, and there was no shortage of milk.</P>
      <P>The minimum price for liquid milk in the towns was raised last year, and evidently that had the desired effect as far as prices go.  I would like to say this much about the supply of milk, especially to the two cities, Dublin and Cork, that there appears to be a steady increase all the time in the consumption of milk in both cities. Take the Dublin figures.  The first reliable figures that we have for Dublin became available when the 1936 Act, dealing with the Dublin milk supply, was put into operation.  In 1939 the average number of gallons of milk consumed per day in Dublin was 39,460, and in 1943 the average was 43,272 gallons&mdash;almost a 10 per cent. increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These figures do not coincide with the sort of opinions that you hear expressed by certain people that we are not getting as much milk here as we did formerly.  We are actually getting more.  With regard to price, since the Dublin Milk Board came into being, I think they have done very good work.  They have succeeded in giving a good deal better price to the producer without increasing, to the same extent, the price to the consumer.  The price to the producer from 1937 and 1938, when the Act came into operation, up to the present time, has gone up on the average from 1/0¼d. per gallon to 1/8¼d. per gallon, whereas in the same period the price to the consumer has gone up from 1/6¾d. to 2/4. <Col N="105" /> The increase in the case of the producer was 53 per cent., and in the case of the consumer 38 per cent.</P>
    <P>Our exports of eggs during the year 1943 were lower by 620 great hundreds than in 1942.  This was due, I feel, to various causes.  One was the increased home consumption of eggs.  Unfortunately, we have not got any reliable figures either in regard to the production of eggs or to the home consumption of eggs, but there appears to be general agreement that the consumption is higher.  There was a heavy selling of laying poultry on account of the high price for fowl.  There was a scarcity of feeding stuffs, and in 1943 this was aggravated by the increase in the number of turkeys.  In addition, there was a failure amongst poultry producers to hatch enough early pullets during the spring of 1943.  We are using whatever propaganda we can in the Department to have an expansion in the poultry and egg business.  I feel it should be possible to provide food for more hens.  There is a very profitable business in more egg production. We have in mind the interest of the consumer in this country in the first place.  As Deputies know, there was a scarcity of eggs for a lengthened period before Christmas in the last few years.  We feel that the only way to get over that is to have a much bigger production.  The surplus, of course, will be exported when eggs are very plentiful, but if we aim at a much bigger production, then we shall always have enough for ourselves.</P>
    <P>We are using this propaganda and giving whatever expert advice it is possible to give through the county committees of agriculture in order to encourage and assist poultry producers to secure a much bigger production in 1944.  We are emphasising in particular the necessity for early hatching so that we can have pullets that will come into production during the scarce period from October to Christmas.  We are offering various inducements to achieve that.  The price of eggs will be higher, probably by 4d. or 5d. per dozen on the average, taking the whole year round. We are also providing, in the case of cockerels which are a nuisance, that <Col N="106" /> the big egg producer will get fancy prices for them from the months of March to June&mdash;about 2/6 per lb. live weight, so that they cannot claim that there is any loss sustained by them in rearing young chickens because there were too many cockerels amongst them.  The feeding of this poultry should not cause any great difficulty because we have found, from experiments carried out throughout the country, that poultry can be fed quite successfully on potatoes, oats and barley, and a small extra amount of these crops will feed a good increase in the number of poultry on any farm.  The exports of poultry in 1943 were the same as in 1942.  In the case of rabbits the exports declined by 30 per cent. as compared with the previous year.  I think we all look on that as a good thing.  It is an indication that there are less rabbits in the country, and from that point of view we welcome the figures giving the decrease.</P>
    <P>Coming to pigs, there was an order made on the 30th September, 1943, fixing a minimum price for pigs and doing away with the provision that was there of a fixed price.  At that time the fixed price was 125/- per cwt., dead weight, for pigs of the optimum weight, and since that time the prices have ranged round 160/- and 170/- per cwt.  That was a very welcome and very substantial increase, and if price were the only consideration it should ensure a big increase in pig production. It is quite evident, of course, that price is not the only consideration. There are indications, from certain quarters that there will be more pigs coming along.</P>
    <P>We keep a very careful and, as far as we can, an accurate account of sow services from boar centres.  It shows a slight increase, but not anything extraordinary. I feel, and I suppose everybody else must feel the same, that we cannot have any big increase in pig production until we first provide the feeding.  If there is a good crop of oats and barley and potatoes during the coming year, it is possible there will be a bigger urge to go into pig production.  That is the only hope of getting increased pig production.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="107" /> A question was raised in the Dáil a few days ago with regard to the distribution of bacon from the factories. The Pigs and Bacon Commission are taking charge of that scheme of distribution and, as far as they can, they will see that every district gets a fair share of the bacon available.</P>
    <P>Another matter that seems to worry some people is the export of milch cows and breeding heifers.  Unfortunately, in this instance I cannot give figures, because I am not allowed to give figures of exports; but I can say this, that there were less heifers sent out in 1943 than in 1942.  That did not apply to cattle in general, but there were less heifers.  As to the heifers going out, everybody knows there is quite a number of heifers not good for breeding, like Hereford crosses and Aberdeen Angus crosses.</P>
    <P>I do not think we need be alarmed that the foundation of our breeding stock is being lost to the country.  In fact, when we come to cows, we find even more encouraging figures.  The export of cows is controlled by licence and the number of licences provided in 1943 was much less than the number in 1942.  We felt we were, perhaps, allowing too many out, but, in fact, although we reduced the number of licences in 1943, they were used to the full only in three months out of the whole year&mdash;in June, July and September. In every other month of the year the licences were not fully taken up.  About 40 per cent. fewer cows went out in 1943, than in 1942.</P>

      <P>If the number of heifers that went out was also less, they must be keeping them for some reason.  I might also mention that there were less cows sent to the canneries, so, judging by the figures&mdash;and I suppose one can prove anything from figures&mdash;<Col N="108" /> we are going to have a lot of cows this year.</P>
      <P>With regard to agricultural machinery, we imported, in 1943, a number of tractors, reapers and binders and threshing sets from Great Britain. These were got in by agreement between the two Governments, and they were allocated to the districts and counties that we in the Department felt needed them most. The counties that were worst off got the bigger numbers and the counties that did not need them so badly got the smaller numbers.  They were given to applicants who, it was believed, would make the best use of them. Unfortunately, some of those binders and threshing sets were late; the binders were late for the harvest and the threshing sets for the threshing period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>One hundred altogether. There is some confusion among Deputies and others with regard to tractors.  We do not control all the tractors that came in.  There were 36 tractors and certain other implements that came in uncontrolled.  They came to agents here in the ordinary quotas to which they were entitled as traders. We do not control them at all and we do not interfere with the people to whom they sold them.  They were controlled with regard to price, but there was no control with regard to the people to whom they were sold.  For the coming year we have 100 binders and we expect to get another 250.  We may be optimistic, but we expect another 250.  We cannot yet say how we stand with regard to tractors.  I need hardly say that we have been pressing for tractors and binders since last July or August.  A certain number of binders has come in and we are expecting to get more.</P>
      <P>Horse-drawn machinery is in fair supply.  There are occasional inquiries in the Department for ploughs and harrows and other implements but, so far as they are concerned, I do not think there is a real scarcity; it may be hard to get them, but there is no real scarcity.  Parts are also in fairly good supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="109" /> With regard to agricultural education, we all agree that to have better farming we want more knowledge, and the best way to get this is by trying to get education spread amongst the young farmers&mdash;it is not so easy to get the old fellows.  The aim is to get the young men, to provide facilities for young farmers in the way of education. To ensure that the results of the various research works being carried on in various Government Departments and universities, the results of the experiments, will reach the farmers, is another very important matter.  For that we have the publications of the Department, such as the Journal.  That is not read by every farmer, I know well, but still, knowledge gets spread around, and there are very good articles from time to time in the Journal.  Then we have leaflets on various subjects.  They are being used very much more as time goes on.  The demand for these leaflets has increased enormously in recent years.  We have pamphlets and, as well as that, we have informative announcements through the Press and over the radio.  Apart from anything the Department may be doing, we have the agricultural periodicals, which are doing excellent work, and even the ordinary newspapers and the weekly papers have special articles on some agricultural subject.  That, again, is very useful, because these articles very often deal with some aspect of reseach work or some experiment that is being carried out either by the universities or by the Department.</P>
    <P>The instructors in each county do a great deal of good work.  I often hear people in the city talking about the deplorable lack of facilities for agricultural education.  They have no idea what is being done by the county staffs.  These instructors do a great deal of work.  They give lectures to farmers on special subjects which arise from time to time.  They lecture on ensilage and they lecture quite a lot on wheat growing and matters of that kind, wherever their services are required. They give special lectures and they carry on winter classes.  These classes are very useful institutions. <Col N="110" /> The pity is that we cannot get the county committees to increase their staffs, so that these winter classes could become more general, and it would be possible for the instructor to go back to the same parish more frequently with these classes.</P>
    <P>At present he cannot go back more than once in every seven or ten years to carry on the course.  Then the county instructor pays visits to farmers, and this is the most useful feature of all, because he can discuss agricultural matters with the farmer. These things all help to spread the necessary information.  I am quite satisfied from my talks with farmers and their sons that their standard of knowledge is infinitely higher than the standard of 35 or 40 years ago.  You never meet a farmer or a farmer's son now who does not understand everything about the analysis of foodstuffs, manures and the proper grass seed mixture.  The farmers of to-day are definitely much better informed.  I do not claim to have a very big experience of mixing with farmers on the Continent; I have some experience though, and I can say, from mixing with those people, that our farmers can compare favourably with them in knowledge and experience.</P>
    <P>Our agricultural education is based on a certain pattern or structure.  At the apex you have the university, with two faculties, agriculture in Dublin and dairy science in Cork.  Next you have the residential colleges, one of which is in Glasnevin and which is under the university.  We have three directly under the Department, at Clonakilty, Ballyhaise and Athenry. We have four more which are privately owned, but which have an association with the Department.  We have a certain association with them and give them grants, provided they carry out the work in a certain way.  One was added during the year in Monaghan, by the authorities of St. McCartan's College.  There is an agricultural college there.  It was opened during the year.  Then for girls we have the Munster Institute, and we have 12 private schools in rural domestic <Col N="111" /> economy that receive grants from the Departments.</P>
    <P>The question of taking steps to augment the educational facilities in these schools for both boys and girls has long been under consideration. Our existing colleges want both renovation and extension.  As a matter of fact, we have no permanent buildings at Athenry and Clonakilty, and it is intended to rebuild these colleges as soon as possible and to enlarge them. We may be able to extend the accommodation already existing in these colleges in the meantime, so as to accommodate the students who are applying, because we have more applications from both boys and girls, than we can deal with at the moment in our agricultural colleges.  In this connection, I should like to tell Deputies that, through the generosity and public-spiritedness of the representatives of the late Lady Maurice Fitzgerald, Johnstown Castle, an estate near Wexford has been made available for the purpose of an agricultural school. That is a very fine property.  The house is much bigger than most of our agricultural colleges.  It will accommodate more students than any of our other colleges, and there will be a better opportunity for a variety of agricultural work there, including research and experimental work.  As soon as arrangements can be made for a certain amount of reconstruction to be undertaken, the college will be open, and I hope that it will be ready for accommodation during the coming year.</P>

      <P>It will be used as an agricultural college.  There will also be a forestry section attached to it, but we have not yet considered whether that will be taken over by the Forestry Department or by my Department. Now, with regard to veterinary education: A few years ago I set up a committee <Col N="112" /> to inquire into and report on this matter of veterinary education in this country.  That committee reported in due course to the effect that our present veterinary college was understaffed, that the building was inadequate, and that it was poorly equipped.  We had, therefore, to deal with all three questions : under-staffing, inadequate building, and poor equipment.  The staff was improved both in numbers and in status, some new equipment was obtained, and plans for re-modelling, repairing, and adding to the building were carried out so far as the emergency permitted. These plans will be completed as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to pay a tribute to the authorities of Trinity College, Dublin, because they gave us part of their Botanic Garden at Lansdowne Road in order to enable us to improve our experimental facilities there. Were it not for that, we would not have been able to make the improvements that we have been able to make. When we get the necessary equipment we will have a very fine college there, which will bear favourable comparison with any other veterinary college.  We have, to a great extent, got the equipment already, but when we have got all the equipment we will have a very fine college.  Veterinary research has been carried out at a separate establishment, known as the Thorndale Veterinary Research Station, which is near Drumcondra.  There is a small farm there, and also a laboratory for research work, but in the meantime the demand for more and more research work has outgrown the facilities provided at that establishment, and we are examining the question of the facilities which must be provided for inquiring into the causes of the various diseases which result in such serious losses to our live stock.  In particular, we are examining the question of providing facilities for the production of vaccines and sera, which are so much in demand at the moment. Deputies know that vaccines and sera are coming very much into use for the prevention and cure of disease.  We have been turning out there, for some time past, vaccines for three very important diseases: contagious abortion, <Col N="113" /> mastitis, and blackwater.  One disease which has given us a great deal of trouble is contagious abortion, and there has been a good deal of talk recently to the effect that the Americans have developed a vaccine, called Strain No. 19, which has had good results.</P>
    <P>That has been tried to some extent in this country, but so far we have not found that it has any advantage over the vaccine turned out at Thorndale. Apart from that, special equipment would be required in order to turn it out here in any quantity, and it would be definitely difficult to get that equipment at the moment.  Accordingly, I think it would not be very wise for us to go to any great trouble about getting in such equipment unless we were convinced that that vaccine was definitely superior to the vaccine which we produce here ourselves.  As a matter of fact, we are carrying out experiments with a view to determining whether or not it is superior.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I know about that. I was coming to the question of mastitis next.  The question of treating mastitis by a vaccine or serum, I am afraid, is giving a great deal of trouble.  It is not easy to treat a disease of that kind&mdash;especially, as the disease develops&mdash;by a vaccine or serum.  The matter, of course, is being actively pursued, not only here, but in practically every country in the world, and I may say that no more progress has been made in any other country in the world than has been made here in that regard.  In other words, we have made no progress at all, any more than other countries have made no progress, but we are keeping in touch with research workers all over the world, and if there should be any likely development we shall hear all about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="114" /> Reviewing the whole matter, anyhow, I feel that the time has arrived when we must be prepared for much greater expenditure in connection with the measures to be taken for the control and eradication of live-stock diseases, and one of the first steps to be taken must be the provision of better facilities for veterinary research.</P>
    <P>We must enlarge our laboratory, get better facilities of various kinds and also perhaps a bigger personnel. The men we have are as good as we will find in any country in the world. The quality is good, but we might want more.  I should like to mention that the committee which is examining post-war policy has this question of animal disease under consideration and I expect to get a report from them in the near future.</P>
    <P>I have been giving a great deal of consideration and thought for some years back to these bigger issues I have mentioned, that is, a higher agricultural education, research in general agriculture, veterinary education and veterinary research, and I am not satisfied that they are being managed to the best advantage.  They are under different control; they are not co-ordinated; and one section is perhaps doing something about which the other does not know.  I intend to have the question examined as soon as possible in a more regular, a more minute way and to see what action could be taken to bring about better co-ordination of the various people who are working on the matters, and perhaps even better control.  The proposal was made some time ago&mdash;I cannot remember whether publicly or not &mdash;that one comprehensive technological college should control the whole lot.  That is a very big problem. It may or may not prove to be the best solution, but, at any rate, we must have it examined in the near future.</P>
    <P>Our big problem at the moment is food production and the need for making provision for our immediate food requirements overshadows every other consideration and every other aspect of agricultural policy.  It must be evident to everybody now that there can be no safety for this country until we produce everything we want <Col N="115" /> in the way of food, whether directly for ourselves, such as bread and sugar, or indirectly for the feeding of animals, to give us milk, butter, bacon and eggs.  I must say that I am very favourably impressed by the amount of tillage being done.  I have covered most of the country during the last month or two and I think that, with the greatly increased sowings of all crops which are now taking place, we should be practically independent of any foreign supplies.  I would not like, however, to be taken as being too satisfied with the position.  I should like to appeal to everybody to use all the power and all the persuasion he has to get more and more sown so that we may be on the safe side.</P>
    <P>The necessary measures are being taken to deal with those who are impervious to appeals and do not appear to mind whether the country goes without food or not.  There have been appointed this year 200 young farmers or farmers' sons who have spent a year at an agricultural college to assist the inspectors in getting tillage done.  They can get my authority to enter a farm where tillage is not being done, or where it looks as if the owner is not going to do it, and much of the tillage is being carried out on farms which were entered upon.  I feel that nobody will offer any excuse for people who, during these times, do not try to carry out their obligations in the matter of tillage. The position is so serious that we must ensure that each holding in the country will make a fair contribution to our food supplies.  There are problems that have to be dealt with, and one of them is the problem of the carrying out of the tillage requirements in the letter rather than in the spirit, such as the growing of cereals year after year in the same field and not minding very much whether a return is got or not, both exhausting the land and giving us poor yields.  We have to deal with that problem and we have dealt with many cases this year and last year by compelling the landholder to plough proper land for crops.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="116" /> No land is too good to give us the wheat and the crops we want in this crisis, and the practice I refer to will not be accepted any longer.  These landholders&mdash;they are few, but there are some who wish to evade their responsibilities&mdash;must adopt proper farming methods, proper rotation of crops, and good husbandry, which is the only way in which we can get the crops we want.  I have been urged over and over again by, if you like, impatient people, to hand these landholders over to the Land Commission and let the Land Commission take the land from them.  There is an obvious error in law there, but that, I suppose, could be made right.  I did not, however, like to mix up my activities with those of the Land Commission, though I am beginning to see that there is some merit in the suggestion, because I believe the country cannot any longer afford bad farmers.  We must have regard also to the period covering some years hence and we must make up our minds that, whenever the war may end, the emergency, so far as food is concerned, will not end then.  It will not end for some years afterwards, so that in any plans we are making at the moment, we must assume that we are planning for the period at least five years, if not longer, ahead.</P>
    <P>That is why it is so important to make landholders who are not already doing so carry out their tillage in the proper way, not to exhaust particular fields and not to give us bad yields by carrying on cropping year after year in the same field.  The only proper method of farming is farming on the basis of proper rotation, with farmyard manure and so on.  If we get the 3,000,000 acres for which we have planned on a percentage basis of tillage this year, we should be fairly safe.  We should have all the food we require and a good amount of feeding for animals as well.  That will give us a proper balance in our agriculture: a proper amount of tillage with pasture, making us independent of foreign supplies, and giving us a chance of carrying on here with a proper system, a sound policy, which will make for stable conditions.</P>
    <P>To know how we stand, perhaps we <Col N="117" /> should take the index of agricultural prices, although I know that these figures do not always give the picture one wants to get.  The agricultural price index figure, which stood at 105 in September, 1939, stood in January of this year at 198, that is, an increase over the pre-war figure of about 86 per cent.  If the farmer's income on average has increased by 85 or 86 per cent., we must find out how his outgoings compare with it.  The cost-of-living index figure has gone up by 68 per cent., so that, so far as expenses for his household requisites are concerned, he still has a margin.</P>
    <P>
      <i>An Ceann Comhairle resumed the Chair.</i>
    </P>
    <P>A question was asked about increased agricultural wages since the war commenced.  They will be up by 50 per cent.  I am now dealing with 1943.  Up to that, wages were up only 33? per cent.  Whether they are up 50 per cent. or 33½ per cent., they are on the index prices well within the increased income of farmers.  Rents and rates are gone up by 10 per cent. Looking at farmers' balance sheets they have 85 per cent. more in the way of receipts.  They are paying wages that have gone up by 33½ per cent., and that this year will be 50 per cent., more than they paid before the war.  Rent and rates represent 10 per cent. and form a big item on the expense side, but a farmer has a good balance left, out of which he is able to meet the increased cost of living.  That is on percentages. On the other hand, a farmer might say that his volume of output had gone down.  On that theoretical computation there is a reduction.  I find it very hard to understand how we could get anything to compare the volume.  If farmers have 1,000,000 gallons of milk less than they had in 1939, and if they have £1,000,000 more from wheat I do not know whether the volume has gone up or gone down.</P>
    <P>I know that there is a recognised system but the result would depend on how prices stood in 1929 or 1939.  Taking the volume such as it is, we find that farmers got £32,500,000 more in <Col N="118" /> 1942-43 than they got in 1938-39.  Out of that £32,000,000, the increase in wages amounted to £2,500,000, and rent and rates, £600,000.  If we ignore wages altogether, as many farmers do not have to pay wages, naturally their sons must get something out of the land.  If we take everybody engaged in agriculture we find roughly that they have got £1 a week more than they got in 1939.</P>

      <P>Farmers are better off than they were pre-war.  They are better off than they were since 1920. When Deputies tell us that farmers were better off before Fianna Fáil got into power, all I say is that they cannot complain now.  The question is: Were farmers fairly treated before the war? Some say &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, others say &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  Supposing we admit, for the sake of argument, that they were not. What has happened since then?  The farmers' income has gone up considerably, something like 50 per cent.  That is in cash, in pound notes, and represents more than 50 per cent., while in the case of most other classes incomes <Col N="119" /> have stood still.  In some cases the position has gone back and, in a few cases, there have been increases under strict regulation.  Comparing one with another, every class of farmer is better off now than before the war.  There is no doubt about that.  They have got substantial increases.</P>
      <P>I am not speaking of classes but of individuals.  What I want to know is: Are farmers justly treated?  Perhaps they are.  I met groups of farmers, some at meetings of country committees of agriculture, at which many of them were present, and I said to them: &ldquo;You have no grievance now; but what you have to be afraid of is the future.&rdquo;  It is a fact, that farmers are afraid of the future.  We should consider the future because that is the danger as far as farmers are concerned.  We should give all our attention to that aspect of agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some things that we can do now and other things that we can plan to do later.  The first duty of farmers is to supply our needs, and our duty is to see that they can do this. Our second duty is to put farmers in a position to export some of their surplus produce to pay for our necessary imports. These exports will be going to a market that it may be hard to hold. That will mean cheap but efficient production, as well as processing and grading to suit the buyer in that foreign market.  It will mean organised marketing so as to prevent underselling, and to ensure that there will be a fair even supply all the time to that market.  These are the things which must take the place of subsidies. I am afraid that subsidies must be regarded as a temporary measure and that they cannot be contemplated as a long-term policy for agriculture.  It is much more difficult to plan a thing like that than to suggest that the farmers be given another 1d. here or 5/- there.  The planning is difficult, but I can assure Deputies that I am very willing and anxious to listen to suggestions for the reorganisation and improvement of our agriculture for the future, to meet the position that may arise when this war is over.  I believe we could have a profitable discussion <Col N="120" /> on that question and from that angle. On the other hand, we could, perhaps, waste a few days talking about 1d. a gallon for milk or 5/- a ton for beet.</P>

      <P>I was not the one, anyway. I am glad the Minister has approached this important discussion on agricultural administration in the manner in which he has approached it &mdash;on the assumption that anticipated imports will arrive, and that recent events regarding our international policy are unlikely to affect our supply position.  I do not think that any provocative references by public men will help that position.  Such utterances would be rash and indiscreet.  Whatever significance we may attach to those events, we are not helping the position by making any reference to them.  There should be enough statesmanship in the Government to deal with the matter, and public references of that sort would not be helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a very important matter that <Col N="121" /> we are discussing now&mdash;the use of the land.  Land is one of the prime essentials of human subsistence, and the proper and profitable use of its land, measured not merely in terms of the individual man's immediate needs, but also in terms of man's collective requirements, both present and future, is of paramount importance to every nation.  It is particularly so to this country of ours, where our prosperity&mdash;aye, our very existence&mdash; depends almost exclusively on our agricultural economy, on the type of husbandry that we pursue, and how we operate it.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from minor extensions which reclamation may make possible, the extent of arable land has been stated recently by the Minister to be about 10,500,000 acres.  To all intents and purposes, that quantity is fixed and inextensible.  Taking our geographical position, our climatic conditions, our soils and suitability for cropping, our whole live-stock economy and the volume in population, it is right and proper that this House should concern itself with our present position and with the future we are likely to face in the post-war period.  The House should ask itself whether it is satisfied with the present position of our agricultural economy, notwithstanding the rather brave efforts on the Minister's part to defend it.  He appears to view our present position and our future prospects in agriculture with complacency.</P>
    <P>If one surveys the whole trend of our agricultural production over a long period of years, one is struck by the static position, notwithstanding the help and assistance that the Minister suggests have been brought to agriculture through agricultural education, the provision of scientific knowledge, the application of modern methods and modern technique and the use of machinery and mechanisation. Our position has not only been static over a long period of years, but in recent years it has shown a tendency towards a rather steep decline. We must compare that with what has occurred in other countries where the production curve has shown a steep rise, although those countries were in <Col N="122" /> a similar position to ours.  In view of all that, one is entitled to ask whether there is not something fundamentally wrong with our agricultural economy.</P>
    <P>The <i>Irish Trade Journal</i> for December, 1943, page 150, Table 2, gives us a fair picture of our position, stating:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The total volume of agricultural output declined by 7.7 per cent. in 1942-43, as compared with 1941-42, Live stock and live-stock products showed a decline of 7.8 per cent., and crops and turf a decline of 7.4 per cent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Taking the volume of our live stock and live-stock products on the base of 100 in 1929-30, the table shows that it had fallen in 1942-43 to 78.7, a reduction of 21 per cent. in live stock and live-stock products.</P>
    <P>The Minister went to considerable trouble to review at great length this evening our whole live-stock position, but he made no reference to the stagnation and decline in live-stock production. In the Statistical Abstract for 1942-43 we are informed that our production in starch equivalents was lower than that for 1941-42 by 12 per cent., while our total production was lower by 4 per cent.  That shows that there is a progressive decline in agricultural production in this country.</P>
    <P>The most dangerous aspect of that decline and of our failure to organise and rehabilitate our agricultural production is that we will not be, in the post-war period, in an efficient position to compete for whatever trade there may be.  We may anticipate that the competition will be more keen than ever, because of the kind of economy and efficiency that other countries have been forced to adopt to step up production, particularly in Great Britain, during the present war.</P>
    <P>Another aspect which the House cannot overlook is that, while the production curve here has been showing a steep downward trend for the past few years, our taxation curve has shown a steep upward trend.  Even in this House, we have been anxious to provide more and more social services. No one can question for a moment the desirability of providing more and <Col N="123" /> more social services for our people; but, like the individual so, too, the nation.  Whatever service a man may desire to provide for his own home and family, if he is a wise man he will consult his pocket, to ensure that the services he is going to provide for his family will continue and be within his financial capacity.  If we here, with our circumstances, are to continue blindly providing more attractive amenities for our people, without any regard to our national income, the day of reckoning is bound to come.  We must bear in mind that this House is primarily responsible to the people, that it is the supreme authority so far as this country is concerned for making national decisions with regard to our social and economic policy and, no matter how desirable it may be to expand our social services&mdash;and I am anxious to ensure that our social services will compare favourably with those provided in other countries&mdash;we can only do that and we can only provide the capital that is necessary even for the service that we provided recently by legislation, which has stepped up considerably the amount spent on social services, by ensuring that our national income is stepped up too.  I suggest that that expenditure inevitably must come to a very great extent from our primary industry.</P>
    <P>In providing these services, we must ensure that the industries that must be burdened with the financial provisions for these services are capable of bearing the charges.  There is another aspect of this whole matter that we ought not to pass over, if a recent speech by the Minister for Supplies represents the Government's outlook.  In the National University recently the Minister for Supplies referred to the advantage that was coming to this country from the fact that we were exporting 100 per cent. more than we were importing; that for every £2 worth of animals and animal products we were exporting, we were only importing at present £1 worth; that we were building up a credit asset on the other side.  It is true that we are a creditor country and that we have substantial sterling <Col N="124" /> assets to our credit over there.  But, no matter how anxious Great Britain may be in the post-war period for trade with this country&mdash;and I am not pessimistic about the future&mdash;I feel that Great Britain will not be in an economic position to liquidate her debts in goods.  By that I mean that I think the Minister for Supplies is rather too optimistic if he feels that this country will be in a position to draw in an unlimited way on whatever capital assets we have accumulated externally.  I think it would be unwise to build on that sort of economy now.  We know that the moment goods are available there will be a very substantial capital required for replacements in industrial machinery, modern agricultural machinery of the mechanised type, huge replacements of all transport vehicles that we have on the road, such as buses, lorries and motor cars of every kind, as well as re-stocking the larder of industry. All that will require a huge amount of capital and, if there is a danger of any limitation being set to the financial position of the country where we have accumulated these credits, then our position will be very serious indeed if our exports have declined to such an extent that we cannot provide, through these exports, the medium of foreign exchange that may be necessary to secure these essential commodities.  I feel that recognition will be given to these credits definitely; I do not think they will be frozen completely.  At the worst, they may be frozen for a period, say, of ten years.  But I think a definite limitation will be set on the use of them, that a certain quantity of goods will be demanded in exchange for goods.  Perhaps facilities will be granted, to a limited extent anyway, for the use of these assets.</P>
    <P>We are told that Russia in her Five Year Plan and in her scheme of development, owing to the fact that she was unable to secure loans and credits abroad, was forced to deny her people, in some cases, essential food in order to export that food in exchange for machinery.  Let us hope that we will never experience such a catastrophe, that we will find ourselves in the position that we will not have <Col N="125" /> the foreign exchange, by way of goods to secure goods.  That is the reason why I suggest, in view of the present position of the country and the likelihood that the war will end in the next year or two, that now is the time to see where we stand and what can be done to organise properly&mdash;I was going to say reorganise, but I will use the word &ldquo;organise,&rdquo; because I do not think we were ever properly organised&mdash;our agricultural economy, our agricultural industry, and to modernise it and to make it efficient in every way.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked a lot about agricultural education.  It is true that we are spending a considerable amount of money on agricultural education.  If we turn to the Book of Estimates and run down the different sub-heads we find that under sub-head E&mdash;Technical and Advisory Work in Agriculture&mdash;we spend £7,899; sub-head E (2)&mdash;Veterinary Research&mdash;£7,000 odd; E (3)&mdash; Subscriptions, etc., to International and other Research Organisations&mdash; £1,754; Miscellaneous Investigations, Inquiries and Reports&mdash;£175; Agricultural Schools and Farms&mdash;£39,000 odd; Grants to Private Agricultural Schools, etc.&mdash;£17,749; Veterinary College&mdash; £18,000 odd; Scholarships in Agriculture&mdash;£1,425; University College, Dublin: Faculty of General Agriculture&mdash;£24,984; University College, Cork: Faculty of Dairy Science&mdash; £13,000; Training of Instructors in Horticulture&mdash;£700; Printing of Special Departmental Publications&mdash; £2,100.  In the aggregate all these represent a very considerable sum of money.</P>

      <P>Whatever we are spending, and I do not think we are spending enough, whatever scientific knowledge we have in this country, I do not think it is being disseminated. I absolutely disagree with the Minister. <Col N="126" /> I do not think it is reaching the ordinary farmer in rural Ireland.  I think that the medium of disseminating that knowledge, the channels through which that knowledge should pass down are choked in some way and that it is not reaching the people.  It does not redound to our credit that during the most favourable period so far as food-producing countries are concerned, during a war period, we have ignominiously failed even to maintain production.</P>
      <P>In the last two or three years there has been a steep fall in our agricultural production.  I do not think the Government or this House can take that development in a complacent way. I think that if we are to prove that this Parliamentary institution is a real asset to our people, now is the time to pay very close attention to this whole problem.  We should examine it as minutely as we can, point out what we think is wrong and suggest what should be done.  One thing that strikes me about agricultural education is that normally we have a number of peripatetic instructors, and if a farmer consults one of them, he gives the farmer a certain amount of verbal advice, but that is not sufficient.  The ordinary farmer is very sceptical about advice like that and is slow to accept it as correct.  I think we want much more practical demonstration to convince the farmer.  Ocular demonstration will convince the farmer of the advantage of pursuing certain methods to secure success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking a particular branch of the industry, what is wrong with our live stock?  Has anything been done to improve live stock?  If not, in what respect have we neglected our live-stock industry and what should be done?  I was delighted to hear the Minister state in this House, I think for the first time, that the dairying industry was the keystone of our live-stock industry, and that our cattle industry and the maintenance of the cattle population depended on the condition in which the dairying industry is carried on.  That is true.  We know from the type of live-stock economy that operates in this country that a considerable number of the calves <Col N="127" /> produced in the dairying districts are distributed over other areas.  The type of live-stock economy that operates in the country depends on the number of cattle and calves produced in those dairying districts.  If anything were to happen the dairying industry, it would react detrimentally on cattle-raising and necessitate a complete change in the live-stock economy of the country as a whole.  I think the Minister has accepted that fact, and I do not want to travel over all the ground he covered with regard to our production.</P>
    <P>The Minister admitted that there has been a steady progressive fall in our production from 1936 onwards. That is continuing during the present war.  He is aware that there is a continuing fall in our cow population as well.  The cow population in 1936 was 1,348,625, and the last figure given in 1943 showed it to be 1,202,034.  That shows that there has been a steady decline down the years from 1936.  What the Minister states about prices is true.  Prices fell in 1929, but notwithstanding that fall in price, production in the countries which have been our competitors on the British market&mdash; Denmark and New Zealand&mdash;continued to expand.  In 1927, which was the peak year as far as our exports were concerned, we exported to Britain 586,485 cwts. of butter.  In 1937, ten years later, our exports had fallen to 319,937 cwts., and they continued to fall right down to the outbreak of war. Then our exports disappeared altogether, and to-day we have to ration our own people to 6 ozs. per week. In 1927 our exports of butter represented 10 per cent. of the total imports to Great Britain, but in 1937 they represented only 3.4 per cent. of Britain's imports.  Imports from New Zealand in 1927 represented 21 per cent. of the total imports to Great Britain, and in 1937 the figure had increased by 10 points to 31.3 per cent. Imports from Denmark showed a slight decline during the same period.</P>

      <P>The whole question of butter production has already been discussed on a motion in the Seanad. The discussion there hinged to a great extent on the provision of fats for our people, on the fact that margarine and other fats have almost disappeared, and that there has been an alarming decline in the production of the only source of fats we now have, butter. Reference was made to the danger of our finding ourselves without a sufficient production of butter for our own needs and it was urged that every precaution should be taken by the Government and the responsible Minister to ensure that such a situation should not develop.  I do not want to repeat the same arguments, but I do stress the fact that this country is pre-eminently suitable for live-stock production.  The Minister rightly stated that the keystone of our live-stock economy is the dairying industry. A progressive decline in the dairying industry, from our point of view as a Parliament here, is so alarming that something definite must be done about it.  We suggest, Sir, that the present price must be maintained for the summer months if we are going to avoid a further decline.  We want that done definitely pending an examination by a select committee set up by this House into the position of our dairying economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not in favour of subsidies in the ordinary way, particularly the type of subsidy that gives the impression to the taxpayer that he is bolstering up an inefficient industry, but this subsidy is not a subsidy to bolster up the dairying industry.  It is a consumption subsidy; it is to bring the price of the article produced within reach of the vast majority of our people.  Subsidies generally, in their application to the agricultural industry, must be treated in the same way because the agricultural industry is entitled, in the same way as any other industry, to charge for the article produced the cost of production plus a fair margin of profit for the producer.  All subsidies generally have the effect that they help to <Col N="129" /> crystallise the <i>status quo,</i> and if there is anything fundamentally wrong in an industry, if the industry is declining or decaying in any way or becoming inefficient, the mere provision of a subsidy helps to crystallise that inefficient condition.  I would much prefer, in the provision of the very substantial sum we are providing here&mdash;the Minister has told us it is going to mean a million of money this year&mdash;that at least some of it should be spent in the organisation of the industry, in making it more efficient and, first of all, in examining what is wrong and trying to put that right.  I was speaking recently to some dairy farmers and they complained bitterly of the fact that under the operation of the Agricultural Wages Act, it was impossible to get labour to milk cows at the present time, and that 90 per cent. of the milking was done by family labour.  On a dairy farm or on a mixed farm where tillage has to be done under the Compulsory Tillage Order at the present time the family have to milk the cows and they are milked before the working men arrive at the farm.  As a matter of fact, the working men are gone before the cows are again milked in the evening.  We all know the reason for that.  It is undesirable to have cows milked twice within nine hours and, on the other side, there are 15 hours.  That does not make for maximum production from a cow.  Hence, the family are forced to milk the cows.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that special provision should be made to cover the conditions that obtain in dairy districts. I am not suggesting that labour should be asked to do that work outside the normal nine-hour day without any payment but, having regard to the circumstances of our dairying industry, surely it is unwise to ignore that matter.  It is not the first time it has been mentioned in this House and we have ignored it for the last few years.  Numbers of men have gone abroad seeking work and to-day a situation is developing in the dairy districts where for large herds it is almost impossible to secure the necessary labour.  The effect of that is that the bigger herds are being rapidly reduced.  The <Col N="130" /> farmer who milked 30 to 40 cows a few years ago is now cutting the number down to 15 or, at most, 20, and the farmer who milked a herd of 25 is cutting that down to the neighbourhood of 12.  I am not suggesting that whatever decline is shown in the statistical returns of our cow population has occurred on the small farms. I think there is not very much reduction shown on the small farms, but among the big herds there is a substantial reduction in the number of cows.  One of the difficulties that have given rise to that situation is the operation of the Agricultural Wages Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>If we examine the production side of the dairying industry, we find there is a definite decline in the milk yields recorded.  Where cow testing is carried out by a number of societies, I think it is borne out that there is a definite decline in our milk yields.  When one considers the average milk yield, calculated in this country at 390 gallons, and compares it with the standards that have been reached in other countries, Denmark and New Zealand, we are completely out of the picture.  I do not want to draw an unfair comparison because these countries have not the same problem as we have.  Their problem, as a matter of fact, is much simpler than ours because they are interested in dairying only and they provide dairy breeds.  We, of course, want dual purpose cattle.  We have a valuable dry stock export to Great Britain and we must keep that in mind all the time. We must not let it decline.  The provisions of the Live Stock Breeding Act, to eliminate the scrub bull and to step up the quality of our cattle, were framed with that in mind.  They aimed at improving the standard of our live stock generally.  I think the administration of the Live Stock Breeding Act has reacted to some extent on the dairy industry.  I refer to bulls that are brought to the cross roads for inspection.  I think those bulls were judged and passed on conformation only and that milk records were not adverted to or were rarely adverted to. <Col N="132" /> Milk records cannot be taken into account if they are not available.</P>
      <P>That brings us to a consideration of cow testing.  The Minister for Agriculture gave us a figure of 50,000 as being the number of cows that are at present registered for cow-testing purposes. That is roughly about 4 per cent. of our total cattle population.  So that we have not attempted to cow test to any great extent, although we are spending a considerable amount of money on it.  We have spent little or no money in trying to educate the farmer in this respect, in trying to convince him of the advantages of recording milk yields, and, of course, in the absence of records it is very difficult to have the Live Stock Breeding Act administered properly in the dairying districts.  The bulls in almost all cases are judged on conformation and without regard to records of milk yields.</P>
      <P>I am also aware that even in dairying districts&mdash;and this is an amazing situation&mdash;a number of farmers are using Hereford and sometimes Aberdeen Angus.  They are using the Hereford because a Hereford cross bullock is a valuable store and commands a very high price.  They appear to overlook the fact that whatever is gained on the store bullock will inevitably be lost on the Hereford heifer as compared with the Dairy Shorthorn, that if we proceed along that line of breeding and cross-breeding it will destroy the dairying industry completely and absolutely, and that it is most unwise and injudicious to breed from Herefords in the dairying districts.  On that matter I asked the Minister recently, with regard to the Dublin Show, the number of bulls purchased for premium purposes, distinguishing, in the case of Shorthorns, between Dairy, Single Dairy and Beef. I was informed that the number of Beef Shorthorn was 74; Double Dairy Shorthorn, 80; Single Dairy Shorthorn, 28; non-pedigree Dairy Shorthorn, 12; Aberdeen Angus, 48; and Hereford, 80.  The Herefords were higher than the Beef Shorthorn, and there was the same number of Hereford as Double Dairy Shorthorn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that that has produced a nondescript collection of animals of <Col N="133" /> various breeds and crosses.  It is undesirable to encourage that sort of cross-breeding.  All over the country we have had it extensively and, bad as the Hereford is, the Aberdeen Angus cross has done an infinite amount of harm to the quality of our basic stock of shorthorns.  While I do not go so far as to suggest that people should be prevented from breeding the Hereford or Aberdeen Angus, I think that the State should not encourage that, and that they should limit very strictly the provision of subsidies in respect of either the Hereford or Aberdeen Angus.  It may be that in certain districts the Aberdeen Angus has an advantage. He is a hardy type of animal but it is a different question when we find the Aberdeen Angus in the centre of the dairying districts.  In some cases, farmers are helped by State subsidy to keep such bulls.  We can have no hope for the future of the dairying industry so long as that condition of affairs obtains.</P>
    <P>I see in the dairying industry great possibilities not merely as regards the provision of basic stock for the whole country but in the provision of that type of dairy stock for export.  We can pride ourselves that, in the past, at all events, our dairy stock&mdash;maiden heifers and in-calf heifers&mdash;compared very favourably with anything they had in Great Britain and we had a monopoly of the trade in that respect. There are great possibilities of developing that trade if we are alive to the opportunities.  The consumption of milk in Great Britain before the war was only about half a pint per individual. According to medical authorities, that is well below the safety level for health purposes.  The absence of certain essential vitamins found in milk has led to outbreaks of rickets and other diseases in children which must be tackled and the proper way of tackling them, according to these British authorities, is by the provision of more milk.  Therefore, they are stepping up their consumption of milk and that is bound to continue.  Their intention is to step up the consumption of milk to, at least, a pint per individual. That will double the consumption and that means the provision of <Col N="134" /> more dairy stock.  That is where we come into the picture.  When we talk about breeding dairy stock, we mean not only the breeding of that stock for our own requirements so as to preserve the basic stock of the country but the breeding of suitable dairy stock for that monopoly trade which we have with Great Britain.</P>
    <P>We have done little or nothing to control breeding so as to obtain the right type of stock.  Examining the type of animal obtained from the shows&mdash;the double dairy bull and the single dairy bull&mdash;I think it is unwise to have any provision for the single dairy bull.  He may have a milk record on his dam side and a beef record on his sire side and it is almost inevitable that he will revert to beef. The sooner we get rid of that type of animal the better for the dairying industry. Even when you have the double dairy bull&mdash;the bull with a milk record on both sides&mdash;you do not always get results.  Whatever hope we may have of producing the right type of dairy stock, we can only do so if we use animals with milk records on both sides.  In making that provision, we must not lose sight of the fact that we still must preserve decent standards of conformation if we are to have a dairy-stock export trade.  We cannot completely sacrifice conformation to milk records.  Because of that, we can never hope to raise our milk yields to the level of those of Denmark before the war or of New Zealand.  I do not think that it is necessary to do that because we are not absolutely dependent on the profit arising from the milk produced.  We have the progeny &mdash;the bullock that is going for export and the heifer.  There is growing up in Canada an anxiety to provide stock for the attractive market, from their point of view, in Great Britain.  We must be alive to the potential danger in that respect.  We are told:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Canada has plans for shipping into British markets after the war large numbers of beef and tuberculin-free dairy animals.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to draw the attention of the Minister particularly to that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="135" />&ldquo;The numbers of beef cattle&mdash; they will be up to the standard of the best Scottish types, according to statements in Canada&mdash;have been estimated at 300,000 head.  The dairy stock will be mainly Friesian and Ayrshire from non-pedigree stock unless the Friesian and Ayrshire Cattle Societies change their minds and accept pedigree animals from Canada for their herd books.  In that case&mdash; which is understood to be unlikely&mdash; pedigree animals&mdash;all tuberculin-tested&mdash;will also be brought over in considerable quantities for sale with the other stock on the open market. The animals will be shipped in cattle boats to such ports as Birkenhead and Liverpool and sold without reserve.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. J. Gardiner, Minister of Agriculture, said in the Canadian House of Commons recently:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are attempting to work out at the earliest possible date a plan by which we can send high-quality beef to Britain....  The plan is somewhat the same as we have been operating in connection with bacon and ham.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, Canada has been sending huge quantities of bacon and ham to the British market since the commencement of the war.  That supply has been stepped up enormously. The British Minister of Agriculture, Mr. Hudson, speaking recently of their live-stock policy and their anxiety to build up a better type of live stock, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A year ago we foresaw the increase in young leys that was bound to come.  We knew that more live stock, especially cattle, to graze them would be necessary.  I suggested that we were short as much as 1,000,000 head.  I, therefore, urged farmers in their own interests <Col N="136" /> as well as in the interests of minimising the meat shortage that seemed bound to occur in 1946 and 1947, to rear as many calves as they could.  We cannot compel save in occasional exceptional cases... I hate to have to admit it, but from what I have heard from those&mdash;and they are competent observers&mdash;who have come back recently from the United States or Canada, we no longer lead the world in the general standard of our herds either in breeding, in type or in performance...  That is why I attach so much importance to the improvement of our live stock.  We are also, to a large extent, a nation of small farmers and live-stock husbandary is pre-eminently an art for the small man. I repeat what I said at Taunton: I believe that, with a proper organisation, the small man can be as efficient as the large.  He can give personal attention to his stock and concentrate his energies on quality rather than on quantity.  Provided that he is properly equipped for his job, that he knows his job and that he is keen on and works hard at his job, then he should be able to hold up his head in any company.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I refer to that to show that there are eyes envying our position on the British market and that, in Canada, they are preparing for the possibility of an export trade to Great Britain not merely in beef but in dairy stock.  In respect of this dairy stock, we had a monopoly trade and let us hope that that monopoly trade will continue in the post-war period.</P>
    <P>I move to report progress.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again to-morrow.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9 p.m. until 3 o'clock on Wednesday, 22nd March, 1944.</P>
