      <P>Go ndeontar suim, na raghaidh thar céad míle púnt, chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha, i rith na bliana dar críoch an t-aonú lá triochad de Mhárta, míle naoi gcéad a cúig is dachad, chun Deontais-i-gCabhair do Chumann Croise Deirge na hÉireann chun Fóirithin ar Ghátar san Iodáil de dheascaibh Cogaidh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1333" /> I move:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £100,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1945, for a Grant-in-Aid to the Irish Red Cross Society for the alleviation of distress in Italy due to war.</P>
    <P>The Dáil will remember the Pope's broadcast of the 1st September of this year in which His Holiness spoke of the deep misery into which vast areas of Italy had fallen, and reminded those countries which had ample resources, of their obligation not to hold them back from those who were starving. The Government has for a long time been endeavouring to secure the necessary facilities for the sending of relief in the way of foodstuffs to Italy, but, owing to the war conditions, without success, except in the case of one small and unimportant contribution.</P>
    <P>The situation in Italy, is, in effect, to-day worse than it was at the time of the Holy Father's appeal.  The very meagre official monthly rations were reduced for this month to a still more appallingly low level.  Motor transport has been reduced by 90 per cent., with the result that a great many districts are at starvation point, with no butter, fats, oils, meat, sugar or milk, and inadequate supplies of grain.  Food has become so expensive that rich and poor are selling their clothing and other possessions to buy it.  The official ration does not provide for more than two meals per week, and does not include either sugar or oil. There are soup kitchens in Rome and in the other parts of Italy, but the distribution is entirely inadequate.  Owing to the impossibility of sending them food, we inquired and learned from the Vatican that a money contribution would be of great assistance.</P>
    <P>The Relief Organisation of the Vatican State, as perhaps many Deputies know, has been very active since the early days of the war. They purchased grain for Greece in Hungary, they sent clothing to the children in Finland, they purchased medicines in Switzerland for internment camps in Germany, they took charge of repatriate refugees in Sardinia, <Col N="1334" /> Sicily and Southern Italy, they set up food kitchens, medical aid, clothing and lodging depots, they made grants of money to different countries through the Apostolic Delegations.</P>
    <P>Under the existing circumstances, it seems best for us, in making our contribution for the relief of Italian distress, to do so through this organisation which has proved so efficient and so ready to help wherever the need existed.</P>
    <P>The proposal is that we make this sum of £100,000 available for the Irish Red Cross.  The House will remember that about a year ago we gave the Red Cross a special sum of £100,000 for the relief of famine in India.  At the same time, when I was introducing that Vote, I asked the House to make a credit of another £100,000 available to the Irish Red Cross.  The intention was, however, that that sum would not be called upon unless it was urgently necessary.  It was hoped, and I expressed the hope when speaking, that our people would by voluntary subscription give to the Irish Red Cross sufficient funds to enable it to carry out the deeds of mercy which it felt called upon to perform and that it would not be necessary, perhaps, to make any demand at all on the Treasury.  The fact is that up to date the Red Cross has had contributions amounting only to about £100,000 and that sum would not be sufficient to cover the money that has already been spent and the commitments immediately ahead.  If we were to suggest to them that they should draw on the previous credit to the sum of £100,000, instead of my coming to the House now, they would be eventually without any funds and it would be necessary to come to the House again to put them into funds because, as every Deputy is aware, conditions in many countries in Europe are extremely bad. I feel that on this occasion just as on the previous occasion I came to the House, this Vote from us here, who have in God's providence been saved from the terrible conditions in which other countries have been involved through the war, will be gladly supported <Col N="1335" /> by the various sections in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express agreement with the proposal to spend through the Irish Red Cross £100,000 for the relief of distress in Italy.  I take it that the Red Cross machinery is the best machinery for transferring this £100,000 to the Vatican Relief Fund and that there will be no expenses in connection with the transfer to be taken out of that amount.  I presume also, though I should like to hear the Taoiseach on the matter, that the position in Italy as described by him is one with which our representative in Italy has been in personal touch and that the report we have received here of these conditions is a report from our representative in Italy. It would be useful if the Taoiseach gave us a little more information as to the kind of touch our representative in Italy has been able to have with the distressed areas, because we should like it to be understood that we wish to keep in close touch with the condition of affairs in Italy and to know in detail what the conditions there are so that it might be recognised through our representative there that we were keeping in close and sympathetic touch with the distressed people and that we were prepared to do anything we could to relieve their distress.  I think we should also express agreement with the idea of disbursing this grant through the Vatican Relief Fund.</P>

      <P>I just want to say that this Grant-in-Aid has the unanimous support of the Clann na Talmhan Party.  I think it is very much needed and that it will have the approval of every fair-minded person.  It is a generous action on the part of the Government and deserves full support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The description of conditions in Italy as given to the House by the Taoiseach is heart-rending.  I am sure our own people, who have gone through many trials and tribulations, will join in expressing sympathy with the Italian people on the privations and suffering which unfortunately are their lot to-day.  This <Col N="1336" /> country of ours has many ties with Italy, mainly spiritual ties, and I think it is only right and proper that, in her hour of anguish and agony, Italy ought to feel that these spiritual ties are such as to compel us to go without question to the assistance of her people. Our own people here have their problems at home.  No matter what these problems are or how acute they might be in an economic sense, I think no one will grudge extending a helping hand to those who are the victims of the conditions which have been so luridly described to us by the Taoiseach here this evening.  I feel sure that the whole nation will join with this House in generously coming to the assistance of the Italian people and that the Estimate which the Taoiseach has introduced will have not only the warm approval of the House but the warm approval of every high-minded Irishman as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having heard the Taoiseach, the Leader of the Fine Gael Party and the Leaders of other Parties express their sympathy with the Italian people, I wish also to express my deepest sympathy with them. They have their troubles and difficulties and they need every help and assistance possible.  At the same time, I am inclined to think that I, as a Deputy, would be neglecting my duty if I did not stand up here and express my honest views on the Estimate that the Taoiseach has presented to the House.  I say it is great to be charitable but, remember, charity begins at home.  Last year we gave £100,000 for the relief of the Indian famine and this year we propose to give another £100,000 for the relief of distress in Italy.  At home, at our own doors, in the City of Dublin, you have fathers and the heads of families marching from labour exchange to labour exchange in search of a day's work.  You have hunger and starvation at your own door, but there is no question of providing £100,000 to see that these families are relieved from want. You have also the terrible T.B. problem.  The youngest and the best of our people are being wiped out through the great scourge of T.B., <Col N="1337" /> but we have nothing like a proposal to spend £100,000 to deal with that problem.  We extend our generosity to other countries who do not give a snap of their fingers for us, while you have our own people depending on doles and on votes for free boots for their children.  You have agricultural workers compelled to exist on a wage of £2 per week.  You have the best of our labouring men working in quarries and on building schemes for a miserable wage on which they themselves are unable to live in decency, much less bring up and rear a family in Christian decency.  We have seen 150,000 of the cream of our manhood forced to emigrate simply because there were not sufficient funds at the disposal of the Government to keep these people at work.  I am surprised at the Farmers' Party and the Labour Party&mdash;I am not surprised at the Fine Gael Party&mdash;because they did not say: &ldquo;We will first look to ourselves and let every other country look to themselves.&rdquo; There is no man who has more sympathy than I have with those countries in distress, but I say that our own country is more in distress at the present time, because the best part of our farmers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in agreement with the other Parties in the House who saw fit to throw in their lot with the Taoiseach, but I say that charity should begin at home.  I have every sympathy with countries which are in distress, but I wish to dissociate myself from the sending of a ½d. out of this country while starvation, hunger, <Col N="1338" /> unemployment and poverty are rampant from the north to the south.  The Fianna Fáil Party is handing out £100,000.  I oppose it, and I say it is a disgrace to let £100,000 out of the country in view of our own unemployment position here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very much to be regretted that this generous and charitable gesture on the part of the Government of this country should be, I will not say spoiled, but in some way lessened by the speech to which we have just listened.  It was a disgrace to this Parliament.  The last speaker is a young man who has not had as much experience as most Deputies in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to raise anything controversial now.  I did not intend to speak on this at all, but was brought to my feet by Deputy Flanagan's statement.  I would ask Deputy Flanagan, who I feel must have at least some finer instincts, to remember that there is no comparison whatever between the distress in Italy and the distress in this country.  Even the poorest of the poor here are far better off than those who are suffering in other countries as a result of the great war.  Deputy Flanagan, as an intelligent man, if he reads the papers and makes himself acquainted with all the horrible facts of the tragedies on the Continent of Europe, must know that starvation and misery exist there. People are dying of starvation in those countries.  The Taoiseach has read out a very truthful report of the conditions prevailing in Italy at the present moment.  It cannot be said that such conditions are operative here.  Through the mercy of Providence, we have been spared the ravages of war.  We have felt only the repercussions, and that only in a very minor way.  Our people are able to survive.  They have their difficulties but, thanks be to God, we have here nothing approaching the poverty and distress which exist in other countries.  I regret that Deputy Flanagan has seen fit to make such a statement in regard to this generous <Col N="1339" /> gesture of ours.  I think he will be in a minority of one.  If a division is challenged, I hope no one will go into the Lobby with him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to dissociate myself in every way from the speech made by Deputy Flanagan, and to voice my approval of this gesture by our Government.  As one who given a great many years to the Labour movement in this country, I can assure Deputy Flanagan that there is no section in this country more ready to support an act of this kind than the poor, the masses of our people.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy asked me if our representative was keeping in touch with conditions in Italy and was able to see things for himself.  As Deputies are aware, we have two representatives, one to the Italian State and the other to the Vatican.  In regard to this particular matter, we have been in touch more immediately and definitely with our representative to the Vatican State, and the information which I have given to the House is information which has been received from him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach say if the representative to the Vatican has more facilities for getting around Italy than the representative to the Italian Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I would not like to say straight off that he has more facilities for doing so.  The position is that he is more in touch with what might be called the general situation of this relief organisation about which we have been speaking.  In so far as its activities in Italy are concerned, he is in closer touch with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking of the actual conditions in Italy itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Those are conditions which he was in a position to verify for himself.  We asked him for a statement of the conditions, and this is the information he has sent us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the remarks of Deputy Flanagan, I have only to say <Col N="1340" /> that they are a complete misrepresentation of the situation in this country. Every Deputy in the House knows that The sum of £100,000, considering the needs, is really only a small sum, but it is a substantial sum taking our own resources into account.  As I said at the start, we have very fortunately been saved from the horrors which accompany war waged in any country. Italy has been particularly badly struck, and completely disorganised. Her whole transport system and so on have been completely disorganised. She has difficulties which anybody who reads the papers from day to day can fully understand.  With regard to our own country, everybody here knows that during the emergency period several million pounds a year have been spent in trying to come to the aid of our citizens who are in distress. The pretence that no attention has been paid either by the Government or by this House to the weaker sections of our community is one which anybody who wants to know the truth will have no difficulty in completely exploding.</P>

      <P>It is completely wrong to suggest that there has been no regard here for the weaker sections of our community during this emergency. The Estimates that are brought into the House prove quite the contrary. Millions have been spent. Unfortunately, it is true that, through lack of raw materials, a number of our industries have been unable to operate, and that a number of those who were engaged in those industries have gone to another country to earn their living.  Some have gone without the absolute necessity for doing so.</P>

    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1945, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Finance, including the Pay-master-General's Office.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have noticed from the details on the face of this Estimate that its presentation to the Dáil is due to additional provision for bonus and emergency bonus.  The amount involved is inconsiderable and normally would be capable of being met from savings on the original Vote.  A Supplementary Estimate would not have been necessary in the normal course, but I thought it desirable to put down the present token Estimate to enable me to make a statement to the Dáil in relation to Civil Service bonus.</P>
    <P>Following consideration of representations made by Civil Service staff representatives over a prolonged period on the question of bonus, the Government, after having given the matter very careful consideration, and, I may say, not without some hesitation, have decided that, as from 1st January, 1945, Civil Service sliding-scale bonus shall be calculated on the basis of a bonus figure of 110 instead of 85, which is the present figure.  The cost of this concession is etimated at £500,000 a year.</P>
    <P>The bonus figure of 110 is the rate which would in the normal course have applied on 7th May, 1941, when the pay of outside workers was stabilised by Government Order.  It was the original intention of the Government that all wages should be stabilised at the same time, if possible, or, failing this, that general stabilisation should be achieved within a short period. Owing to the position of the Civil Service, concerning which all the relevant data was readily available, it was possible to proceed with stabilisation of <Col N="1345" /> Civil Service salaries and wages almost immediately and the Civil Service (Stabilisation of Bonus) Regulations, which were made on 26th June, 1940, stabilised Civil Service bonus at the figure of 85 as from the 1st July, 1940, on which date, through the operation of the sliding scale, the bonus figure would have been due to rise to 105. Unavoidable delay occurred in the stabilisation of outside wages and the general Standstill Order was not made until 7th May, 1941, over ten months later than the date of Civil Service stabilisation.  The position is, therefore, that, whereas outside workers were allowed to obtain increases in pay without any restriction up to 7th May, 1941, Civil Service sliding-scale bonus (which was designed to compensate for the increase in the cost of living since 1914) has been pegged at the figure of 85 since 1st July, 1940.  The present sliding-scale bonus concession is designed to remedy this position as from 1st January next.</P>
    <P>As regards emergency bonus, outside workers are at present allowed, under Emergency Powers (No. 260) (Fourth Amendment) Order, 1943, an increase in the wages they had on 7th May, 1941, of a maximum amount of 11/- a week by way of emergency bonus.  The present maximum rates of Civil Service emergency bonus on the other hand, are 10/- a week (married) and 8/-a week (unmarried) for whole-time officers whose total remuneration does not exceed £500 a year, inclusive; and 8/- a week (married) and 6/- a week (unmarried) for part-time officers whose total remuneration does not exceed £365 a year, inclusive.  The grant to civil servants of a further 1/- a week all round merely equates, as regards emergency bonus, the position of the married civil servant under £500 a year with that of other sections of the community, whose emergency bonus is governed by the Standstill Orders.  If the Government is successful in its efforts to prevent a further rise in the cost of living, the need to modify the Standstill Orders to provide further increases in emergency bonus will disappear.</P>
    <P>The differentiation between married and unmarried civil servants and the <Col N="1346" /> ceilings of £500 (whole-time officers) and £365 (part-time officers) will still continue so far as emergency bonus is concerned, but, in applying the ceilings, the addition made to sliding-scale bonus will not be reckoned. Neither the marriage differentiation nor the ceilings apply in the case of awards made by the tribunals set up to inquire into increases of pay in outside occupations.</P>
    <P>As I have explained, the increases will merely have the effect of equating the position of civil servants with that of other wage-earning members of the community as regards emergency wage increases, and it is the intention of the Government that the concessions are to be considered as final for the duration of the emergency.  It is to be specially borne in mind that civil servants, unlike most other sections of the community, had, since 1920, been conditioned to remuneration based on the sliding-scale bonus system, and this operated considerably to their disadvantage during the period when their sliding-scale bonus figure dropped to as low a level as 50.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that, when introducing the Budget for the current year, I spoke at some length of the problem of inflation and emphasised the necessity for taking all possible measures to restrict this evil to the narrowest compass compatible with the necessities of the situation in the difficult conditions imposed by the present emergency.  It was for this reason that, as I have already mentioned, the Government hesitated before deciding in favour of the increases in bonus which are now proposed for the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>The Government has the problem of inflation constantly before its mind and it realises that the proposed in creates in Civil Service remuneration, though fully justified having regard to the considerations I have mentioned, will tend to aggravate the position to a certain extent.  In the Government's view this is all the more reason why in the future the most stringent measures are called for in order to prevent any further emergency increases in wages and salaries.  The concessions <Col N="1347" /> now being granted ought to remove the sense of grievance which civil servants have felt because of the stabilisation of their pay before the general stabilisation of wages.  The Government considers it essential to maintain, if at all practicable, the present limits of emergency bonus allowable under existing Standstill Orders; and, of course, the figure at which the sliding scale bonus for civil servants is now to be stabilised by statutory regulations will not be increased further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government, no doubt, has had its conscience moved a bit in the matter of the wrong done to civil servants when their wages and salaries were stabilised earlier than the rest of the community, but it seems rather glib for the Minister to say that there is now recognition of that fact by the Government and that the intention to make amendment for it in some way from January 1st should remove all dissatisfaction.  It may remove a certain amount of dissatisfaction, but how is it going to remove the debts?  If the Minister knows anything about the position a large number of civil servants of all classes are in as a result of the stabilisation of their bonus, on the one hand, and the shocking rise in the cost of living on the other hand, he must realise that anybody who has responsibility for a home, not to talk of a family, has gone very deeply into debt following the shocking rise in the cost of living within the last few years and the stabilisation of their remuneration.  I do not want to confuse the situation with figures of any kind, because the facts should stand out boldly enough to anybody who has responsibility for a house or a family.  With regard to civil servants of all kinds, the fact is that anybody who has any knowledge of his neighbours can get plenty of information about the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask Deputies to look at the Book of Estimates, page viii, where information is given with regard to the basic salary, that is the ordinary remuneration of the various classes of civil servants, and also the bonus.  Take the case of a person in receipt of 64/9 weekly wage, made up of a wage of <Col N="1348" /> 35/- and 29/9 bonus, or the person in receipt of £320 5s. yearly, made up of £200 and £120 bonus.  If the bonus in the case of these two people had been allowed to rise with the cost of living, the man with £320 yearly would be receiving at least £95 more yearly, and the main in receipt of 64/9 would be receiving about 16/- more weekly. These are very serious cuts in incomes, but when we consider that they have been operating I might say for the last four years, nobody would stand for the accumulation of these cuts being taken from these families.  The Minister smooths the matter over.  There is not only the difficulty with civil servants that they are not in the position of ordinary workers who, by some kind of inquiry under emergency Orders, can get increases even over the stabilised limit, but for four and a half years that has been taken away, and their incomes have been stabilised on a year when the cost of living had not begun to rise so much.  Civil Service incomes have been stabilised below a particular limit and they can only get recognition for the 1941 position.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister cannot satisfy his conscience if he is going to take the stand he suggests.  The matter requires very much more consideration and understanding than has been given it.  I suggest to the Minister that civil servants with homes and families are labouring in a very serious way under a burden of debt as a result of the position created during the last four and a half years.  All during that time families were growing up, becoming a greater burden, and requiring more care, particularly in the circumstances in which this country finds itself, when a family requires a great deal more care than in ordinary times.  There is not now the same hope and the same opportunities for young people finding work when they leave school or home. The Minister is glossing over a very serious domestic position for people who are perhaps one of the most important sections of our machinery.  I think the Minister was ill-advised not to give compensation for the past.  He seems to have stuck his head in the sand instead of getting rid of the dissatisfaction and the hopelessness.  I believe it is wrong to say that this is <Col N="1349" /> the final word until the emergency is over, because there is no knowing what problems will face civil servants in their work or in supporting homes and families.  I think the Minister was ill-advised and that he has not done himself justice.  I suggest that he should take a more reasonable attitude with regard to the domestic side of things.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnSOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this concession of the Minister in favour of civil servants.  I think it will be welcomed by all parties.  I consider that the Minister should make some concession in respect to the heavy losses which civil servants have sustained by reason of the stabilisation of the index figure during the past four years.  I do not suggest that he should go back over the entire period and make up to civil servants everything they have lost, but some concession in respect of the back period should be made.  Even if the Minister, instead of making the concession effective from 1st January next, made it effective from 1st January, 1944, it would be a slight recompense to the servants of the State who have had to bear, in my opinion, a much heavier burden and have had to make a greater contribution in the emergency conditions than any other class in the community.  I do not think a concession such as I suggest would place an undue burden on the finances of the State, and if the Minister could see his way to make it, I am satisfied that he would be giving some measure of fairness and justice to this class which has suffered so heavily by reason of the stabilisation of the cost-of-living index figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister told us that the cost of doing what he proposes to do from 1st January next will be £500,000, but he was very careful not to say that this sum was portion of the few million pounds of which he has succeeded in depriving civil servants since he stabilised the cost-of-living bonus in June, 1940, and that the civil servants who will get this sum of £500,000 as a result of the Minister's decision will get only an instalment of what the Minister knows is morally due to them and of what was legally due to <Col N="1350" /> them until the Minister introduced the stabilisation regulations.</P>
      <P>What are the facts of this whole matter?  In 1920 a cost-of-living bonus agreement was negotiated between the Civil Service staff organisations, on the one hand, and the Government of the day, on the other.  For approximately 18 months after the negotiation of that agreement the cost-of-living index figure continued to rise, and in accordance with the terms of the agreement, wages and salaries moved up in direct ratio to the increase in the cost-of-living index figure.  Then, in 1922, the figure commenced to decline.  It declined for a long number of years until, in 1932, the index figure, which at its peak stood at 165, fell to 50, from the point of view of its application to basic wages and salaries.  One has only to form a mental picture of these two figures, 165 and 50, to realise the extent to which civil servants suffered when the index figure was falling from 165 to 50.</P>
      <P>That fall represented a very serious and a very grievous sacrifice on the part of those whose wages were related to the cost-of-living bonus agreement then current.  The staff no doubt felt these hardships keenly, and from time to time they made efforts to induce the Government not to insist on its full pound of flesh.  They pleaded from time to time for an easement of the bonus agreement because it was pressing with considerable rigour upon them, but every appeal by the staff organisations to the different Governments was met with the reply:&mdash;&ldquo;This is an agreement, a bonus agreement. There is nothing essentially or inherently wrong with it.  If there is anything wrong at all, the difficulty is in the basic wages or salaries.&rdquo; Generally speaking, they said, the agreement was all right and they intended to apply it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We remember when the Taoiseach went down to the square in Ennis on 8th January, 1933, and there declared the almost sacred character of the bonus agreement.  He told all and sundry, and civil servants in particular, because there was an election on at the time, that the agreement was an instrument which they did not propose <Col N="1351" /> to violate, that they intended to honour the bonus agreement.  He said he thought it would be a bad thing for those concerned if they tried to get rid of that sliding scale agreement, because, he said:&mdash;&ldquo;As sure as I am standing here in the market square in Ennis, the cost of commodities will go up and it will be a great consolation to civil servants to know that, when the cost of living goes up, their wages will go up to enable them to meet the increased cost.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The civil servants, with that assurance from the Taoiseach, with that definite promise, one might say, suffered on and continued to labour under serious grievances through the rigid application of the cost-of-living bonus agreement.  Then the war broke out in 1939.  A state of emergency was proclaimed here, and, in November, 1939, we had the Minister for Finance announcing that the Government intended to set its face against the efforts of anybody to secure compensation for the increase in the cost of living. Arising out of that declaration, the bonus stabilisation regulations were introduced in June, 1940, and applied as from 1st July, 1940.  Under these regulations, the Minister pegged down the wages and salaries of civil servants to an index figure of 85, although, in July, 1940, the figure which should have applied was 105. Since July, 1940, civil servants have been paid on the basis of a cost-of-living index figure of 85, when in fact&mdash; and this gives some picture of what they have suffered&mdash;they ought to have been paid on the basis of a cost-of-living figure of 190.</P>
    <P>The State, although a party to the cost-of-living bonus agreement and having taken every possible advantage it could from that agreement, repudiated the agreement in 1940, the effect of that repudiation being to compel civil servants to accept a condition of affairs whereby their basic wages and salaries were governed by an index figure of 85, when a substantially higher figure ought to have been applied every week and every month since the bonus stabilisation regulations were put in force in July, 1940. <Col N="1352" /> It is worthy of note at this point that, although the Government introduced these stabilisation regulations in 1940, so far as civil servants were concerned, they did not introduce the general wages Standstill Order until May, 1941, the result being that civil servants' remuneration was stabilised approximately ten months before the Government felt justified in introducing the general stabilisation of wages Order, so that, between July, 1940, and May, 1941, civil servants were compelled to accept stabilisation regulations which were not imposed on workers in outside industry.</P>
    <P>Now the Minister comes along, in December, 1944, four and a half years after he introduced the stabilisation regulations, and says he has discovered that it was unfair to have stabilised civil servants' remuneration from July, 1940, as he could not stabilise wages generally until May, 1941.  Instead of making restitution, like a Christian gentleman, for the wrong he inflicted in 1940, the Minister now wants to try to get it over to people that this is a very generous gesture on the part of the Government and that everybody is to stay quiet about his wages and bonus until after the emergency.  The Minister said that this increase for civil servants is fully justified.  Of course it is; it was fully justified in July, 1940.  There was no answer to the claim of the Civil Service organisations that this bonus should have been paid from July, 1940, to May, 1941, and in fact there is no answer to their claim that the bonus agreement, under which they lost such substantial sums of money, should continue to operate.</P>
    <P>It is manifestly unfair and unjust that, if an agreement is going against a person for a long number of years, and then a set of circumstances arises in which the agreement is likely to be favourable to him, one party to the agreement should be able to say: &ldquo;I want to repudiate the agreement when I have squeezed every possible advantage out of it.&rdquo;  That is what the Government did in 1940.</P>
    <P>Now the Minister's conscience has <Col N="1353" /> apparently been stricken in the matter and he wants to yield up some of the money which he knows he had no moral or legal right to withhold and he proposes to make restitution as from 1st January next.  It seems to me like a case of taking a man's watch and chain, getting some qualm of conscience as to your right to it and saying to the man: &ldquo;I have been worrying about that watch and chain of yours; I shall give you back the chain next Monday,&rdquo; and still keeping the watch.  That is what the Minister is proposing.  He is proposing to give £500,000 back to the civil servants when he knows that he is comfortably lining the Exchequer's pockets with a couple or more half millions which do not belong to the Exchequer, but which properly belong to the civil servants and ought to be given to them to enable them to meet their heavy domestic responsibilities.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister in all equity that there is no case for not making restitution, for not providing for an earlier date than that proposed in the Estimate.  The Minister knows that he is only giving back some of the money which he has withheld.  Not only have civil servants lost between July, 1940, and May, 1941, by the stabilisation bonus regulations, but since May, 1941, they have lost still more.  Since that month the cost of living has increased still further and they have borne even heavier sacrifices, because the index figure has risen from 110 in May, 1941, to 190 in July, 1944.  That gives a picture of the heavy loss which civil servants suffered when the bonus during that period was related to an index figure of 85.  I put it to the Minister that in all conscience he is bound to make adequate restitution for what has been done.  He is unfair and spoiling the sense of conscientiousness of which he is now apparently possessed by not making the increase which he proposes to grant retrospective so as to compensate the staff in some measure for the substantial losses which they have incurred.</P>
    <P>Even when the Minister's increase is granted as from the 1st January next the staff will still suffer very serious hardship.  I have before me just a few <Col N="1354" /> figures which I took the trouble of working out.  I find that a man who had a pre-war wage of £2 per week will, as from the 1st January next, even when he gets his increase, be suffering a loss of approximately 19/-per week which he would not suffer if the cost-of-living bonus agreement were operating normally.  Even a man with such a low pre-war wage as £1 10s. 0d. will, after he gets this increase on 1st January next, be suffering a weekly loss of 13/- on that low basic wage as compared with what the position would be if the cost-of-living bonus were operating normally.  Even a man with a pre-war wage of £3 10s. will continue to suffer, after he gets this increase, a loss of 30/- approximately. People in that low-wage category who are constantly struggling to make ends meet, people who have never been able to save up for the rainy day, people afflicted with one trial or another in order to maintain a home and a wife and children, cannot afford to make such heavy sacrifices as will continue to be demanded by the Minister even when these increases have been granted.  I put it to the Minister, therefore, that he ought, in view of the appeals which I am sure will be made to him from all parts of the House and the appeal which I am glad has been made by a Deputy of his own Party, to reconsider this matter and recognise that, if he is going to give civil servants back some of what he has taken from them, he ought to go a little further than he proposes in this Estimate.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in referring to the increase of 1/- per week in the emergency bonus, said that he was raising the ceiling from 10/- to 11/- for the purpose of equating the position of civil servants to that of workers in private industry.  I should like to point out that the equation will not be complete even when he raises the emergency bonus from 10/- to 11/-because in the application of the 11/-ceiling to workers in private industry there are none of the differentiations which are embodied in the Minister's application of the emergency bonus of 11/-.  For instance, the Minister will allow the emergency bonus of 11/- if you are married, but if you are married <Col N="1355" /> and doing part-time duty you cannot get that much.  If you are unmarried and doing part-time duty you get still less.  I put it to the Minister that he ought to recognise that there is no case whatever for the differentiation between married and single officers and between part-time and full-time officers in respect of the emergency bonus.</P>
    <P>A rather extraordinary position arises in connection with this.  We have the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is responsible for the the administration of the Wages Standstill Orders generally, permitting banks to pay to their staffs an emergency bonus of 11/- per week without any marriage or single differentiation and without any full-time or part-time differentiation.  If the Minister for Industry and Commerce believes that it is right that bank officials should be paid an emergency bonus of 11/- per week without the differentiations contained in the bonus arrangement of the Minister for Finance, surely the Minister for Finance, if he wants to equate the position of civil servants to the position of outside workers, ought to remove these differentiations.  They cannot be justified.  There is no basis on which they can be explained.  They have not a moral basis, an ethical basis, a philosophic basis, or an economic basis.  I give up trying to plumb the mind that created a formula of this kind and I hope for an early reformation of that mind in the interests of national economy and national sanity.  I put it to the Minister as a sensible man that, if left to himself, he would never have dreamt of inventing a formula of that kind.  Having looked at it and relating it to the position of outside employees and the authorisation issued by his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in respect of outside workers, he ought to apply the 11/- emergency bonus fully without those odious differentiations which cannot be justified on any ground whatever.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I should like to make reference on this Estimate and that is the position of <Col N="1356" /> persons who have retired on low rates of pensions.  If the Minister had recognised in July, 1940, what he is recognising in December, 1944, that civil servants' remuneration ought not to have been stabilised earlier than that of outside workers, a number of persons who retired from the service, either on the ground of age or ill-health, since July, 1940, would have had their pensions increased by a proportion of the increase which civil servants are to receive on the 1st January next.  If the Minister is only going to apply this increase from the 1st January next, it means that, although he is making restitution to serving civil servants in some measure&mdash;an insufficient measure in my opinion&mdash;he is going to do nothing apparently to deal with the case of persons who were compelled to retire on age or medical grounds since this injustice was first inflicted in 1940. If the Minister admits that he really did wrong in July, 1940, and that he ought not to have moved in this matter so precipitately in that year, then he ought to recognise that a special case exists for those persons who were compelled to retire on health or age grounds since the bonus stabilisation regulations were introduced.</P>
    <P>A man whose health is such that he is able to continue in the Service until 1945 will, for pension purposes, get the benefit of the increase in bonus; but, if a man's health was such that he was compelled to go out at any time since 1940, that man will lose, inasmuch as he will not have any benefit from the increase which will be granted on 1st January.  He will lose that, notwithstanding that the Minister now admits that he is granting this increase because of the precipitate application of the bonus stabilisation regulations from July, 1940, when men who have since retired were in the Service.  I put it to the Minister that these pensioners, many of whom were retired when the cost-of-living index figure was as low as 50 and 55, have a very special case for investigation and a very strong claim for an increase in their pensions to enable them to meet the high cost of living.</P>
    <P>These people went out when the cost-of-living <Col N="1357" /> index figure was 50 or 55.  That figure is now 190.  How do you expect a person who went out on pension when the cost-of-living index figure was 50 or 55 to be able to keep his head above water when that figure is 190&mdash; when, as a matter of fact, for pension purposes it ought to be 195?  It is asking that person to bear a burden which it is not possible for him to bear on his small pension.  There is a special case for the lowly-paid pensioners. The resources of the country are not so depleted that the Minister must compel these persons, who have served the State loyally and faithfully, to bear hardships out of all proportion to those which any citizen is required to bear in our circumstances to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcCann" hpid="Mr. McCann Mr. McCann">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to appeal, as other Deputies have appealed to the Minister to see his way, if it is at all possible for him to do so, to go a little backwards with this grant.  It is true that for four and a half years civil servants have laboured under terrible disabilities. Other sections of the community have received increases of one sort or another.  Certainly their incomes have not been stabilised in the same way as the incomes of civil servants.  With the sharp increase in the cost-of-living index figure, from 85 to 190, I think the case was made apparent long ago that some justice should be done to civil servants.  I make this appeal to the Minister, that if it is at all possible, he should make the increase retrospective as from 1st January, 1943.  If he does not find that possible, then perhaps he could make it retrospective from June, 1943.  I think all sides of the House are in agreement on this matter.  I have heard opinions expressed from time to time favourable to this proposal; I have heard considerable sympathy expressed with the civil servants.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister realise that if he finds a difficulty in meeting a suggestion such as has been made by Deputy McCann&mdash;that is, making the increase retrospective&mdash; that is only a measure of the wrong that has been done to the individuals concerned?  The bigger the difficulty <Col N="1358" /> for the Minister now, the bigger the wrong that has been cloaked over.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say I am not displeased to see the sympathy that is so general in the House towards the sacrifices that civil servants have been called upon to endure, and have endured, on the whole, without very bitter complaint.  I think I must admit that during the last four years that was the position.  I am fully aware of the heavy sacrifices that civil servants of all classes have been called upon to bear and I find myself, very regrettably indeed, in the position of being the instrument of enforcing these sacrifices upon them.  I do not enjoy that position; I do not enjoy the knowledge that some civil servants, as Deputy Mulcahy properly said, men with large families, as a great number of them have, who entered into commitments before the stabilisation was thought of, find themselves in a serious position as a result of the cuts that have been imposed upon them&mdash;heavy cuts, indeed, in many cases.</P>
      <P>I ask Deputies to realise what the position in this country has been, how many other classes of the community have had to suffer, have had to sacrifice, have had to tighten their belts, have had to do with less food, less clothes, less boots, or no boots or shoes or stockings; that thousands have been without work; that many others, thousands and thousands of them, have had to leave their families to seek work in England or Scotland or other countries for the sake of not adding to the hardships at home or for the purpose of getting help for their families at home.  It is within the knowledge of everybody in this House what many of the constituents of probably every Deputy have had to do. Admitting the severity of the sacrifices as described by Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Norton, accepting what they say as true, do we not have to admit to ourselves that there were many thousands, hundreds of thousands of people, who have had to endure very much heavier sacrifices?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is my whole case.  The civil servants, at any rate, though their remuneration was reduced, though, as <Col N="1359" /> Deputy Norton says, an agreement with them was broken, did not lose their employment on account of the emergency.  They were kept in employment and, at the end of the fortnight or the month, as the case may be, their cheques arrived and they could see something on which to build for the following month or six months.  As long as the State lasted, they were not going to lose, they would not be thrown on the roadside.  They had something to look forward to in steady employment, with all the conditions attaching to it.  At any rate, they were permanently employed in established service.</P>
    <P>I do not want to overdraw that picture.  I do not want to say that, on the basis of the permanent employment which they have, with its security of payment, holidays with pay, payment during sickness, and so on, we are entitled to take without limit from Civil Service wages and salaries.  I do not want to make that case at all.  I think we have asked the Civil Service to bear very heavy burdens, indeed.  To their credit, they have been loyal and industrious; they have even extended their hours of work during the emergency.  They have done that voluntarily and are continuing to do it voluntarily.  I want to pay that tribute and to acknowledge the excellent service they have given, despite the fact that they felt a grievance&mdash;and some of them felt it very severely indeed.</P>
    <P>However, facing what we had to face at the outbreak of war and not knowing what conditions were going to be like, not knowing until recent times&mdash; and, even yet, not being certain&mdash;of what might be before us, I do say, as Minister for Finance responsible to the Government and to this House for measures taken, the Civil Service on the whole has not had to bear anything like the hardships, the inconveniences, the sufferings and the sacrifices which have had to be borne in some cases by people who were in very prosperous positions before this war started and who, to-day, are penniless and whose families are living on the charity of friends.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1360" /> I do not want to deny the case made by Deputy Norton.  When the Taoiseach made his speech in Ennis, to which Deputy Norton has referred, neither he nor anyone else could have foreseen the emergency and the sacrifices which would have to be endured during it by so many hundreds of thousands of our people.</P>
    <P>There is just one modification I would make in the statement by Deputy Norton that the Government took every possible advantage when the cost of living was low.  It is a minor modification, I admit, and not worth a lot, but I would just stick to the facts: there was a limit of wages below which the cost-of-living figure was not allowed to go.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <P>At any rate, as Minister I want to be accurate in my figures, and I am trying to make the Deputy a little more accurate than he was, seeing that he is Leader of the Opposition Party.  Despite what Deputy Mulcahy says, this £500,000 going back to the Civil Service&mdash;if the House agrees&mdash;will assuage the hurt feelings of civil servants to some extent.  I admit there will still be a grievance there and that there will be a feeling, in some cases, that we have asked too much of the Civil Service. That is a debatable matter.  We certainly have asked very heavy sacrifices from them and they have, on the whole, made them for the benefit of this State.  They have made them willingly, recognising that, in the great majority of cases, they were in a priviliged position.  I do want to pay tribute to them for the loyal and industrious service they have given and <Col N="1361" /> for the integrity with which at all times all classes, high and low, have served the State even during times when they felt they had sore grievances.</P>
      <P>This is an instalment on the heavy cuts that have been made.  I do not want to deny what Deputy Norton said about the amount of money that we have saved.  We will still have left to the credit of the State, out of the savings in the Civil Service, some millions of pounds.  I do not want to deny that at all, but I want the House and the country to realise what the Civil Service has suffered.  The more the country, as well as Deputies in this House, realise the sacrifices they have made, the higher their opinion should be of the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>The marriage differentiation is a thing that applies to the Civil Service. It does not apply outside and has never applied outside.  I do not know exactly when it was introduced in the Civil Service: it was not during my time.  It was a system that was in existence there and, naturally, being there, the bonus had to be applied on the same principle as the ordinary wages and salaries of the civil servants.</P>

Deputy O'Connor suggested it be paid from January of this year, while Deputy McCann went one better and asked me to take in another half-year.  There is no hope of that.  This year we have budgeted for a considerable deficit and what we are doing to-day will add heavily to that deficit.  If there were any likelihood of a surplus, we might have a different view of the matter but, budgeting as we have done this year and last year for deficits, I am afraid there is no hope of adopting the suggestions put forward by those two Deputies and supported by others in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so. I have looked into that matter, may I say, sympathetically&mdash;though I hate using that word since, if nothing is forthcoming, the sympathy is not worth much.  I have considered the point over lengthy periods.  We cannot take one class of pensioner.  If we do anything for one class we will have to do it for all, including the old age pensioners.  I was aghast when I saw the figures of what even a small increase for all classes of pensioners would cost.  I could not face it, and that is the position.  This proposal in regard to the Civil Service will cost us £640,000 or £650,000, including the 1/-emergency bonus for civil servants, <Col N="1363" /> Gárdaí and teachers.  The fact that we recognised the position of civil servants who had their bonus stabilised a year before other people outside, and tried to meet the situation to some extent, has naturally set other people going.  We have not heard the end of it yet, and in all probability other Ministers are busy working out figures for their Departments.  I can foresee &mdash;unless the Government, as I hope they will, realise the danger of being over generous in times of a deficit&mdash; that the House will hear more about demands for increased bonuses and increased payments of one kind or another before the financial year is out.</P>

If he admits by this Estimate that the Government ought not, in fact, have stabilised the remuneration of civil servants from July, 1940, when they did not stabilise the remuneration of people outside until 1941, will he not now admit that there is a very strong case for not depriving those who retired between July, 1940, and January next from the benefit of the increased bonus which they would have got if the Government had not effected that stabilisation in July, 1940, and which they are adjusting now to take effect as from the 1st January next?</P>

      <P>I agree that there is a strong case for examining the question of not only the pensioners referred to by Deputy Norton&mdash;I do not want to minimise what he says with regard to them&mdash;but that there is also a strong case for doing what Deputy Mulcahy has suggested with regard to civil servants as a whole, and pensioners.  I agree that there is something to be said for examining the case that Deputy Mulcahy has partly made, that Deputy Norton has partly made, and that other members of the House are quite willing to make, but, taking the facts of the situation as they are, I do not think any Minister for Finance would be prepared, in present conditions, to increase further the strong tendency towards inflation, whatever the justice of the claims may be held by some to be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say that we are agreed as to the necessity for arterial drainage.  We are trying to tackle there a problem created by long years of neglect so far as the national drainage of the country is concerned. If, however, we are to make arterial drainage effective and economic we must tackle field drainage as well. That, too, of course is a very big problem, and I hope it will not be lost sight of.  We regret that this Bill has emerged in its present form.  The Vocational Commission has seen fit to criticise the bureaucratic trend in our legislation in recent years.  I feel that this Bill is an outstanding example of that type of legislation.  That trend has been strongly condemned by a commission set up by the Government. We have vigorously opposed it on this side of the House.  We did so during the Committee Stage, but the Parliamentary Secretary was adamant in defending the bureaucratic viewpoint. We feel that the power and authority of the people ought to be vested in them.  We, in the Parliament of the country, should not surrender the authority of the people to a bureaucratic institution or hand over complete and absolute control of the arterial drainage of the country to an institution constituted as the Office of Public Works is.  We feel that, along with the authority that was envisaged by the Drainage Commission in its report, there should be another authority elected and in some way as representative of the people so that control would remain in the hands of the people.  The Office of Public Works could be utilised to do the work, but it should be controlled and directed by the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We agree that in doing arterial <Col N="1365" /> drainage work of this kind very wide powers are necessary so far as entry on land, the acquisition of land and the exercise of rights-of-way, milling, and other matters are concerned.  We have freely given those powers to the drainage authority that we are setting up, but during the course of the discussions on this Bill we have thought it desirable and essential to urge that a provision should be inserted in the Bill to protect the rights and liberties of individuals.  That demand of ours has been denied time and again, and this House has seen fit to leave out those essential safeguards.  The bureaucratic institution has been given wide and arbitrary powers so far as the administration of this measure is concerned. That is to be regretted.</P>
    <P>If this House continues to legislate in this fashion an intolerable position is bound to arise.  In saying that I am not and have no desire to cast any reflection on individual members of the Civil Service.  The civil servants, trained as so many of them are with the one track mind and a red-tape outlook, can scarcely be blamed if we in a Parliamentary institution are prepared to deny to the people the power that ought properly be vested in the people and hand over to a bureaucratic institution that sort of limited control and authority.  An individual engineer or inspector from the Department vested with that power of control can behave in a very arbitrary way.  It is only human to expect that he will do so at times.  That is why I say the safeguards to which I have referred should have been inserted in this Bill. They are essential if we are to ensure that the rights and liberties of individuals are to be protected at all times and so that they may not be steam-rolled by a man exercising the wide arbitrary power which is now being given to the Office of Public Works. We have argued that point on many sections of the Bill, but we have not impressed the Parliamentary Secretary or the majority of the members of this House.  Is it not an extraordinary state of affairs that the House should agree to a provision of this sort: that if the action of the commissioners is to be questioned at any time, and if legal <Col N="1366" /> proceedings are instituted, a certificate issued by the commissioners to the effect that a particular work has been efficiently done must be accepted as final and conclusive evidence on that point?  It must be accepted in court as final and conclusive.</P>
    <P>Is not that an extraordinary provision for a democratic assembly like this to agree to?  We tried to prevail on the Parliamentary Secretary not to agree to a provision of that sort.  The Parliamentary Secretary, claimed, I suppose, to be a great democrat before he was put in charge of the Board of Works.  He appears to be a great autocrat now.  He believes in bureaucratic rather than democratic control. These are the fundamental issues between the Government and ourselves so far as the shaping and moulding of this piece of legislation are concerned. This is an outstanding example of the very thing condemned by the Vocational Organisation Commission&mdash;the trend towards bureaucratic administration. Every member of the Fianna Fáil Party should have regard for this aspect of the question.  Very eminent men were put on that commission and they give this question very close examination.  When they thought fit to warn the House and the country of the undesirability of such legislation, we ought to hearken to their warning. But we do not appear to worry about it.</P>
    <P>A very reprehensible section was introduced into the Bill at the last moment&mdash;a retrospective section which sets out to nullify a decision of the High Court.  If the people are to have respect for the decisions of the courts, we ourselves ought to set them a good example.  We ought to accept the decisions of the High Court.  The section to which I refer sets out to treat with contempt a decision given by the High Court.  That is a very reprehensible way of dealing with a problem which could have been dealt with in other ways.  I regret that the Government and the Parliamentary Secretary have persisted in their effort to defeat the High Court decision by legislation.</P>
    <P>I asked the Parliamentary Secretary on the Second Stage of this Bill to <Col N="1367" /> bear in mind that there is an agricultural aspect to this problem of national drainage.  He did not appear to grasp the significance of my point.  Great Britain has undertaken large-scale, agricultural drainage schemes during the war.  They claim to have reclaimed about 6,000,000 acres&mdash;a huge achievement in a short time.  It was necessary for their chartered surveyors to have agricultural qualifications because this whole problem of drainage and water levels has a very important agricultural aspect.  I feel that the ordinary engineer, trained to deal only with water, does not know enough about that aspect.  It is not merely desirable but essential to have men with agricultural qualifications.  Great Britain has done that.  America has insisted for some years that some of the men engaged on drainage should have agricultural qualifications.  If the Parliamentary Secretary is not prepared to accept my advice, I hope he will undertake to examine that aspect of the matter further and consult men capable of giving him advice.</P>
    <P>All we can do now is to express the hope that the extraordinary powers vested in the Department by this piece of legislation will not be abused.  I believe that it is unlikely they will be abused to any great extent but we cannot take things for granted.  We ought to make legislation watertight and insert the necessary provisions.  A mere promise that everything will be all right is not sufficient.  The House has been given good reason to doubt the wisdom of allowing legislation such as this to go through without necessary safeguards by the action of the Parliamentary Secretary in attempting to undo a mistake made by his Department. I hope that undue advantage will not be taken by the officers of the Department or by the Department itself of those sections which have been left wide open and in which the interests of the individual have not been sufficiently safeguarded.</P>

      <P>I want to join with the last Deputy who spoke in voicing my protest against the vicious principles which have been introduced into this measure.  It is a very excellent <Col N="1368" /> measure, dealing with a desirable thing &mdash;arterial drainage&mdash;and it is regrettable that advantage should be taken of it and that it should be made the cloak for enshrining undemocratic principles in our legislation.  I do not share the hope of Deputy Hughes that the powers given in the Bill may be used sparingly.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will use them mercilessly.  I hope he will avail himself of the powers given in order to set aside the rights of private citizens and the elected representatives of those citizens in the county council and here, as has already been done.  I hope that that will be done unsparingly, because I trust that, in that way, there will be a natural reaction from the people.  They will not lie down tamely under the operation of retrograde legislation of this kind.  As stated by Deputy Hughes, their every right has been flouted.  Evidence of the intention of the Board of Works is shown by the way they have set aside in this Bill a decision of the High Court and anticipated any similar decisions by defeating them in advance.  In that frame of mind, it is futile to hope for a sparing use of the powers given.  In the interests of the country, I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary and those associated with him will use their powers unsparingly so as to bring about a reaction which will destroy that kind of mentality in this House. We have been sent here to represent and maintain a democracy but here we are handing over to a subservient body &mdash;the Board of Works&mdash;power to override the rights of common citizens who will be affected by arterial drainage schemes.  They are to be the sole judges as to whether a work is properly completed or not.  Once it is certified by them, that will end the matter.  Neither the people nor the courts will have anything to say to it. I do not believe in putting any body above the law.  The Board of Works are given a privileged position under this Bill and I regret that so necessary a piece of legislation should be used as a cover for the establishment of so vicious a principle.  I trust that the idea of such a privileged position will be resisted vigorously, and that a position may be brought about in which <Col N="1369" /> the citizens of this country will have a voice, and will be enabled to bring us, their representatives, to book later on if we should fail in our duty.</P>

      <P>When this Bill was introduced I ventured to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on having the privilege of producing such a Bill as this, which had been so long delayed, and I expressed the hope that when the Bill left this House such a piece of legislation would be enacted as every section of the House and every Deputy could welcome, but I regret, as other Deputies have already pointed out, that the Parliamentary Secretary was not more amenable to the various suggestions that were made here for the improvement of the Bill.  One of the difficulties that I saw in the Bill when it was originally introduced was that it appeared to be too dictatorial; that there was no link provided as between the local bodies and the commissioners. Suggestions were made on various stages of the Bill to provide for such a link, but they were all refused by the Parliamentary Secretary. I even suggested an amendment whereby the Minister for Local Government would be brought into the Bill, as being the Minister most closely in touch with the local bodies, but for some reason the Parliamentary Secretary seemed to resent any question of interference by the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Keyes, a moment ago, referred to the question of the completion of a scheme and the necessary certificate.  Under this Bill, the word of the commissioners is to be taken that a scheme is satisfactory, and there is no machinery whereby the local bodies or anybody else can appeal against that decision.  I endeavoured to have an amendment inserted in the Bill to the effect that no certificate as to the completion of a scheme would be issued without, at least, the consent of the Minister for Local Government who, as I have already said, is in close touch with the local bodies.  The Parliamentary Secretary refused to do that, but he did give us what some of us, at any rate, accepted as an undertaking that he would bring in an <Col N="1370" /> amendment to the effect that the Minister for Local Government, at least, would be consulted before any certificate was issued by the commissioners and that he was bringing in a definite provision in the Bill linking the Minister for Local Government, by name, with the issue of such certificates.  I was surprised, therefore, to find that the Parliamentary Secretary failed to introduce any amendment covering that point.  At a later stage, he said that, on reconsideration, it was thought not wise to introduce such an amendment. In other words, on careful consideration, it was finally concluded that it was definitely better to leave the Minister for Local Government out of the Bill so far as any advisory capacity was concerned.  I think it is regrettable that the Parliamentary Secretary could not see eye to eye with us in that respect.  As the Bill now stands, there is no effective appeal from the decision of the commissioners in any matter.  That is regrettable for many reasons.  In such a complicated business as national drainage there are bound to be differences of opinion between the local bodies and the commissioners. It is not a good thing that the decision should be left to one of the parties concerned, and that is what is bound to happen once the Bill leaves the House in its present state. I do not want to make any reference to what we have already discussed on the various stages of the Bill.  Like Deputy Hughes, Deputy Keyes and other Deputies who spoke, I regret that the Parliamentary Secretary took the opportunity of introducing, at a late stage of the discussion on the Bill, a revolutionary section, making it impossible for local bodies, through their representatives, or even for the Minister for Local Government, to offer any effective opposition to any decision of the commissioners.  In fact, the commissioners are put in such a position that their decision is over and above that of the judges, so far as this particular section of the Bill is concerned. I hope that when the Parliamentary Secretary takes this Bill to the Seanad, having considered it more closely in the meantime, he will give way, in the Seanad, to suggestions that were made in this House but refused by him.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1371" /> Little more remains to be said by me, except to express the hope that, even though our suggestions have not been received by the Parliamentary Secretary in the manner in which we hoped they would be received, great good will be achieved as a result of the passing of the Bill, and I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will be as enthusiastic in seeing that the drainage problem of this country will be undertaken speedily as he has been in resisting the suggestions put forward by various members of this House, which he was adamant in refusing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few remarks that I should like to make in connection with the Bill.  A lengthy debate took place on one section of the Bill in connection with the Mulkear judgment, and the Parliamentary Secretary, it seemed to me, conveyed the impression to the House that the effect of the judgment in the Mulkear case was to tie up the House from spending any more money on that scheme.  I have since seen the judgment on that case, and it seems to me to be clear that all the judge decided was that a final award could not be made until the works had been completed and until the entire costs were included&mdash; quite a different thing from what the Parliamentary Secretary suggested.  I do not want to go back on that particular aspect of the question now, but it is clear to my mind that there has been a grave neglect of drainage work by county councils in the past and that the local authorities throughout the country, as a result of that neglect, are left with a huge legacy of work to be done.  We sought to shift that work on to the State because we felt that it was unfair and unreasonable to pile the cumulative effect of that neglect on top of the local authorities, as is, apparently, contemplated under this Bill.  I have no doubt, as Deputy Keyes has pointed out, that the Board of Works will take steps to compel the local authorities to bring the works up to the level of the standard at which they feel they should have been kept in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another fear that I have in connection with this Bill is that, through the <Col N="1372" /> County Management Act and the present local government administration, generally, the voice of representative bodies throughout the country will be silenced, and that the local authorities and the elected representatives of the people will have no say whatever in the administration of the Act.  I think that is a deplorable departure, particularly as we have no right of appeal whatever to any court in the land.  The central drainage authority is the court of final appeal, and I can visualise a position arising, the result of which will be that the entire implementation of this Bill will go forward irrespective of what the local people may feel about the matter. There are good features in the Bill also that, I think, should be commended: such as that the occupiers of lands to be benefited are being freed from the charges under this Bill.  I think that that is a very good provision and that the Parliamentary Secretary should be complimented upon it. At the same time, however, I must say that I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary met us properly on the other points that were made, and particularly on the question of the right of appeal to the High Court and also the passing of this heritage of neglect to the local authorities.</P>

      <P>Most of the points that have been raised on this Final Stage of the Bill have been very fully debated in the House already, and I do not propose now to cover the ground that has been so often covered during the various stages of the Bill.  As well, I shall have an opportunity in the other House I suppose of going over this measure, section by section, as we have done here.  It is true to say that I have not been able to meet members of the Opposition in all the amendments they have submitted but if these amendments have been resisted, they have been resisted simply because it was our considered view that their acceptance would injure, and would in fact in their application impede, the work that all Parties in this House would like to see undertaken and carried out as quickly <Col N="1373" /> as possible.  There is no doubt that drastic powers are enshrined in the Bill but anyone who has any idea of the problems associated with arterial drainage will realise the necessity for drastic powers.  My only fear is that when we come to grapple with these problems the powers which we have taken in the Bill will not be sufficiently drastic for the purpose.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made amongst other matters to the Mulkear decision and I was very pleased to observe from the remarks we have heard from Deputy Coogan, that although on the Committee Stage we were accused of doing something that was entirely unconstitutional by the introduction of an amendment, although we were denounced by him and some other members of the Party from every angle for the introduction of that amendment, he has now come forward and admitted that since the discussion he has read the decision given by Mr. Justice Overend.  I hope that some of those other people who have been talking about this judgment and that some of those leader writers who saw fit to comment on our attitude in this matter, since writing these leaders and making these comments in a public way, have also made up their minds to read that judgment.  If they do so, I think whether they be laymen or lawyers they will agree that instead of our doing, as was suggested by some Deputies and by people outside, something contrary to that particular judgment, we are in fact following rigidly along the lines suggested in the High Court decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Parliamentary Secretary if the commissioners will follow any order of priority in undertaking drainage schemes?  What I mean is this.  If, for instance, a scheme with a novel historical background is put before the commissioners, will that scheme get prior consideration to a scheme which has been brought before the commissioners in comparatively recent years or recent months? Will schemes formulated under the 1924 and 1925 Acts which were not completed because local authorities could not see their way to subsidise these <Col N="1374" /> schemes, be given a certain preference over newer schemes?</P>

      <P>As I say, I would be surprised to hear of any drainage scheme that had not a historical background. I know a number of districts about which an agitation has been carried on for years and years, but we have not any fixed notions as to the line on which we shall proceed.  The House has some idea, I suppose, from the fact that we have already selected the Brosna and we are at present working on the Glyde and Dee.  I think that in the commission's report mention was made of the Brick and Cashen, but I am not repeating that to indicate that that is the order in which we shall travel in the preparation of schemes.  As I have told the House already, our activities in that regard will be subject to review annually here. I have no doubt at all that we shall hear then from Deputy Roddy, who will have in mind, and who will be under pressure from his own people in Sligo, some particular district which has, as he says, an historical background. If our selections are not in the from which he thinks fit and proper, we shall get the criticism of this House and the country outside.  I am sure that no matter what our choice will prove to be, or in what order we may proceed to select districts, we shall have people saying that we have not taken up the most necessary schemes.  I suppose that is to be expected, having regard to the length of time it will take to complete this work and the amount of pressure that will be put on everybody to see that I come before you and that you come before the other fellow.  The drainage authority, however, will have to examine every one of these districts from every point of view&mdash;the point of <Col N="1375" /> view of employment, the point of view of the equipment we may have at our disposal at the time and the point of view of the amount of good that will result from the carrying out of the scheme.  These are the considerations that will have to be borne in mind when deciding the order of priority; at least they are all the indications I can give to the House at this stage.</P>

      <P>In page 3, Section 5 (1), line 43, to insert the words &ldquo;after making such inquiries as he considers necessary&rdquo; before the words &ldquo;is satisfied&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a discussion on this on the Committee Stage.  Section 5 deals with the use of ground as a place of burial.  The idea of this section is to amend the principal Act, because under the principal Act there is no power to take a place for the burial of animals except the land owned by the owner of the cattle.  This section was put in, first of all, in order to enable the inspector to dispose of the cattle where no such ground was suitable. The principle of that has already been accepted on Committee Stage, and I need not go back over it.  In some discussion during the Committee Stage it was urged that the inspector should make every possible endeavour to use the owner's land before he would go into another man's land.  Both Deputy Hughes and I have made an attempt to ensure that.  My amendment says that the veterinary inspector, &ldquo;after making such inquiries as he considers necessary&rdquo;, must be satisfied.  Deputy Hughes' amendment suggests the words &ldquo;after inspection by himself or on his behalf&rdquo;.  There is not a lot between them.  The only thing I can plead in favour of my amendment is that at least it has had the benefit of having been looked over by the <Col N="1377" /> lawyers, the draftsmen and so on, who have brought it into conformity with the usual legislation on this point.  I think the amendment which I have proposed should cover the point, because he must at least make the inquiries that he considers necessary before deciding that it is not possible to have the animals buried on the land of the person concerned, and that he must go outside that land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister went back to the Principal Act and said that under that Act there was no power to go outside the farm on which the live stock existed.  That is true, and we agree that it is necessary to have power to go outside if there is no suitable land on the particular farm in which the outbreak has occurred, but from the point of view of the other man who has to provide the burial ground that is very objectionable.  My aim is to ensure that that will happen only where it is absolutely essential. If there are any facilities on the land where the outbreak occurred, then the animals ought to be buried on that land, and it was open to the inspector to go outside it, in my opinion, as the Bill was originally drafted.  I do not think the Minister has met the point, the Parliamentary draftsman notwithstanding, because if we examine closely those words &ldquo;after making such inquiries as he considers necessary&rdquo; it will be found that they mean nothing.  The inspector may not consider any inquiries necessary, and legally he cannot be challenged on it. I suggest the words &ldquo;after inspection by himself&rdquo;&mdash;putting the responsibility on him&mdash;&ldquo;or on his behalf&rdquo;; if he is not able to do it himself he can ask somebody else to do it, but inspection surely should be made.  I appreciate the Minister's willingness to meet the point, but I do not think his amendment does so, because I think the interpretation of those words is that the inspector can simply do what he likes.  If he is challenged, he can say: &ldquo;I consider that it is not necessary,&rdquo; and that is all about it.  There is no definite duty imposed on him by the amendment.  The Minister agrees that it is not desirable to go outside the owner's land?</P>

I already told the House on the Committee Stage that I would agree to the Deputy's next amendment to delete sub-section (2), but then, if we do, it means that the owner of the land, the aggrieved person if you like, could take an action if he thought the inspector had not made reasonable inquiries.</P>

      <P>I should like also to say to the Deputy that in those cases, as he knows, there are always instructions. First of all, there would be Orders made under the Act.  Secondly, there would be instructions drawn up. The instructions given to veterinary inspectors in such cases certainly will &mdash;as they do already&mdash;contain a direction that they must make every endeavour to have the animals disposed of on the land concerned before they go outside it.

      <P>The Minister will notice that, as the Bill is drafted, the owner of the animals or goods may be required to remove them.  But the owner may not be available.

A man with one animal diseased may do as much harm as a man with seven. Therefore, the simple fine is the best, but we overlooked the fact that item (ii), which is dealt with here, says that he can be fined for the removal of manure, and so on, in addition to the fine under the first paragraph.

    </Speaker>
    <P>This new Bill has many excellent progressive features, more especially in relation to the diagnosis and treatment of early symptoms of mental illness.  It is, I think, readily admitted by all sides of the House that it is an excellent measure and the Parliamentary Secretary in introducing such an admirable measure deserves our heartiest commendations.  Roughly speaking, this measure will affect four sections of people.  In the first place, we have the administrative bodies responsible to the Minister for the provision and administration of proper institutions for the treatment of mental disease.  One of the splendid features of the Bill is the section dealing with the possibility of a number of such administrative bodies co-operating for the purpose of establishing research laboratories&mdash;a much-needed provision, I should say, in the preliminary work for the adequate treatment of this disease.  I think it was Deputy O'Higgins who referred to the fact that there were no post-graduate courses for those who intended to specialise in this particular branch of national health but, as far as my knowledge and experience go, I think the medical men who were admitted to the mental hospital departments had first to undergo a postgraduate course in the study of mental diseases.  In addition&mdash;probably the matter would not arise under this Bill &mdash;there is the provision of travelling <Col N="1383" /> studentships, and so on, in countries where this particular branch of medicine has received special attention for years.</P>
    <P>Regarding the patients threatened or afflicted with mental illness, what I may call the early treatment period will save them from what is commonly regarded as a stigma.  Mental disease is not more remarkable than any other disease, but in the public eye some stigma attached to those who were afflicted with mental disease.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill, those who may be affected will now have a better chance of retaining their property, until the course of the disease is definitely established.  The Parliamentary Secretary told us that about 33? per cent. of the patients recover after three to six months.  There is a danger of relapse if they recover after three to six months and find themselves amongst people who for long years have been affected by this disorder. That danger is largely obviated by the provisions in this new Bill.</P>
    <P>These provisions will relieve relatives of many natural anxieties.  They will now know that special care and attention will be given patients in the early stages.  The only part of the Bill likely to cause any difference of opinion will be the section dealing with the staffs in the immediate charge of the institutions and of the patients.  We admit that the employment is not a very congenial one, involving as it does years of care and continued vigilance. The staffs look forward to getting two-thirds of their pay and emoluments as the basis of pensions.  They will not get that under this Bill, even though many improvements have been made, for which full credits must be given to the Parliamentary Secretary.  Instead of calculating on ten years previously as the basis of the pension to be granted, it will now be on the last three years.  In addition, it is proposed to give one year's salary and emoluments.  The staffs state that this is a contributory scheme.  Many of them have been contributing since 1910.  Even when the emoluments are included to their advantage, they <Col N="1384" /> would prefer two-thirds as the basis of pensions if the Parliamentary Secretary could see his way to grant that request.  The easiest way for the substitution for what is in the Bill would be to put in one-sixtieth where one-eightieth occurs, and two-sixtieth where two-eightieth occurs.  That means something in cash and a small rectification of the Bill.</P>
    <P>When female attendants engaged in those institutions leave to get married after a number of years' service they were entitled to receive a certain salary and emoluments.  Under the Bill they simply get back contributions paid towards pensions.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should consider restoring the other provisions.  After all, when attendants leave after ten years' service, they have an accumulation of rights towards pensions, and it is only right that, in addition to the restoration of the premiums they paid, some additional sum should be given.  Those who are looking for two-thirds of their salaries as pensions are not looking for everything, but are prepared to give something.  I believe they are prepared to pay 4 per cent. instead of the 3 per cent. they are now paying, if that concession were granted. There are other small items that affect pensions.  One is that those in these institutions feel that they are prematurely aged and that there should be some provision for the continuation of the payment of portion of their pensions to widows.  The Parliamentary Secretary has a very admirable provision in the Bill for the payment of moneys in certain circumstances to the legal representative of members of the staffs.  That provision in the Bill is an improvement.  One fear in that regard is that it may be too closely interpreted.  A person entering the service has to pass an examination and if disabled afterwards by heart disease or digestive trouble, due perhaps to anxiety and the nature of the work, there is a fear that the provision may be too closely interpreted.  I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on introducing this measure which, I am sure, will be sympathetically received by the entire community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Deputies in welcoming the introduction of this Bill and, in particular, in congratulating the Parliamentary Secretary on the distinction of having his name associated with the removal of what might be described as a very degrading clause so far as the treatment of mental diseases is concerned, particularly in the incipient stage.  I venture to say that when the Bill becomes an Act it will, at least, have removed a very serious blot from our social life.  As far as voluntary patients are concerned we welcome that proposal. That regulation was simply archaic and absolutely retarded anything in the way of curative treatment. It certainly did not tend to induce patients to seek treatment at the early stage before being committed.  There were also restrictions inside such buildings for the treatment of patients of that class.  I am glad that all these regulations are being swept aside and that we may look forward to the plan enshrined in the Bill producing good results.</P>
      <P>Having paid a tribute to the Parliamentary Secretary, it is well that it should be recognised in the last analysis, that the practical solution of this problem will rest on the shoulders of local authorities.  In so far as the treatment of mental disease is concerned I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that the problem has always been approached by local authorities on the basis of practical sympathy, and that everything has been done in respect of accommodation and medical attention in the various hospitals.  I have no doubt whatever that whatever extra financial commitments will follow the passing of the Bill, will be borne by local authorities in the same spirit as they have manifested up to this.  Because of that, it is, perhaps, regrettable that this excellent Bill, which obviously calls for enthusiasm and co-operation from those who will be in charge of the administration of the Act, should incorporate the terms of the County Management Act.  It is obvious that a certain amount of enthusiasm, personal attention and supervision will be wanted on the part of local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, I am sure, will agree <Col N="1386" /> with me when I say that, as a result of the operation of the County Management Act, the work of mental hospital committees has very seriously deteriorated within the last six months or so. I have personal experience of the main hospital committee in the country, that is, Grangegorman Mental Hospital Committee.  It is a very large committee, consisting of over 40 members, and, if the Dublin County Council had its representation, the membership would run to about 47.  Members of the House who were members of that committee prior to the change-over under the County Management Act will agree with me with regard to the excellent work done and careful attention given by that exceedingly large committee in respect of patients and the general working of the institution, but it is regrettable that, even recently, it has been exceedingly difficult to get a meeting of that committee and that meetings could not be held for lack of a quorum.  Obviously there is something radically wrong, when a committee which was active, enthusiastic and co-operating with the heads of the institution suddenly falls down as this committee has.  I suggest that an examination of the position even at this stage would be well worth the while of the Parliamentary Secretary rather than that the opportunity which this Bill gives for bringing about the active co-operation which we desire should fail to be availed of.</P>
    <P>Deputy Roddy referred to one point in regard to which I very gladly support him, that is, the question of the capitation grants.  I have already referred to the part which local authorities will be called on to play.  The main financial burden arising from this Bill will fall on their shoulders, and they are not objecting, as I say, to that, in any way, but the Parliamentary Secretary is aware, because the point was brought up in the House here even since I became a member, that the origin of the capitation grant is an old British Act of somewhere around 1875.  The régime at that time was apparently anxious that a distinction should be drawn between a patient in a poor law institution, a workhouse, as it was then designated, and a mental hospital, or an asylum, <Col N="1387" /> as it was then described, and were anxious to encourage a patient to be treated in a mental hospital or asylum rather than in a poor law institution. A grant was given at the time covering the difference in the cost of maintaining a patient in a poor law institution and in an asylum, the amount being based on a differential of 4/-.  The strange thing about it is that, down through the years, that figure has not changed, or where it has changed, it has changed to the detriment of the local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Corporation is not getting the 4/- differential at the moment.  The figure is even less. I understand that the fund originally came from certain licence duties, and whether the fund has dried up or not, I do not know, but true it is that the figure is not what it was 60 years ago. The difference between the cost of a patient in a poor law institution and a mental hospital at the moment is best illustrated by the fact that, in Grangegorman, the over-all cost is £2 2s. and for the Board of Assistance, roughly 25/-, or a differential of 17/-, while the local authority still gets only 4/-.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that the opportunity provided by this Bill might be availed of to rectify that anomaly which has existed so long and to which attention has been drawn on several occasions.</P>
    <P>The question of chargeability is pretty well defined in the Bill, but I am not quite clear as to whether a particular case which has been brought to my attention is covered.  Mountjoy Jail is regarded as the receiving jail for practically the whole country, and if an individual there becomes insane, he will naturally be taken to the local hospital, which is Grangegorman.  If he were a chargeable patient, I should like to know if there would be recoup-ment so far as his local authority is concerned.  There are other matters, including the matter of superannuation referred to by Deputy McCarthy, which arise on the Bill, but we will obviously come back to them at the appropriate time on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Any Bill of this kind, tending, as this does, to give more <Col N="1388" /> care and to provide improved methods of treatment and more humane administration so far as one of the most afflicted sections of our population is concerned would be assured of a very sympathetic hearing in this House from all sides, and consequently it is natural and proper that some welcome changes made in the Bill should receive appreciation and welcome in the House.  Powers are sought in the Bill to repeal, partly in some cases and wholly in others, a long list of previous enactments dealing with lunacy.  I have not had the opportunity of finding out to what extent they alter the position, but I am willing to believe that, having regard to the fact that there is in many respects a progressive spirit manifested in the Bill, the repeal of such enactments is in accord with that spirit.</P>
      <P>With other members, I very warmly welcome this new and up-to-date method of getting admission for patients to mental hospitals.  The former system was one of the most hideous deformities of our social system.  The fact that people had to be paraded in public in the custody of police officers before their admission could be secured was a dreadful deformity and everybody interested in the development of a more humane and up-to-date treatment of the afflicted sections of our population will give a very warm welcome to this new proposal. In the words recently uttered by a very distinguished ecclesiastic in this country, it was something which deserved to be blotted out from the Statute Book of the country and from the memory of the people.  I sincerely hope it foreshadows developments of a similar kind in regard to other services. The people would certainly warmly welcome an extension of that policy in regard to the poor law system generally and in regard to other matters appertaining thereto.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to see that provision is being made in this Bill for the closer supervision of private and semiprivate institutions dealing with mental disorders.  The fact that the system will accordingly become more uniform and that the question of <Col N="1389" /> supervision, inspection and general control will be brought into line is another welcome feature of this Bill. On the question of superannuation, I do not want to say anything at present, but I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary must be aware that, for a number of years past, there has been a sustained agitation amongst employees of mental hospitals for the betterment of their condition.  I think he will recognise that it is in the interest of the people committed to the care of attendants in mental hospitals that those who perform the arduous and, very often, unpleasant work of caring for such patients should not have any ground for discontent. In so far as these provisions will bring about an improvement, and in so far as they may be revised again on the further stages of the Bill, they are a very important feature of the whole measure.</P>
    <P>I join with my colleague, Deputy O'Sullivan, in his statement in regard to the control of mental hospitals.  The term &ldquo;board&rdquo; is used in this Bill and there is also a provision for the repeal of a certain section of the County Management Act.  I had not the advantage of hearing the Parliamentary Secretary's opening statement and, if I am in the dark in regard to this matter because of that, the fault is my own.  But, if this matter has not been adverted in his opening statement, the Parliamentary Secretary might, perhaps, indicate how far the repeal of this particular section and how far the use of the term &ldquo;board&rdquo; in connection with this measure indicates any change in the present position or the giving of any additional executive functions to the people's representatives on the mental hospital committees.  Not alone in Dublin, but in other parts of the country, mental hospital committees are falling very largely into disuse because of the fact that there are no functions that they may usefully perform, except the function, which, of course, is an important one, of paying periodic visits to the institution.  That is a function, however, that could be exercised by any public representative without any closer relationship with <Col N="1390" /> the mental hospital.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary will find on examination of this matter that there is a case for taking the elected representatives of the people more fully into confidence and putting them in a position of responsibility in regard to the administration of the mental hospitals and that that change will be for the benefit of the people concerned and of the service as a whole.</P>
    <P>There are distinctions made in this measure between certain sets of employees in a mental hospital, registered and non-registered employees. I rather understood that, in the case of a considerable number, if not the overwhelming majority of the employees of mental hospitals, they were attendants in the sense of being officers of the institution and that, in addition to that work, they discharged up to a certain point other functions in connection with a particular craft or calling in regard to the upkeep and maintenance of the institution.  I should like to know exactly how far this proposed change will alter the position in regard of such persons.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied with that.  This Bill, as I said, does afford an opportunity of saying something that I think the Parliamentary Secretary is aware of, namely, that there is a feeling amongst people who have tried to associate themselves as much as ordinary lay people can with the question of the treatment of mental disorders in this country about what may be done in the immediate future towards making substantial progress in that direction.  If a very inexperienced layman may venture a suggestion in a matter of that kind, my suggestion would be that a number of prominent officials, such as resident medical superintendents in various mental hospitals, should be given facilities, as soon as conditions approach anything like normal, to go abroad and find how far more up-to-date curative methods of treatment could be applied in this country in regard to this particular disorder. There are many strange things said <Col N="1391" /> from time to time, I do not know with what degree of accuracy, with regard to mental disorders.</P>
      <P>I saw a statement some time ago which seems to me a very strange contradiction in itself, namely, that during periods of war and terrific unrest, when everyone would expect mental disorders rapidly to increase, that in fact the contrary is the case, and that during periods of terrible unrest an examination of statistics in various countries has disclosed that there has been a rather marked decline in the incidence of mental disorders as shown by the records in regard to people admitted to institutions for the treatment of that type of disease.  I do not know whether that is a fact or not but, if so, it is an extraordinary statement. I only mention it in order to press on the Government, through the Parliamentary Secretary, the viewpoint that in this particular matter there is a great field for developing a programme that will ultimately result in more up-to-date curative methods being employed for the treatment of mental disorders in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very glad to notice that provision is being made in this measure for gratuities to the widows and dependents of people who die in the service of mental hospital authorities. There is just one fear lurking at the back of my mind in connection with that matter and it is whether there will be much difficulty, having regard to the provisions of the Bill, in establishing in applications of that kind a particular connection between the death of the persons concerned and the service in which they were engaged for a certain number of years; whether, in the case of a person employed in a mental hospital, who dies from pneumonia, for instance, there would be any difficulty for any person who sought to establish a claim under this measure in showing that that was due to service in the mental hospital.  The Parliamentary Secretary is aware, or at least some of his colleagues are aware, that with regard to people who die while serving in the National Army there is very often great difficulty on the part of dependents who make a claim for gratuities <Col N="1392" /> or pensions afterwards in connecting the deaths of those persons with service in the Army or causes arising out of that service.  I feel, therefore, that in connection with a measure of this kind, the spirit of which has already been commented upon favourably, the Parliamentary Secretary should keep that matter in mind so that disappointment and disillusionment will not be created in regard to the operation of this provision when the Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>I endorse on behalf of the local authorities and the people of my county the plea of Deputy O'Sullivan that this out-of-date computation of the grant payable to mental hospitals should have the Parliamentary Secretary's attention and be dealt with before the Bill is finally passed.  While I always have had, and still have, reservations and considerable doubt as to the wisdom of the plea that has been put forward in many quarters for many years that mental hospitals should be a national charge, I think it would probably bring us very considerable difficulties if that proposal were adopted.  I think, however, that having regard to the long period that has elapsed since this method of calculating the grant was initiated, the time has come for a favourable review of that matter.</P>
    <P>There is one point upon which I would like some information from the Parliamentary Secretary.  There are certain very unpleasant happenings, in my opinion, from the social point of view, that formerly took place with regard to persons of unsound mind who were in mental hospitals.  Occasionally here and there through the country a patient in a mental hospital became violent and did harm to some person in the hospital, either a fellow-patient or somebody in charge of the hospital. We had in the past what I think was a most unpleasant and, in fact, a most unnecessary proceeding, the formal bringing up of such people in courts of law to go through the form of standing trial for that particular happening. One could not say it was an offence, because the person responsible for it was not in possession of his senses, <Col N="1393" /> and the trial was a mere formality.  If that method of investigation into such cases has been dispensed with, I am very glad; if not, I think it ought to be dispensed with.  The fact that persons in that position were already proved beyond yea or nay to be of unsound mind ought to be sufficient, without parading the unfortunate people in a court of law.  It is possible that steps of that kind were inevitable in view of the existing law, but I suggest that method is out of date and, if it has not been already changed, it ought to be.</P>
    <P>There is another thing that has occurred to me in my association with local affairs.  I have seen a number of people discharged from mental hospitals completely cured.  One is very glad to know that that does happen.  I wonder if any attention could be devoted to such people for a certain period, say 12 months after their discharge from the mental hospital?  I feel it would be necessary in many cases.  I suggest that, just as people who are recovering from an attack of tuberculosis have means by which a certain amount of after-care is available for them, it would be a very useful auxiliary to the treatment and the ultimate cure of people afflicted with mental disorders. I have seen people in very poor circumstances&mdash;and there can be no doubt such circumstances very often have a great deal to do with mental disorders&mdash;following their discharge, and I felt there ought to be some provision by which there could be a following-up examination from the point of view of their circumstances and a building-up of their general health.  That procedure would be very advisable.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that there are certain districts where there is a very high incidence of mental disorders&mdash;certain parts of the country yielding a vastly higher proportion of cases than others. It may be due to heredity or other causes, but these are matters that I do not wish to discuss now.  However, there does seem to be a very large number of admissions to mental hospitals of young people almost on the threshold of their lives and it <Col N="1394" /> appears to me that any money spent in securing for such people good health and the full possession of their senses would be very well spent.  I feel that the Parliamentary Secretary and his advisers, knowing more of the facts of such cases than I do, will devote all the attention they can to that particular aspect of our problem.</P>
    <P>I feel sure the Parliamentary Secretary is aware of the fact that the incidence of mental disease may, to a large extent, thank God, in view of the up-to-date treatment and the developments we may expect in the future, be reduced, very considerably. There is one thing he will not need to be convinced of and that is that prevention is very much better than cure.  Mental disorders must, inevitably, have their roots in economic conditions and as long as there is a good deal of destitution and fear in the minds of the heads of many households as to what the future has in store for them, there must always be a strain on such people that very often becomes unbearable and results in additions to the numbers afflicted with mental trouble.</P>
    <P>I feel sure that this measure, good in itself, will do a great deal more good if it is followed by other measures of social reform for the purpose of rooting out the economic evils that contribute very largely to the incidence of mental disease.  I welcome this measure as a progressive step in that direction and I hope I may have the opportunity before the new year becomes very old of expressing a further word of congratulation to the Parliamentary Secretary on the advent in this House of other proposals along the same progressive road.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I must congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on the introduction of this progressive measure. He has brought in no half-measure to remedy the problem that has confronted us for such a long time.  It could be said that our legislation with regard to mental treatment lagged behind the legislation of many other countries in the world, but I believe that this measure when it becomes law will put us in the forefront in the <Col N="1395" /> treatment of mental disorders.  There is no doubt that it is recognised in the medical profession as a revolutionary step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>The question of the mental hospital board was dealt with pretty fully in the Local Government Act or the County Management Act in 1939 or 1940.  As Deputy Murphy pointed out, the board of the single mental hospital has no function whatever and it is not proposed to change that in this Bill; at least, I see no change giving them any more functions than they have.  I suggest that this is an opportune time to make an alteration in the County Management Act or the Local Government Act of 1939 or 1940.  I do not suggest giving them control over the staff, but rather something to interest them in the work of the committee. Their functions and duties are so few at present that the members are not interested in attending the meetings. For some extraordinary reason, the joint boards have wider powers and functions and I suggest that the mental hospital boards be given the same powers, which is the least they might expect.  If the Parliamentary Secretary cannot go as far as that, I suggest that he at least give them control over the finances of the mental hospital so that, like the county council, they can decide the estimate.</P>

      <P>If they are getting them in the Bill, I am glad to know that there is some improvement, and to know they will have control over the <Col N="1396" /> finances in future.  That is a step in the right direction.  This means that once a year, at any rate, when they decide the estimate, the members will have at least one interesting meeting of the committee.  They should be given other functions in addition.  I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary should provide a medium through this Bill whereby these committees could function effectively, so that they would be kept interested in the work of the mental hospital, without in any way impairing the powers of the county manager.  Otherwise, the Bill is a good one and will meet with the full approval of all members of the House.</P>
      <P>The staffs are being provided for and their conditions are being improved. It will give general satisfaction that the widows and dependents of the officials of mental hospitals are being provided for.  That was a very big grievance in the past.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to make that provision retrospective over a number of years.  I have in mind some widows who were very badly hit as a result of the loss of their husbands while on duty.  They were young men with 15 to 20 years' service who left large families totally unprovided for.  They got the small amount the husband had put into the funds, though in one case even that small amount could not be paid to the widow, for some reason or other.  There are a number of cases in every mental hospital district, where husbands have died in the service for the past ten or 12 years, and I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary make the provision retrospective.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might reply first to the point made by Deputy Alfred Byrne, inasmuch as it is one of the few points which has no relation to the Bill.  The Bill does not make any provision for mental defectives.  I do not know if the Deputy was here during my Second Reading statement, when I drew a distinction between mental defect and mental disease.  The Bill is intended to deal with the problem of mental disease, mental disorder, mental ailment, the various disturbances of mind of people who at one time possessed their normal faculties and subsequently became ailing in mind.  In the case of the mental defective, it is a hereditary condition and the unfortunate people afflicted have never been in possession of their full mental faculties.  That is another problem and, in fact, is more an educational problem than one of mental treatment.  Beyond trying to develop their limited faculties, so as to make life somewhat easier for them, the prospect of cure in the case of the mentally defective is almost negligible, so it is merely a matter of education rather than of mental treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been pleasant to listen to <Col N="1398" /> Deputies of various Parties paying tribute to me and to my advisers and assistants in the Department, on the introduction of what has been very properly described as a revolutionary measure in our approach to the whole problem of mental disease.  I appreciate all that.  I realise how difficult it sometimes is for people to rise above political affiliations and give credit to their political opponents where credit is due.  That has been rather generously done in relation to this Bill and I appreciate it.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies spoke about our having lagged behind neighbouring countries.  That is so: we certainly have lagged behind neighbouring countries, but one could reply, if one were so inclined, that if the neighbouring countries had not interfered so much in the affairs of this country, perhaps we might not have lagged behind so far in this matter, as in many other social matters.  While we have been considerably behind the most recent legislation in neighbouring countries in dealing with the treatment of mental disease, it is true to say that, when this Bill comes to operate, we shall have substantially passed them out.  I think it is no exaggeration to say that the mental treatment code before the House is the most advanced and, though I say it, the most enlightened code in any country in Europe.  That is a very big thing to say, but I think it is true; and those who have an opportunity of discussing this Bill with medical experts outside the House will, I think, find general agreement with that interpretation of it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Roddy mentioned the matter of better segregation.  I presume he has personal experience of these institutions, as he comes from a constituency where there is a mental hospital. While we have not, in fact, the degree of segregation we should like to have and which this Bill aims at securing, I rather think the Deputy conveyed the misleading impression to the House&mdash;I am quite sure he did not mean to do so&mdash;that, for all practical purposes, we have no segregation at all.  Of course that is not so.  The Bill <Col N="1399" /> gives us power to provide different institutions for different classes of mentally afflicted people and, if the local authority fails to make such provision, the Minister is armed with the necessary power to enforce his authority and to prescribe the institutions which are to be provided.  Deputy Roddy also complained about the appearance of these institutions.  I do not deny that they are not very inviting.  It has to be borne in mind that, by reason of the type of patient that these institutions have to deal with and accommodate, they have to follow a certain type of architecture.  In that way, while they might be brightened up perhaps considerably, still they cannot be made as inviting as institutions for the treatment of physical disease.  These institutions are provided particularly for such disordered patients as may require restraint or may be dangerous to themselves or others.  I am sure Deputy Roddy appreciates that as well as I do.  If we were able to bring about a further segregation of the less dangerous patients, the temporary patients and the chronic patients, they probably could be accommodated in more attractive surroundings, if we had the necessary finance to provide the more attractive surroundings.</P>
    <P>There was a good deal said by various Deputies on the question of the compulsory acquisition of land by mental hospital authorities.  Deputy Roddy and Deputy Hughes and a number of other Deputies seemed to feel strongly that mental hospital authorities should not be given power for the compulsory acquisition of land, particularly for farm purposes.  That attitude of mind represents the layman's outlook in relation to this particular problem.  In fact, land, particularly for farm purposes, is as necessary a part of a mental institution as the building itself.  The farm is used, of course, for therapeutic purposes. These people's minds and bodies are occupied in the cultivation of the land which also serves the useful purpose of providing the food requirements of the institution.  Apart from that aspect of it, it is not a new position even in relation to mental <Col N="1400" /> hospitals.  Right down the ages we have had compulsory acquisition powers vested in the county councils. They may not have been exercised to any great extent, but the fact remains that they were there.  Similarly, we have compulsory powers of acquisition in relation to housing, and, under the public assistance code, in relation to hospitals and similar institutions.  So that it is not by any means an innovation, and more particularly, in relation to mental hospitals than to any other institution, is it necessary to have the powers of compulsory acquisition.</P>
    <P>A suggestion has been made that we should take power in the Bill, if we are going to adhere to this power of compulsory acquisition, as we are, to acquire land for the purpose of exchange.  I do not propose introducing any amendment to meet that point of view.  It would be a very difficult type of compensation to operate.  If we found it necessary&mdash;let us take a hypothetical case&mdash;to acquire a farm of land convenient to a mental hospital and we were under a statutory obligation to provide alternative land for the owner of that farm, I do not know how we would satisfy him that the land that we proposed to offer him was, acre for acre, as valuable as the land that we had taken from him.  In fact, it would never be as valuable in his eyes, even if you were to give him two or three acres for every acre that you took from him.  Apart from that, if you were to follow that suggestion to its logical conclusion you would have compulsorily to acquire land in order to give land for the land that you compulsorily acquired.  On a full examination of the matter I do not think that much criticism can be found with the proposal in the Bill.  We are driven back to the policy of compensation by way of money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be fixed by arbitration under the law.  Deputy Hughes, in the course of his welcome to the Bill, described this as the first effort of the Fianna Fáil Government to codify our social legislation.  Other Deputies seemed to be equally forgetful. <Col N="1401" /> I think that one of the most comprehensive codifying Bills, indeed one of the most revolutionary Bills, from the point of view of historic background anyhow, that passed through this House was the Public Assistance Act of 1939, which I also had the honour of piloting through the House, under which we got rid of all that pauper law that was as old, as out of date and as unsuited to the conditions existing in this country, and as incompatible with the dignity of our people, as the mental code that we are now proposing to replace by this Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hughes also mentioned the question of some protection for the medical profession in relation to certification. I do not propose to delay the House in dealing with that.  The Deputy will find the protection set out in Section 248 of the Bill.  In the new setting, and under the new system of admissions to mental hospitals, dispensary medical officers will, in the first instance, merely recommend a patient for admission.  The patient is not admitted, and the reception is not completed, until the expert in mental diseases, namely, the R.M.S. or his deputy, examines the patient and decides whether, in fact, the patient should be received.  So that, so far as the protection of the patient is concerned, and indeed the protection of the medical certifiers, the position is much better safeguarded than it had been before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Deputies, from virtually all sides of the House&mdash;and, surprisingly enough to me, some of the Labour Deputies&mdash;advocated the transference of the cost of mental treatment and of the provision of mental institutions to central funds.  A good deal of criticism has been levelled at the line of policy under which the 4/- per head voted by Parliament in 1874 still remains the capitation grant.  I could say a good deal on the social policy represented by that line of thought but I do not propose to go into any great detail now.  There are just a few points I should like to make.  This grant was paid for the purpose of inducing the local authorities to take the mentally afflicted out of the workhouses and the jails.  As I pointed out to the House <Col N="1402" /> in my Second Reading statement, under the laws of more than 100 years ago, which we are repealing in this Bill, people mentally afflicted were arrested, charged before a justice of the peace and put into jail.  The next advance was to put them into houses of industry or into workhouses.  The further advance was the payment of this 4/- per head to induce local authorities to provide special accommodation for them outside the workhouses. Until comparatively recently, the huge grants in relief of rates now being paid out of central funds were not being made available to local authorities.  In fact, in 1891, about £250,000 was the amount of the entire grant in relief of rates from central funds.  In the year 1941-42, the total amount paid in relief of rates in one way or another was £4,807,294 10s.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is forgetting the difference in the rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will make his case fairly completely and fairly convincingly because he has a strong case.  Deputy Roddy, Deputy Hughes and other Deputies say that the charge should be transferred to central funds, that the State should pay for everything.  Even last night, it was urged that the £20,000 which was being made available for the provision of free, or cheap, footwear in addition to the £170,000 already provided for assistance in kind, was not enough.  It is never enough.  The Minister for Finance had another motion before the House to-day and he was told that he was not making sufficient provision from central funds.  In my judgment&mdash;and I am surprised that members of the Labour Party do not take this line, from a purely social point of view&mdash;a system of taxation based upon valuation of the property a man actually holds is much more equitable than the central system of taxation.  If we were to raise this sum of £1,500,000 or £1,250,000, necessary for the maintenance of mental institutions, by way of central taxation, and if we were to impose taxation upon some of the necessaries of life, is it not <Col N="1403" /> as clear as noon that the poor would pay a greater proportion of that tax than if it were raised by way of local taxation under which a man pays according to the valuation of his property? I cannot understand why there is not clearer thinking on this subject, even on the part of members of the Farmers' Party.  They are not all enthusiastic about the policy of derating advocated by other Parties. Any representative of the small farmers who has thought out the economic consequences of derating would agree that he did not want it, because, so far as the small man is concerned, derating would be no boon; it would give the maximum relief to the man with the high valuation.</P>

      <P>We have been here a long time and it looks as if we will be here longer, notwithstanding the things we dropped.  Deputy Cogan advocated the substitution of the term &ldquo;nervous disease&rdquo; for &ldquo;mental disease&rdquo;.  I do not want to be critical but I do not think that there is much in that point. It is not so much what the diseases are called that counts as the provision for treatment and the general approach to the problem.  What we require very badly is a more intelligent understanding of these problems.  If we could get the people to realise that no greater stigma attaches to disease of the mind than to disease of the body, we should be advancing along the right lines but I do not think it would help to use the term &ldquo;nervous disease&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;mental disease&rdquo;.  In fact, there is nothing objectionable in the term &ldquo;lunacy&rdquo;.  It is what the term has come to denote in the public mind that gives rise to objection.  In fact, the word is derived from an ancient belief that mental disease was associated with changes in the moon, so that the term itself is comparatively harmless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell spoke about the supervision of persons boarded-out. The Bill is very comprehensive and it is a big task to read it, so I do not blame the Deputy for the slips he made.  If the Deputy is particularly interested in the provisions for boarding-out and the selection of persons with whom patients will be boarded-out, he should refer to Section 201.  I do not think that any possible consideration is left out in that section.  If there is any omission I shall be glad to hear from Deputy Dockrell at a later stage.  Deputy Dockrell also spoke about the &ldquo;new departure&rdquo; set out in Section 219&mdash;the liability of a child to maintain its parents, the liability of an illegitimate child to maintain its mother, and so forth.  So far from that provision of the law being new, it is just 106 years old, has remained in our code, and has <Col N="1405" /> been operative all the time since.  It has been recently re-enacted by this House, under the Public Assistance Act, and, accordingly, I think that if Deputy Dockrell will refer to these other enactments he will be satisfied that there is not anything new about it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Seán McCarthy would like to see the two-thirds pension rate either restored or, at any rate, preserved for the present staffs who had been contributing over a long period and who looked forward, on retiring, to two-thirds of their salary and emoluments as pension.  The Deputy, on a closer perusal of the Bill, will find that existing members of mental hospital staffs can accept the terms provided under the 1909 Act or the terms provided under this Bill. He will find that they need not accept the terms provided under this Bill, but I rather think that, when they get time to examine the superannuation provisions provided for in this Bill, they will agree that the provisions in the Bill are much better. At least, I shall be very much surprised if they do not accept the provisions of this Bill in preference to what was provided in the Act of 1909, because, in many respects, this is a substantial advance on the provisions of the 1909 Act.  Of course, there is the big difference that, if we are to give a lump sum on retirement, naturally, the pension accompanying that lump sum must be proportionately less.  This, in fact, is based on the Prison Officers' Superannuation Code, and I think it is designed to meet, in a rather generous way, the case of staffs of mental institutions, in full recognition of the fact that the staffs of such mental institutions have a very difficult life and are following a very depressing occupation.  I am fully aware of that fact, and I can say that the Government are also fully aware of it.  That is the reason why they agreed to embody in this Bill the superannuation provisions that are provided for here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy, of Cork, mentioned the question of an improvement in the conditions of service.  I think the <Col N="1406" /> Deputy was referring to the salaries and emoluments of the employees of mental hospitals.  Of course, the Bill does deal with the question of salaries and emoluments of employees, but for a considerable time past I have been negotiating with representatives of the staffs, in the hope that we might get an acceptable, uniform scale.  So far, we have not reached agreement, but the position is not unpromising.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy also mentioned the desirability of providing more up-to-date methods of treatment for mental patients.  Well, the Deputy speaks as a layman, and I am sure that he did not intend to criticise the professional competence of our medical specialists in this country, particularly in relation to the treatment of mental diseases.  I think that our medical men, and particularly those specialists who have to deal with the mentally afflicted, are as well equipped as such specialists in neighbouring countries.  In fact, I might say that they are probably better equipped than the specialists in other countries.  If more money is being devoted in other countries to research in that direction, then that is all to the good, and if in any other country new discoveries should be made in the diagnosis and the treatment of mental disease, then I am sure that our alert specialists in this country will avail themselves of such research work and, very shortly, will give the benefit of such treatment to our patients here.</P>
    <P>I might point out that, in fact, the treatment of mental disease has advanced much more rapidly in recent years than the treatment of some other ailments.  Statistics prove that there has been a downward trend in the case of mental diseases, and that is the best evidence of the services given to such patients by our medical experts. I think it was Deputy Murphy, also, who mentioned the case of the aftercare of mental patients.  The Deputy will also find that that is dealt with in Section 212 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I think, Sir, that I have dealt with most of the questions raised in the course of the debate, and I hope that Deputies will take the opportunity, <Col N="1407" /> between now and the next stage of the Bill, of giving a close examination to its provisions.  I admit that this is a very comprehensive Bill.  In fact, it is almost frightening for anybody to attempt to wade through the sections and examine every feature of it.  One would need to be very enthusiastic to do so, but, at any rate, Deputies will have time between this and the next stage of the Bill to consider its proposals and submit amendments that may improve it, and I can assure Deputies that if they put forward any amendments that would be an improvement in the Bill, or calculated to improve it, I shall be only too glad to welcome such suggestions.</P>

      <P>I understand, Sir, that as a result of your ruling yesterday, we are prohibited from making any reference to the prerogative of mercy or the question of clemency by the President in the case of Charles Kerins, and I do not propose to mention any matters which are precluded by your ruling from being mentioned.  Deputy Larkin yesterday gave notice that he wanted to raise certain matters connected with the public appeal for clemency being extended in the case of Charles Kerins, sentenced to death by the Military Tribunal, and the two points that we sought to raise, through Deputy Larkin, were the questions of interference by the Gárda authorities with the Constitutional rights of citizens to hold a meeting, and the gross abuse of his powers by the Press Censor in the suppression of any reference to the exercise of the ordinary Constitutional rights of the citizens of this country.  It seems to me that both these matters are so interwoven that it is necessary to present them in a rather interwoven manner.  In reciting the facts for the information of the House, I should like to narrate a chapter of incidents which, I think, will convince any fair-minded man or woman that there has been a gross abuse of executive power during the past ten days and that that abuse of power has taken the form of trampling upon the Constitutional rights of citizens as enshrined in our Constitution.</P>
      <P>The first instance to which I must advert is one which took place on Tuesday, the 21st November.  On that date a telegram was sent to the chairman of the Kerry County Council, the chairman of the Tralee Urban Council, the chairman of the Listowel Urban Council and the chairman of the Killarney Urban Council.  The telegram was in this form:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;From a meeting of Kerrymen resident in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1409" /> Meeting of Kerrymen and women resident in Dublin fearing grave miscarriage of justice urges you spare no effort save the life Charles Kerins condemned to die.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The telegram was signed by 15 persons. Among the 15 persons who were signatories were Deputy Cormac Breathnach and Senator Donnchadh O hEaluighthe, two members of the Government Party, who apparently saw nothing wrong in sending that telegram to the four local authorities concerned, who saw in it not only no abuse or no infraction of the law but not the slightest impairment to the political fortunes of the Party of which they were members. These telegrams were accepted by the Post Office authorities.  They were duly paid for but the telegrams were not delivered.  Can anybody in this House imagine that the foundations of this State were in any way threatened or that the liberties of our people were placed in jeopardy by the sending of that telegram which had the approbation of members of the Government Party?  The Kerry County Council was promoting this petition campaign and in furtherance of the campaign it was decided to hold a public meeting in Dublin on the 27th November. Located far from the scene of the main activities for a reprieve the Kerry County Council requested the local reprieve committee to arrange for a meeting and to collect signatures.  The local committee duly endeavoured to discharge the task assigned to them. In pursuance of the effort to arrange a meeting here in Dublin, an advertisement in the following terms was offered to all the Dublin morning papers and the <i>Evening Herald:</i>&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Kerins Reprieve.  Kerry County Council asks citizens of Dublin to attend a public meeting in the Mansion House on Monday, 27th November, at 7.30 p.m. to join them in an appeal for a reprieve of the death sentence on Charles Kerins.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, it is worthy of note here that the Attorney-General's certificate for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court had been refused when that advertisement was tendered to the papers and the refusal to grant the certificate to appeal had actually been announced. <Col N="1410" /> When this advertisement was tendered, therefore, it was tendered with the full knowledge that there was no other legal process open to the Reprieve Committee, whether it was the local Reprieve Committee or the Kerry County Council, and there was no further appeal open to the legal advisers of the condemned man.</P>
    <P>Another incident took place on the 24th November.  On that date an advertisement was tendered to all the papers except the <i>Evening Herald.</i>  It was in these simple terms:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Kerins Reprieve.  Reprieve signature forms can be obtained at the Mansion House.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That advertisement, handed to the papers mentioned, was apparently submitted by the papers and was stopped by the Censor.  Can anybody here again imagine an advertisement in such simple terms causing any great perturbation in the mind of citizens or in the minds of the Executive Council, or being in any way calculated to impair the foundations of this State?</P>
    <P>We had another incident of censorship, perhaps the most insolent incident of all.  On the 22nd November a meeting of the committee of the Kerrymen's Association in Dublin tendered an advertisement to the papers in the following terms:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A meeting of all Kerrymen and women resident in Dublin will be held in Clery's, O'Connell Street, on to-morrow, Thursday, at 7.30 p.m.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was no mention of Kerins' name.  There was no mention of an execution, there was not even mention of a reprieve or an appeal for clemency, and yet a simple advertisement of that kind, announcing a meeting of Kerrymen resident in Dublin in Clery's Restaurant, was something which apparently called for the exercise of the wide and despotic censorship powers which are wielded by the Minister responsible for censorship.</P>
    <P>The committee which had been promoting the efforts to secure a reprieve for Kerins decided that as they could not secure publicity in the form of <Col N="1411" /> advertisement in the papers, they had perforce to rely on an exhibition of posters and the distribution of handbills as a means of calling public attention to their efforts to secure clemency for the condemned man. They then took the step of ordering posters.  So convinced were they that the posters were in accordance with the exercise of their Constitutional rights that a large number of these posters were given to ordinary professional billposters and accepted by them for exhibition on the ordinary public hoardings.  A number of the posters were exhibited by members of the Reprieve Committee and sympathisers with the objects of the committee.  These professional billposters, members of the Reprieve Committee and sympathisers endeavoured to have these posters exhibited, but when they did so they were pounced upon by the police, who, in flagrant violation of what should be their normal duty of protecting citizens, proceeded to take the posters, the property of the committee, from these citizens who were exhibiting them.  Not satisfied with doing that, between Friday, 24th November, and Monday, 27th November, 21 persons were arrested and lodged in the Bridewell. Not a single charge was preferred against any one of the 21 people.  They were subjected to the indignity of being lodged and detained in the Bridewell, no charge being preferred against them, and they were compelled to submit to having their fingerprints and photographs taken, even though they were innocent citizens discharging a duty which they believed they had a right to discharge under the Constitution of this country. Posters found on those people were confiscated.  The police acted as if the posters and handbills were of a kind calculated to undermine the foundations of the State.  One of the handbills was in these terms:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Citizens of Dublin, the Kerry County Council asks you to attend a public meeting in the Mansion House on Monday, 27th November, at 7.30 p.m. to appeal for a remission <Col N="1412" /> of the death sentence on Charles Kerins.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was no inflammatory language, no incitement, no derogatory reference to the Military Tribunal, to the Fianna Fáil Party or to the Government&mdash;merely a simple invitation by the Kerry County Council to citizens of Dublin to attend a meeting in the Mansion House on 27th November to appeal for the remission of the death sentence on Charles Kerins.  Nobody could say that that was an inflammatory leaflet.  Nobody could say that there was any danger to the State by the distribution of a document of that kind.</P>
    <P>Further evidence of the police arrogance in this whole matter was given on 25th November, when a woman who was collecting signatures for a reprieve petition in O'Connell Street was arrested by the police and charged with obstruction.  The police apparently were not satisfied and the Censor apparently was not satisfied with all this depredation on the Constitutional rights of citizens.  They thought there was still room for more brusqueness and for more unwarranted interference with the citizens' rights, because, in addition to the activities to which I have just adverted, the police toured the city tearing down posters, confiscating posters and handbills, and visiting shopkeepers for the purpose of threatening them with consequences if they dared to exhibit posters on their private property.</P>
    <P>The committee then realised that it was apparently impossible to get publicity by means of advertisement; that it was impossible to get publicity by means of posters, and that handbills were no use because they too were being confiscated by the police.  They decided then that the only method of publicity left to them was to endeavour to get a loud speaker outfit.  This they secured and mounted on a cab, with the object of telling the citizens that forms for signature by those who wanted a reprieve for Kerins could be got at the Mansion House and could be signed there.  No sooner had the loud speaker been mounted on the cab than a uniformed police sergeant said to the cabman: &ldquo;If you use that <Col N="1413" /> cab for the purpose of conveying this apparatus around the city, your licence will be taken from you.&rdquo;  Of course the Minister for Justice knows that that was an impudent arrogation of power by the uniformed police sergeant. It is not the function of the police or of the Minister for Justice to take a licence from a cabman.  A cabman's licence and the revocation of it is a matter for the courts.  It was suggested to the police sergeant on the occasion that, if the cabman had committed any offence, he ought to be charged with the offence there and then; that he ought to be brought before a district justice, and that the district justice should be allowed to deal with the matter, since only a district justice can revoke a cabman's licence and the police officer had no power to do so.  The police sergeant, apparently realising then that he had no such power, declined to prefer any charge against the cabman, but he nevertheless succeeded in coercing the cabman into declining to fulfil the arrangement which he had made with the reprieve committee to take the loud speaker apparatus through the city.  However, on the following day, the committee secured another cab. They mounted the apparatus on the second cab, whereupon a police sergeant appeared and said: &ldquo;I have instructions from my authorities to prevent you from taking that apparatus around the city for the purpose contemplated by the reprieve committee.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, we have another instance of the suppression of free speech, another instance of the use of the powers of censorship to suppress information and news which are apparently unpalatable to the political palate of the Minister in charge of censorship.  A meeting was held in the Mansion House on 27th November.  The speakers included the Lord Mayor of Dublin and the Lord Mayor of Cork.  They included Deputy F. Crowley of the Fianna Fáil Party. They included a number of other Deputies of this House, and a number of prominent members of local authorities throughout the country.  There were on the platform representatives of various local authorities, and various public citizens of standing, and <Col N="1414" /> at that meeting the following resolution was passed:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That this meeting, summoned by the Kerry County Council and representing citizens of all Irish counties, urges the Government to advise the President to commute the sentence of death passed on Charles Kerins by the Special Criminal Court.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Present at the meeting, which comprised several thousand citizens, there were representatives of the Dublin daily papers and of the <i>Cork Examiner.</i>  A meeting of that kind is probably unique in the history of public meetings in Dublin, inasmuch as there was assembled there a set of citizens that it would be extremely difficult to get together on any single platform, and, if they met on this occasion&mdash;representative of practically all Parties in this House, representative of different shades of political opinion throughout the country, representative of the different strata of our life in this country&mdash;it was only because, in the exercise of human feelings, they desired the life of Charles Kerins spared. Not a single word relating to that meeting, neither a report of the meeting itself nor of the speeches made nor of the resolution which was passed, was permitted to appear in the Press, because, of course, the Censor was annoyed, and when the Censor is annoyed the people's liberties must give way in order to appease him.</P>
    <P>Now, we come to another instance of suppression.  Deputy Larkin, Junior, who was named in this House yesterday, and who is consequently prevented from being here to-day, tendered to the <i>Evening Mail</i> on the 28th November an advertisement in the following terms:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In accordance with the provisions of Clause 5, Article 15 of the Constitution, a petition is being made to the Executive Council requesting them to advise the President of Ireland to commute the sentence of death passed on Charles Kerins.  The grounds on which the petition is based are that the procedure at his trial before the Special Criminal Court was of such a nature, especially in respect to the presentation <Col N="1415" /> of evidence, together with the accused's lack of legal knowledge and refusal to accept legal aid, as to give rise to a strong reasonable doubt in the minds of many citizens that the guilt of Charles Kerins was fully proven, and, therefore, that a grave miscarriage of justice might take place should the sentence of death be carried out.  Petition forms are available which may be signed by any citizen who desires to support the plea for clemency and as a Dáil representative for Dublin City, South, I earnestly urge all my constituents to sign the petition, which may be done at Thomas Ashe Hall, 5a College Street, Dublin.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That advertisement was tendered to the Press but on the following day Deputy Larkin was notified by the Press that the advertisement had been stopped by the Censor and that it could not appear.</P>
    <P>I have adverted already to the fact that over a week-end recently 21 persons, exercising their right to exhibit literature of a kind which did not transgress the laws of the country, were arrested by the police and incarcerated in the Bridewell.  On last Friday and Saturday these prisoners. demanded to see a priest and to be afforded facilities to attend Mass on Sunday.  Their request to see a priest on Friday and Saturday and for facilities to attend Mass on Sunday was refused by the authorities responsible for having these men there.</P>
    <P>Now we come to last night.  I am reliably informed, and I have taken trouble to check this statement which has been made to me by a number of persons who were present and who have no association whatever with the political beliefs of the late Charles Kerins or with any of his friends, that at about 9.30 last night there were people on the opposite side of the road at Mountjoy Jail kneeling down saying the Rosary in Irish.  There was no disturbance or excitement of any kind. Uniformed police patrolled but they did not interfere with the people. However, at the commencement of the last decade of the Rosary, orders, <Col N="1416" /> apparently, were given to the uniformed Guards to clear the crowd, and then they commenced to hustle and bustle people down the North Circular Road.  Some men and women were very roughly handled, without any justification whatever.  Before the interference by the Guards, beyond the recitation of the prayers, there was perfect peace and quiet at the meeting. There was no obstruction of traffic, because the people were kneeling on the footpath and in the side walks.  Later last night a small procession of men and women was proceeding down O'Connell Street.  They knelt on the footpath and on the roadsides to recite the Rosary, when, suddenly, an order was apparently shouted to the police to clear the street, and the method of clearing the street adopted by the police was to use their batons.  Their batons were used to such an extent that some people were injured in the course of the &ldquo;delicate&rdquo; methods adopted by the police.  I understand that some people were taken to hospital as a result of the police interference last night. There was no indication given to the crowd last night that it was intended to have a baton charge by the police. There was no warning given that there would be any such baton charge. There was no indication that any proclamation had been issued by the Government forbidding an assembly at the General Post Office for the recitation of prayers.  Some citizens who felt they had some rights in a matter of this kind in their own city, in their own country, approached the police for particulars.  They were referred to a police officer in plain clothes, but the police officer in plain clothes ordered all the inquirers to be cleared away and refused to answer questions which were civilly put to him by responsible citizens.  In fact, I am assured that citizens who were walking in O'Connell Street were molested and challenged offensively and addressed in a rough and brusque manner by members of the police force who are under the control of the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>I want to underline this point and to call the attention of the Dáil to this fact: In all the official literature which <Col N="1417" /> has been issued by this reprieve committee, whether the Kerry County Council or the local reprieve committee, there was no reference whatever to the trial of Kerins by the Military Tribunal; there was no reference whatever of any kind to the personnel of the court; there was no reference whatever to the conduct of the trial; and there was no reference to the verdict as recorded against Kerins by the tribunal which tried him.  The whole basis upon which this petition rested was the procedure adopted by the State prosecutor, and there is nothing in our legislation and nothing in our Constitution which prevents a law-abiding citizen petitioning for the reprieve of a man if, on reading the public Press which is available to all citizens, he feels convinced that the man did not get a fair trial.</P>

      <P>The whole basis of this petition did not rest at all on the trial by the Military Tribunal.  The literature issued in connection with this matter made no reference to the Tribunal, its personnel or its verdict.  The petition appeal rested on another basis and, if I transgress order, I think I may make my point of view clear by saying that the members of the House are familiar with the basis on which it rested.</P>
      <P>Now, we can stand and survey these incidents.  Is there any fair-minded person in this House who believes that these activities by law-abiding citizens, against not one of whom a single charge has been preferred, were in any way an impairment of the right which the State has to expect these people to conform to the laws of the country? These men and women exercised their Constitutional right to plead for clemency.  The right of citizens to plead for clemency in the case of a sentenced prisoner is as old as liberty itself.  The men and women who were associated with this petition simply pleaded for clemency for a man who was under sentence of death and adverted to certain circumstances to show why, in their opinion, clemency should be exercised in the present case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have seen appeals for clemency hawked around this city and country in cases of the most revolting character. I have seen appeals for clemency hawked around in some of the filthiest sex cases.  I have seen people prepared to make a plea for those engaged <Col N="1419" /> in practices which threaten the whole of human existence.  Filthy sex cases and abortion cases can apparently get people to plead for the offenders, and they are completely free from the Guards' surveillance, but when people exercised their right to plead for clemency for a man under sentence of death, the whole weight of the Government machine was brought to bear upon them, and every effort was made to circumvent their activities.  It is well to stress the fact that the plea for clemency was only made by these people when it was not possible for them to utilise any other legal protocol.  When all legal machinery had been completely exhausted, they then appealed to the Government to spare the man's life. That was the only course left to them. Is there anything unconstitutional in citizens saying: &ldquo;Spare that man's life,&rdquo; and submitting reasons, if necessary, why it should be spared?  Because they were doing that their activities were impeded by the forces at the disposal of the State.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Government and to Ministers responsible that in matters of this kind citizens have rights, but these rights were rudely and roughly trampled upon by the forces at the command of the State within the past ten days.  I want to know, if they are going to justify the action of these forces, what purpose it was sought to serve by this unwarranted interference with ordinary citizens in the exercise of their Constitutional rights. I say that nothing whatever could justify methods of that kind, because these are the methods of coercion and tyranny.  It may be, of course, that these forces acted on their own initiative.  It may be that these forces saw a situation in which they felt that they were entitled to do what they did. But it may not be that.  It may be that these forces, and those exercising the powers of censorship, were acting under Ministerial instructions.  Were those people who were responsible for suppressing the activities of this committee, and for suppressing the news and the advertisements in the newspapers, acting on their own initiative or acting on Ministerial responsibility? <Col N="1420" /> We ought to know from Ministers where they stand in this matter.  Were those concerned acting on Ministerial instructions or was the initiative in their own hands?  Were they acting solely on their own initiative and in accordance with their own desires?  I suggest that their action&mdash;the arrests and suppression&mdash;goes right to the roots of citizens' rights under the Constitution, and that the action of those concerned during the past ten days has been a vicious and unwarranted interference with citizens who are Constitutionally entitled to exercise their rights under the Constitution now in operation.</P>
    <P>I am concerned in this matter because I believe that citizens have rights.  I believe that a citizen is entitled to exercise those rights conditioned by public order and public weal. Public right was not imperilled, and public weal was not imperilled by the activities that were carried on.  It seems to me, from an examination of the whole position, that this was an effort of well-intentioned citizens, with some members of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;and other prominent financial supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash; and citizens generally to secure the exercise of clemency towards the condemned man.  Because I believe the action of those responsible during the past ten days has been a gross abuse of power by the Executive Government, because I believe these are the methods of tyrannical dictators, I protest on behalf of this Party in this House at the methods that have been adopted.  Our citizens have rights and these rights ought not to be the plaything of this or any other Government. If one Government can make the rights of citizens a plaything, something to be trampled upon whenever the Government so desires, then every other Government that follows will find in the precedent so created a justification for a similar or even greater invasion of citizens' rights.  This is still a democratic Parliament; this is still a place where men and women can voice their opinions freely; this is still a place where, at all events, the Censor has no power of censorship, so far as the spoken word is concerned, and it is the duty of this House as a <Col N="1421" /> constitutional Assembly, as a democratic Assembly, to protest against invasion of citizens' rights and to ensure by its protest that citizens' rights are not invaded by those now using the power in an unscrupulous way.</P>

      <P>I am the first to admit that citizens have rights.  It is because of that that we are insisting that no small minority, no handful&mdash;the representatives of whom could not save their deposits in any constituency in Ireland &mdash;who are seeking on an occasion like this to impose their will on the people, to intimidate citizens and to intimidate weak members of this Party as well as members of other Parties, will deprive citizens of their rights.  I am not going to stand up to defend the action of some who were mentioned, who were afraid to stand up to the intimidation that was practised by the particular body that we all know.  This is not the first time that we have had an agitation of this kind.  About two years ago a similar agitation took place over a pending execution.  What was the result?  From one end of Ireland to <Col N="1422" /> the other there was gross intimidation of ordinary citizens; shopkeepers were not allowed to open and, in defiance of the order of these people who, mar eadh, now want to defend the constitutional rights of citizens, those who had the temerity to open their shops had their windows smashed and were assaulted.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton has been living in this country for the past five years and he knows what is happening.  He has the innocence to say that 20 innocent people were arrested.  I would like to know what he knows about the innocence of these people.  I wonder is he aware that 20 had been interned or sentenced for offences against the Offences Against the State Act?  In pursuance of my perhaps foolish policy I released a number of these men against the advice of the Guards, because I thought, having been interned for two years, that might have put a little sense into them, and that I could take a chance and release some of them.  I have a list here.  These are the innocent people that the Guards arrested when exercising their constitutional rights!  Constitutional rights!  They were preventing other people from exercising their constitutional rights.  That is what they were engaged in, going around and intimidating ordinary citizens who were afraid&mdash;naturally and rightly afraid&mdash;to stand up to them.  That is the sort of work they were doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are well known, every one of them.  Six of those arrested were released because the police had no record about them and they took it for granted that they had simply been roped into it; but the 20 who were held include some very well-known people indeed&mdash;very well known to Deputy Larkin and others.  One man in particular who is always there when there is trouble, who is one of the most dangerous agitators in this country, is included amongst those 20.  When Deputy Norton talks about innocent people, he ought to remember that he stood for these measures which were very necessary to enable this State to protect itself against this terrorist organisation which has been trying unsuccessfully <Col N="1423" /> for the last five years to involve this country in war.  When very drastic powers were sought here, he and his Party at the time and every other Party in the House gave us these powers ungrudgingly, and I say they have never been abused.  I do not know what will happen with regard to these 20 people but I certainly am going to change my attitude to some of them.  They have got their chance, and, if the police recommend their continued internment, in they will go again while I have the necessary power.</P>
    <P>What were they doing?  Putting up posters.  Where did they go to put the posters?  They had the indecency to go to the house of the widow of the man they murdered, the murdered sergeant's wife.  They went out to Rathfarnham, and, around the gate of this unfortunate woman's house, they plastered these posters.  Agents of these people persecuted that lady for hours trying to intimidate her into signing this petition.  These were actions which we are not going to tolerate and we are not going to tolerate any attempt by this organisation to rehabilitate itself by using an opportunity like this.</P>
    <P>With regard to the presentation of addresses to the Government, any Deputy who wishes can see the number of petitions which were sent in.  There were enormous numbers of them. They were considered, and considered at length, from every point of view.  I saw one bundle&mdash;they were practically countless&mdash;and I know for a fact that large numbers of the names were simply copied from the register. Some members of this organisation which is trying to impose its will on the country were engaged for a full week copying names from the register. We have piles of them over there, and Deputies can see them, all in the same handwriting.  But what are people's constitutional rights?  Are they not entitled to use their own discretion as to whether they will sign these petitions or not?  What right have these people to stop citizens on the street and intimidate them into signing? <Col N="1424" /> That is what I allege has happened. The police know that it has happened, and, so long as I have any control, I will do all I can to stop it.</P>
    <P>This is a new Dáil, and this matter was not dealt with very fully, or, in fact, at all, since it was constituted. I should like to remind members that, apart from the efforts which this organisation has made to bring trouble on this country, which the vast majority of the citizens have tried to avoid, by involving it in this war, they have consistently set out to murder our police.  Since I took office as Minister for Justice, how many have been murdered?  I have a list of them here, Detective-Sergeant McKeown was murdered; Detective-Guard Hyland was murdered; Guard Roche was murdered; Guard Walsh was murdered; Sergeant O'Brien was murdered; Guard Mordaunt was murdered, Murderous attacks were made on Gárda officers in Holles Street.  Two, Guards Shanahan and McSweeney, were desperately wounded, but, thanks be to God, not mortally.  Guard Brady was wounded, and the gallant man to whom I gave a medal the other day escaped death by an act of Providence. The bullet struck his watch over the abdomen.  That is the sort of thing we have to deal with, and we have been able to convict only one of the group which murdered Sergeant O'Brien.  If I had any apologies to make to the House, it is that we have been unable so far to get the whole of the gang which murdered that unfortunate man on that morning.  That may come in time.</P>
    <P>There has been a new alliance since 1943.  When the election of that year was coming round, it was quite clear that there was a change.  Up to that, there was never any mention in the House of that organisation, because everyone knew the danger and menace it was to the country, but now Deputy Norton, in the innocence of his heart, wants to tell us that they are the people who have been denied the exercise of their constitutional rights.  I know very well the use that organisation has always made of occasions of this kind.  As I say, if these unfortunate <Col N="1425" /> things are to recur, if we are to have murders and executions for those murders, one thing which I will not allow, so long as I am Minister for Justice, is that organisation, which we are determined to crush if we can, to rebuild itself at the expense of the victim who has died for carrying out the orders it gave.  I hope that is plain, and Deputy Norton or any of these other people who are now apparently to be used as the tools of that organisation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

These are the men who have been murdered and wounded.  Other operations of this <Col N="1426" /> organisation we know about&mdash;what they call financial operations&mdash;£10,000 taken from Amiens Street Post Office and something in the neighbourhood of £5,000 taken from Messrs.  Wills on the South Circular Road.  This is the way this organisation finances itself.  We found on them plans for raiding banks. This is an organisation which is not alone going to attack and to murder the one body we have to protect the common citizen, but to destroy the whole commercial life of the country. When they get an opportunity like this, they are in clover, because they see in it a chance of reviving the organisation if they avail of it, and I think the Minister for the Co-Ordination of Defensive Measures was very wise and thoroughly justified in refusing to allow these people to take advantage of this occasion to propagate their organisation, as they did in similar circumstances in the past.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>If anything in the world surprised me, it was the way the Minister for Justice carried on.  He went back over a period of four or five years, talking about some organisation, but I understand the matter before the House concerns two things, one, the conduct of the police towards what is known as the Kerins Reprieve Committee and, number two, the conduct of the Censor, the way the censorship has been used as regards that committee.  Therefore, I think it would be a waste of time for me, or for any man with intelligence, to talk about the £10,000 or the £5,000 taken five or six years ago, because that is not the subject that is before the House, and I am just dealing with the matter before the House and nothing else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may be in the same position as Deputy Norton; I may also be blackened, and it may be said of me: &ldquo;Oh, there is another tool,&rdquo; but I never made a tool of myself all my life, and Fianna Fáil should know that well, nor will I ever allow myself to be used as a tool by any Party or any organisation or any class or section in this country.  When I stand up here to speak I do so because my conscience tells me it is necessary that I should do so, and when I speak on this subject I speak on it because as a citizen, and <Col N="1427" /> as an erected representative of the people, I feel the rights of the citizens of this country have been interfered with in a way that they should not be interfered with.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton gave quite a long list of things that have happened with the object of preventing this reprieve committee from carrying out what they considered their duty.  I should like to know from the Minister for Justice is it illegal that a reprieve committee should be set up in this country and why did he not decently declare that reprieve committee an illegal organisation?  Would it not be more decent to do so than to work underhand, as has been done, in order to prevent those people from getting signatures, in order to prevent them assembling at a meeting, in order to prevent their getting together in a meeting at the Mansion House?  Everything was done to prevent them.  I do not need to go over the list.  Very well and very capably Deputy Norton did so.</P>
    <P>Here is an example of the attitude of the Censor.  A letter dated 28th November was handed to the papers. It said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A Chara,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I would like to ask the people of Ireland, through your columns, to join with me in a triduum of Masses and Holy Communions beginning Wednesday, 29th November, and ending on the 1st December, First Friday, for a very special intention.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&ldquo;Is mise,</P>
    <P Just="Right">&ldquo;MRS. AUSTIN STACK.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is not a word about a reprieve committee there.  Nevertheless, that statement never appeared in any of the papers.  I would like to know the reason why.  On the day that any Government, any people or any individual in Catholic Ireland will rise up to prevent a thing like that happening, all I have to say is God help Ireland.  Our Constitution starts off in the Name of the Most Holy Trinity.</P>
    <P>Surely you must realise that when citizens of this State think a man should be reprieved they are entitled, or should be entitled, to use every legitimate means at their disposal to <Col N="1428" /> have the voice of the people.  Even though they were hampered at a most alarming rate, nevertheless, according to the Minister himself, countless petitions were received.  I heard the number was only 77,000, but according to the Minister there were countless petitioners.  My name was in that list, and it was not off the register it was taken.  I assure the Minister it was not off the register it was taken.</P>
    <P>I am one of those who attended the Mansion House meeting, and the Censor prevented any publicity there also.  I went as a citizen of this State to a meeting presided over by the Lord Mayor of Dublin.  Also present were the Lord Mayor of Cork and Fianna Fáil T.D.s.  I spoke there not as a mob orator, and neither did those who spoke speak to a mob.  We spoke to the honest, honourable citizens of this State irrespective of party, irrespective of politics.  And do not think that I stand up here to bolster any illegal organisation such as the Minister talked about.  I believe that the day of anything other than constitutional methods in this country is finished, but I also believe and remember&mdash;I will fight on this till the day I die and I will oppose it&mdash;that no persons should interfere with the rights of citizens to do anything they think is right in a constitutional way.</P>
    <P>No later than last night I was walking down the city&mdash;and remember, nobody told me this.  An individual was going along the streets, a man of about 35 years of age, singing &ldquo;Easter Week&rdquo;.  I saw him being approached by two detectives.  He was told to shut up.  &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;while I am alive I will sing &lsquo;Easter Week&rsquo;.  &ldquo;Get along,&rdquo; they said, shoving him along the path.  The man continued to sing &ldquo;Easter Week&rdquo;.  He was immediately taken over and shoved into the Bridewell. It is a bad day for Ireland, the day the Irish people are prevented from singing &ldquo;Easter Week&rdquo;.  I do not blame the Gárdaí for what happended. I know that that work was not work they liked, but I know they were instructed and they had to carry out their instructions.  I know it was not their fault; it was something they had to do.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1429" /> The Minister stated that they got the names off the register.  I want to tell him that if the reprieve committee got the opportunity they should have got, unhindered and unhampered as they should have been, they would have the signatures, not of 77,000 but of 2,750,000 of our people who believe that it is only a jury of our own countrymen who should convict any Irishman.  We have heard the story of the terrible 20 &ldquo;convicts&rdquo; who were putting up posters and who are now in prison.  I was told this&mdash;it might be a lie&mdash;that just at the hour of 12.30 on Saturday those people were approached in the presence of their employers, where they were working, so that it could be used against them when they tried to get back to their work again.  That was a nice attempt to injure those people.  They could have waited another half-hour until those people were getting away at 1 o'clock.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot about the new alliance &mdash;that Deputy Norton has joined some new alliance.  I do not know what it is, but in this matter I join with him, anyhow.  The Minister for Justice talked about the election and said that &ldquo;those people&rdquo; did not win a seat. I never heard of the reprieve committee contesting any election.  They were not contesting any election in South Kerry.  A hint was thrown out about weak-minded people who allowed themselves to be intimidated.  I suppose some of those weak-minded people are in this House.  It is not intimidation when a citizen is asked to sign a reprieve form.  It is in that citizen's own free will to do so or not, as he wishes.  I think, in the case of the loud-speaker in the car, that the Guards took this into their own hands. It is my belief that the Guards were driven, and that the Minister was driven, by orders from certain sections of the Gárda.  If a reprieve committee were organised for a Jew in this country&mdash;and it has been done for some people for whom, in my opinion, a reprieve committee should not have been set up&mdash;it would be allowed to carry on, but in this case it was not.</P>
    <P>I want to make it plain that I have no sympathy whatsoever with crime&mdash;absolutely none&mdash;on either <Col N="1430" /> side; but it is my belief that the class of work being carried on is more encouraging crime than preventing it.  There is no use in talking now, but I wish to make it plain that the batoning of people in the streets when they kneel down to pray, and the striking of a woman on the head, breaking her nose so that she is suffering from concussion and in a hospital to-night, will not help, and will not have even any political value.  Things like that are no addition to the Minister or to any political Party.  It is my view that the Gárdaí who did that had to do it, that they were not too willing to do it, but had to carry out their orders.</P>
    <P>No matter what sort these 20 criminals are who have been taken up &mdash;I do not know any of them; I never saw any of them in my life and I suppose I never will&mdash;remember when you denied them the right to hear Mass last Sunday, it did not help them.  I am not any judge of their conscience, nor is the Minister either.</P>
    <P>In this debate, I have not gone over the last five years, as the Minister was allowed to do.  I have stuck to the motion, and I will finally say that these bullying tactics of one crowd against the other will only lead from bad to worse.  In my opinion, the people should try to come together and stand together and should not be dictated to by any officials in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard the case put by Deputy Norton and by the ex-Leader of the Farmers' Party, and if any speeches were calculated to create disorder in this country, those speeches were.  Now, government in this country is a very difficult job and I am very glad to know that the Fianna Fáil Party has come to realise that fact.  It is very dangerous, in times such as these, to add fuel to the flame, but that is what these speeches are doing, There is no doubt that there is an illegal organisation here whose set purpose is to destroy the Government by unconstitutional methods.  The Cosgrave Government had that problem to deal with, too, and dealt with it in a fairly effective <Col N="1431" /> manner.  This Government is doing its best and I applaud it for doing so.  If it is the wish of a certain section of the people to Balkanise the country, they should let us know where we stand.</P>
      <P>I feel it is a weakness that some of the spineless representatives we have in public life are mainly responsible for this vacillating and weak policy which is running through our political life.  I remember an incident which occurred in Cork City in 1943, when I was asked to sign a document and refused.  I said that if it were issued or signed by the head of the State, it would have some weight with me and that possibly I would sign, but it was signed by a number of persons none of whom I knew anything about and whom I described as nonentities. The two gentlemen who waited on me and pressed me to sign told me of various public men who had signed, including the then Lord Mayor of Dublin, but I refused.  On that occasion, the people of Cork as well as the people of Dublin were asked to abstain from work for one hour and they blindly followed the request.  The Minister for Justice said a moment ago that some persons who did not close their shops had their windows broken.  Surely, we are not going to start a condition of that kind in the country?  If we are, let us say so.  If we feel that kind of conduct should not be tolerated, let us open our mouths and say so.  I refused to sign the document and got no threatening letters, but was amazed to find that, at that time, no instruction came from the Fianna Fáil Government which would let the people see that the document had no Government backing.  I felt there was a weakness there in the Government.  On that occasion, the workmen who were asked to give up work for an hour had a jolly time kicking football round the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear a lot about the craze for piety and prayers, and I am wondering at all this piety.  I wonder if we are so religious-minded and so prayerful and so pious as people make out.  I do not want to be impious, but I am rather shocked&mdash;and it is hard to shock me&mdash;when I hear of the Rosaries and prayers said in the streets.  If there were any sincerity in some of those <Col N="1432" /> who called for a reprieve, they would get a Mass said for the poor soul, but there was not.  None of us wants to say anything disrespectful either of prayers or of the Church, but one cannot help remarking that this paroxysm of piety could have found better expression in the way I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, when he took this matter in hand, had a very objectionable job, but it had to be done, if order was to be maintained. If there is any vacillation or weakness in this country, it will become another Balkan State, or portion of one, and it would be as well to hand it over to the gunmen and be done with it.  It is up to the citizens to back this Government, or any other Government, which will stand four-square against any gunmen, so that we may not have another revolution.  For that reason, I applaud the Minister for Justice in his action.  I know it is not a very popular thing to say.  Instead of the Holy Trinity mentioned we might have a quadruple Party.  I feel the Minister is doing his duty in the matter and I congratulate not him personally but the Government.  If there are weak members in the Party, that is their funeral, not ours.  There may be weak members in other Parties, too, but I have this feeling that while we have a head of the State he should be respected, and while we have Ministers of State they should be respected.  We can differ with them and do, and if we want to get them out we can put them out through the agency of the ballot-box which is the essence of freedom and the essence of democracy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not my intention to speak, but in view of Deputy Anthony's speech, I feel it my duty to say something.  He accused Deputy Norton and Deputy Donnellan of being provocateurs, men whose sole purpose in life is to create trouble or be the cause behind the creating of trouble.  Now, while I fully sympathise with the position that the Government find themselves in, while I fully realise the duty which falls upon the Minister for Justice in a country newly established, in a country in which the Party, <Col N="1433" /> of which the Minister for Justice is one, helped to bring about the position in which we find ourselves to-day, and in which we have found ourselves for many years past&mdash;I sympathise with him as far as that goes.  While I do not condone crime in any shape or form, political or otherwise, nevertheless, what I want to understand is this: if I or any other citizen of this country is sentenced to death for theft or robbery, or violence which brings about death, or for political crime, and if, in our examination of that judgment, we believe that the person sentenced to death has been sentenced wrongly, or that he did not get a fair trial, and if a reprieve committee is set up that may be able to bring to the notice of the authorities the dissatisfaction amongst the citizens of the country&mdash;after all, they are the supreme court: there is no appeal beyond the citizens of the country&mdash;it is their duty&mdash;it is the only method left after the court has given its decision&mdash; to appeal to the Executive Council and to the President of this country to extend the hand of clemency to the person condemned.</P>
      <P>Now, what is wrong in Deputy Norton or Deputy Donnellan, or any other Deputy standing up in this House and asking the Government or the responsible Minister, through you, Sir: what was their reason for forbidding the publication of certain advertisements which no honest man, no sensible, honest, law-abiding citizen, could find fault with?  They were not advertisements which would undermine the State, or criticised or belittled the court set up which tried the person whose case has brought about this debate.  They were advertisements which kept within the law, and yet they were not published.  It is for that reason that Deputy Norton and Deputy Donnellan got up to-night.  They wanted information relating to that.  We are not saying that Mr. Kerins was innocent or guilty.  We are not making that suggestion at all.  That is not the point of our argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only people who can say whether he was innocent or guilty are the citizens of this country&mdash;the supreme court.  No individual Deputy or group of Deputies can say so. <Col N="1434" /> What we are to understand from the Minister for Justice is that he wants to make it that we here are trying to claim that he was innocent, that we are condemning the Government for not having him reprieved and let free. We are not here condemning the Government on that ground at all.  We are condemning the responsible Minister for forbidding the publication of certain advertisements relating to this reprieve committee which was set up.</P>
    <P>It is wrong for the Minister for Justice to accuse Deputy Norton, Deputy Donnellan or any other Deputy that we here are associating ourselves with any illegal body in the country for we are not associating ourselves with any illegal body.  I, for one, even at the cost of my life, would not tolerate any body of citizens forcing their ideas by any other method except that which is within the Constitution upon the people or Government of this country.  No Deputy in this House, as far as I know, stands for that line of action.  Yet the Minister for Justice gets up, seeing that he has not a leg to stand on, and knowing that he has not a leg to stand on, and deliberately and intentionally accuses Deputy Norton and I suppose Deputy Donnellan of trying to ally themselves with some illegal body or organisation in order to blacken them before the citizens of this country, in order to destroy the whole case made by them because he himself has no leg to stand on.  I say that is not the line of action, and that is not the reply, that we expected from the Minister for Justice. As I say, we realise that on the Front Bench there are men sitting who have instilled into the minds and hearts of young Irishmen those ideals&mdash;to do the crimes which you accuse them of having committed.  You know that.  How often did we listen to you on public platforms instilling those ideals into our minds if we were so minded as to adopt them and bring them through? Now, when a reprieve committee was set up in order to appeal to the Executive Council and to the President you denied publication of those advertisements.</P>
    <P>I do not pretend to be religious. Deputy Anthony should not throw out <Col N="1435" /> suggestions that we are only hypocrites&mdash;pretending that we are religious. I do not try to read into Deputy Anthony's conscience as to what he may be.  He may be the best Christian in this State to-day.  We all have our weaknesses and faults, but it is not his duty as a citizen or that of any Deputy to try to minimise the importance of certain rituals attached to our religion.  They say it is wise and good that we should pray.  We can pray at home, in the church or on the streets.  It has been the custom ever since the days of Terence McSwiney&mdash; the Lord have mercy on his soul &mdash;that people prayed outside the prison wherein lay the condemned. They prayed outside of Brixton Prison in a foreign land.  His sisters prayed for him there in spite of the British authorities, but to-day under the Republic which you claim you have set up, An Taoiseach de Valera and his C.I.D. men prevented them praying outside Mountjoy, although there was no intention of making a disturbance, of breaking the law but to abide by the law, and not even to stop the traffic.  Our consciences and minds are as strong as the minds and consciences of the men on those benches, and if we were the Government to-morrow and thought that any man had deliberately assassinated a policeman carrying out his duty, and could bring home that belief for certain, we would not hesitate for one moment to send him to the gallows where he should go.  On the other hand, if we were the Government to-morrow and a certain individual was tried in court for the assassination of a certain servant of this State, and if in the eyes of this Government, who might then be in opposition, it was thought that the evidence against him was flimsy, that it was not sufficient to give him the rope, then I say it would be your bounden duty and the bounden duty of every citizen in the land to try to bring home to the authorities that in your conscience in your mind and in your good faith, that man was not guilty.  That is what those who were associated with this reprieve committee tried to do.  I have nothing to do with it.  I am only speaking as an <Col N="1436" /> individual.  But that is what they tried to do, and then we find hysteria across there.  No wonder you are hysterical when you realise that.  May the Lord have mercy on Charles Kerins &mdash;He has now judged him, whether he was guilty or not.</P>
    <P>If the court here failed, the court of Heaven cannot fail.  It will be known there whether he was guilty or not. You are the men who instilled these ideas into the minds of men of his type&mdash;the deeds they are prepared to perpetrate to-day are the result of these ideas.  It is you who should have mercy and clemency more than anybody else.  I had no intention of speaking on this matter.  I had nothing prepared but, listening to the Minister and then to Deputy Anthony, it was sufficient to raise the blood of any honest man who believes in fair play, and, who believes that an Irishman should get a fair trial.  When we read up our history of bygone days and of the Cumann na nGaedheal administration, and think that such a day would dawn under a Fianna Fáil administration, then we cannot forget the reign of Caesar in Rome and the conspiracy that took place there.  Brutus was an exalted citizen and, because he was exalted, the conspirators thought that they could get away with the stabbing of Caesar.  Members of Fianna Fáil think that because of another exalted citizen, high in the opinion of the people&mdash;An Taoiseach&mdash; they can get away with anything they do and that he is the Brutus of to-day as was the case in Rome in bygone times.

      <P>Like the last speaker, I did not intend to speak to-night and would not do so if I did not desire to refute the implication contained in Deputy Anthony's speech.  I am not very much interested in this matter.  I am a complete outsider to most of the matters Deputy Norton has spoken of.  Deputy Norton made certain statements to-night and I hope that whatever Minister replies&mdash;whether it be the Taoiseach or the Minister for <Col N="1437" /> Co-Ordination of Defensive Measures &mdash;will deal with those statements and not evade them.  Once a year, the Government comes to this House and asks it to grant them emergency powers.  Whether his statements be true or false, Deputy Norton has charged certain members of the Government with outstepping those powers.  I should like a very definite answer to that statement from whatever Minister replies.  If Deputy Norton's statements are false, well and good.  If they are true, the powers given to the Government have, in my opinion, been grossly outstepped.  Like the Minister for Justice, Deputy Anthony did not deal with the motion before the House.  He tried in a very nasty and underhand way to link us up &mdash;or to do us some damage, at any rate &mdash;how, I do not know, because I do not profess to understand the workings of Deputy Anthony's mind.  Deputy Donnellan's speech dealt fairly well with the point that the Minister for Justice had not given attention to the statements&mdash;very serious statements, if they were true&mdash;made by Deputy Norton. That was the gist of Deputy Donnellan's speech.  I was sitting beside him the whole time.  He simply asked for a reply from the Government as to whether those statements were true or false.  If Deputy Norton's statements are true, then the Government made wrong use of the emergency powers we, in this House, grant them once a year.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton was as flush with his adjectives to-night as he usually is.  He condemned the Government as tyrannical, dictatorial and coercive and said that the unfortunate man who died this morning did not get a fair trial at our hands.  We know that, two years ago. a police officer who was protecting the rights of the citizens of this State, was murdered; that a man was arraigned on a charge of murder before a court set up under the authority of the Oireachtas; and that the verdict <Col N="1438" /> arrived at by that court, composed of honourable officers who have done their duty in a magnificent way for several years, was confirmed by the normal Court of Criminal Appeal, of three judges, set up by the Oireachtas in the following words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;On a careful review of all the evidence and of the facts and circumstances surrounding the commission of the crime, we are of opinion that the evidence before the Special Criminal Court was amply sufficient in law to justify the verdict.  There is no indication that the court misdirected itself in point of law, nor is there any indication of anything in the nature of a miscarriage of justice. The verdict seems to us to have been arrived at after a careful and patient trial during which every consideration was shown to the appellant.  In the result we are of opinion that none of the grounds&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I uttered a sentence this evening which the Chair, at that time, thought to be a comment by me on the trial, I said I had no intention of commenting on the trial.  I never made a reference to the trial.  Now, the Minister for Co-Ordination is, apparently, being permitted to quote a judgment of a court. I was told this evening that I must not do that, although I had never intended to do it.  I think that there should be equality of treatment for members of the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton uttered only one sentence.  There can be treason in a sentence.  There can be treachery to the people of this country in one sentence, if a man sets out to lead the young people of this country to embark on the wrong road, particularly in view of the present state of the world.  We want the young people of this country to realise that we are not living in a vacuum: that, to-day, unfortunately for the world, chaos and anarchy are overcoming peoples and nations that have been civilised for thousands of years, that have had their own free Governments for hundreds of years, and that if you have not got the reign of law, the only alternative is the reign of anarchy.  We have, in this little country of ours, for a long time now struggled and fought to establish the people's law&mdash;the <i>Res Publica&mdash; Poblacht na hEireann.</i>  We have <Col N="1440" /> established the right of the people of this country to have their own governmental institutions, and as long as this Government has the guidance of the people of this country, the people's law will be enforced against any body of people who try to overthrow the Government established by the votes of the people of this country, and who wish to enforce their own laws on our people.</P>
    <P>As I have said, we are not living in a vacuum.  We want to provide, if we can, in a world threatened with chaos that this nation will be free to proceed in a peaceful, orderly fashion to settle all our differences and to discuss our difficulties&mdash;difficulties which are common to mankind.  Particularly, in this little portion of the world, we want our young people to set themselves to providing means or methods for the improvement of the lives of our people.  But we cannot do that&mdash;we cannot rely upon appeals&mdash; when we are dealing with a set of men who are making war upon the right of our own people to have their own laws constitutionally established and constitutionally enforced.  We swore&mdash;the vast majority of the members of this House, on all sides of the House&mdash;to defend this country against all enemies, foreign and domestic.  It took us a very long time to get rid, even in this portion of the country, of our foreign enemies, and Fianna Fáil, since it came into power, has been doing everything in its power to lead the young men of the country to take part in the affairs of the nation. Fianna Fáil, since its inception, has done all it could to do away with bars of any description to our people taking part in the government of our country.  Behind all these reprieve activities in the City of Dublin and elsewhere&mdash;of which such people as Deputies Norton and Blowick are merely the front, the respectable front &mdash;is a body of people who want to reduce this country to chaos, who want to seize power here and to deny the right of our people to govern themselves in their own way.  Certain people, such as the Lord Mayor of Dublin, the Lord Mayor of Cork, and other people, who have sympathetic hearts, are put forward in such cases <Col N="1441" /> as this, but they are merely the front, behind which there is an organisation of the kind to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>Some of these people do not want us to be free from foreign domination, and others of them would deny the right of our people to have their own Constitution and to rule themselves in their own way, unless these people are to be allowed to do it; and that claim is put forward by a mere handful, which is behind the front provided by certain Deputies and other people with sympathetic hearts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>There were very many decent people engaged in this reprieve appeal, and from a human point of view I think that every man and woman in the country will regret that any young Irishman should have to die, even if it is for the murder of a fellow-Irishman, and it was on that human sympathy that these gentlemen, behind the front, tried to operate.  The phrase they used was: &ldquo;A young Kerryman, 26 years of age, is sentenced to die.&rdquo;  Deputy Norton, to-night, never even once mentioned&mdash;although he referred about a dozen times to the fact that a man was sentenced to die&mdash;the crime for which that man was sentenced to death: a sentence imposed by the Military Court and afterwards confirmed by the normal Court of Criminal Appeal.  Never once did Deputy Norton mention that this young man was tried in full legal fashion and found guilty of the death of Sergeant Denis O'Brien.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have sympathy for any young man who is condemned to die, and those of us who know our national history are the more sympathetic when a young man from that great County of Kerry is condemned to die, but we must not, in our sympathy, forget the issue that is involved here, which is whether a man, young or old, whether from Kerry or any other place, has the right to murder an officer of this State.  If emotion of this sort is to be brought forward, we must remember that this particular officer of the State was an old 1916 <Col N="1442" /> man, that he got no trial, got no time even to say his prayers, and was murdered at his own doorstep within earshot of his wife and children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret, as I am sure we all regret, that either an officer of this State or his murderer should have to die, but if an officer of the State is murdered, I do not think his murderer should be enabled to get away with it because of a respectable front being able to bring pressure, or trying to bring pressure, upon the Government, by operating on ordinary human sympathy.  If that were to be the case, what is there to prevent every other officer of the State being murdered in a similar fashion?  The whole system of democratic government is involved in the question of whether, when an officer of the State is murdered, the State can be intimidated not to carry out the sentence, when the person charged with the murder has been duly tried in legal fashion, found guilty and condemned&mdash; whether the State is to be prevented by riots in the street or civil commotion from carrying out its duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no one, in this House or outside it, whether in County Kerry or County Clare, who regrets more than I do that this young Kerryman should have had to die, Personally, to the extent that any spirit of violence remains in this country, where one young Irishman is prepared to use violence against another, particularly for political or semi-political reasons&mdash; to the extent that such spirit exists&mdash;I regard it as a failure of the policy we tried to operate.  We in Fianna Fáil have done our best to bring about conditions of peace and order in this country, based upon the freedom and justice that we endeavoured to establish since our Party took office.  I regret bitterly that some of these men have had to be imprisoned and that some of them, when found guilty of murder, have had to die.  I hope that this is going to be the last of it.  I hope that the young men of this country are not going to be led away by allegations such as were made by Deputy Cafferky and Deputy Blowick <Col N="1443" /> that Fianna Fáil counselled such actions.  I hope they will not be led astray&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>We heard what the Deputy said and it is on record.  The fact of the matter is that the Fianna Fáil organisation, the men of the Old I.R.A. and Sinn Féin, stood steadfastly for one ideal&mdash;that there should be a free independent Government set up in this country, that when it was set up in a constitutional way by the people of this country its laws should be obeyed, and that differences should be settled according to law and not by force of arms.  The people of the country enacted the Constitution and <Col N="1446" /> no one can contest the fact that anybody who wants to go forward with a policy, to put it to the people, to get elected here as a member of this House, who wants to promote his policy in this House, has every right and freedom to do so.  There is more freedom in this country in that respect than in any other country in the world for not alone are the constituencies of convenient size, but the deposit necessary to enable a candidate to go forward for the Dáil is very small. There is absolute freedom and in such circumstances there is absolutely no excuse for anybody saying that he will rely on force to change either the Constitution or the law.  We do not want to use violence to enforce the law but if any set of individuals led on by such propaganda as Deputy Cafferky and others have used, try to use force against this State, well then the State will have to defend itself.</P>

We know that this sort of incitement is being used by the men who are behind the front, the respectable front that is being put up.  It will be disastrous for this country if there is to be violence used against the Government and officers of the State.  I would appeal to Deputy Norton and to Deputy Blowick to remember that, in addition to Article 15 (6) which they have been quoting and their friends outside have been quoting for some time, there is another Article in the Constitution.  Lest they have forgotten, I am going to read it for them. Article 40, sub-section 3 (2) says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The State shall, in particular by its laws protect as best it may from unjust attack and, in the case of injustice done, vindicate the life, person, good name, and property and rights of every citizen.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If an individual can murder an officer of the State, and not even at any time say he is not guilty of that crime when he is found guilty, and can find people like Deputy Norton, Deputy Blowick, the Lord Mayor of Dublin and all the rest of them, to create riots and disturbances on his behalf, how is that clause of the Constitution to be implemented?  How are we to vindicate and protect the lives and property of the citizens of this State?  I should like Deputy Blowick to put himself that question, and to think over it, and, having thought over it, to say that, when a man has been tried and sentenced for a crime, instead of going out and appealing to the good nature of the people in order to create riots and commotion in the city that Deputies should use the ordinary procedure of raising the matter in the House or raising questions with the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were quite determined that we <Col N="1448" /> were not going to allow the respectable front on this occasion to be used as a cover for the reorganisation of a group of men who have behaved in the manner which the Minister for Justice has pointed out; who have murdered servants of the State, who have carried out &ldquo;financial operations&rdquo; against the private property of the citizens, with guns in their hands.  We were quite determined that we would not allow them to use this state of commotion and human sympathy to reorganise and strengthen their organisation.  Deputy Norton, if he has the welfare of the working people of this country at heart, will stand in with the Government in applying that clause of the Constitution, and protecting the lives of the officers of the State who are protecting the State, because if there are anarchy and chaos in this country it is the people of the lowest scale of income who will be the greatest sufferers.  Deputy Blowick should also consider the matter.  I do not know that the farmers of Roscommon, or of Mayo, authorised him to give comfort to such an organisation in the manner in which he did last night, when one of his members tried to create a riot in this House in its behalf, supported, I am reminded, by the whole Farmers' Party.  I do not know that he has any mandate from the farmers of Mayo for that.  We hope that the Labour Party and the Farmers' Party are going to think this over.  This unfortunate man has died for the crime of which he was found guilty according to law, but if this sort of game goes on other young men will be inflamed and will think that they have the backing of those people to plan or carry out reprisals against servants of the State in the manner in which some of those 26 young men were conspiring before they were rearrested.</P>
    <P>We hope they will give no such comfort or support to them.  We hope they will show here to-night, and on every other occasion on which this question of national discipline comes up, that, although they may differ from Fianna Fáil on various social programmes and on various other questions of internal policy, when it comes to the protection <Col N="1449" /> of this State against its foreign enemies or its domestic enemies they are as one with the Government.  That was the policy of the Labour Party, as I understood it, all during this war until recently.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make my own speech.  We stopped advertisements emanating from the reprieve association because we were charged and had responsibility under the Emergency Powers Act to make Orders, and carry them out, whenever it was necessary for securing the public safety or the preservation of the State, or for the maintenance of public order.  We enforced those Orders when advertisements were put forward and we enforced those Orders in respect of the letter, which was read by one of the Deputies who spoke, asking for a demonstration, or hinting that the writer desired a demonstration, in certain churches of this country, in favour of the murder of Civic Guards. Deputy Larkin, last night, raised this question.  He was concerned, as he put it, that we had forbidden a lady from asking the people to attend Mass. We would like the people to attend Mass.  We hope that many people have prayed, not only for the spiritual welfare of the deceased to-day, but also that there will be no other cases of like-kind in this country But I most certainly object to religious services <Col N="1451" /> and religion being used, whether by the Left or by the Right, for fomenting treason and trouble and denying the right of the people of this country to rule themselves in their own way. Deputy Larkin and his particular friends, I suppose, are encouraged by others who try the same game at the extreme opposite end.</P>
      <P>The names of various honourable deceased Irishmen have been dragged into this affair by the people behind this reprieve association in order to try to justify the activities of the men who were responsible for the murder of Detective-Sergeant Denis O'Brien.  We did not propose at any time to allow them to be successful in strengthening their organisation under cover of this particular reprieve movement.  Neither do we intend to allow them to promote their organisation under any other guise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The speech delivered by the Minister for Justice was delivered in his usual style and it was quite evident to those who listened to him that he worked himself up into a fit of rage for the purpose of deliberately evading charges that were made against him and his Department by Deputy Norton.  This debate has been allowed so as to enable Deputy Norton and others to justify certain charges. Deputy Norton made these charges in detail and supported them, in the majority of cases, by documents or documentary evidence.  The Minister for Justice made no attempt whatsoever to answer these very detailed and specific charges.  Does the Minister for Justice suggest that it is illegal, even in a case of this kind, for the persons known as the reprieve committee to get posters printed and put on the hoardings of the City of Dublin?  Does he suggest that that is an illegal act by an illegal body?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If so, why did not he issue an Order and why did not he charge them, if they are guilty of an illegal act, either with obstruction or some other offence known to the common law?  The Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures made no attempt, and did not intend when he got up to make any attempt, to answer the <Col N="1452" /> charges that were made by Deputy Norton so far as his Department is concerned.  He talked about the respectable front that was supposed to be covering up the activities of some illegal organisation.  Everybody in this city knows that Mr. Denis Guiney is one of the biggest and best employers in the city, and that he is a close personal friend of the Minister for Justice.  What is wrong with Mr. Denis Guiney and those associated with him, the members of the reprieve committee&mdash;and Mr. Guiney is one of the leaders of this reprieve committee&mdash;handing these advertisements to the daily papers for publication?  Will the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures, or the Taoiseach, if he replies on behalf of the two Ministers concerned, say what is wrong with an advertisement which reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A meeting of all Kerry men and women resident in Dublin will be held in Clery's, O'Connell Street, on to-morrow, Thursday, at 7.30 p.m.&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>Under what section of the Emergency Powers Act, or of any other Act now in existence, did the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures or those acting in his name prevent the newspapers of this country from publishing that advertisement?</P>
    <P>The Kerrymen's Association, I believe, was established in the first instance for the purpose of honouring the Kerry footballers whenever they came to Dublin and, in between the football matches in which the famous Kerry football team were engaged, I understand they carried on dances and other social functions throughout the year.  Why did not the Minister for Justice ban that organisation if it is acting, as he suggests it is acting in this case, for some illegal purpose? Mr. Denis Guiney is the leader of the reprieve committee.  Who are the other members of the reprieve committee? Will the Taoiseach or any other Minister give us the names of any of the members of the reprieve committee who are alleged to be associated with this irregular organisation of which Kerins is supposed to have been a member?</P>
    <P>Let us come to the public meeting <Col N="1453" /> and those who are associated with it. I have been very closely associated with the present Lord of Mayor of Dublin for nearly 40 years.  I am fairly well acquainted with his daily activities and I am assured that he was persuaded by the reprieve committee, of which Mr. Denis Guiney is the leading member, to agree to allow the Mansion House to be used for the purpose of this meeting and to preside at the meeting.</P>
    <P>Who were the speakers at that meeting&mdash;and I am assured that the persons who were invited to speak and who did speak at that meeting were invited to attend there and to speak by the reprieve committee of which Mr. Denis Guiney was a leading spokesman&mdash;Mr. J.D. O'Connell, solicitor, who was authorised to speak for the Kerry County Council; the Lord Mayor of Cork who, I understand, is a prominent Fianna Fáil supporter and who has a better right, I presume, as Lord Mayor of Cork at present, to speak for the citizens of Cork in a matter of this kind than Deputy Anthony.  Deputy Anthony is quite entitled to speak for those he represents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The third is Peadar O'Donnell, well known to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and to every member of the Ministry; P. Finucane, T.D., elected by the people of Kerry; M. O'Connor of the Kerry County Council; James Larkin, Junior, who, in spite of whatever the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures may say about him and the slanderous statements made about him during the election by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, was elected by the people of Dublin City, South, to be a member of this House; Fred Crowley, T.D., one of the most respected members of the Fianna Fáil Party in this House; Mr. Dan Spring, Member of the National Labour Party, elected by the people of Kerry; Senator Horan; E.J. Walsh of the Kerry County Council; Peadar Cowan; <Col N="1454" /> Michael Donnellan, T.D.; Gearoid MacHugh; James Larkin, Senior, T.C. Will the Taoiseach or anybody else stand up in this House and say which, if any, of the members who spoke at that public meeting, have any direct association with this alleged irregular organisation with which the late Mr. Kerins was supposed to be actively associated?</P>
      <P>I could give the names of other people who were on the platform that night.  I want to ask the Taoiseach what good purpose could be served from the point of view of law and order by preventing the publication of any reference to the meeting in the daily papers.  I was not present.  I was invited, and I was also invited to speak, but I knew perfectly well that Deputy Martin O'Sullivan, the Lord Mayor of Dublin, was going to preside and that he would speak for me and my colleagues in this Party.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Local Government has been constantly interrupting in this debate.  He is known to the people as being the ablest political slanderer in the country.  I really intervened in the debate for the sole purpose of endeavouring to get from the Taoiseach, if he speaks before it concludes, some reason or some justification for the activities of the police authorities in Dublin for the past eight or ten days.  If the police authorities concerned were authorised by the Minister for Justice and the Government to act in the manner indicated by Deputy Norton&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>They had your full concurrence for tearing down posters that were properly put up by those representing the committee in connection with this matter.  If it is illegal for certain individuals to put up posters, why were not the individuals who were caught in the act brought before the courts and charged with some offence against the common law?  I think the Minister will admit that it is a most irregular thing for Guards to be employed pulling down posters, if it could be proved&mdash;and I think it can&mdash;that these posters were put up by a body acting within the law.  I understand this debate is to conclude at a certain time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to prevent other Deputies from speaking, but I want to say that the charges made in such detail by Deputy Norton have not been answered by the two Ministers concerned.  No attempt has been made by the Minister for Justice to answer the charges made against the police, and the Minister for Co-ordination of Defensive Measures made no attempt to justify his assumption of dictatorial powers, when he prevented the newspapers from making any reference to the agitation organised for the purpose of securing the reprieve of the late Mr. Kerins.  I admit that I know people who would sign a reprieve, and who have signed these appeals for the reprieve of persons condemned to death in the past, because they did not believe in capital punishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know any more about this matter than Deputies representing Dublin know, but I am in contact with hundreds of people every day in my ordinary activities, and I did not hear of any case of any citizen of this State being forced to sign these reprieve forms.  I also admit that I was rather amazed at many of the statements made by Deputy Norton and at the evidence he produced in support of the <Col N="1456" /> charges he made.  I heard a number of them for the first time yesterday.  They are charges, if proved, that should be answered and justified by the Minister for Justice and by the Head of the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Some Deputies said that the people were the supreme court.  I wonder in what sense the people are the supreme court in matters of this kind.  The people are the supreme court in deciding at election time who the members of the Dáil shall be.  During the period from that time until the people are again consulted, the Dáil has full responsibility for speaking for the people.  The Dáil appoints the Government and the Government, as appointed, are responsible for government.  The Dáil can put out the Government.  The Government is the Executive.  There is a judicial machinery which examines charges against individuals for breaking the law, whether in big matters or small matters.  The judiciary is chosen from the point of view of seeing that justice is done, as the best machinery for arriving at the truth.  It is the machinery under the law for assigning punishment.  Will anybody tell us now that a public meeting is to be the place where matters of that sort are to be tried?  The Ceann Comhairle has rightly stated that this Dáil is not the place where cases are to be tried, because it is quite obvious that, as we have not in front of us the witnesses and so on, we cannot go into details of the cases and satisfy ourselves as individuals on which side there is right and on which side there is not.  We would not be fit to try a case in the Dáil without having all the machinery of justice here.  We would have to take weeks in trying to get at the facts before we could constitute ourselves judge and jury to try these cases.  Do Deputies think a public meeting could do that?  Do you think the speakers at that meeting confined themselves simply to asking for mercy?  They spoke of one side, but they did not speak of the other.  We are here as an Executive to see that the judgments of the courts are carried out.  That is our function.  It is our special function. No other body, not even the Dáil, has <Col N="1457" /> that function so long as we are in office.  It is our function, our responsibility.</P>
      <P>We have also, in the carrying out of that responsibility, a special power given us, the power of commuting sentences, by advising the President.  As is well known, according to the Constitution, the President in matters of this sort has to act on the advice of the Government.  Even in the Executive, we cannot try these cases.  It is not our function to try them.  In a certain case there is a special obligation on us to consider whether the prerogative of mercy should be exercised, but it is not our business in the Executive to try these cases.  Our business is to see if there are any special extenuating circumstances, any reason why the law should not take its ordinary course.  The ordinary course is that the sentences of the court be carried out by the Executive.  We got all the petitions, all the pleas, in this case, and we were satisfied that there were no circumstances there that would justify us, that, in fact, we would be failing in our public duty if we did not carry out the sentence properly imposed by the court.  With every Executive it is a sad function to have to carry out, but, so long as the law is the law, any Government or any Executive has to perform that function without fear or favour, as the custodian of the rights of the people.  It is in that spirit that we had to deal with this matter. People at a public meeting had not our responsibility, It is very easy for people at a public meeting to allow themselves to be carried away by the natural feelings which every one of us has.  They have not to look at the other side of it, but we must do so. We knew perfectly well how this organisation was working and that they were utilising the natural feeling that was there.  They knew the people were not going to think of the man who had been killed nor of the people who might be killed, if justice were not done.  But we had to think of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We think that citizens are very badly advised when they lend themselves to public demonstrations in matters of this sort.  There is a way <Col N="1458" /> for bringing to the notice of the Executive any particular points which should be brought to its notice.  The legal representatives do it and, in cases that are tried by judge and jury, the juries sometimes do it by recommendations to mercy.  The private citizen or groups of citizens can send in petitions.  In our long experience&mdash;and, unfortunately, we have had many cases like this to deal with since we came into office &mdash;these petitions have been carefully examined and our tendency has always been towards clemency, towards leniency.  That attitude continued until we were satisfied and until it was demonstrably proved to us that, if we were clement in one case, it meant that we would have many other cases.</P>
    <P>We had a typical example here on one occasion when a man was on hunger strike.  There was a petition from the Labour Party to let him out. We considered it, we looked to the future and saw the condition we had to deal with.  We decided we could not release him, and I came into the House and made a statement, as I felt that public sympathy would mean that that man would continue, and others with him, until they died.  I wanted to make them realise as early as possible that we could not give way.  That remained the position until it was medically reported to me that the man was on the point of death, that he was suffering extreme pain, that he could not live in any case more than a few hours and that he was urgently in need of an operation in a civil hospital in order to relieve his pain.  I went to my colleagues, as I said in the House before, and I begged them to reconsider the decision.  Even though I had publicly stated here, and publicly pledged myself to the people as a whole, that this man would not be released, I got the Government to change its view and let that man out. We released him; he got well; within a year, he was engaged in the same type of activity for which he had been detained.  He and another man shot down two members of the Gárda Síochána&mdash;two deaths&mdash;and wounded a third.  They had to be tried and were found guilty and had to be executed. Then there were also two other men <Col N="1459" /> who, when we did give way at all, thought that we would not see it to the end, and they died on hunger strike.</P>
    <P>I was taught a lesson then and, as long as I am here as an executive, I will never forget it.  I was taught the lesson that, in giving way and being element in the case of one man, I was responsible for six deaths.  We will never do that again.  This man was found guilty of murder and, if we let him go, we would have other cases of murder.  Let there be reprisals if there will, but as long as we are here we will carry out the law, justify and fairly.  Some Deputy said we railroaded this man.  That is not the custom in this country: we did not learn in that school.  We had no desire whatever for that man's death.  It has been suggested he should have got a trial by jury.  Why is trial by jury not in vogue?  Why is it that we have dispensed with it in certain cases?  It is because witnesses were intimidated, because jurymen were intimidated.  If we are to maintain order&mdash;which is the first and primary duty of every Government&mdash;we will have to see that the people who commit crimes are properly brought to trial before a court that cannot be intimidated.</P>
    <P>The advertisements were stopped by virtue of our right to maintain order and preserve the State, to prevent organisations getting ahead and using this as a cloak for reorganisation.  As you know, the members of this organisation claim to be the Government in themselves, to have the right here to govern, although, as has been pointed out already here, they could not succeed in being elected in a single constituency.  Every Deputy can stand up here, any man can go out before the people and ask to be elected, on any policy.  The Constitution is a free Constitution, made by the Irish people, and every section in the country will have to obey the laws.  It is our business to see that that is done and, if we do not do so, we will have chaos.</P>
    <P>I appeal to all Deputies to see the <Col N="1460" /> seriousness of this matter.  I appeal to the people of the country to give no countenance to this organisation, no matter what may be the aims they say they have, no matter how much they may appeal to sentiments which are dear to us and have been dear to us in the past.  There is a change of position in this country: the methods which were used to try to defeat a foreign Power in this country ought not to be used against an Irish Government freely elected here under a free Constitution.</P>

These young people are to be caught by the sentiment of freedom and to be led on to think they are acting in a patriotic way.  They are to be caught up and to be bound and, even if they try to retract from that position when they get older and have more sense, they are to be threatened with the gun.</P>

    <P>I want to warn the parents and the young people of this country not to be led into anything of that sort.  Now is the time to end it.  These people would have involved us in this war; these people, some of them, would have done the same as Dermot MacMurrough, but we do not want that.  To get the freedom we have has cost many a sacrifice and many a life. Are we going to throw it away now? Are we going to try to put the Executive, the Government, in the position that it cannot take the ordinary measures that are necessary in order to preserve this State?  The pretence that we are acting in a dictatorial fashion is without foundation. To-morrow the Dáil can take away from us all the powers we have got; but I am perfectly certain that if there is any suggestion of taking these <Col N="1461" /> powers away, the majority of the Dáil will give us these powers, because the majority know these powers are absolutely necessary in the times that exist in order to preserve order.  We have been most fortunately preserved so far from the chaos which has resulted in the countries that have been overrun by war.  Let us see to it that we are not fooled and that people who are waiting to fish in muddy waters will not find the waters muddied by us for their purpose.  Let us take care where we are going.  There are people who see no other way to get into power, knowing that if they go before the people they will not be elected. They are trying to bring about a situation of chaos and disorder here in which they think they might be able to seize power.</P>
    <P>We have a magnificent police force; we have a magnificent military force, magnificent in many ways.  We came in here as the opponents of the Government that established them.  We had opposed them very bitterly, because we differed on certain fundamental points; but when we came in here that force of Civic Guards and that Army obeyed us and were loyal to us, even though there were temptations put in their way&mdash; and we know there were.  They were as loyal to us as they had been to the Government that preceded us.  We are not going to see the lives of these men, who are there to defend the rights of the people, taken with impunity.  We will see, so far as any power that we can command will enable us to do it, that these men's lives will be vindicated, as stated in the Constitution.  That we are determined upon.</P>
    <P>Let them have their reprisals.  There are members on this bench who have faced it before, as there were members on the other bench on another occasion. We are not afraid of it at all, not a bit.  We are going to see to it, in so far as we can, that the servants of this State will be protected by all the powers of the State, and we ask Deputies in this House not to lend themselves to those who have no purpose in view but the destruction of this State&mdash;a large number of them.  It is <Col N="1462" /> true that there are some young people who have grown up in recent years and who hardly understood the position, young people who were taught that the position is now the same as it was back in 1918 or 1919.  Some of these people do not understand.  We were willing to do everything we could to make allowance for them and to try to wean them off; but they have resisted every effort of ours to induce them to obey the law and to accept the constitutional position of the Irish people. If they take up that position and are going to rely upon force, there is no other way of meeting it but by the full force of the State&mdash;no other way.</P>
    <P>We are prepared to take our own responsibilities&mdash;we want nobody to share them.  Our responsibilities are ours, but we do ask Deputies in this House of all Parties, and we do ask all the people in the State, all the citizens of the State, to assist us in seeing that that task will not be more difficult than it otherwise would be.  It will mean saving lives.  If one-half of the efforts that are made to hold the hand of the Government when justice has to be done were made to convince these people that they are wrong and show them the right way, how much better it would be.  If you cannot do that with them, then tell them: &ldquo;Very well, if you are not going to be advised, then you are going to come up against a power which will be much stronger than you are.&rdquo;  That is the way to save lives.  That is the way to see that we will not be meeting on other occasions like this, sad occasions; that we will not be meeting like this when the Executive of the day has to see that use is not made by designing people of naturally sympathetic citizens.</P>

      <P>To-night Deputy Donnellan indicated that he believed that 2,750,000 of the people of this country are of the opinion that it is only a jury of honest people should convict an Irishman.  I think it is desirable that we should all get out of our minds that you can deal with a type of organisation that sets itself out in an armed conspiracy against the <Col N="1463" /> State by ordinary jury methods.  I think there is sufficient evidence on the records of this House already not to have that questioned, and whatever difficulties or drawbacks there may be about the type of courts other than jury courts that are operating, I think we have to be perfectly satisfied, as a Parliament here, that until we can better the type of military courts that are dealing with these matters, they are going to be used and stood steadfastly behind, and it is a matter of gratification that when an appeal was made from the judgment in this particular case, the appeal court had to uphold so clearly the verdict of the military court.</P>
      <P>While I do not profess to misunderstand the Taoiseach when he declares that they want to shoulder their own responsibilities and do not want to share them with anybody else, the responsibility for standing behind the Executive and the general arms of the State in defending this State against any kind of an armed military conspiracy devolves on the whole of us, and I want to reiterate that, in that, this Party stands to its traditions.</P>
      <P>I could not allow this debate to pass without introducing these two matters in a brief way.  The whole of our judgment and power and tradition are going to be behind the ordered instruments of this State against any kind of conspiracy, any armed conspiracy. We stand for one Government in this country, one Army responsible to that Government, and the absolute and complete control of all arms by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach made a statement here to-night which I regret terribly could not have been made before we had the rather disturbing incidents we had here yesterday and the rather disturbing discussions we have had here to-day.  It is all very well for the Taoiseach to say that they are going to stand up to their own responsibilities and are not going to share them with anybody; but if you have knowledge in the Government that this conspiracy is reorganising itself, that this conspiracy, <Col N="1464" /> under the cloak of a reprieve movement, is carrying on its reorganisation, surely we do not live so far from one another, and we do not so mistrust the various outlooks of one another, that the Taoiseach, either directly with the heads of the various Parties, or through the Defence Conference which is there&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is there in so far as the leaders of the various Parties are prepared to act and to serve on it, if, by doing so, they can serve any useful purpose.  It is really shocking that at this hour of the day it should be possible to suggest that various Parties in the House were in any way cloaking armed conspiracy against the State, or any of the persons engaged in such conspiracy.  If there were any possibility, any danger of that, through weakness, misguidedness or lack of judgment, surely the heads of the Party concerned ought to be brought into conference with the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice or the Minister for the Co-Ordination of Defensive Measures, so that, in conference, the minds of the leaders of the various Parties could be understood and anything which was disturbing in their attitude could be discussed and got rid of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I merely wanted to state clearly how fully and completely we are behind the Government in any action it takes to preserve the State.  I do not want to bring in any other matters, but I suggest that so much misunderstanding was shown in the proceedings here yesterday and to-day that an early opportunity should be taken, in council between the Government and heads of the Parties, to clear up whatever misunderstandings there are, or whatever feelings have been disturbed, as a result of the interchanges and speeches we have heard, because, while it is absolutely necessary to defend the State, and none of us will spare himself in any way in that regard, we are concerned with the things which will <Col N="1465" /> affect the strength of our people and their unanimity.</P>
    <P>Things have happened in the way of censorship and suppression which disturb us in many ways.  We do not want to go into these things to-night, but I would have welcomed a situation in which, if the Taoiseach or the Minister for Justice saw anything like a disturbance arising out of the proposed meeting of the reprieve committee, they would send for the prominent people supposed to be connected with it, and, if they could not come to a satisfactory conclusion as to what was to happen at the meeting, what was to be said and what help might be given by the committee to prevent anything of this kind happening again, then I could understand any meeting or any putting up of posters being forbidden under Emergency Order, and I could understand the Taoiseach coming to the House and in a calm, straight and unruffled way saying clearly where he stood, in the words he used: &ldquo;We will never do it again,&rdquo; stating clearly where he stood with regard to the courts and the decision of the court on this matter.</P>
    <P>That would have been a much stronger and much more satisfactory way of dealing with it than leaving us in the terribly unsatisfactory position in which the various Parties who have been ruffled in this way must be at present.  I ask the Government to understand, first, that we stand behind them in every way in which they want to save the State, but we earnestly suggest that the people can be trusted to discuss matters to a greater extent than they have been trusted in the past and can be trusted to meet to a greater extent than apparently they are allowed to meet.</P>
    <P>I do not, as I say, want to go into the matter of censorship, but I ask that, in spite of anything that may have happened here and anything the Minister for Justice may see in the development of the Labour Party, to give them the credit of standing between the Government and anything like armed conspiracy against the <Col N="1466" /> State, and through the Defence Conference, or by any other means, have a thorough and complete review of the whole position so as to enable us to get back to a position in which it will be perfectly clear to everybody in the country that every member and every Party in the House will uphold the Government in any action designed to preserve the State.  Deputy Davin may say that the Defence Conference is there, but the Defence Conference has not met this year.  Nevertheless, if there was any work the Government wished us to do, we would be there, and it may be the spirit of the Government which the Taoiseach talks about when he says they are not prepared to share their responsibilities with anyone, that makes it difficult for the Government to meet us.</P>
    <P>It may be perhaps that by reason of whatever analysis the Labour Party has been subjected to, the Labour Party or their representatives may not be welcome in the Defence Conference, but unless we get clear and can be sensible about these matters, I do not know where we will get from the point of view of doing our Parliamentary business alone, not to speak of standing up to any developing threat there may be against the State.  I do not believe there is any threat capable of developing against this State with which this House cannot deal, but the one thing which would help to develop such a threat, or which might cost lives, or might bring about loss, would be any suggestion that there is not complete and absolute understanding between the various Parties, and absolute unanimity that armed conspiracy against the State would be dealt with and completely crushed.</P>
    <P>I do plead for some kind of an approach to the situation that will get the atmosphere of yesterday's incidents and the discussion we have had here to-night out of the minds of all our people here, because I am quite sure that nearly everybody in the Chamber must be disturbed by the way in which feelings have been ruffled by reason of the discussion which has taken place here to-night.  I want to emphasise <Col N="1467" /> again that we stand for trying these cases with the greatest possible justice, but that they cannot be given over to a jury, and we will support the Government in every way in which they put down the use of arms and armed conspiracy against them.  I want to make that clear.  The only other thing I want to make clear is this: I think a better spirit of approach on the part of the Government when regarding their difficulties to the heads of the various Parties would make it much easier for them, and for us to stand over our responsibilities, and would make it much more difficult for threats against either the lives or the interests of our people to arise.</P>

      <P>I was precluded from taking part in this debate earlier by reason of the fact that I had given notice to raise another matter.  It is not my intention to raise that matter now.  I hope that the notice which I gave regarding agriculture will be taken by the Government as indicating the concern of our Party in regard to the position of agriculture, and that an early opportunity will be afforded for a debate on it.  I know that there is another Deputy who wants to speak on the subject before the House at the moment, and consequently, what I have to say on it will be brief.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  We, as a Party, have not taken part in this debate in order to demonstrate sympathy with any illegal activities against the State. We do not intend that the action which we have taken should be regarded as a demonstration, and we hope that it will not be so regarded.  We hold firmly that it is the duty of every Deputy to do everything possible to strengthen and support the forces of order and of law.  It is, I think, a good thing that this debate has taken place. Some of the speeches made have contributed to clear the air and to strengthen the position in regard to <Col N="1468" /> order in this country.  I must say that I would be unworthy to stand up in this House if I did not say that I regret not only some of the things that were said from the Government Benches, but that I regret still more some of the things that were said by some members of this Party.  I regret, in particular, one remark that was made by Deputy Cafferky in the concluding part of his speech in which he seemed, at any rate, to indicate that the Government might suffer from acts of violence at some time in the future. I may have been mistaken: I may have misunderstood the Deputy's remarks, but I think a lot of other people misunderstood them also, and I think it is desirable that the Deputy should have an opportunity of explaining now that a mistake was made. The Deputy now explains to me that he did not intend his words to be taken that way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that his explanation should be accepted.  I hold that this State ought now to have grown up.  More than 20 years have elapsed since it was established.  I do not agree with anybody who says that there is any analogy between the things that are being done or contemplated by illegal organisations to-day and the things that were done or contemplated by military organisations in the past, or even things that were done by the Fianna Fáil Party when they were in opposition.  Twenty years of self-government ought to be sufficient to educate us to a full understanding not only of our constitutional rights but of our constitutional duties, and of the responsibility which rests not only on individuals but on all Parties to maintain and preserve order.  I agree with Deputy Mulcahy when he says that, as constitutional representatives, we have even the right to express misgivings in regard to some of the things which the Government may have done. We have the right to express the hope that the integrity of the forces under the Government will be maintained and strengthened, and that the confidence <Col N="1469" /> which the people should have in the forces of law and order in this country will be strengthened and safeguarded. That can only be done by the most strict and careful control, by the Minister for Justice in particular, of the forces under this control.  It is also desirable that the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures should not in any way exceed the enormous powers which have been given to him in regard to the censoring of matters of public importance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene in this debate with very great reluctance indeed.  I have been tempted to do so because of one unfortunate contribution that I heard made in the debate by the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures.  Let me say, without the least desire to give offence, that I regard his contribution to the debate as one of the most unfortunate that I have heard for a very considerable time.  I am not going to make any attack on the Minister or any attack on his Party.  Neither am I going to make any defence of the Party with which I am proud to be associated. I do want to say this of our Party, that our record as a constitutional Party, of every member of it and of every friend of it in the country, ever since our people came in here in 1922, is unimpeached and unsullied. Neither in recent times nor in the remote past has there been any change, or any indication of any change, of policy in that particular direction. May I submit that that does not deprive us of the right to criticise actions and a line of policy that we consider to be indiscreet and unwise on certain occasions?  Surely, views of that kind do not undermine the viewpoint that every one of us in every Party in this House is united against violence and crime and against every agency that seeks to embark on such methods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was a member of the House in 1939 when the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures, with his colleagues, got the extraordinary powers that were conferred on them under an Act passed in that year.  It <Col N="1470" /> is on the records of the House that I dissented from giving the Government those powers because I was not certain that they would be used discreetly and well.  Very often since, when I heard the Minister speak in this House and when I heard a case made against him on behalf of the Press of this country, on behalf of the newspapers of this city and of the country, through the agency of other members of the House, I was convinced more and more that the Minister is capable occasionally of acting in the most irresponsible way, and I have never heard a clearer vindication of that point of view than his statement here this evening.  I suggest to the Minister that he is pressing an open door when he asks members of this House to stand against anarchy.  May I respectfully make this suggestion to the Minister: that there are many ways of promoting a feeling that ultimately leads in a wrong direction, and that you can by the strong, vigorous and aggressive use of certain powers at certain times promote a feeling that is neither for the good of the community nor for the good of the citizens generally?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach made an appeal to members of the House this evening. If I may be presumptuous enough to do so, may I make an appeal to the Government?  The appeal is that, in the exercise of the powers that they have, discretion should be used, and that there should not be the kind of attitude adopted in defending the rights of the Government that was adopted by the Minister here this evening.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech, in my opinion, displayed a lamentable lack of responsibility. I very much regret that the debate this evening should be disfigured by the unfortunate statement for which the Minister has been responsible. He did not answer one charge of alleged abuse of his powers as the chief authority in the matter of censorship. The Minister has a bad record in this connection in many respects, and I am satisfied that he is not fitted to be entrusted with the powers he has <Col N="1471" /> had conferred on him in this regard.  I say that without abating one iota of my views as to the rights of the people and as to the bona fides of every Party here from the constitutional standpoint. I trust that the people will be <Col N="1472" /> spared any action which may lead to a renewal of debates of this kind in the future.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.50 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 24th January, 1945.</P>
