      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to repeat <Col N="2246" /> myself, but I want to bring out certain points.  The first is to suggest that the Bill is mistitled; the second is that, in another place an investigation is taking place which may change the whole outlook of the House and opinion throughout the country on this Bill, and that may compel a readjustment of the situation; thirdly, that this railway company has, on the submission of the Minister himself, proved its incapacity to carry on such an undertaking; fourthly, that the House is being asked to vote the considerable sum of £13,500,000 to be handed over to people for property for which, according to the Minister himself, there is no collateral; fifthly, that the company itself is in such a state of disquietude as well as being in a condition of bankruptcy almost that it would be unfair if not, to use a stronger word, dishonest, to tender £13,500,000 for a property that in certain quarters was valued at from £4,500,000 to £7,000,000.  I am very generous in saying £7,000,000, because it has been stated that the property is not worth £4,500,000 as a going concern. This railway company has no goodwill to sell except the needs of the community.  Furthermore, I suggest that these statements made publicly, as well as the atmosphere outside of this House, should convey to the Minister&mdash; he seemed to have a feeling of uncertainty within himself in the halting submission which he made to the House&mdash;and should convince the back-benchers in his Party, that this is a serious matter which requires further consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put some questions to the Minister when speaking on Wednesday which he failed to answer.  I know that, with his usual courtesy, he will answer them when closing the debate.  I put it to him, again, that this is a Bill born out of time; it is an abortion, born of mismanagement and fathered by cupidity. To that extent it is a measure that is going to affect the back-benchers opposite, in their relations with their constituents, in a very serious way. Their constituents are being denied the services to which they are entitled.  The back-benchers in the Minister's Party ought to consider their position.  If the Minister takes off the Whip, I feel sure <Col N="2247" /> that 90 per cent.  of the membership of the House will vote for delaying this measure.  If the Whip is not taken off, then, naturally, the back-benchers will respond to it.</P>
    <P>I submit to the members of the Government Party, who represent the citizens of Dublin, that they cannot be a party to this merger because if so they will either have to lie here or lie in another place where they are carrying on in an administrative capacity.  It is quite clear, in connection with this merger which takes in the Dublin Transport Company, that there is something to be explained.  My submission to the House is that the Dublin Transport Company has nothing to sell.  The Corporation of Dublin and its citizens, represented by the Lord Mayor, Aldermen and elected councillors have.  The corporation would not hesitate, if it were in the interests of the country even to forego their financial rights, founded on the security of the rates, and accommodate themselves to the needs of a national service of transportation, but what is clear from this Bill is that the Dublin United Transport Company is confiscating and presuming to sell something that it has no legal right to sell.  It has no legal right to negotiate with any body outside the Corporation of Dublin.  It has a life extension, under agreement, in this property up to 1966, but the company has violated every term and condition in that agreement. They never kept one of the conditions of the agreement.  They did temporarily open up the Lucan line and they did temporarily supply electrical energy in the immediate area of the power station controlled by them: but they closed those two activities down, denying the public of Dublin the rights set down in the agreement.  I hold that those two rights alone, having been evaded by the company, made that agreement null and void in law.  It was the duty of the citizens of Dublin, through their elected representatives, to take into their own charge the use of the streets of the city.</P>
    <P>This merger goes further than that. It provides that whatever way-leave <Col N="2248" /> rents were payable are to be matters of treatment before an arbitrator.  The Minister specifically repeated that this question of arbitration as to the rights of the citizens of Dublin applies only to trams, yet in the 1925 Act the Corporation of Dublin is entitled to carry on omnibus services.  That seems to have been forgotten.</P>
    <P>There are two pertinent issues which I wish to bring before the House, without taking more than my share of the time.  These two fundamental issues affect the workers in this country.  In this Bill, officers and servants are segregated. The high officials, officers, who may be found redundant are compensated and there is no question of any difficulty about that.  When it comes to the workers, the servants, however, if they go out of the service within six months after the merger, they will be entitled to consideration only if they are found redundant for certain reasons.</P>
    <P>An amendment to the 1924 Act was drafted for the purpose of evading responsibilities to the servants of the railway companies.  After many hundreds of men&mdash;close on 2,000&mdash;had got compensation, the balance of the men suing before the courts failed, through no fault of their own, because the law was subject to delays, there not being sufficent judges available to carry on every day and deal with those cases as they should have been dealt with&mdash;immediately on the discharge of the men.  In that particular Act, there was a clause, which is inserted in this Bill.  Deputies might turn to Section 41, where they will find it, as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every person who was, on the 1st day of January, 1944,</P>
    <P>&mdash;so the Minister was sure this Bill would come into law by the 1st January, 1944, though this is a legislative Chamber, where every matter has to be discussed and where, after certain points of view have been talked over and considered, that matter may be made law, under certain procedure&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...an officer or servant of any dissolved company</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2249" />&mdash;and in this case there are two dissolved companies, the Great Southern Railways Company and the Dublin United Transport Company&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;shall, if his office or situation is abolished before the 1st day of January, 1945, directly and solely as the result of the amalgamation effected by this Part of that dissolved company and the other dissolved company and not</P>
    <P>&mdash;mark this, he or she is entitled to compensation if in the service at that date and found redundant&mdash;</P>
    <P>not&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;caused by decrease of traffic,</P>
    <P>&mdash;I submit there will be a decrease of traffic as a certain number of branch lines have already been abolished by the dictator, with the approval of the Minister&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;reduction of renewal or maintenance work,</P>
    <P>&mdash;in other words, the promise that these lines will be restored appears to be doubtful and, if the maintenance work is not of the same volume as previous to that particular date, he or she is disqualified from compensation&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;alteration in methods of working &mdash;the Minister himself suggested, and the House has considered, that there may be different methods of working, and that has always been visualised&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;closing of railway lines or other economic cause...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What happened when the men were making application on the latter stage of the 1924 Act?  The economy committee, which consisted of non-nationals, came in on oath and stated that, in the opinion of that committee and the company, it was to the economic interests of the company that these men should be dismissed.  Ergo, they lost their rights to compensation.  I would like to tell the aftermath of that in four different cases&mdash;suicide in one case, sudden death outside Trinity College in another&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

      <P>The Deputy is now repeating himself verbatim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this Section 41 <Col N="2250" /> of the Bill, the men and women who may be found redundant may be dismissed without compensation.  I think I would get strong legal support in making that submission.  There is another matter which seems to have been overlooked.  Though the Grand Canal Company is not being taken over, what do we find here? The Minister does not take over the canal services, but he takes power to decide&mdash;on the advice or without the advice of an advisory committee&mdash; that the rates charged by the Grand Canal Company may have a certain effect on the earning power of the new combine and, if he is of opinion, even without any expert advice, that the Grand Canal Company is not charging rates commensurate with the services rendered or is otherwise competing unfairly with the combine, he has power to compel the Grand Canal Company to reduce or increase the rates.  I am not a defender of private enterprise, but I suggest to those interested in that particular form of activity that this is nothing but confiscation. It is perfectly right and proper for a State-controlled organisation to arrange terms of service and the rates they are to charge for them, but are they to be allowed to enter the premises and management of another concern and decide they will make those people&mdash;whether they like it or not&mdash;carry goods in such a way as not to be in competition with the State-financed concern?  I do not know whether the Grand Canal Company has been informed of that or not.  Even yet, if the ordinary laws operate in this country, they may have power to ask a question about that, since it means taking away certain rights and properties which they possess as a statutory company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister had gone a step further and said: &ldquo;We are going to take over the transportation system of this country,&rdquo; I for one would be with him.  I am quite sure that the majority of this House is of opinion as Deputies have stated on all sides of the House that this problem can only be settled by public control and public ownership of the service.  I believe the Minister would get a majority for that but he would only get it <Col N="2251" /> when it was carefully surveyed and certain well-considered plans had been prepared, after a certain price was paid for the properties now existing and after the investigation has come to a close and a considered verdict been rendered.</P>
    <P>Even if the Minister gets the Second Reading of this Bill, all these Schedules and clauses will be debated and considered. I am quite sure the Minister, where there is unfair treatment of individuals, or even private companies, or contradictions in the measure, will correct them.  A sop has been thrown out to private owners of lorries and road vehicles throughout the country who have been stopped by the fiat of the Minister and denied the right to carry on their business, for various reasons, including that of competing unfairly with the Great Southern Railways. Even if the Minister has approached this question by recognising in a limited way the right of these private owners to operate, after this merger he will qualify his permission by only allowing them to operate in limited areas with the limitation of the present permission of 15 miles outside certain areas.  In the case of Dundalk he goes further, because there our authority does not extend beyond the three-mile limit near the Border.  In conclusion, I am going to make a request&mdash;and I submit it to my three colleagues here&mdash;I ask them to live up to the declarations which they have voiced, that the property of the citizens of Dublin is being filched from them, is being confiscated.  That means that we have got to increase the rates on the city, that every man and woman in the city will have to pay more for houses, and that business men will carry further responsibility.  I do not think any of us in the city council would consider it fair that the way-leaves should be met by the corporation, because we have repeated again and again our claim that the streets of the City of Dublin are owned by the citizens.  Of course, there is overriding authority of the national Government, but no national Government would take from a municipal, urban or rural council the rights which are inherent in its jurisdiction.  These <Col N="2252" /> three representatives have always done their duty, and I suggest that they should do their duty in this crisis. There is another court of appeal, and I would ask the men of the West to consider the position, no matter what their political affiliations.  In 1934, the service on the Midland Great Western Railway was cut by 50 per cent., and lines torn up, and the railway from Dublin to Galway singled.  The Minister comes in here and admits that that was wrong, and that it may have to be corrected.  What are you going to say to your constituents in regard to this matter?  It was stated in this morning's papers that fish have had to be thrown into the sea, either because they had gone bad by bad handling, or because there was no service to bring them to where they could be sold.  Then, with regard to the extreme south, everybody knows that the counties of Kerry and south-west Cork are not getting service.  They are getting less now than they were getting.  When you have done the long, painful passage to Waterford, you would think that Waterford was outside the State altogether. It is a long, wearisome drag that should have been cut by an hour or an hour and a half years ago.  All these things, I suggest, are matters which you have to answer for to your constituents.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by saying that although I do not know the mind of this House, I suggest to the Minister that the introduction of this Bill is ill-timed.  There is no feeling of antagonism on the part of the critics. The only criticism we have offered is that it is a bad bargain and financially unsound as presented to the House, and there might have been delay. There is no reason why there should not have been delay in introducing the Bill because there is no urgency in regard to it.  The urgency is just to mend this old crock and keep her going for a time until we get a clear, well-planned, well-considered scheme.  Then bring in your scheme and I feel sure, as we have undertaken to do throughout this session, your submissions to the House will be considered fairly.  In every submission you have made to the House on the Estimates, you have got comfort and support <Col N="2253" /> from the House.  In this case I ask you to consider the claims of the people of the country and not to submit to the dictation of the Stock Exchange and the speculators.  Before I finish I want to mention one or two things that happened to other workers. A gentleman who was some years ago in a transport company was asked to give up his position.  Four years before they could have compelled him to resign. For that he got adequate compensation. He got a bonus in addition, to shut his mouth.  In regard to the schemes for the betterment of the workers, I want to point out that in the case of this scheme for a particular form of insurance over 200 insurance collectors will lose their positions.  I am quite sure these men are going to become articulate.  But the money that used to go to them is now going into one particular office in which one of the heads of this alleged company is now a partner. The most offensive thing in the Bill that I can see is the section which gives power to this company to subscribe to charitable objects.  I do not know whether that means the advisory board and that these gentlemen are going to get charity or whether the dictator-chairman is going to consider what he gets to be charity or the gentleman who is supposed to be the managerial expert and who is not known to the outside public.  Why a public utility concern should take upon itself to become a charitable organisation I fail to understand.  One of the most peculiar and amazing things in the Bill is that a person entering a clerical capacity must know Irish, oral and written but, strange to relate, what applies to the office-boy or other clerical officer is not enforced against the gentlemen with salaries, the advisory committee and the manager nor the imported gentleman, the two non-nationals.  They are not compelled to know Irish.  That only applies to the boy who pays attention to his studies and tries to get in by a close examination.  I think it is fine that it is essential that he know Irish, but I would carry the thing a stage further. I say that every officer in the service, after a certain number of years, ought to know Irish.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2254" /> The stations will be named in Irish. What a lot of foolish people we are! If your salary is over £500 a year you do not need to know Irish; if you do, it is only for the purpose of passing into the job.  If it is a case of a man getting £2,500 a year, he can learn Sanskrit or any other language; he must know English.  I was surprised that this Scottish gentleman did not know more than&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect, if you bring a non-national in here to run the railways to suit his own purposes&mdash;a man with no railway experience whatever&mdash;it is a very strange proceeding.  However, I shall have an opportunity later on of referring to that matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in moving the Second Reading of this Bill, paid a tribute to the members of the tribunal who sat to inquire into public transport in this country and reported in 1939.  I agree that it is a very useful and informative report, and that it contains, for the most part, very sound recommendations for dealing with the problem.  But while the Minister paid a tribute to the members of the tribunal, the Bill, as introduced, pays them very small compliment, because, as a matter of fact, the Bill entirely spurns their recommendations.</P>
      <P>The main principle of this Bill, the backbone of the Bill, is the merger between the Great Southern Railways Company and the Dublin United Transport Company.  All the rest is, to a certain extent, padding, though necessary padding.  There is not the slightest hint in the report or in the recommendations of the tribunal with regard to that merger.  They have not made any such recommendation what ever.  The recommendations of the tribunal are under various headings with regard to the different types of public transport.  The report deals with the Great Southern Railways under one heading, and with the Dublin United Transport Company under another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2255" /> With regard to the Great Southern Railways Company, Deputies will see the recommendations starting in paragraph 170 of the report, page 82. Paragraph 170 starts off by setting out what the company has said about its difficulty in getting capital in order to carry on its business and it makes certain suggestions with regard to being allowed to borrow a further £2,000,000, setting out that that should be under a Government guarantee.  There is some suggestion of that kind &mdash;that the Government should give a guarantee.  The recommendation of the tribunal is at the end of page 82. This is what it says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have examined the question of direct investment by the Government in either debenture stock, preference stock, or ordinary stock and we are of opinion that direct investment is not the most desirable method of providing the company with the assistance it requires.  Instead, we recommend that the borrowing powers of the company should be increased and that the Government should fully guarantee the repayment of the principal and the payment of the interest in connection with an issue, in such manner as the company considers most advisable, of a further £1,250,000 debenture stock...&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>At 4 per cent. &mdash; a &ldquo;draft&rdquo; proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The paragraph proceeds:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...bearing interest at a rate not exceeding 4 per cent.  Per annum and ranking <i>pari passu</i> with the existing debenture stock of the company.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is the recommendation of the tribunal, committing the country and the Government&mdash;the taxpayer&mdash;to £1,250,000 annually.  And they did it with considerable hesitation.  They refused to accept what the company said they would require&mdash;a little over £2,000,000&mdash;and they thought they were going quite far and were being very generous in putting forward a recommendation that the Government should guarantee £1,250,000.  In paragraph 171 they say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2256" />&ldquo;The adoption of the recommendations which we have made so far would impose upon the Government not only heavy financial obligations, but the responsibility for the imposition of additional duties on forms of transport other than those made available by statutory transport organisations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They thought £1,250,000 was a heavy financial obligation.  I wonder what they think of the suggestion to provide £16,000,000?  They go on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We consider we would not be justified in making such recommendations without reasonable assurance that the methods of administration of the company during the next five years would result in maximum advantage being obtained therefrom, and that an opportunity would thereby be afforded of measuring the commercial possibilities of the company and at the same time of formulating a more enduring policy in regard to public transport as a whole than is now possible.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then they go on to make a recommendation to deal with the government of the company over a period of five years. They say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We recommend that for a period of five years, instead of the business of the company being carried on by seven part-time directors, operating through a general manager, the board should consist of three directors, two of whom would act in a part-time capacity and would be elected by the shareholders, while the remaining director, who would be chairman, would act in a whole-time capacity and would be nominated by the Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Not one word of dictatorship; not one word that the chairman nominated by the Government should be the complete controller.  They suggest two directors nominated or elected by the shareholders and presumably, because there is nothing said to the contrary, these two shareholders would have an equal voice with the chairman in the policy of running the railway.  There is a further suggestion about controllers who are not members of the board, and the qualifications they should have are set out.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2257" /> In paragraph 172 they speak of a national transport council.  It is only when you come to paragraph 175 that they actually make a recommendation. They say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To exercise such wide functions we recommend the establishment of a national transport council consisting of a small number of persons with special qualifications to deal with the complex economic, statistical, financial and general matters to be entrusted to their care.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Bill does not provide any such council, but a council is given some duties.  The last sentence in paragraph 172 is one the House should take to heart.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In particular it is of great importance that a clear and dispassionate appreciation of the factors affecting the success or failure of the Great Southern Railways Company under the new conditions should be available before any final conclusions are reached as to its future commercial possibilities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The suggestion there is that the transport council should be supervising the working of the railways under the new system of a chairman nominated by the Government, with two directors and two controllers watching it over a period of five years, and that a full report arising out of the inquiries they had made and the working which took place during that period should be available before any final conclusions were reached; in other words, before a Bill would be brought into this House and enacted.  That is almost entirely the recommendation with regard to the Great Southern Railways.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 173 goes on to deal with hauliers' licences.  Paragraph 174 emphasises the supervision that there should be over this £1,250,000 that the State was to put up.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government guarantee in respect of a sum not exceeding £1,250,000 for capital purposes should be utilised only after every precaution had been taken to ensure its productivity, and the council would advise the Minister as to the extent to which it was desirable that the <Col N="2258" /> guarantee should be made available. It would also fall within the scope of the activities of the council to have regard to the wider aspects of transport and to give consideration to such matters as the cost and condition of the roads carrying the bulk of the motor transport of the country and the incidence of taxation imposed for the building and upkeep of such roads.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a matter of very great importance to every local authority.  That is the recommendation of the Transport Tribunal for dealing with the position of the Great Southern Railways.</P>
    <P>They make recommendations also with regard to the Dublin Transport Company which start at paragraph 254. The Dublin Transport Company had suggested that they required to borrow a further £800,000 which should be repaid with the existing debenture stock of £300,000 over a period of ten years. This did not commend itself to the tribunal, because they felt, and I think very rightly and sensibly, that in order to repay that sum of £1,100,000 over a period of ten years, such fares would have to be charged by the Transport Company as would be unfair to the public.  They saw no reason why that £1,100,000 should be repaid over such a short period.  Instead, in the last sentence in paragraph 254, they say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We consider that the necessary capital should be raised by means of an issue of long-dated debenture stock, the company being empowered at any time after the expiration of, say, 15 years from the date of issue, to take advantage of the possibility of redeeming the stock by an issue of further stock at a cheaper rate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the principal recommendation made by the tribunal with regard to the Dublin Transport Company.  Paragraph 255 is of minor importance. Paragraph 256 refers to complaints made by the Dublin Transport Company with regard to competition by the railway companies in transport within the city, that is with regard to the running of buses for mystery tours, etc., and the recommendation in that respect was this:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2259" />&ldquo;We recommend that the competitive passenger traffic between the Tramway Company and the railway companies should be the subject of a `pooling' arrangement.  Such a pool would prevent wasteful and uneconomic competition, and would, therefore, be in the interests both of the general public and the companies concerned.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the nearest thing to anything in the nature of a merger.  As to the suggestion for pooling, I suggest that if there was that competition still going on&mdash;probably there is not during the war years&mdash;there would be an excellent opportunity for arranging that pooling as between the Great Southern Railways and the Transport Company, at any rate.  Since the managing director of the Dublin Transport Company has become chairman and practically dictator of the Great Southern Railways no difficulty can arise there now. These are recommendations which commit the State to nothing more than a guarantee of £1,250,000 to the Great Southern Railways.  The tribunal made no suggestion that the debenture stock issued by the Dublin Transport Company should be under a Government guarantee and the total commitment the State would incur under the report of the tribunal was a contingent one of £1,250,000.</P>
    <P>The proposal in the Bill is that the State should undertake the enormous liability of perhaps putting up the debenture dividends on a sum of £16,000,000.  That that is a very serious matter we can gather from the statement by the Minister for Finance when introducing the Budget the other day, at the end of page 38 of his typed statement, he says with regard to this guarantee:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The giving of this guarantee, which has become necessary for the protection and development of an essential undertaking, is one of the most important single financial transactions that has taken place in the history of the State.  No Minister for Finance can assume without misgiving such a heavy liability&mdash;however contingent it may be and however <Col N="2260" /> hopeful he is of the prospects of rail and road transport in this country.  In the present circumstances, when the impact of emergency conditions on transport is more severe than ever, and may, indeed, grow worse, no Minister in my place can be free from anxiety that the Exchequer may be in the shadow of coming obligations arising from this guarantee ... That is a possibility which must not be forgotten in any preview of public expenditure during the financial years that lie immediately ahead.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are very serious words in connection with this guarantee of £16,000,000.  I suggest to the House that they also should show anxiety with regard to committing the country to this contingent expenditure.  Towards the end of that page the Minister says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If the full amount of guaranteed debenture stock authorised by the new Bill, viz., £16,000,000, is issued by the company, it will represent an increase of 44 per cent. in the total contingent liabilities of the State. Both absolutely and relatively this transaction is obviously one of outstanding importance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that there is no such recommendation made by this tribunal who investigated the question of public transport, I think this House should not agree to the State undertaking that liability without further inquiry.  The Transport Tribunal only recommended that the State should commit itself to a liability of £1,250,000.  The Minister admitted that they had investigated the matter fully and he praised their report and paid tribute to them for the thoroughness with which they went into their work.  The most they recommended that the country should be committed to was a sum of £1,250,000.  Here, out of the blue, comes a proposal that the State should commit itself to a sum of £16,000,000 which, as the Minister for Finance points out, would mean an increase of 44 per cent. in the contingent liabilities of the State, and I assume that that means, in simple words, in the public debt of the State.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2261" /> Deputy Larkin and other Deputies referred, very rightly, to the provision in the Bill dealing with officers and servants.  For that provision alone, I think the Bill should be rejected unless there is some assurance from the Minister that it will be amended in Committee.  The proposal is that if any officer of the company loses his employment after a period of six months has elapsed he may go without compensation, because that is, in essence, what it means.  Deputy McGilligan referred to the Railways (Existing Officers and Servants) Act, 1926, which provided that the railway company, to avoid paying compensation, had to show that an officer or servant had not been dismissed as a result of the amalgamation of the railway companies during a period of seven years.  I think that was the effect of it.  Deputy McGilligan pointed out that he had discovered that the seven-years period was too short and that in fact there should be no period in relation to a matter of the kind.  In other words, if a man loses his employment as a result of any piece of legislation we pass, no limit should be put to the period during which he would be entitled to compensation for dismissal.</P>
    <P>It stands to reason.  Why should there be a limit?  If, when ten years have gone by, it is found that, entirely as a result of this Act&mdash;not because of any economies and not because of any alteration in the services&mdash;a man is dismissed, why should he, because that period of years has passed, be deprived of the right to compensation?  We ought to cut out the period altogether but, at any rate, we should not be less generous than the 1926 Act which Deputy McGilligan, who introduced it, has since found was not fair to the officers and servants, or at least to one of them whose case came to his notice. We have a new departure here also, in that for the first time we find chapters appearing in a Bill.  I do not think we have seen it in any of the enactments which have gone through this House.</P>
    <P>The next section in the chapter, Chapter 42, deals with the inauguration of a superannuation scheme.  It is <Col N="2262" /> a scheme which is to apply apparently to the new company.  Section 43 refers to the existing superannuation funds of dissolved companies.  I am given to understand that this is causing very considerable anxiety amongst railway officers who are members of the fund referred to in Section 43 (4), that is, the Railway Clearing System Superannuation Fund.  The governing body of that fund, I understand, is called the Railway Clearing System Superannuation Fund Corporation, and I do not know how the Minister is to work Section 43, if he carries out the proposal in Section 42.  I am entirely a child in these matters, but the officers concerned are very anxious about it, because they believe that, in the light of Section 42, it is not possible to carry out the assurances purported to be given in Section 43.</P>
    <P>They say that the corporation dealing with this clearing system superannuation fund is a body of the general managers of all the railways, both in Great Britain and Ireland, which are parties to the scheme, and of the representatives of the staffs.  It is established and conducted under statutory conditions laid down by the United Kingdom Parliament.  They say that the funds are entirely controlled in England and that, in the case of the death of any member here, probate has to be taken out in England in so far as what that member is entitled to from the fund is concerned.  They also say that no railway is admitted to this fund, unless the whole staff of the railway become members.  If what they say as to the cardinal principle in respect of the admission of a company&mdash;that all its salaried staff must be entered&mdash; is correct, it is not possible to have Section 42, unless it is in addition to continuation as a member of the fund, and I think the Minister should see that it is very carefully looked into before Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>On whatever date this Bill becomes law, the Great Southern Railways will cease to exist.  The company will become a dissolved company and the members going over to the new company will possibly find themselves in the position that their rights are gone. The Minister shakes his head, but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>To come back to the Bill as a whole, I think that the Dáil should be slow to allow the country to commit itself to a very big undertaking like this and such a big commitment of the country's finances.  The main principle of the Bill is to merge the Great Southern Railways Company with the Dublin Transport Company.  That is not a recommendation of the tribunal which sat on public transport.  We have not been told where the proposals came from and we have not been told the reasons for their introduction now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been given no reason why the recommendations of the tribunal that a period of five years in normal times of peace should not have been considered, in order to make a complete study of the problem, before committing ourselves to any final limitation in this matter.  If we adopt <Col N="2265" /> that suggestion, the country would not be involved in anything more than £1,250,000 gross debt, even if it were necessary over a period of five or six, or seven, or even eight, or nine years, while the problem was being studied, to subsidise the railways.  It would be far better and cheaper for the country to undertake that subsidy than to commit ourselves to proposals which deal with such a huge involvement of public funds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lynch has made reference to the Report of the Transport Tribunal.  I read it very carefully, and I must say that I thought it rather a dreary document.  The best friend of that tribunal could not describe its report as a very inspired production.  I invite the Dáil to turn its attention for a moment from a report, which emanates from that body, that Government guaranteed loans in this country should bear interest at 4 per cent., to the Minority Report of Dr. Henry Kennedy which, in my judgement, is a more valuable document.</P>
      <P>I hope, Sir, before departing from the Majority Report, that we have passed for ever from the day when Government guaranteed loans in this country will be issued at 4 per cent. With the report of Dr. Henry Kennedy, the Minority Report, I want to say that I agree, and I want to suggest to this House that this Bill, stripped of its verbiage is really a speculators' Bill.  It is a Bill designed to ensure that the speculators will get what they hoped to get.  Here is Paragraph 2 of Dr. Henry Kennedy's report written in 1939:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The full gravity of the financial position of the Great Southern Railways Company is not shown clearly in the accounts.  Representatives of the company in evidence before the Tribunal have stated that, in order to maintain satisfactory standards, an average annual expenditure of £600,000 would be essential for maintenance and renewals of the permanent way and works, and an equal sum for maintenance and renewals of the rolling stock.  These amounts are relatively lower than the figures for <Col N="2266" /> maintenance and renewals submitted by the Great Northern Railway Company for its undertaking.  The officers of the Great Southern Railways Company have frankly admitted the very unsatisfactory condition of the rolling stock, and especially of the passenger coaches, explaining that that condition is due to financial stringency, and consequent inability to provide adequate renewals.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;3.  The chief Engineer has in recent years given only a modified certificate with regard to the condition of the permanent way and works.  The company has stated that expenditure has been reduced to the irreducible minimum consistent with safety. There seems to be no reason to doubt the accuracy of the estimate submitted by the company.  One result of the reduced expenditure is shown in the evidence that in order to maintain services on the branch lines, which it is proposed to close, an expenditure of £1,238,070 would be essential over the next five years. The deficiency in maintenance, rather than evidence of the operating economy, seems to have been the major consideration in the proposal to terminate services on the branch lines.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This report, based on the evidence of the company's own officers, reveals that the rolling stock and permanent way of the company were not only inadequate, but almost dangerous, because the engineer was prepared to give them only a qualified certificate. This report shows that the company itself believed that immense sums would be necessary to put the company's property in a safe condition. Nevertheless, with that before them, the evidence on which it was based, and the summing up of a member of the Commission, speculators entered the market and drove the price of the stocks up by 100 per cent. on the Stock Exchange, and in some cases, substantially more.  That having taken place, we are presented with a Bill which, in effect, proposes that the Great Southern Railways Company is to be bolstered up on the one side by the acquisition of the Dublin United <Col N="2267" /> Transport Company, a traditionally prosperous and well-managed enterprise, and on the other side by a £16,000,000 Government guarantee.</P>
    <P>After you have read the chapters and paragraphs and sections of the Transport Bill, is not that what it amounts to, that every fellow who bought stock from poor people and held it until it doubled and trebled in value on the Stock Exchange, is going to get his plunder in the shape of the Dublin United Transport Company and £16,000,000 of public money?  I exhort Dáil Eireann to vote against a Bill, the only substantial effect of which, so far as we can see at this stage, is to provide the speculators of the Dublin Stock Exchange with comfortable profits, and, mind you, not only the speculators resident in Éire but other cute international crooks who got wind of the word through the usual channels and have been operating on the London Stock Exchange as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

Or is it more reasonable to suggest that the &ldquo;cute boys&rdquo; went in and bought the shares in that undertaking to hold them in anticipation, in well-founded anticipation, <Col N="2268" /> that they were going to rise to double and treble their value because the Dublin United Transport Company would be absorbed by the new undertaking?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>All I want to do now is to record the fact that the Stock Exchange quotations for Great Southern Railways stocks have appreciated two or three times.  That proves that those who held the stocks during the period were right.  That is the only substantial and concrete factor of significance in this Bill.  I am asking Dáil Eireann to say to the speculators, foreign and domestic, that they have slipped up, and that they are not going to get the swag they expected, and let them sell their shares as best they may.  I would be glad if the House <Col N="2269" /> took the decision, so that these sharks would be left with their shares, and would not be given time to unload them on unwary people who would otherwise be left holding the baby.</P>
      <P>I listened with some dismay to my friend Deputy Fionán Lynch.  His speech was trenchant and clear, but I gathered from it as I listened that his proposal is that we should set up another transport tribunal.  We have had several transport tribunals, and surely it is not proposed that we should set up another?  If we are going to establish a transport tribunal every five years, the history of transport in this country will be a history of transport tribunals, because every time we try to make some progress, it can be argued that the report on which we are proceeding is out of date.  In the meantime, the grass will grow on the railway lines and the transport system will collapse.</P>

      <P>I want to make a proposal to the Government which I think is reasonable and right.  The railway company is &ldquo;bust&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;bust&rdquo; wide open&mdash;and everybody knows it.  The only thing that has maintained the company is the monstrous increase in railway freight rates which has taken place, with the Minister's approval, over the last two years.  I think very few Deputies realise the reckless and unscrupulous way in which railway rates have been increased in the past two years.  I direct the attention of the House to the <i>Quarterly Statistical Bulletin of the Central Bank</i>, which gives a return of railway receipts. That return, No. 15, shows that the goods train receipts have risen from £3,500,000 in 1941 to £4,242,000 in 1943. Let me make a comparison.  In 1939, they were £2,635,000.  In 1943, they were £4,242,000, and in 1944, they are still rising steeply.  Will anyone argue that there is a larger volume of goods carried over the railways to-day than in 1939?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Much more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If there were, the increase might be in the order of not <Col N="2270" /> more than 50 per cent.  That would give Deputy Davin a full and ample margin.  The increases, however, amount nearly to 100 per cent., and certainly to 75 per cent. I could have brought here freight bills to show the specific additions to the charges, but, perhaps, at this stage it is scarcely appropriate to go into such great detail.  It is known to anybody interested in transport that railway rates have shot up and that it is only the increased revenue derived from that increase which has kept the railway company in existence.</P>
      <P>I propose to the Government that instead of pursuing the utterly disreputable and fantastic Bill now before the House, they should make up their minds to adopt the minority report of the Railway Tribunal and set up a transport board analogous in constitution to the Electricity Supply Board, which would take over the railway company, the Transport Company and, if necessary, the Grand Canal Company.  I suggest now the names of two persons who might act as directors, Mr. Reynolds and Dr. Henry Kennedy. Dr. Kennedy is the kind of man, I believe, who would effectively represent rural interests on the board.  I think these two men should be accompanied by three others so that you would have a board&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Not of yes-men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we should have a board constituted almost identical with the Electricity Supply Board, and I say that my experience of the Electricity Supply Board is that after it had got over its teething troubles&mdash; it was inclined to be somewhat dictatorial in the earlier stages&mdash;it matured. I can only speak of what I know in saying that in dealing with the Electricity Supply Board, as it is now, you are dealing with an efficient, a reasonable and expeditious body.  You have the feeling that that organisation has developed what is so difficult to secure in monopolies such as this is: a desire not only to serve the community as a whole but also a desire to ensure that every customer it has will be satisfied with the service it offers.  I suggest that, the transport board having been <Col N="2271" /> established, we should, by legislation, authorise it to take over the railway company, the Dublin Transport Company and, if thought desirable, the Canal Company, at the average Stock Exchange quotation for the year 1938.  I do not think it would be fair to fix the year 1939, because the incidence of the war caused a downward tendency in share values on the Stock Exchange in 1939, but if we take the valuation placed on the concerns in 1938, then I feel that although we are not being over-generous, at least we are not being unreasonable and we are giving the shareholders in those two companies a reasonable price for their enterprise. Nobody would argue that the condition of the railway company improved since 1938, and I do not suppose that the Dublin Transport Company would argue that the condition of their enterprise had materially improved since that date.</P>
      <P>That having been done, I do not think I want to say at this stage that it is possible for Dáil Eireann to set itself up as a board of directors to run a transport company.  There is no use in my pretending that I can sit down here and discuss transport with the same authority as men who have been in the transport business all their lives. I think it is a great mistake for the Legislature, even when it decides to nationalise a public service, thereupon to resolve that Dáil Eireann must be consulted about every detail of the administration of the service it has been decided to take over.  No body of shareholders claims the right to check up on the day-to-day policy of the board of directors of a company, nor are they competent to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Shareholders, ordinarily, invest their money in an enterprise, which appears to them to hold prospects of success, on condition that the board of directors of that company is a body of men in whose judgment and capacity they have confidence.  I suggest, therefore, to Dáil Eireann that if we take over the business of transport in this country, and are resolving to operate it, not as a speculative undertaking but as an essential public service, we have <Col N="2272" /> an opportunity, having taken over that enterprise, of choosing the best men that we ourselves want and appointing them as directors of the company. That done, and despite my devotion to the principles of democracy, I think we should leave the management of the transport industry to that board of directors, and then, if we find it unsatisfactory, if we find that adequate facilities have not been provided, if we find that charges are unreasonably high or that labour conditions are not consistent with what we think right and proper, we have an opportunity in this House of dealing with that board of directors when their annual report is presented here.  When the transport board reports to this House annually, in the same way as the Electricity Supply Board does, we can call the whole conduct of the board into question and we can call on the Government of the day to carry into effect any changes that we think requisite in the constitution or administration of that board to secure the broad objectives which we consider are not being adequately served by the board as then constituted.</P>
    <P>Now, no matter how good a board we establish, I suggest that it is a desirable thing to preserve the element of competition in order to spur that board on to its best endeavour.  The longer I live in this world the more I am convinced that competition is the greatest blessing that any businessman can secure.  The old view was that if you had a shop, you wanted no rival set up against you in your immediate neighbourhood.  My experience, after 20 years of running a shop, is that the more Woolworths, the more Liptons, the more Home and Colonials that are set up near me, the better I do my job and the more money I make, and I also found that the less Woolworths, the less Liptons, and the less Home and Colonials are set up near me-the less competition, in other words, which used to be called unfair competition&mdash; the more I am inclined to stick my foot in the ground and grow like a cabbage.</P>
    <P>For that reason, having created such a monopoly as I have envisaged, I <Col N="2273" /> think we should ensure for the consuming public, the users of transport, that competition should be preserved, and the way to secure proper competition here is to guarantee the right of every individual citizen to use his own vehicles for the transport of his own goods and for the transport of his own person, thus ensuring that if the Transport Board does not give adequate service, larger and larger numbers of citizens will purchase their own lorries and their own cars and travel on the roads in preference to using the railways or the vehicles made available by the board.  I do not think that we should, on establishing this new board, close down the railway company or the railway system.  That would be a mistake, but I think we should make up our minds to the fact that the railways are dying and that in a comparatively short time they will be as archaic and out of date as the Bianconi coaches of former days.</P>
    <P>It may take 20 years or it may take 30 years, but certainly the younger Deputies of this House will live to see the entire goods and passenger transport of this country on the roads, and I think that one of the essential steps necessary to take&mdash;and I observe with interest that it is also contained in both the majority and minority reports of the Transport Tribunal&mdash;is to plan and put in hand without delay a system of roads in this country adequate to carry, not the volume of traffic at present available, but the volume of traffic that those who are most competent to judge forecast as being available 30 years from now.  There, is a project upon which labour could be employed. There, is a project for which 85 per cent. of the raw materials are available here in our own country.  There, is a project which would make possible a suggestion which I intend to make in connection with the Budget debate, and that is that the payment of the dole to unmarried men in this country should for ever cease and let every unmarried man who is looking for the dole get out and help the nation to build that system of roads that the nation will require, if and when the forecast that I now make comes to pass.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2274" /> Now, some people will say that, strategically, it would be suicide ever to close down the railways and thus leave ourselves dependent on the rubber and petrol requisite to operate road transport.  That is a shortsighted view, and an ignorant view, to boot.  Firstly, I do not think that petrol will be the principal fuel of future transport.  I think that the principal fuel is much more likely to be fuel oil, and that the Diesel engine will supplant the petrol-driven engine in a comparatively short space of time.  A certain amount of imports from abroad would be required in that case, but the fact is that any system of railways in this country depends almost entirely on the import of raw materials.  Many people think that if you can fuel the locomotive engines with turf, the trains could run for ever.  That, of course, is nonsense. You could run small trains on branch lines for short runs with reasonable efficiency by using turf as fuel, but when it comes to the high-powered engines on the main lines, they could not be operated on turf; they could not generate enough steam on turf to make a long run with a heavy train. Furthermore, no train can be run for more than a day without lubricants. Even if we had all the fuel that we required, the lack of grease would bring the transport of this country to a stand-still.  There is also the question of spare parts which are not available in this country.  Steel and iron are not available in this country unless we import them, and these are constantly requisite to keep a railway in running order.  The rails for the railway trains to run on have to be provided.  All these things represent imports with just as much force as do Diesel oil, petroleum and rubber. Even the Taoiseach and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Department of Local Government and Public Health have come to the conclusion that self-sufficiency is all &ldquo;cod&rdquo; and they are beating a strategic and dignified retreat from that position. Sooner or later the more obscurantist and childish of their followers will realise that the Chief has turned tail though he is still looking in the same direction, and proceed to back gracefully <Col N="2275" /> out of the self-sufficiency position. That they have all to get out of it is manifest, from the point of view of maintaining essential services. Whether these services depend on rail or road transport, certain supplies from outside are necessary and, in effect, no more for road transport than they are for rail.</P>
    <P>I hear it frequently alleged that people who get up here to discuss legislation confine themselves to criticism and that they refuse to make alternative proposals.  I have made four proposals here to-day.  Each one of them, I think, is first-class.  One I made was to disappoint the speculators. Let us leave them holding the baby.  That would be a great day's work for this House.  If we made it clear to-day that we were not going to give the speculators the swag they calculated on, just imagine the effect on the Dublin Stock Exchange. Imagine the &ldquo;boys&rdquo; who had £75,000 worth of debentures waking up to discover that these were worth only £30,000 and that they had to make good the £40,000 or £45,000 which they had borrowed from the bank to speculate in these stocks.  Imagine the dismay of the worriors who had bought some £60,000 or £70,000 worth of preference shares from poor widows and their neighbours who had held these shares for years without getting any dividend.  The swag taken from these widows has trebled and quadrupled, but imagine the speculators waking up to find that what they thought would be worth £20,000 was worth only £3,000.  Would that not be a public service?  I invite Dáil Eireann to join with me in that pious public service of taking from the burglar his swag, taking from the brigand his spoils.</P>
    <P>My second proposal is that instead of paying out £16,000,000 of public money to line the pockets of the Stock Exchange speculator, we ought to take over the transport enterprise of this country at a fair price and give to the owners a fair price, that we ought to provide an element of competition by the preservation of the right of the private individual to run his own lorry and car, that we ought to build an <Col N="2276" /> adequate system of roads forthwith to carry any traffic that may accrue over the next 40 years, and that we ought to make up our minds hereafter that, if there is to be any profit made in the transport of goods in this country it will accrue to the community, and that if this great investment is essential in order to preserve adequate transport for the commerce and trade of the country, the profit on that investment will accrue to those who make it, the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I want to make this suggestion. Everybody says that post-war one of our most valuable invisible exports will be our tourist traffic.  Large sums are being made available to the Tourist Development Board in order to improve the amenities and beauty spots of this country for the tourist trade.  An absolute <i>sine qua non</i> to the full user of those facilities is an adequate road system because 95 per cent. of the post-war tourists are going to be in their own cars.  They are not going to travel to any remote part of the country without carrying with them the assurance that they can move freely about to any particular beauty spot they have chosen to visit.  Good roads then will be an immense additional inducement to foreign visitors to come to this country, roads prudently and discreetly constructed, adequate for the real needs of the country but not constructed in such a way as to destroy the amenities of the remoter and more secluded parts of the country which must ever remain less commercialised than those areas where the system of transport must be designed to meet commercial needs.</P>
    <P>I want to make one more suggestion. If my proposals were put before the House to-morrow morning they would be carried unanimously.  Is there any single Deputy who would object to taking over control of the present transport system of the country and using it for the good of the country through a transport board which we could establish for that purpose?  Is there any single Deputy on the Fianna Fáil Benches who objects to the principle which I adumbrate?  The Government's proposals are to ram down our throats a proposal to vindicate <Col N="2277" /> every unscrupulous speculator who has been operating on the Stock Exchange, at a cost described by the Minister for Finance as one of the most formidable liabilities this State has ever undertaken. That is the proposal which it is sought to thrust upon us by holding the whip over the reluctant heads of members of the Fianna Fáil Party who do not believe in this Bill.  I am making a proposal which I believe will be acceptable to every member of the Government Party, which will be accepted, I am sure, by the majority of the Fine Gael Party, which certainly goes very much nearer to what the Labour Party stands for than the present proposal and which, I think, will meet with the approval of Clann na Talmhan.</P>
    <P>If this is a democratic Assembly, and if our purpose is to do that which the majority of the House think best, why not withdraw the Bill and accept my proposal?  It is really a proposal that does not reflect on anybody; it will achieve justice for all, and it will be launched with the best of good-will from all sides of this House.  The Minister's mangy proposal is to be thrust down the throats of the Opposition and forced upon the reluctant members of the Government Party.  Which is better?  Surely mine.  I understand the proposal I put forward now bears some likeness to proposals that were once adumbrated by the Minister himself. Why has he changed his mind?</P>

      <P>Why has he changed his mind?  Why has he run away from what he used to advocate at one time? I always believed that if these things could be operated by private enterprise it would be better to maintain that system but I am forced to the conclusion by the course of events that the maintenance of a satisfactory transport system in this country open to competition is no longer possible. Whether that is the fault of the directors of the old railway company or is due to the trend of world events I am not in a position to say and I do not think it is profitable to discuss the matter.  The facts confront us.  Let us <Col N="2278" /> think the whole thing over and do the best we can.  If we do half as well with the Transport Board which has been adumbrated as Deputy McGilligan did with the Electricity Supply Board, we shall have every reason to be proud of it.  There is, probably, as much ability available to manage the affairs of this Transport Board as Deputy McGilligan had at his disposal when he established the Electricity Supply Board and, given in the early stages, the goodwill which the Electricity Supply Board received from the majority of our people, I think we should be able to make a success of it. The Electricity Supply Board was adversely criticised at one time by influential members of the present Government. I can remember the Minister for Local Government and Public Health screaming about the horrible white elephant which had been left to the incoming Fianna Fáil Government by their predecessors in office.  I often wonder if the Minister now scratched his head and asks himself where we would be but for that white elephant of Cumann na nGaedheal.  The Electricity Supply Board was misrepresented in its early stages and vigorous efforts were made to destroy it by the Party which now constitutes the Government of this country.  If the Minister sets up a transport board on the lines I suggest, no efforts will be made to destroy it and no lying campaign will be preached against it.  No slanderous suggestion that it is a slave camp will be made.  On the contrary, all Parties will do what they can by way of advice and recommendation to make it a success.</P>
      <P>I look forward with hope to the emergence of something enduring which will reflect as much credit on the State that established it as the Electricity Supply Board.  I make a suggestion which will be acceptable to all sides of the House against the Minister's suggestion which, in truth, is acceptable to none.  There is time for the Minister to mend his hand and arrive at agreement with the Dáil on his proposals.  If he does not, I think that the future of transport is extremely gloomy.  If he does, I think we may reasonably anticipate success.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Higgins moved a motion which is being discussed with the Second-Reading Motion in connection with this Bill. That motion provided for the suspension of further discussion of the Bill until the report of the tribunal at present sitting is available.  I should like to support Deputy Dr. O'Higgins's motion as strongly as I can.  Deputies on non-Government Benches have facilitated the Government with any legislation required.  They were always ready to give the Government, in exceptional circumstances, the measures they desired with the least possible discussion.  There has been no instance in which that help has been refused.  The Opposition do not believe that there was any necessity for hurrying this measure in the manner in which it has been hurried. When the transport difficulty arose lately, the matter was referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  They recommended that certain privileges be given to the Government in connection with the Estimates.  They also suggested that the House sit all day on Tuesday and Wednesday of each week.  That arrangement placed at the disposal of the Government more time per week than has ever been available to any Government here.  The Government has at its disposal a greater number of parliamentary hours per week than was available at any time since this country became self-governing.  Notwithstanding that, the Government asked us to rush the consideration of this measure.  It was considered so important that it could not wait for a week or two so that Deputies would have a chance of discussing it properly. Most Deputies live far from Dublin. I live 150 miles away.  We come up here on Monday to facilitate the Government owing to the rush.  We travel all day on Monday and work all day on Tuesday and Wednesday, without a moment to attend to the other business which Deputies have to discharge.  If Deputies desire to transact other business for their constituents, they must either stay here over the week-end or do their business <Col N="2280" /> by correspondence from their homes. That takes a great deal of time and effort.  Between the time the Bill was presented and Deputies were called upon to discuss it, reasonable attention could not be given to it.  I venture to say that only a few Deputies on the front benches of the different Parties had knowledge of the details of this Bill on the first day on which this debate opened.</P>
      <P>If other Deputies have a better knowledge of the Bill now, that is mainly due to the speeches delivered by Deputies who had more time than country Deputies to read and understand the measure.  I frankly say that at the time this Bill came before the House, I knew nothing about it.  I had not the time at my disposal to read it or to try to understand its contents. I have somewhat more knowledge of it now but that is mainly due to listening to men who knew more about the subject than I did and who had more time to consider the provisions of the Bill.  I think that the House ought to support the motion that the discussion be postponed until the findings of the tribunal, which has been set up to inquire into certain matters which have been mentioned here, are available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the Bill, Deputy Dillon said that the Great Southern Railways Company, as it exists, is down and out.  I do not know that those were his exact words, but that was their effect.  I am in agreement with that opinion. Everybody knew during the past seven to ten years that the Great Southern Railways Company could not profitably carry on.  Its existence as a profit-making undertaking had ceased.  It was only by various remedies, if they can be so described, that it was kept in operation at all.  A number of things were done to help the company. There were amalgamations.  Following the amalgamations, a number of competing transport concerns were put out of operation.  Then, there was a watering down of capital, so that overhead charges, in the way of interest on capital, would be less if there was any chance of a profit being made.  The remission of the rates in connection with their agricultural lands was a great <Col N="2281" /> boon to the railway company.  Yet, with all these facilities in the way of reduction in capital charges, remission of overhead expenses, the company was insolvent and most people envisaged a situation, in the not far distant future, when the operations of the Great Southern Railways Company must collapse. That was a position that the Government would have to meet, but I am quite sure nobody expected that they would meet it by asking the House, without any particular discussion, to pass £16,000,000, and probably £20,000,000, to bolster up a concern which everybody knows is in a decaying and dying condition.  It would be different if the House were sure that this £16,000,000 or £20,000,000&mdash;I frankly admit that I am not quite certain of the sum involved&mdash;would mean that the company would be put in such a position that they could guarantee efficient transport service for ten, 15 or 20 years, and that it would be able to repay the principal and interest.</P>
    <P>I should like to know of anyone who sees any probability that, even with the extra facilities which the Minister proposes to give them in this Bill, the company will be able to provide interest on its stocks in the years to come. If, in the past, with monopolies and other facilities, the company was not able to pay a dividend on most of their stocks, is there any probability that in the years to come, when conditions will be changing and when there will be greater competition with other forms of transport, the company will be in any better position in regard to earning power?  I know the Minister is attempting to place them in a better position by wiping out all possible competition but even with that, as far as anybody can foresee, there is little probability of their being able to repay the interest on the money which it is proposed to grant them.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that he disliked subsidies and that he hesitated to give subsidies that might be considered necessary in other circumstances.  But what is this but a subsidy?  What are the proposals the Minister present to the House but subsidies?  Is not the guarantee of capital and interest, under present circumstances, a subsidy?  As <Col N="2282" /> far as one can see, it is a direct subsidy because nobody foresees that the capital or interest will ever be repaid. Is not the compulsory acquisition and handing over to this company of another successful and solvent company a direct subsidy?  If it is not, I do not know what subsidy means.</P>
    <P>There will be strong objection to the proposal in the Bill to set up the new company under the authority of one man.  I do not care who the man is that it is proposed to select, the House generally considers that no one man should be entrusted with the powers that it is proposed to give him under this Bill.  I do not know if there is in this country any man with such comprehensive knowledge and experience of railway working, who has earned such a record for railway traffic management in this or any other country, that he could be entrusted safely with the powers proposed in this Bill.  When the Minister thought fit to entrust the management of the Great Southern Railways Company practically to one official, he did not select a railway man; he brought in a man who had no knowledge of railway working.  We do not know whether or not under the new Bill somebody with very little knowledge of railway working may be placed at the head of this concern, who, for a number of years, may learn his business at the taxpayer's expense and, through lack of knowledge and experience of the particular work, may create all kinds of difficulties.</P>
    <P>I should rather favour the proposal of Deputy Dillon that, if we must have a national transport concern, it should be something on the lines of the Electricity Supply Board, consisting of a board of four or five or six of the most competent men the country could select, some of whom would have the best possible experience in the management of railways.  The transport of this country should be entrusted to such a body.  Experience has proved that it worked well in the case of the Electricity Supply Board although, when the Electricity Bill was first introduced, there were hardly any men in the country who had extensive knowledge of that particular problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2283" /> The difficulty that most Deputies will find in voting for this measure is that the entire management is entrusted to one individual who may or may not have, and probably will not have, any extensive knowledge of railway traffic.</P>
    <P>I have one other great objection to the Bill, that is, the reappearance of the compulsory acquisition clause.  It is proposed compulsorily to acquire the assets and business of the Dublin United Transport Company.  Compulsory acquisition is not altogether a new thing in this country.  It has been applied in two or three other cases, but I think the further extension of the principle is not desirable. Many of us in the agricultural community are familiar with the principle of compulsory acquisition of land, and know how it ended, in many cases amounting practically to confiscation. When discussing this measure we cannot forget that we did not then get the sympathy we expected from other interests in this House.  Very little sympathy of that kind was expressed by the representatives of industry until quite recently.  When it comes now to the acquisition of a big concern like the Dublin United Transport Company perhaps the shoe begins to pinch.  There is one satisfaction in this case, the Dublin United Transport Company shareholders are going to be better provided for than the people from whom land was acquired. If I were a Dublin Deputy, I think I would have pretty strong views in opposition to the acquisition of the Dublin United Transport Company. Do these Deputies realise that they are about to hand over an efficient, and a profit-bearing concern, which provides internal as well as external transport for areas up to 20 miles from the city at very reasonable rates? They are going to hand that concern over to people who provided to be inefficient, who failed to run the railways in the manner in which they should be run with the result that the company became bankrupt.</P>
    <P>Can Deputies visualise what prospects <Col N="2284" /> there are of cheap transport in future?  I happened to travel in a bus recently that goes to a place 20 miles from the city.  I produced a few shillings change for my fare, but not thinking that would be sufficient, I tendered a ten shilling note, but the conductor said that the silver was sufficient. When I handed him 2/- he gave me back 6d. change.  The return fare was also 1/6.  In contrast to that I find when I travel by bus from the village where I reside, to the City of Limerick, the distance being three miles shorter than the Dublin one, I am charged exactly double the fare by the Great Southern Railways, so that Dublin citizens get for 3/- what I pay 6/- for.  That is because the Great Southern Railways are not able to run their bus service as efficiently as the Dublin Transport Company.  That is a benefit that the Minister may be the means of depriving Dublin citizens of in future, as it is obvious that if these services are handed over to the Great Southern Railways, as well as a capital of £2,000,000 and a good business in order to bolster up the Great Southern Railways Company, this Bill will not result in a wiping out of the difference in fares that I indicated.  Is it not more likely that the fares may be raised?</P>
    <P>I wish also to refer to the position of private owners.  The Minister says that they are not affected by the Bill. Perhaps that is so.  I should like to have a definition of &ldquo;private owner&rdquo;. I assume that these words include commercial firms and limited companies that own lorries on which they carry their goods.  I want to know definitely if &ldquo;private owner&rdquo; includes concerns like co-operative creameries with lorries in which they carry their products.  Is the transport business of co-operative creameries to be handed over to the new railway company or do these concerns remain in the category of &ldquo;private owner&rdquo; ?  It seems to me that there is a danger there.  There is a fear in the minds of many people that that is one of the objects of this Bill, because in recent months there has been in my constituency a gradual disposition on the part of the Minister's Department to put lorries owned by co-operative creameries out of operation. <Col N="2285" /> I have many applications from managers of creameries asking me to intercede with the Department so that supplies of petrol would be provided for these lorries.  The Minister will probably argue that that has nothing to do with this Bill; that the issue of permits for petrol was suspended because it was not available, and that there will be a re-issue when it is available.  I am not at all sure that that is the reason why some of these lorries were not allowed to operate. I know of one very large co-operative creamery whose lorries had to go out of operation because the Minister's Department would not issue permits, and the transport part of the business had to be transferred to the Great Southern Railways.  Experience has shown that they are not getting as efficient service from the Great Southern Railways as they could provide with their own lorries, and the business has not been running on the lines on which it was run previously.  In fact in many ways that creamery is hampered.  They also find that their expenses will be from £600 to £700 per year more than they were.  Their computation is that the amount of petrol consumed by the Great Southern Railways services on their work, as against the quantity they required, would be greater by from 150 to 200 gallons per month. The case cannot be made there that it was necessary to save petrol and that that is the reason why the lorries of this co-operative creamery were not allowed to operate.  Suspicion may arise in the minds of those concerned that that portion of the business was put out of operation so that when this Bill becomes an Act they will not be able to resume that side of the work.</P>

If there is no intention of putting these co-operative <Col N="2286" /> creamery lorries out of operation why are they not allowed to operate now? It is not because the petrol is not there.  They can prove that the railway company is using more petrol than they were using.  It must be for some ulterior motive, so that these lorries would not be operating when this Bill becomes an Act and that they would not then be allowed on the road.</P>

      <P>I am obliged to Deputy MacEoin, but whether the power is under this Bill, or some other Bill, it does not matter.  If I have made a blunder in discussing this Bill it all goes to prove what I said at the opening of my speech, and what the mover of the amendment said in his speech, that the House should not have been <Col N="2287" /> asked to discuss this Bill in such haste. Deputies should have been given sufficient time to enable them to grasp the full contents of it.  I am simply endeavouring to extract some idea of what is in the Bill and of what is not in it.  I am afraid that most of us here have a very vague idea of what the Bill contains.  Even Deputies who have read the Bill carefully and have pondered over it, have not been able to give it the consideration that they feel themselves would enable them to describe in clear language to the House what the Bill means or does not mean. I have listened to this debate for the last three days.  With the exception of the Minister, I have not heard any Deputy say that he clearly understood what are the implications of this measure and what its general effect will be.  In such circumstances, is it any wonder that I should look to the Minister for an explanation as to what he intends to do with private lorries owned by co-operative creameries: whether there is any danger of their being put out of operation in the future?  The Minister would relieve our minds if he were to tell us that these lorries will be put back into operation again in cases where it can be proved to him that their going back on the roads would mean no loss of petrol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill will also have very grave effects on the unfortunate employees of the railway company.  The question of redundancy has been argued pretty generally.  We would like to know what men will be put out of work because of redundancy.  Deputy Larkin described some of the things which he would not consider redundancy. At any rate, whatever be the meaning of redundancy, every Deputy must have sympathy for the possible conditions which will obtain in the case of those railway workers when the Bill is put into operation.  I do not profess to be able to define clearly what redundancy means.  My reading of the Bill is that, if a worker is lucky enough, for some reason or another, to be put out of work before a certain number of months elapse, he will be considered to be redundant and will get some compensation.  If, however, <Col N="2288" /> he is not lucky in that respect and is discharged under some other head, then he is going to be unprovided for.  Surely that is a state of affairs that no Deputy should subscribe to.  The debate on this measure has been unreal.  The Taoiseach nods his head.  I agree that a number of us who have spoken on it have done so without sufficient knowledge.  The fault for that lies with the Minister. The Bill was in the hands of Deputies for only two days when it was taken in the House.</P>

      <P>The Minister supposes that we had nothing to do for two days except read the papers.  That is a nice compliment.  I hope that is not the view of other Ministers.  We are working four days a week for the State.  If the Minister thinks that the representatives of the farmers and of agriculture have so little stake in the country that they are not to have any day to work for themselves, and that facilities are not to be provided for <Col N="2289" /> them to do their own work, then the future of agriculture in this country is in a very bad condition and agriculture is very badly represented in this House.  I do not believe, however, that it is so badly represented.  I believe that we have farmers and farmer-representatives on the Government Benches, on the Clann na Talmhan Benches and on the Fine Gael Benches with sufficient work of their own to do, and with a sufficient interest in that work to occupy them for at least two days in the week.  If they give four days a week to the service of the country, then I think they are doing their bit and should not be asked to do what is happening in the case of this Bill, to discuss a measure for which sufficient time has not been given.  Sufficient time was not given to Deputies to prepare for a discussion on this Bill.</P>

Other things that were not quite as important have been repeated.  There is no necessity whatever for hurry in connection with this Bill.  Not a tittle of evidence has been given to show why there should be all this haste.  The discussion on the Bill could have been held over for another two or three weeks so that Deputies would have had an opportunity of preparing for a discussion on it.  I believe that, in common decency, the discussion on this Bill should have been postponed until the tribunal, which is investigating the doings of certain people in this country, has presented its report.</P>

      <P>The last speaker said that there was an air of unreality about this debate.  I think that anybody really interested in this matter will say there is a good deal of truth in what he said.  The debate has been <Col N="2290" /> very unreal, very far away from the real subject before the House.  It would be helpful, I think, if we could get back to the position as it is, and not to what people imagine it to be. This Bill is a fairly bulky document, but I think we have had very much longer Bills before us.  Everybody with experience of the House knows perfectly well that it is in Committee the details of a measure such as this are fully discussed, and that the object of a Second Reading debate is to get at the general principles underlying a particular measure.  On any occasion when I have been in the House during the discussion on this Bill, except when the Minister was explaining the measure, the speeches seemed to me to be very far away from the general principles of the Bill.  It is suggested that we are rushing this legislation. We are doing nothing of the sort. Everybody must admit that, for very many years, our transport services have been in an altogether unsatisfactory position and that the sooner we improve that position the better.  We have been told we are not looking sufficiently far ahead and planning for the post-war period.  There are some things which we cannot plan ahead satisfactorily, as the details are not sufficiently well know to us.  Surely anything we can do now in the way of work which would have to be done after the war, will help to prepare us for the difficult situation which may arise then.  If we postponed action in this matter, the Government might be justly accused of not taking time by the forelock, of not doing now the things we could do.  Everybody will admit that our transport services will have an important part to play in the future development of our country.  If we can improve them now, why should we postpone doing so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested that sufficient time has not been given to Deputies to understand the principle of the Bill, which is the question on the Second Reading.  Is that right?  Is that true? In March, 1943, the Minister indicated that he had been in touch with the management of the company and that proposals were being considered for reorganisation. <Col N="2291" /> Some months later, he told the Dáil that we had to go further and indicated that legislation would ultimately be necessary.  Then, during the general election, the Minisster pointed out that legislation would be necessary to deal with the transport situation.  The definite proposals which form the basis of this Bill and the main point of principle in it were published in October last, as far as the Great Southern Railways was concerned, and were indicated in December, as far as the Dublin United Transport Company was concerned. I think that there was a discussion on the matter in the Seanad in January last.  Therefore, over that whole period since October and December, everybody knew the main basis of the proposals.</P>
    <P>The Bill was circulated eleven days before the Second Reading began. That is a reasonable time to give to people, particularly when there was circulated with the Bill a White Paper, summarising in four pages the principal points in the Bill.  In my opinion, the suggestion that Deputies did not get reasonable time to prepare for a Second Reading speech on this Bill has not a leg to stand on.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bennett seemed to think that Deputies were here for the convenience of the Government.  Deputies are here to do the business for which they were elected and not to convenience the Government.  If they come here, they come to do public business and it is part of that public business that they should give time to these matters, to prepare so that they may be able to deal with them properly in this House.  When they become Deputies they engage to do that.  Surely, if a period of 11 days is given in which to read four pages containing the main principles of the Bill and if for several months those proposals have been discussed in public, that should be sufficient to enable anybody to take part in the discussion.  There is no desire on the part of the Government to rush anybody and, in asking that the Second Reading now take place, there is no indication of any desire to try to rush its discussion in this House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2292" /> It is unfortunate that certain accidental things have taken place which have enabled Deputies to confuse the issue if they want to do so.  It is possible that Deputies whose minds are easily confused may find themselves confused by these accidental circumstances. It is true that there is a shortage of coal now and that our transport services have to be curtailed. That brings about a serious situation for the whole country, and especially for those whose livelihood depends on their employment in that service; but it has nothing to do, directly and immediately, with this Bill, which was prepared before the shortage occurred. This Bill is for the control of transport services in a general period and not for a time of emergency.  As it is a permanent measure, why should we bring in the present situation, which has nothing to do with the principles underlying the Bill?</P>
    <P>Another unfortunate circumstance is that there is a tribunal investigating certain transactions which took place in a certain period, mentioned in the terms of reference.  That tribunal was set up&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To investigate and report on the dealings in Great Southern Railways stocks between the 1st day of January, 1943, and the 18th day of November, 1943; and the extent, if any, to which any of such dealings were attributable to the improper use or disclosure of information concerning proposals for the capital reorganisation of the Great Southern Railways.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is what the tribunal is examining and that is apart and aside altogether from this Bill.  If it should be found that there were dealings which were attributable to improper disclosures of information, or if there were other improper things done, I take it that these things can be dealt with by this House when the report comes to hand.  I have no idea as to when the report may be ready. Why should we postpone consideration of this Bill until we have that report?  This Bill would not prevent us from dealing with any individuals, no matter who they may be, who may have acted improperly, nor will it <Col N="2293" /> prevent the House from taking any steps that may be necessary to deal with the tribunal's report.</P>
    <P>I was here when Deputy Dillon suggested that, to spite speculators, we should do something quite different.  That was an extraordinary sort of purpose to put in front of members of this House.  This Bill is for the better arrangement of our transport services.  That is the fundamental thing that we have to consider &mdash;what is the best manner in which we can rearrange the organisation of our transport services, the control, management and so on so as to give the best service to the community.  If speculators have to be dealt with we ought to deal with them in some other way.  Certainly we ought not to use this Bill to try to attain an object of that sort.  I do not know what speculation there has been.  I remember being on the opposite benches when Deputy McGilligan was talking about the Drumm battery and the prospect he held out was so bright that I heard one Deputy say: &ldquo;We will all rush out and get shares in the railway company.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>That is a matter the tribunal will investigate.  I am only <Col N="2294" /> saying that it would be quite wrong procedure for Dáil Eireann to try to use a measure like this to deal with speculation.  If speculation has to be dealt with let it be dealt with as a separate thing.</P>
      <P>This measure has no relation to speculation in railway shares but if you want to deal with speculation it seems to me that you will have a very wide subject indeed to deal with.  I am not going to try to defend speculators who try to deceive the public.  I have never speculated and I know nothing about the business but I do say that it seems to me that most private business is carried on one way or another by speculating on the chances of making a profit.  I am sure Deputy Dillon in his business tries to buy the things he thinks will increase in value.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about the emergency.  I am speaking of ordinary times.  I think myself that where business is carried on for profit and where there is buying and selling you buy at the lowest price you can get and buy those things you think will appreciate in price.  That is speculation if you like.  It runs through a lot of our economic activities.  Perhaps I should not say the whole of our economic activities.  I think if you try to deal with that you will have your work cut out for you.  If there are people improperly buying and selling and if people such as the widows and orphans mentioned by Deputy Dillon were induced to sell shares to people who were buying to make a profit by all means let us inquire into it, but it seems absurd that we should make use of a measure like this to deal with it. The purpose of this Bill is to improve the transport service and nothing else. The arguments ought to be addressed to it from that point of view.  With <Col N="2295" /> regard to the point that the measure is being rushed, I can only say there is no basis whatever for that.  You have made long speeches on it and you have plenty of time to deal with it.  There has been no attempt to rush you and you have got ample notice of the measure; I think four days is the period in Standing Orders and you have got eleven days.  You had a White Paper presented to you to make things easy so that you could grasp the principles of the Bill.  You knew the principles of the measure some months ago so you can have no basis for the complaint that the Bill is being rushed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the fact that the tribunal is sitting, I think it would be absurd to put aside doing something that ought to be done until we receive the report of the tribunal.  If the tribunal reports, action can be taken on that basis if the Dáil wants to take action and this measure will in no way tie the hands of the Dáil. I have heard the complaint that we are offering to throw away £20,000,000 in this Bill.  It is quite clear that people who talk like that have not attempted to understand the Bill.  The £20,000,000 that have been mentioned is the authorised capital of the new company.  In other words, they can have capital up to that amount.  That is the only way you can have the figure of the £20,000,000.  How is that figure arrived at, supposing they reach the figure of £20,000,000?  There is £13,500,000 which comes from the purchasing of the stock of the existing companies, of the railway company and the Dublin United Transport Company, on the basis indicated in the White Paper.  The shares of each of these companies are going to be transferred over to the new company on the basis that was announced here a few months ago.  That means £13,500,000 roughly of the authorised capital will already be accounted for and the remainder of that is to enable the company to borrow such sums, from £13,500,000 up to £20,000,000, as may be necessary to improve the earning power of the company on the one hand and the facilities it can afford <Col N="2296" /> the public on the other.  It is to enable the company to borrow money which will enable it to get improved equipment.  We all know that the position of the company was such that it could not borrow up to the present. The Great Southern Railways was not in a position to raise new capital in order to do anything.  It was to put the railways in a position in which they could get equipment necessary to enable them to do their work in the best interests of the community that you had to enable them to borrow money.</P>
    <P>That is the reason why the authorised capital has been raised to £20,000,000.  There is in this matter no question of the State subsidising them or handing over any money whatever to them.  What the State has done, or rather what the State will do after the Bill becomes law, is this&mdash;it is going to put a State guarantee behind the debentures and other guaranteed stock.  That is being done on the basis of the reduction of these stocks as is set out here in the White Paper on the Bill.  The 4 per cent. debentures of the Great Southern Railways are reduced to 3 per cent., pound for pound.  The 4 per cent. guaranteed preference stock is divided into two parts.  If you hold £100 of that stock, you get £50 of the 3 per cent. debenture stock and you get £50 of the common stock.  On the £50 at 3 per cent. you will get £1 10s od.  Afterwards, if the company thrives, they can get on the £50 ordinary stock half of what would go on £100.  It depends on the dividend that they may earn.  It is purely a matter of estimation in the future whether they will earn or not.  We hope they will.  At any rate, the terms given to the 4 per cent.  guaranteed preference shareholders is that they get £50, on which they are guaranteed £1 10s od, and they will get £50 stock on which they will have to take their chance, as it is ordinary stock.  On the 4 per cent.  preference stock they are simply given £100 common stock, and the ordinary stock also will be pound for pound common stock.  Is it suggested that these terms are unnecessarily <Col N="2297" /> generous to the stockholders? I have not heard anybody making a detailed case that they are.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, about £11,500,000.  I remember that there was very strong dissent from a number of people here when that Bill was going through; they were saying that the debenture holders were very improperly treated when, for £100, they got £85; that it was altogether unfair to take the 4 per cent. guaranteed preference stock and write it down to £50; that it was still more unfair to write down the 4 per cent. preference stock to £35 and, taking off 90 per cent. of the ordinary stock and writing it down to one-tenth of its value, they said, was robbery.  What is being done in this case is that the dividends and interest are being considerably reduced.  The burdens which the company will have to carry are being considerably reduced by this Bill and, in view of the reduction, there has been a State guarantee given instead.  I can understand people going into details and <Col N="2298" /> arguing on this basis but, looking at it, it seems to me not an unfair proposition. It is very hard to get anything that could be said to be definitely fair; there are different points of view.  One thing, at any rate, is that there have been negotiations and the companies have agreed on this.  You may say that if the companies have agreed it must be good for them.  Our position is that it is also good for the State if we get agreement without arbitration.  Very often the State does not do so very well in arbitration. The State does not always do well in arbitration.</P>

They forget that shares may have changed hands time after time and there are very few of the original stockholders left.

The procedure of trying to get the company's consent and agreement was the method adopted rather than compulsory acquisition, because, apart from anything that might be unfair about it, if we came here with a compulsory acquisition Bill all those who are now talking in favour of it would probably be against it, just as on the occasion when we were proposing to write down the debentures from £100 to £85, we had objections from the benches opposite on the ground that we were robbing the people of their property.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We ought to get <Col N="2302" /> back to a little bit of order.  What I am saying is that, on the Second Stage of the Bill, what we are considering are the main principles of the Bill. These are designed to try to improve the transport services of the country and put them in a proper position. We are anxious to have that done, and to have that permanent position. reached as soon as possible.  There will be uncertainty with regard to these proposals in the railways and in the tramways.  That uncertainty is not good.  We want to try to end that uncertainty with all possible speed.  I suggest to the Labour Party that they ought to be particularly interested in ending any uncertainty in the position, because the stronger the position of railways is financially, the better will they be in a position to carry on, for instance, over a longer period, if necessary, with their employees, etc.  At present they cannot do that.  I suggest to the House that it is very bad national business to leave this in an uncertain position. We should get out of our heads, so far as this Bill is concerned, two things which are purely accidental. One is the emergency which is causing the curtailment of services and the hardships which that possibly would bring on the community and, possibly, would bring on others, a thing which everyone must regret.  The other is the question of the sitting of the tribunal to examine whether there were disclosures and, therefore, improper dealings as a result.  I suggest that by passing this Bill we are not tying our hands in any way from dealing with the other matter.  The difference between the Second Stage and the other stages is that there may be amendments in the other stages. Deputies can put down their amendments and, if these amendments are ones which, in the general interest, should be accepted, I am perfectly certain that the Government will consider them from that point of view.</P>

      <P>We are not here to test people.  That is like what the Deputy said the other day.  We are here to get things done.  The position is that, where there is a public utility, such as the transport services, there are various grades of opinion.  There are those who think that you ought to leave it absolutely free and not interfere with it; let the whole thing go as wild as the transport service in Dublin at one particular period before it was dealt with, when we had competition amongst buses.  You can have that state of affairs completely and <Col N="2304" /> absolutely uncontrolled.  I do not think that, at any time, people were prepared to allow a public service of that sort to be absolutely uncontrolled. Then you could bring in measures of control.  These measures of control range from the sort of control which existed in pre-war days up to the position in which the State owns, controls, and operates the railways. I take it that the position of the Labour Party is that they want the State to own, control and operate them.  I must say that I am not a believer in that at all.</P>

I do not believe it would be efficient, and I believe it would be a bad thing for the country from a variety of points of view.  I do not want that to start with.  The next thing is that you could have control in a variety of ways.  The sort of control I would stand for would be that control which would make sure that the public interest, and not merely the private interests of the shareholders, would be kept to the fore.  I am in favour of that, and there is provided in the Bill a method by which the public interest in the transport services can be safeguarded. We do that without becoming directly the owners.  It is done by means of contact between the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the railway management.  It is provided by having a chairman, who is appointed by the Minister and removable, whose business on the board will be to see that the public interest, and not merely the interests of the private shareholders, will be safeguarded. That is the purpose of the chairman, who, however, does not act alone.  He will be there as a public trustee, so to speak, but there will be with him six others who are interested in the efficient management of the railways from the point of view of making them pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My purpose in speaking was to try to get this matter fully considered on its merits and to get an understanding by Deputies as to what we are doing on this Second Reading. There is the method by which the public interest is safeguarded, so that the public interest will not be lost sight of in any desire to secure efficiency and the other directors are there to see that there is efficiency, for which the spur will be the ordinary spur in the case of business men trying to make their business pay.  I think it is a fair combination.  Many years ago &mdash;about 1908, I think&mdash;I read a paper which had been read at a meeting of the British Association in Dublin, in <Col N="2307" /> which the whole question of railway control was considered.  The questions of public ownership, private ownership, private management, and so on, were discussed and the conclusion reached in that paper was that it was necessary to make sure that the public interest was safeguarded and that one of the ways was the appointment of directors as a whole.  That had the fault that the interests of efficiency might not be so well safeguarded.  I believe that this proposal here is a sound one.  It is somewhat of a variation of what has been done in relation to other matters, but it is a sound proposal.  It provides a method of getting maximum efficiency, of getting it away from being the subject of public discussion every day here, which has been the case in countries where there has been direct State management and which has been a fruitful source of damage.</P>

      <P>These enterprises are not quite on all fours and, for this particular purpose, this method, which is a slight variation of the method of control, is one which we believe will be successful.  That is only our belief; we may find that we are mistaken in the long run; but we believe in it sufficiently to desire that it should be given a trial.  I repeat that all I wanted to say was that there are two accidental matters which are confusing, or which are brought in deliberately to confuse, the issue; the existence of the emergency and the tribunal which is at present sitting. The issues can very well be raised on the method of control on our method of organisation&mdash;that is a fair matter; <Col N="2308" /> it is what the Dáil is here to discuss &mdash;but we put forward our proposals which we believe to be the best.  The reorganisation of the capital of the company is designed to reduce expenses and there is a saving of about £70,000 per year, I think, in respect of debenture interest and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance is naturally anxious and properly anxious about every contingent guarantee.  He very rightly and properly looks askance at any extension of State guarantees.  This is a matter in regard to which, I think, Deputy McGilligan and those who apparently have his philosophy with regard to money cannot complain very much.  It is a matter of opinion whether it is likely to materialise or not.  I think the position is such that, under the new arrangement, the company ought to be on a fairly sound basis and able at least to make ends meet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter to which I feel I should refer in passing is the amalgamation of the Dublin United Transport Company with the railways. It has been suggested that that is an unfair proceeding so far as the transport company is concerned.  Now, with regard to the citizens of Dublin, the position is that we hope that they will have just as satisfactory a service under the new arrangement as they <Col N="2309" /> had under the old one.  If it is suggested that, where there is a special density of population, there should be special transport services separate from the rest of the State, that is something which would not be in the national interest as a whole.</P>
    <P>We believe, in the national interest as a whole, that Dublin, which is the national capital and whose prosperity and position depend ultimately on the country, is really best served by the amalgamation.  If you do not take national interests into account your position will be that each separate area will take over the cream of the services and neglect the rest. Then the State would have to step in to deal with the problem.  We think these services ought to be self-supporting. There is no question of any subsidy in this Bill.  The whole idea is to try to make these services self-supporting, and we believe that the proposals put forward by the Minister are such that any person who makes up his mind that he is not going to allow himself to be confused by considerations of the moment will support them.  It is in that spirit that the Government is proposing the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>When I saw that the Taoiseach was about to intervene, I felt that he intended to act in the same manner as that in which oil is poured on troubled waters.  I did not expect his intervention would have the contrary effect.  He created some disturbance in this House, and I think the uneasiness and perturbation manifested here should have convinced the Taoiseach himself, apart altogether from the context or content of what was said, that there is something definitely wrong in the whole situation about this Bill.  In my very short experience here never, I think, has there been such agitation about any matter as on this occasion.  It certainly has caused a greater stir than any other measure which has come here for consideration.  The Taoiseach gave us such a wide variety of angles on the subject that it is very difficult to know where to begin, but it became evident, as I listened to the <Col N="2310" /> Taoiseach, that he was in much the same plight as ourselves.  I sympathise with him sincerely that his grasp of the Bill was not much better than that of the younger Deputies of this House, in matters of detail.</P>
      <P>I am sure, however, that in the matter of principle he is well posted. I think that when we discuss principles we may have the best intentions.  We may not be doctrinaires in economics any more than in politics&mdash;but in the actual working out of a principle, we may discover that there is no good in it, that it has been negatived.  We may agree that a principle is enshrined in this Bill but may hold that the manner in which it is proposed to carry it out is ineffective. The Taoiseach evidently wants us to discuss the Bill <i>in vacuo.</i> Apparently, he thinks there is no relation between it and speculation and, to a certain extent I agree, that it must be considered apart from the question of speculation. Speculation is a very desperate thing when it overrides itself in any State.</P>
      <P>I am sure that everyone is familiar with the case of modern France when the Stavisky scandal rocked that State to its foundations.  I submit that we have come perilously near to the same position in this country over this business. Whether we have been able to take it in hand or not remains to be seen.  The Bill as such should, of course, be discussed apart from the aspect of speculation, but its impact is on it and it is strong enough to vitiate the whole issue of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even supporting the principle of this Bill, we would be very loath to operate it in these circumstances, and under these conditions.  I quite agree that it is a long-term policy, a case of getting ready for the post-war period &mdash; perhaps I would more properly put it, the inter-war period before the next conflict&mdash;but that does not mean that we have any good reason for optimism about it.  I am unconvinced by the statement of the Taoiseach about the time that has been allotted to us.  I still think that the White Paper was not as ample a document as he imagined it, or that <Col N="2311" /> it gave us a summary or résumé of the principles of the Bill.  It is merely a condensation and, even as a condensation it is more difficult to read than the Bill itself.  Certainly, it is a very difficult document to grasp.  If, in this paper, there had been a proper discussion of the new principles about which the Taoiseach talks, then it might have been very helpful to new Deputies and to those who have not long experience of legislation such as the Transport Bill.</P>
    <P>I suggest that even the Taoiseach found considerable difficulty in wading through the White Paper, difficulty even on the front page.  It consists of many sections and many pages, and because of the importance of the whole of it, I submit that it is a Bill to which even more than 11 days should be given.  We may have ideas about transport, we may have our own principles with regard to transport, but we must discuss the problem as a legislative assembly and not as a debating society, relate the provisions of the Bill to our principles, and see how far they coincide or diverge, and what accommodation is possible between the Bill and our principles.  I submit that it is not possible to do that in the short time at our disposal.  We are asked to dispose of this Bill in less than a month, but no statistician could make the investigation that it is necessary to satisfy himself that justice has been done either to the workers or to the public, and in the time allowed, no statistician could dig up the facts and assess their value over a period of years.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach seems to suggest that matters which have been under consideration for several years should be disposed of in a survey over a period of three weeks.  That is the real difficulty about the Bill&mdash;the Taoiseach and Ministers who have been intimately connected with the details have had this Bill under consideration for months past, yet they ask the House to dispose of it in a few weeks. This legislation is of particular importance as transport is the lifeblood of the country.  It concerns the workers employed in the industry <Col N="2312" /> and it affects the whole economic future of the State.  Under those circumstances, I think the Minister would be well advised not to press for the rushing through of this Bill before the 1st July like a Hurricane or a Flying Fortress.  Plenty of time could be given, unless the Minister has inside knowledge about the opening of the Second Front or the collapse of the European situation.  If he thinks the war is going to end in a much shorter time than I do, then there may be some justification for his desire to rush the Bill.</P>
    <P>Everyone in this House who has been democratically elected for the purpose of discussing the nation's business is concerned to see that we will be prepared as a nation to withstand any shocks that come in the period after the war, but a good case must be made out for it.  So far a case has not been made.  I think that any Deputy who has considered the matter will see that there are so many different ways of approaching even a question of principle that the short time at our disposal is not sufficient for the discussion of the matter.  Most of the members of the House whom I have heard speak have approached this question from the point of view of what they consider to be their own principles.  They have ideas of their own in relation to transport.</P>
    <P>Personally, I have great sympathy with the Minister presenting such a Bill when he has to traverse the diverse workings of many minds on the matter.  I am sure he could reply when many of the past ideas of his own, his theoretical principles, are quoted against him that consistency is the refuge of a small mind.  We have had many somersaults here. I was quite amazed to notice the change in the economic outlook of some of the members of Fine Gael and particularly of Deputy Dillon.  I should say that the age of miracles is not yet past and if the Minister for Industry and Commerce has done nothing else, even if this Bill were to go into the limbo of forgotten things, he has done a very good day's work in converting a number of leading <Col N="2313" /> figures to the policy of nationalisation or an approach to that policy.  He has brought them nearer to understanding something about the control of transport.</P>

      <P>I do not think that the Labour Party is claiming Deputy Dillon any more than Fine Gael is claiming him.  I was just saying that I think it is good to have a more realistic approach to these economic questions than we have had for some time past. I was going to add, and I might as well do it now, that whether the statements of the people in opposition when they are in opposition are of any great value is another matter.  Had I the time, which I regret I have not, to search in the past, I am sure I would find that the policy of Fine Gael on the question of transport is no more consistent than the policy of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether again that is any grave matter for politicians is a question that is somewhat apart from the main one. To my mind, the whole Bill is a Bill that even in its title is quite uncertain as to where it will lead us.  A great deal of this uncertainty runs through it.  The title itself would lead one to believe that it has a narrow basis, that <Col N="2314" /> it deals particularly with two big concerns and their amalgamation.  But, in fact, if you examine the Bill you see that it is of much wider scope, that it proposes to operate a transport service and to take over and acquire the whole or any part of any transport undertaking. Transport service, in this Bill, means not the rail and road and canal services which we have at the present time but, in fact, it means as well, sea, air and road services.  In other words, in discussing this Bill we are discussing the future transport of the country&mdash;transport as a whole in all its forms.</P>
    <P>We are dealing not only with the railways and the Dublin Transport Company and the canals but with the company or the concern which will have prior rights, and probably exclusive rights, in regard to any development of transport, whether that development is by way of the Drumm Battery or by electrification or by jet propulsion or helicopters or other forms of transport.  We do not know what they may be.  It will all be under this company.  This company will have everything to say in regard to anything that has to do with transport in this country, and it is for that reason that I think the Dáil should be particularly concerned with the control of the company and with what method is observed over its control by the nation: how its acts shall be regulated, how its employees shall be treated, and how it shall attain efficiency for the different sections of the country.</P>
    <P>It appears from the Bill itself, that we have a new form of control, a control that is not the same, we have been assured, as the method of control obtaining under the Electricity Supply Board.  It is not a method of nationalisation.  It is not a method, I think, that is known by any precedents.  It is a new venture, and what the exact working of that venture will be, it is difficult to forecast. Whether the present situation of the railways justifies this new method is a very moot point.  It has been termed a method of control by dictatorship, and on this point I think <Col N="2315" /> the Taoiseach himself has not, as has been alleged by members on these benches, sufficiently studied the Bill. It is quite true that he may have read Section 35, which deals with the board of directors.  The Taoiseach informed us, correctly, that there would be six of these directors and a chairman.  In sub-section (3) of that section it says that the chairman alone shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of the board.  Sub-section (4) says that no meeting of the board shall be held unless the chairman is present thereat, and, as if that were not watertight enough, we finally have sub-section (5) which says that no decision shall be arrived at by the board at any meeting without the concurrence of the chairman.</P>
    <P>Those are certainly very drastic powers.  There is something in what the Taoiseach says: that if you have six men, six businessmen with railway experience, and men of responsibility, they, despite the regulation in the Act and despite the curtailment of their powers, will, as normal human beings are apt to do, make their presence felt. Now, there is no doubt about that, but here is the point: if they are in agreement with the chairman, then their presence or their submissions or their representations will have the same effect on the transport company and will be carried into effect, but if they disagree with the chairman, if they do not walk the same path as he does, if they do not follow along the same line, then the chairman is the determining factor.  It is, undoubtedly, a fact that the whole motive of existence of these directors on the board would be to spur on the railway company to improve the efficiency of the railways. As the Taoiseach has said, that will be their duty, but what is the criterion of efficiency?  It is not something that is abstract or ideal or that can be found in a White Paper.  Efficiency has certain connotations, particularly with regard to transport.  Everyone knows, everyone can see, that here you have an amalgamation of two concerns, one with very large interest in the railways and the other with very large interest in the road services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2316" /> Now, I am not adverting in the slightest to the character of the present chairman or the presumed chairman, or the chairman who has been in the position and who may be promoted to this other position.  Apart altogether from his personal qualifications and character, any chairman coming into such an amalgamation of two diverse interests such as is proposed here must be either one or the other.  He must, to use the common parlance, be either road minded or rail-minded. Now, which is he to be in this case?  If he comes from the Dublin Transport Company, if he comes with that background, he will be bound to have certain views with regard to the railways and will be bound to be road-minded.</P>
    <P>Those six directors, on the other hand, who probably will be picked as representatives of the interests of various industrial concerns through the shareholders, will undoubtedly, so far as one can see, be mainly rail-minded. There you have an obvious conflict of interest.  If they were all to be road-minded then one could make a case that their representations would have an effect upon the all-powerful chairman, but if they are opposed to the chairman, or if he is opposed to them, you do not get a deadlock, but you get the chairman, with his overriding authority, being able to determine the whole policy of the Government.  Now, that is a principle. That is not a detail of the Bill. That is not something that you can amend on the Committee Stage.  That is the question around which the whole Bill revolves&mdash;this question of control&mdash;and that point undoubtedly must be met.  These men will either be &ldquo;yes-men&rdquo; or &ldquo;no-men&rdquo;, but whether they are yes-men or no-men, what the chairman says goes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">

    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>He is the head man of all.  It is a very important thing then to discuss, in the creation of such a board as that, what is the outlook of the chairman.  I submit that in a <Col N="2317" /> transport concern he cannot be both. I suppose that Deputy Davin or anybody who has been brought up on the railways, who has known their working, in and out, all the time, could not conceivably, in any circumstances, take the same view of a transport matter as would be taken by another person who regards the whole question of transport as devolving on a road service.  It is undoubtedly true that many of those who have been brought up with the road tradition believe that the railways are obsolete.  They believe that there is no future for the railways.  I think&mdash;I am not quite certain and am not giving this as a quotation&mdash;that a Minister, even the Minister for Industry and Commerce himself, was accused, at least at one time, of making some remarks of that character.  Whether that is so or not, there is undoubtedly a tendency manifest in this country and every other country to believe that the railways are obsolete.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It becomes a question then of considering whether the State is wise in putting in capital, in putting in some resources, and even in giving guarantees, to bolster up what has been described as an obsolete service. There will be a conflict there on the board.  There will be railway-minded directors who believe that there is a future for the railways, whether through electrification or through rationalisation of the whole concern, or by connecting it with various forms of road transport.  They will believe that there is a future for the railways but the chairman, if he be road-minded, might look upon these things from an entirely different point of view.  He may come from a sphere of industry where things are naturally at a higher state of efficiency because in the evolution of human society and in the evolution of industry, road transport has undoubtedly been at a higher level than rail transport.  It is a later movement, it has learned the lessons of the past and undoubtedly it has been enabled to achieve a different type of organisation, in some ways a much more efficient type of organisation, judged from commercial standards. Now the man who comes with that <Col N="2318" /> training to control the transport company may consider that his duty on lines that are best for the State, best for his own colleagues, best for the shareholders and best for everybody concerned, is to carry through some rationalisation of the railways, according to methods to which he has been accustomed in his control of road transport.  That may be calamitous in its effects.</P>
    <P>For instance, in the past we had different crises.  We had the closing down of the Broadstone at one period and I am sure as a result of that closing down or amalgamation, we had the transfer of many workers hither to employed there to other services and other workshops.  Their transfer would naturally increase very much the overhead charges in such workshops. Railway people who are accustomed to such things would try to ease that situation or improve it within narrow limits but a person coming from outside, with his idea of hustling and the organisation that obtains in the road service, might reasonably consider that these workers constituted a very heavy overcharge for which no value had been obtained for the company.  He would undoubtedly make out from the economic point of view a very good case for the redundancy of many of these workers.  But there are bigger issues in this question than the mere, narrow, commercial idea of efficiency.  We have to consider transport, as the Taoiseach said himself, on the basis of a national service.  We have to consider it as giving value to the community in every shape and form and we must consider such mere commercial views of efficiency as would be held by this hypothetical chairman to be dangerous to the country as a whole, dangerous to the community in its repercussions on the people employed in the concern itself and on people outside.</P>
    <P>I think this Bill has created such a feeling among many of those who are at present working on the railways. We know that by the idea of Mondism, the idea of rationalisation which was so common in Great Britain and America in days gone by, different sections of different industries were put <Col N="2319" /> out of commission in order to conserve profits for the profit-makers and provide better guarantees for the speculators. We in this country escaped a great deal, if not all, of that policy of Mondism and rationalisation but many of those now working on the railways are wondering whether, under this transport concern, we are to have a very much delayed spate of rationalisation. There are provisions in this Bill in regard to redundancy which would indicate to their minds that that long-delayed rationalisation of the railways is about to take place, that quite large sections of these men will find themselves without an occupation when the Bill becomes an Act and is implemented.  That is a very serious question of principle, a question that concerns us particularly on these benches.  That is why we should like the question of compensation for railway servants to be dealt with in a much more generous spirit than is indicated in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Taoiseach wants me to speak frankly about that matter I should say that what I have stated indicates the current that is running through the minds of very many workers at present employed on the railways.  They fear that when you are bringing, as I have termed him, a road-minded man into control of the whole concern, inevitably there will be rationalisation.  They fear that there will be a cutting down of various <Col N="2320" /> forms of employment, that, from the point of view of road-transport efficiency, he may consider many of the smaller stations, for instance, as unnecessary.  He may consider that the workshops repairing these vehicles could be brought up to a higher level of efficiency.  As I have indicated, and as the Taoiseach knows very well, in Great Britain and in America there was a spate of what was known as rationalisation, under which firms used to get out a stop watch and time every different action of the worker. They developed the endless chain system, so well known in connection with Fordism.  They ran everything so efficiently that they were able to close down sometimes one-third or one-fourth of the plant and yet were able to get the same output from the remaining workers.  They were able to increase the economic efficiency, the efficiency which would pay dividends to shareholders, efficiency from the point of view of commercial standards, but an efficiency that, from human standards, I am sure the Taoiseach will admit, was entirely wrong and would not suit this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>No, particularly in the steel industries.  They had an amalgamation.  I remember going over some of the factories in Sheffield. They had an amalgamation under one of the big steel concerns there.  They transferred wholesale the machinery in what they called uneconomic shops to better situated shops and closed down the uneconomic works completely.  To such an extent did this go that in many places in England and Wales the steel industry was wiped out and the workers were left without occupation in that line.  As a result of this <Col N="2321" /> short-sighted rationalisation.  When this war came upon them, they were in a very sad state and there was a long delay in getting these mills restarted.</P>
      <P>The question of the short time allowed in which a decision is to be come to regarding redundancy&mdash;from July to December&mdash;has been dealt with by other speakers.  I am sure that the Taoiseach, with his humanitarian outlook, will see that that period of six months will be extended. There is no reason why this question should not be left open to decision over a period of years.  There is, in fact, no reason why any definite period should be inserted in the Bill at all.  If a man is proved to be redundant as a result of the rationalisation, following upon this amalgamation, he should, in justice, be entitled to compensation.  The question of the period should not affect the matter at all.</P>
      <P>The question of nationalisation has, naturally, been debated upon this Bill. The Taoiseach said that the Labour Party went out whole-hog for nationalisation. Our alternative proposals are not&mdash;as an individual, I am sorry to say it&mdash;whole-hog nationalisation proposals. They are proposals which were enshrined in a document presented to the Minister and with which he is familiar.  We indicated in that document that our idea of the organisation of the transport industry was of the nature of a public utility company, with certain control by the Oireachtas, not in regard to every-day policy but rather as a check.  An annual report would be submitted to this House, as is done in other cases, and if there were a desire for discussion upon the policy of the principle of the transport concern, then such report could be availed of.  We do not at all regard as desirable nationalisation in a form in which every little movement and action by the transport company would come under fire in this House.  Our proposals did not proceed upon that line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of nationalisation is one that cannot, unfortunately, be considered without relation to the particular subject under discussion.  If it could, a very good case could be made for nationalisation, particularly in the <Col N="2322" /> present economic situation of the country and of the world.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has assured us that he has read the funeral service over capitalism and that we are entering another period of economic life.  What exactly it will be called it is hard to say but so far as indications by the Minister, Fine Gael, Deputy Dillon and, more particularly, Deputy McGilligan are concerned, they suggest some form or other of nationalisation.</P>
    <P>The exact working-out of what constitutes nationalisation is a problem which would have to be left to each industry.  Whether it would be practicable or desirable to have nationalisation <i>per se</i> in one major industry, while the remainder of the industries of the State were privately owned and conducted on the principles of the system which the Minister assured us is dead, is a very difficult point to decide.  Nationalisation, if it is to be really effective, should extend over all the major and heavy industries of the country, all the industries that are susceptible to amalgamation and that are capable of being brought up to a moderate state of efficiency.  It would not, of course, include one-man industries or craft industries.  These could not, under any conceivable scheme, come under a scheme of nationalisation or socialisation. But transport is the lifeblood of the whole economic system and it is susceptible to some form of nationalisation.  It is a great pity that the Minister lost his chance of trying out some form of nationalisation in this case instead of adopting the method of a chairman-controlled concern to implement the ideas of the State and control the general tendency of the undertaking.</P>
    <P>The financial provisions of this Bill would require three months' discussion by statisticians.  I suppose it would be possible to discuss them apart from the situation in which the new company is to be born.  The Minister, however, has indicated his desire to launch the new company so soon after this period of speculation that it would be astonishing if there were no relation <Col N="2323" /> between the speculation that has taken place and the launching of this concern, despite the wishes of the Minister or the Government.  When the Taoiseach was asked could he state the cause of the phenomenal rise in the Great Southern Railways Company shares, he had to answer that he did not know.  He did not know why the ordinary stock had risen from £9, on March 26th, 1943, to £52 on March 24th, 1944.  He had no answer.  Surely there must be some reason for this phenomenal rise.  It is not confined to ordinary stock.  Preference stock jumped from £14 on March 26th, 1943, to £52 on March 24th, 1944.  Guaranteed stock jumped from £28 to £72 on January 28th, 1944.  Debenture stock jumped from £56 on March 26th, 1943, to £90 on March 24th, 1944.  Surely these are phenomenal rises.  They must have some explanation.  If it is stated that the provisions of this Bill bear no relation whatsoever to this movement on the Dublin Stock Exchange of a character never previously experienced in dealings in these shares, then the age of miracles has returned.</P>
    <P>Speculation may have unduly boosted these shares; there may have been leakage of information proper or improper, which may have further boosted the shares but the commonsense view is that apart altogether from this unusual, abnormal state of affairs, if a Transport Bill were to be brought forward in a normal state of affairs the provisions of the Bill or what were understood to be the provisions of the Bill would affect railway shares, either favourably or adversely.  The shares would go up or down according to what the experts considered to be the implications of the Bill.  Therefore, if we subtract from these phenomenal rises in railway stock what might be due to abnormal causes, and then try to relate them to the normal operation of the Stock Exchange, we must admit that there is every indication that persons interested in these shares considered that the provisions of this Bill would be unduly favourable or extravagantly favourable as far as they <Col N="2324" /> were concerned.  That, in my submission, is the real reason for this speculation and that is the answer to the question which the Taoiseach was unable to answer.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to refer to cross-Border traffic by road vehicles and the method that should be adopted for the control of this traffic.  It may not be a question of principle, but it has had important reactions on the country and should be considered.  Many people concerned in this business know that for a number of years there has been an invasion of the south by vehicular traffic from the north. There has been a muscling-in of services and traffic which would normally have gone to the Port of Dublin and probably the Port of Drogheda and perhaps Dundalk.  It is being diverted to the north by road haulage.  There has been a consequential diminution in the volume of employment among dockers in the south along the southeast coast while no great economic advantage has accrued to the country to offset that loss.  We have advocated in that connection that there should be a licensing system limiting the field of operation of these cross-Border road vehicles, having due regard for the national interest.  We do not suggest that they should be completely prohibited, because some case may be made for a certain volume of this traffic, but to allow them absolute freedom to operate without some proper form of control would be to abandon all that traffic to these higher powered and, in some ways, more highly efficient services.  We are particularly concerned with this diversion of traffic.  I am sure that is a minor point that can be settled.</P>

      <P>We understand that <Col N="2325" /> there is some form of licensing in operation, but we consider that, if there is to be a transport system, particularly in the cases I referred to, where a national transport concern will not operate directly on the rail service, there should be some restrictions, in the interests of the State and of employment, on the activities of those cross-Border vehicles which operate into territory which should naturally be drawn off by rail services from the south.  Navan is such a case.  We consider that there should be greater control of licensed road hauliers from the north, but not a complete drying up, because that would not suit people generally, their convenience or economic interest.  A case could be made for restrictions in order to help a return of traffic to what I hope will be a more efficient railway service under the new concern.</P>

      <P>I rise in protest against the introduction of this Bill, particularly in view of the fact that an inquiry is taking place at present, and that we are prevented from making any reference to the outcome. Deputies in this Party will oppose this Bill, because we are of opinion that it is to a great extent dictatorial by placing the control of transport in the hands of one individual.  Accordingly we believe it to be the duty of this House to prevent such a measure becoming law.  In introducing the Bill the Minister laid strong emphasis on the necessity for a reorganisation of transport.  It is generally accepted that he failed to outline the extent of the Bill's operations, if it becomes law.  He gave no indication of future plans for dealing with transport. Motor-tax revenue goes into the General Exchequer.  I am of opinion that a large increase of heavy traffic over the roads by lorries and buses is inevitable under the new proposals, and consequently the Minister for Finance will welcome such additional revenue.</P>

      <P>This Bill will result in a large increase in the number of vehicles on the roads.  At the present time the roads are not in a condition to deal with any substantial increase of heavy traffic, and any extra burden placed on them will mean rapid deterioration. That will undoubtedly entail the expenditure of a large amount of public money.  The Minister is aware that the maintenance and repair of roads is the concern of local authorities and that they have to defray the charges from local rates.  Accordingly, we may visualise much higher local rates for the upkeep of roads, particularly in the rural communities.  It may be assumed that the railways will remain the major traffic arteries between towns, but the roads will be used for the transfer of merchandise from the railways.  The revenue collected from increased road traffic will be distributed, I suppose, according to the Government's wishes, but there is no guarantee that local ratepayers will not have to bear the burden of increased construction and maintenance for the accommodation of fleets of heavy buses as well as for haulage work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The money is distributed on a mileage basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so now. The Minister will realise that the trend is towards road transport.  Deputies have pointed out that the manager of the new concern may be road-minded. Is the Government prepared to remove the burden of road maintenance from <Col N="2327" /> local rates?  Will local authorities have to maintain roads for the increased burden which will be imposed upon them if the manager is road-minded?</P>
      <P>The concentration of all transport under one body may be detrimental to national economy, inasmuch as the opportunity of providing cheaper methods of conveyance is considerably reduced if there are vested interests affected.  Should some new motive power prove cheaper and more efficient than the existing system there is every reason to assume that the chance of trying it in competition with the other methods is eliminated.  Does the Minister see that point?  The monopolists will not be ready to scrap plants in which considerable funds have been invested and to substitute services which would cost the community less.  The obvious outcome would be that the community would be penalised by a monopoly which would not scrap its plant for one that would provide cheaper, more efficient services.  The effect on cost of production is of particular importance in an agricultural country where transport represents a large part of total costs.  That might mean that the world price of our goods would stand higher than those of countries in which newer and more efficient transport methods were operating, thus reducing cost of production as well as cost to consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Should this occur, it would mean penalising our export trade and adversely affecting our home standards of living.  The Bill makes no provision for the replacement of obsolescent transport with newer developments. In fact, by setting up a body which is not State-owned, and yet not open to private competition, practically ensures this adverse result.  The Minister will admit that the company which he intends to set up is not a State-owned company, and yet that it will not be open to private competition. The Minister will also understand that this company is to be sheltered like an infant industry.  No provision is made as to when it is to come of age.  It is to be continually sheltered.  One could understand if it <Col N="2328" /> were to be sheltered for two, three or four years, but according to the Bill and to the Minister's statement it is to be continually protected from any competition, private or otherwise. Cheapness and efficiency are the results of human and private initiative, the pitting of one man's skill against that of another, the incorporation of new ideas and technique such as may be attained within the framework of a totalitarian economy where, of course, specialists are trained for that purpose.  The Minister is aware that he has not got specialists here for that particular type of totalitarianism.</P>
    <P>This Bill relieves Córas Iompair Éireann of all the distinguishing marks of an ordinary company.  In fact, it sets up a department where the members, directors and stockholders are to receive a definite remuneration stipulated by the State. That remuneration will not depend on the initiative of the persons concerned. They are relegated to the position of the wage-earner whose wage is guaranteed by the Government, and will have, in their newfound positions, all the irresponsibility of such wage-earners.  They will have nothing to worry about. Their wage is there, and they are going to be paid irrespective of what they do or how they do it.  The normal incentive towards a reduction of costs&mdash;the profit motive&mdash;is completely wiped out because, in no instance, can the stockholders receive more than 3 per cent. on the debentures, and 6 per cent. on the common stock.  There is, therefore, no inducement towards providing cheaper services. The company, on the one hand, will have to face no competition, and hence need not look for trade.  In other words, it can just look on the public as it likes.  It will not need to facilitate the public or give the public the service that it would have to give if it were a private company open to competition.  It will not need to give the public the service that it would have to give if it were a State company nationalised, and had to give an account of itself in a yearly report <Col N="2329" /> to this House.  This new company is to be protected in every possible way, with a guarantee from the Government that it can earn a certain dividend or certain wage.  The normal functions of a company are being taken away.  The company is a collection of fixed income earners.  There is no inducement to the company to provide cheaper transport.  It is not even being burdened with the effect of making a loss, should earnings be insufficient to cover commitments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not necessarily. As I was saying, the company is not even burdened with the effect of making a loss should earnings be insufficient to cover the commitments to pay 3 per cent. on the debentures. That will still hold good because the necessary moneys to meet that are to be provided by the Oireachtas.  Subsections (1), (2) and (3) of Section 17 give the company that guarantee.  The company is not even required to pay back these moneys.  Again, in Section 7, it allows the Minister to make any regulations that he thinks fit.  If in anything I have said, I have hurt the feelings of, I think, the Deputy from Cork&mdash;I do not know his name&mdash;by exposing something that he does not agree with he will get sufficient time to read his speech if he wants to read it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I said that you will get sufficient time to read your speech if you want to.  The company, therefore, when it is set up will be deprived of all incentive to provide cheap transport.  To relieve the company <Col N="2330" /> of the consequences of earning a loss is to deprive it of the incentive to give cheap transport.  The initiative to do so will not be there due to the fact that guarantees are being given by the Government that its losses will be made up by the State coming to its aid.</P>

    <P>What action will the Government take to force the company to do that? <Col N="2331" /> Cheaper transport is promised, but the total volume of normal transportable merchandise is fixed and in normal times the railway company is losing money and trade.

An initial millstone of £500,000 is placed around the neck of the company.  If charges are reduced, it can only mean that the Oireachtas is paying part of the cost, and that means that the consumer must really pay a higher price for the services rendered, though in a disguised form.

      <P>As Deputy Cosgrave says, the Minister does not disappear. He is the hidden dictator and has the power to remove the chairman at any moment.  The interpretation that will be given to this Bill will be the interpretation the Minister desires.  The Minister, in introducing the Bill, failed to give the meanings which he wished to apply to the Bill and that is why I put these questions to him, through the Chair.  I hold that, if the future trend of transport is towards the road, it will mean a heavier draw on the ratepayers.  Those of us who represent the farming community will have to oppose that.  It would also mean that the lorries which are used to take pigs and cattle to the local railway terminus or bacon factory may have to be retained for five, six or seven hours, which would mean heavy costs to the farmer and a reduction of his profits. It would mean the reduction of whatever profits he would have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Judging the Bill as a whole, although there is necessity for reorganisation of transport and for a new system, I do not think this Bill will bring that about.  I do not deny that the Minister may be under the impression that it will bring about the <Col N="2334" /> object which he has in mind and lead to the more efficient development of transport.  But we here are honestly of the opinion that it will fall short of that.  It will not have the desired effect in making the transport of this country, both rail and road, as efficient as the people would like and in particular it will not give a cheaper system of transport.  The transport system, especially the railway system, is costly and I do not think the Bill will alter that.  For that reason, I and others on these benches, will oppose it and I appeal to members of the other Parties, even those of the Fianna Fáil Party who are not afraid of the Whip, to oppose it also.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach in speaking here to-day expressed the great truth that the details of a Bill can be amended upon the Committee Stage but that the Second Stage is concerned with the principles of the Bill.  I submit to you, Sir, that the principles enshrined in this particular Bill are concerned mainly with the directorship.  There is the directorship with a chairman who has full overriding powers over everything.  There is the question of the £16,000,000 guaranteed and £20,000,000 ordinary capital.  Thirdly, there is the management and general working of the Bill or of the transport of the country or the amalgamation of the Great Southern Railways and the Dublin United Transport Company. If the Second Reading were taken, you could not change any one of these three things in Committee because then you would alter the whole principles <Col N="2335" /> of the Bill.  I submit that every attack and every opposition made to the Bill has been made on these three points. There may have been minor points raised like lack of time to examine the Bill and so forth, but these are the three outstanding principles and they cannot be changed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will accept that, but from the manner in which the Bill was introduced one would take it that the control of the company was enshrined in it as a matter of principle. The Minister says that that is not so but he was quite clear that that control was necessary to make the proposal a success and he went further and said <Col N="2336" /> that it was only just short of nationalisation. I submit that the difference between what he is doing and nationalisation is the difference between two figures one on the same sheet and that is nothing.  In the Bill the proposal is to abolish two existing companies and to establish a new company, transferring the powers of the two companies to one company, the management of which will be held by a managing director who is to carry out the instructions of the Minister and the policy of the Government of the day.  The difference between that and nationalisation is nothing.  I want to be quite clear as to where we stand on this question of railway transport of the country on these benches.  We believe in the establishment of a public utility company run on the same lines as the Electricity Supply Board.  We think that that is an excellent manner in which to deal with such a great public service as transport.  It is alleged that that is nationalisation of a type, but it is not.  It does mean that it is the property of the State and that it is managed in the interests of the people as a whole.</P>
      <P>It is very hard for Deputies who have no experience of the Stock Exchange to value the £16,000,000 or £20,000,000 that it is proposed to guarantee to this new company.  The £16,000,000, it is argued, is not a subsidy. It is the nearest thing again to a subsidy that you can possibly have because once you give security to a person for a certain amount of money it is nearly the same thing as if you wrote him a cheque and he did not cash it until he wanted it.  If the House passes this Bill&mdash;I sincerely hope it will not&mdash;it will be giving £16,000,000 to the director without saying to what purpose it is to be devoted and in that way nobody, except the Minister and that director, will have control of that money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach to-day very properly gave expression to some great truths. There was one thing to which he gave expression that I do not exactly accept.  He said he was not a speculator. I take it that that is correct, that he is not a speculator on the Stock Exchange.  But as a political <Col N="2337" /> speculator there is no one in the world to equal him.  He also said he did not know how people judged the rising and falling of stocks.  Nobody knows better than he how his political stock went up and down.  Let us hope that it is again on the descent.  He knows that very well; there is no person better able than he to appreciate that.</P>

      <P>He speculated well from 1922 to 1932, but, then, the greatest speculator, the greatest operator on the exchange, can meet his Waterloo, and this Bill could just be the Waterloo for the Taoiseach. In this particular speculation he should be very careful.  We are guaranteeing £16,000,000.  The people who are going to benefit by that guarantee are those who have, no matter for what reason, purchased shares in the Great Southern Railways during the past 12 months or two years.  While I am quite agreeable to the guarantee being given, I insist that it should be a guarantee for the valuation of the stock at a certain time.  I believe that what Deputy Dillon suggested would be quite reasonable, and that is that we should select the year 1938.  When you are taking over the company you should take over the shares as valued in a year such as 1938, when everything was normal.  But you are taking them over now at a figure which has established itself more or less on the market and you will enrich people to whom we are under no obligation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the citizen of this State is concerned I do not begrudge him anything he gets, but what annoys me more than anything else is that we are guaranteeing the interest and capital of people who have money in the railway company, but who are living outside the State and who purchased their shares within the past 12 months.  I think that is a very unfair position for a Minister to take up.  He has no mandate from the people to guarantee those things.  I would like to know how many persons in Stormont will have their capital and their dividends <Col N="2338" /> guaranteed under this Bill if it passes &mdash;people who have purchased stocks within the past two years.  I suggest it is almost impossible to discuss this Bill in the manner in which it should be discussed when we have not the report of the tribunal now sitting.  I suggest that because of the circumstances of the time we are tongue-tied upon very essential matters, and we are not at liberty to deal as adequately as we should, and as we could, with certain proposals.</P>
    <P>The amalgamation of the Great Southern Railways Company and the Dublin United Transport Company may be all to the good, and may be essential for the useful employment of transport in this company.  But it is a strange thing that the Transport Tribunal did not make any such recommendation. It is also strange that the Government would adopt a plan almost contrary to the recommendations of the Transport Tribunal.  That tribunal recommended, as Deputy Lynch pointed out, that there would be a period of five years in which the whole transport question would be examined while being worked under fairly favourable conditions.  Nothing like that has been done.  The tribunal reported in 1939, but the Government did nothing since then and they do not show any anxiety to operate the proposed five years plan.  They have multiplied the capital, and have asked us to guarantee £16,000,000 without giving us the information which we consider essential before we arrive at any decision.</P>
    <P>The Government knew very well in 1939 that the Great Southern Railways had not an adequate coal supply.  This bringing in of £16,000,000 to bolster up the railway company now is like locking a stable door after the horse has been stolen.  If in 1939 the railway company had sufficient capital they could have left in ample coal stocks to carry them for a considerable time. The Government, for some reason or other, did not advise the railway company to lay in sufficient coal or did not express any desire to guarantee the purchase of such fuel.  I submit that in that sense the Government are <Col N="2339" /> too late with their present proposals. Before we agree to this heavy expenditure we should have more information placed at our disposal.</P>
    <P>I am one of those who believe that we cannot do without the railways, although in the United States and elsewhere road transport has taken away to a very great extent the activities of the railway companies.  Road transport has advantages inasmuch as it can go to the producer's premises, load up the stuff and thus have only two handlings instead of four or five.  In that way it is true to say that road transport has a great advantage over railway transport.  But in this Bill the Minister has not given us any indication how the £16,000,000 will be utilised, whether for complete road transport, complete rail transport, or both.  He tells us blandly that this is an enabling Bill to allow this board, with a dictator on top, to do what they please.</P>

      <P>The order of priority for the transportation of goods on the rail and road merchandise vehicles of Great Southern Railways Company is determined by me, and not by the com- <Col N="2345" /> pany.  As announced in the Press on 26th April, the Great Southern Railways Company are required to provide transport in priority for the following classes of goods: Supplies for urgent defence purposes, fuels, essential foodstuffs, raw materials for agricultural production.  The company is required to carry other traffics to the full capacity of their available services to the extent that traffic of the above descriptions is not available for carriage.</P>
      <P>Fish is being accommodated on &ldquo;perishable&rdquo; trains, which is the most expeditious service at present at the disposal of the railway company.  The best service possible is given for ice traffic within the means at the company's disposal, but it is not always possible in existing conditions to have spare wagons available for this traffic at short notice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that on the 26th and 27th April the Great Southern Railways did not supply sufficient wagons in Cork for the carriage of ice, and that, owing to this neglect, thousands of boxes of fish shipped from Valentia were condemned on the British market on the 1st and 2nd of this month?  The fishermen and the fish merchants in South Kerry fully appreciate the difficulties of the railway company, but I consider that it is not too much to ask the railway company at present to supply three or four wagons for the transport of ice when there are heavy landings of fish at Valentia and Dingle.</P>

      <P>With regard to the specific complaint of the Deputy, I am informed that the company went to considerable trouble in regard to the movement of the ice required by the fishermen, and arranged to have it forwarded to the area by a turf special train, which was the only transport available.  It is obvious that, in present circumstances, transport facilities will be curtailed, and, as we have to give priority to certain traffics essential to our own purposes, it will not be practicable to provide in future, as in the past, the same facilities for the movement of goods for export.</P>

    <P>The total net income of the company for 1943 before making provision for depreciation was £1,191,774.

      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the corporation did not get this application from Marlboro' Street National Schools last October or even last year?  The corporation is prepared to give the meals to these school children, but, under the Act, the Minister is empowered to recoup 50 per cent. of the cost.  Does the reply mean that the Department will not give it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>How could the corporation give an indication of what it proposes to spend, inasmuch as the parish priest did not apply until recently?  We did provide £5,000 extra in our estimate, but there were applications from schools subsequently, and I suggest that the Department might reconsider the position.  I know it is difficult for the Minister for Finance when making up his figures, but that is the position.  Are these children to go without the meal?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be clear to the Deputies interested in this matter that the demands cannot be varied from month to month.  In fact, that is <Col N="2352" /> what has been done in the case of the Dublin Corporation.  Since the first estimate was received on 22nd October, there have been from time to time a number of amendments of the demand. Finality must be reached at some stage. The estimated expenditure on school meals in Dublin City is £104,500 for the current year, 1944-45.  The Minister for Finance will have to find £52,250 of that amount.  It would be utterly unreasonable that from time to time throughout the year we should make additional demands on the Central Fund.  We have to get finality at some stage and give the Minister for Finance an opportunity of estimating the probable calls on the Central Fund.</P>

      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the corporation's financial year ends on 31st March, and that, in relation to previous instances of this sort, the Department always gave sanction for supplementary allowances?  Does he consider it reasonable that, because the corporation submits its estimate in March, it should assume what the amount will be to suit his particular arrangements in respect of October? The whole thing is definitely unreasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The corporation has been warned time and again, not this year or last year but on several occasions during the past four or five years, that a firm estimate must be received within a certain time.  The corporation are not being prevented from incurring the increased expenditure under this heading. The only point at issue is that any expenditure over the £104,500 will have to be borne out of corporation funds.</P>

      <P>Might I point out that not one penny of this money will be payable out of the Central Fund?  It will be paid out of Supply Services and there is nothing on God's earth to prevent him from bringing in a Supplementary Estimate for this sum, if he thinks it necessary, and letting the House decide whether the money will be provided out of the Exchequer by way of subsidy to the corporation in connection with this scheme.  It is done every week.</P>

We are not without appreciation of the difficulties, but what is to happen if, due to emergency conditions, further unemployment arises and a parish manager makes up his mind to ask for 2,000 school meals?  The School Meals Committee of the corporation and the parish managers wish to give, and will give, these meals, but we appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to give us the 50 per cent. recoupment which he is empowered to give and to introduce a Supplementary Estimate, as we in the corporation will have to do, because of the emergency circumstances.</P>

      <P>A proposed scheme for the distribution of footwear to children of persons of other low-income classes is at present under consideration in conjunction with the other Departments of State concerned.

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to urge on the House the wisdom of delaying the Second Reading of this Bill and supporting the motion put down to adjourn the Second Reading until after the report of the Railway Stocks Tribunal.  I submit that it is very important that that should be done, but there are even greater reasons for it. The Minister for Finance very properly pointed out that this guarantee represented 44 per cent. of the contingent liability of the State.  That is a very great percentage of our guarantees and it is one that should not be lightly undertaken, especially when it is for such a large amount.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, when he was addressing the House, asked why should we postpone this Bill until after the tribunal has reported.  I suggest to him that the reason we should postpone it until we have the report is that we want to know, and it is essential we should know, whose capital we are guaranteeing, and who is going to reap the benefit of the guarantee which this country is to give for this particular stock, a guarantee of £16,000,000.  That is a very large sum, and while I admit the transport of this country is very important, there are other things, in my opinion, which are even more important and which require a guarantee of financial help but will not get it, at least until it is too late.  I submit that the whole question has been pushed too quickly and the House is asked to come to a decision too hastily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister admits that he has had discussions with the railway people, <Col N="2361" /> and he must also have had discussions with the transport people.  He has had the advantage of a staff and yet I would be sure in saying that there are a great many matters in the Bill of which even he has not a thorough grasp.  It is obvious there are members of the Government with a greater opportunity who have not a grasp of these matters either.  There is no reason in the world why the matter should be rushed.  I submit there is a reason why this Bill should not be rushed.  It is the recommendation of the tribunal that a five-year plan should be adopted, and in the light of the experience of the five-year plan in which, I submit, it would be reasonable to have a dictator at the head of transport, we would have information on which to base our plans for the period after that.  I submit, therefore, that the House should refuse a Second Reading to this particular Bill or to pass the motion that it should not get a Second Reading until we have considered the report of the Stocks Tribunal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support this motion by Deputy Dr. O'Higgins.  I feel that to rush this Bill through in such a short period as to have it completed by the 1st July is not fair to the people in general.  Such a big national scheme should not be rushed through without every Deputy getting time to examine it.  So far as the text of the Bill is concerned, we have had very short notice.  In my case, I got only five or six days to consider a Bill of roughly 170 sections, between 400 and 500 sub-sections and 50 pages.  In a distant area such as County Mayo you would want a reasonable time to study some of the sections.  It is well that the Minister should realise that people in areas like Mayo have to pay attention to different aspects of the problem.  I was asked on several occasions during a period of three months whether I had got the Bill. Eventually I got it suddenly and I had not the time to tell them that it had come.  In view of this, I would consider that the Second Reading of the Bill should be deferred.  I do not think that it was reasonable to give <Col N="2362" /> such short notice to people in the country in areas where there is no railway service such as in parts of County Mayo.</P>
      <P>Many large areas of County Mayo have had no railway service for a number of years.  The railway company took away the line from Westport to Newport and Mallaranny and the branch from Mallaranny to Achill.  In those areas the railway company did not come to the assistance of the people with alternative services.  It was really the private haulier and the motor lorry that came to the rescue of the people of those areas, and the same situation applies in other parts of the country. They took up the railway line from Ballina to Killala and the company gave no substitute service.  I support all those who want to see the railway system protected, because without a railway system we could not serve the interests of the country and I do not see how the people would be able to exist.</P>
      <P>The railways must be protected, but I am making this point that if the railway company are to have a monopoly, there is no reason why they should not replace something which they have taken away from the people. I believe that a lot of the trouble in the railways is due to their lack of foresight between 1918 and 1933.  That is the period in which road services took hold and stretched out in areas which the railway company had not touched.  In my county, a considerable area is not served by the railway from Ballina to Blacksod, a distance of 60 miles.  Prior to 1918 and coming from that to 1922, stock had to walk 40 to 50 miles from the fair to the nearest railway station at Ballina.  Pigs had often to walk 50 miles to Ballina and the railway company made no effort to provide people with the service they required between those areas and the nearest railway station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was the reason for the success of the private companies, who gave the people the service they required, a good, cheap and efficient service. Private owners of these lorries went to fairs and markets without demanding a price for the day.  They went on the <Col N="2363" /> chance of getting a load and if they got a load they were paid by the load. If they did not, they had to provide for themselves and they might have to do something for themselves in order to meet the expense of the journey.  Those are the things which made the situation awkward for the railways.</P>
    <P>Section 106 of the Bill deals with 10-mile radius men.  I feel that the 10-mile radius men are very useful in certain areas, especially in my district. Those men will have to live at a certain distance from the railway.  They are conveniencing the farmers and the public, and an ordinary man can go to the lorry owner and book his lorry for the day and be told whether he can get it or not.  These men deserve very special consideration, and I am glad to see that under the section they will be able to continue their usual work.  It seems that there is a condition that up to the present they did not need to register and that by this section they will now have to be licensed.</P>
    <P>What I am afraid of in that section is that the Minister has retained to himself the power to add to the existing licences in the 10-mile radius or to refuse a licence in accordance with the requirements of traffic.  In that case I would make a special appeal to the Minister that there are areas such as I have mentioned and that those 10-mile-radius men give very useful service. As I have stated, they are always there for the convenience of the people in the ordinary way, so far as the haulage of agricultural stuff to and from the fair is concerned.  As the Minister is aware, in some parts of the country the roads are not the same as they were 25 years ago so far as horse traffic is concerned, and to my mind lorry service has come to stay, and therefore anything that would interfere with those 10-mile-radius men would seriously affect that traffic in certain districts and particularly in my own part of the county.</P>
    <P>As far as Newport, Mallaranny, and Achill districts are concerned, the Minister gave permission for the lines <Col N="2364" /> to be taken up there, and the railway company have withdrawn all services in that area.  As a result, complaints have come from that area that the people are not getting any service so far as the railways are concerned and that, even prior to the emergency regulations, they were not getting a sufficient supply of petrol for haulage purposes.  The Minister should pay special attention to the districts of Newport,. Mallaranny, and the Island of Achill and provide these people with every possible service, even during the emergency.  These people have to get in and out from the island and transport their goods, and unless they get some service, reasonably approaching what was given to them by the railways, they will not be satisfied.  I ask the Minister to give special consideration to that part of the county.</P>
    <P>The next point I want to make is that this is a post-war Bill, and I cannot see how it is so urgent that it has to be passed before the 1st July. Nobody in the House or in the country can know what will happen so far as this country is concerned when the war is over.  It should be remembered that it was the post-war regulations following the last Great War that brought the lorry traffic into this country. It started in 1917, went on through 1918, 1919 and 1920, and it was between 1920 and 1924 that the lorry traffic really came into this country. That was what happened after the last war and, accordingly, with regard to post-war regulations so far as road or lorry traffic is concerned, it is very hard to decide what is going to be the post-war position.</P>
    <P>My final point is that I do not think it is fair or right to put the control of a big combine of this kind, a State organisation, into the hands of one man.  I think that this House should have some control or some say in the matter.  We saw certain things happening in other cases where control was put practically into the hands of one man.  We saw what happened in the case of the Pigs and Bacon Board &mdash;I do not want to mention it&mdash;where the pigs and bacon trade was killed altogether, and, certainly, a national system such as this, should be sub- <Col N="2365" /> ject to some control by the elected members of this House.  You are putting £20,000,000 capital into this combine and giving control of it to one man. You are putting that combine into competition with the small men in the 10-mile radius, and we can easily realise what will happen to the small men.  They will go out of existence in a very short time.</P>
    <P>With that amount of capital behind them, the combine can wipe out these people one by one.  Of course, the owner of a lorry may be able to carry on for a year or two, but he will not be able to bear the cost of general repairs, and it is doubtful if any of these lorry owners, when their lorries become old, will be able to replace them with new ones, and if these lorries go off the roads and the whole transport business is put into the hands of the great combine I have very grave doubts with regard to freight charges in the future.  I do not think they will be as low as they are now.  After all, competition is the life of trade, and my opinion is that the competition of a number of those lorries in the different areas would be very useful competition, even as far as the railways are concerned, and they would be even more useful now when you are going to have this big combine.  The railway companies take every chance they can of collecting freight and charges generally. We had experience in that connection in Mayo, so far as Ballina and Westport are concerned, where the railway, as a result of the competition of goods coming into these ports, had to cut rates and charges on goods coming into those areas, with resulting benefit to the people concerned.  Those are just a few remarks I wish to make. In general, the Bill has been very well discussed by all sections and by all the previous speakers in the House.  The only thing I wish to say in conclusion is that I am going to vote against the Bill, principally on account of the principle contained in it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand the arguments that have been offered to this House about the rushing or alleged rushing of this Bill through the House. Everybody here knows, and everybody in the country knows, that the country <Col N="2366" /> as a whole, for many years, has been crying out for something to be done about our railway system and about the way in which the Great Southern Railways had been carrying on.  For many years, the people of this country, generally, have been demanding Government interference of some kind or another with a view to bringing some order out of the chaos that existed and still exists so far as that company is concerned.  This Bill could be described as an injection of penicillin through the gangrenous system of the Great Southern Railways Company.  It holds out a hope that even at this late stage something will be done to put those things in order and, from that point of view, I think the Bill should be welcomed by all sides in the House.</P>
      <P>It has been said here that whatever complaints there may be in respect of the matters that are being investigated by the tribunal that is sitting at the moment, these matters have nothing to do with the principles enshrined in this Bill.  There are a few matters in connection with the Bill on which I should like more information.  One is the question of harbours, and particularly small harbours, throughout the country. We, in Mayo, save something like £2,000 every year as a result of Westport Harbour being open&mdash;I am speaking of the county council&mdash;when we were importing tar through Westport Harbour.  The Minister may say that the Bill does not propose to interfere with any harbour, but there are various ways in which the company in the future could interfere with such harbours. For instance, if the company closed down a line to one of these small harbours they could manufacture the excuse that the line was uneconomic and, in that way, cut out competition by the small harbours throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is one of the matters on which I should like more information and some guarantee from the Minister that that will not happen in the future, because there is a temptation for any company given a monopoly such as is proposed here, to attempt by every means at their disposal to eliminate all types of opposition.  I should certainly like to see these harbours preserved <Col N="2367" /> and I hope that this company, when it is the be-all and end-all of transport in the country, will not be in a position to wipe out the traffic from these small ports by lifting the lines leading to them.  I am not satisfied that it was in the best interests of the company or of its business to wipe out some of these lines in the past.  I think that they now find that the closing of lines such as the Newport line in Mayo was a great mistake.  It is a very easy thing to close down a line, but it is not so easy to replace it.  That line has now disappeared, of course, and there is no possibility of having it reopened.  I hope that the representative of the Minister on the new board will see to it that the company will be run, not so much from the point of view of a profit-making concern, as in the general interests of the community.  I hope that the company will have regard to the service which it should render to the community as well as having regard to profit-making for shareholders. The railway service is vital to all sections of the community and in some instances the company will have to bear in mind that there are things more important than mere profit-making and that there are certain vital services that must be carried out irrespective of how they may be viewed from a business standpoint.</P>
    <P>The Minister made it clear that it is not the intention of this Bill to interfere after the war with the private lorry.  The position of people operating such services within a ten mile radius of places like Ballina, Drogheda, Sligo, Tralee and Westport is not clear to me.  I am not clear whether it is the intention to renew the licences of the present licensees when they die out. I should like to know from the Minister whether it is the intention under the Bill to allow those people to transfer their licences, or otherwise dispose of them, or whether it is the intention to continue the present practice of allowing a father to transfer his licence to his son.  I know that these people have performed an excellent service to the community during the years in which they have been operating, <Col N="2368" /> and I should like to see them allowed to continue that service.  I think the experience of the Minister is that they have been doing it as well as the railway company or anybody else could do it.  The value of these people's services was recognised before when they were allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>Criticism has been levelled at this Bill on the ground that the amount proposed to be paid to the company is too much.  I do not know that that criticism is justified.  I do not know that anybody who held these investments in railway stock, certainly since the old days, have made a fortune out of them.  I think the opposite is the case.  Quite a number of people have held on for a great number of years without getting any return whatever for their money in the hope that at some future date something might be done for them.  These people who held on to railway shares for a great number of years in the expectation of making something out of them found instead that a considerable part of their holdings was reduced by legislation time and again.  These people are not making a fortune under the proposals outlined in this Bill.  So far as people who bought these stocks in recent years are concerned, I do not know that anybody ever bought anything without expecting to make something out of his investment.  People do not invest in enterprises of this kind without expecting to make something out of it.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything extraordinary in the proposals contained in this Bill and the fact that agreement has been reached between the Minister's Department and these people is all to the good.  The suggestion has been made that it would be better if the question was left to arbitration.  Some Deputies have suggested that the proper way to approach this matter would be to take the figures quoted on the Stock Exchange for these shares in 1938 or 1937.  It may not be a proper analogy, but if you take the case of a countryman who purchased a farm of land at the height of the economic war at a comparatively low price, I do not think it would be fair <Col N="2369" /> to ask him to accept the same price to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. L. Cosgrave Mr. L. Cosgrave">

      <P>To take another instance, if you asked a man who bought stock for his farm 12 months or two years ago to sell them to you today at the same price as he paid for them, I do not think anybody would call it just or equitable.  We had arbitration before when the Great Southern Railways Company were taking over lorries from a number of hauliers and everybody knows that it was a farce, as far as the company was concerned.  I could never understand myself why the company agreed to a system under which people were enabled to sell them old lorries without any goodwill for thousands of pounds. The company were raked and robbed under that system.  They paid a lot of money for practically nothing at that time and I am glad that some agreement has been reached on this occasion that seems to be acceptable to everybody.  I heard no good argument during the debate as to why we should hold up this scheme any longer.  This is a Bill which is long overdue, a Bill under which we hope to see the whole question of the transport of this country brought under proper control. I hope that the Government will go further and include other forms of transport such as canals.  In that way we shall have a system of transport that will not be dependent on a board of directors who have no interest in the community as a whole.  At least we shall know what is going on because the facts and figures in connection with the undertaking will be laid before the House and will be brought under yearly review.  We shall have an opportunity in that way of reviewing the operations of this company.</P>

      <P>Apparently there is practically no need to engage in this discussion on the lines of the necessity for a reorganisation of our transport system but, on the other hand, now that the proposals are before the House, the argument used by almost every Party is that there is not sufficient time at our disposal to examine <Col N="2370" /> this Bill, and that it should be postponed for this and that consideration. I thought that this opportunity would have been availed of by the Labour Party particularly, to criticise the Government on the belatedness of the introduction of this measure.  They might have been able to adduce good arguments along those lines.  They must realise, of course, that the Government have been studying this question for many years, faced with the failure of the Great Southern Railways Company to give satisfactory and efficient service and the failure of those in control of it to fully appreciate and act according to their responsibilities.</P>

    <P>Everybody knows that a tribunal was set up by the Government and brought in a report.  Then the war intervened. I suppose we were so much occupied with the different aspects of the defence of our country and the awful inroads made upon our general economic position that time passed. Two years ago, the Minister for Industry and Commerce appointed a chairman of the board in control of the Great Southern Railways with very full powers.  Since then, statements have been made on behalf of the Government and by the Minister.  The Minister has acted and we are now examining proposals which are the outcome of those years of experience, including the tribunal examination, with the report of that body and its volume of evidence.  That was a very important report but more important must be the experience of the man who was put in charge a couple of years ago to make the most of the transport facilities at our disposal.  Neither the Labour Party nor the other Parties have been idle in this connection. They have made comments on our transport system.  The Labour Party has been discussing the whole question of transport year in and year out. Within the past few months, some spokesmen of the Labour Party have been actually lecturing on proposed heads for a transport Bill.  The Labour Party were quick off the mark in presenting a set of counter-proposals regarding the principles on which legislation should operate.  I think, most <Col N="2371" /> definitely, that, as sensible men, we should realise that we must make up our minds some time and that, when we ask for a thing and get it, we should not ask for a postponement but rather try to get down to implementing the measure as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputies have given many names to these proposals.  Deputy Davin described this Bill as a Fascist Bill. Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney advocated nationalisation which, he said, this Bill is not.  Deputy McGilligan was more cautious.  He would not commit himself to a policy of nationalisation but said he would prefer nationalisation to this Bill.  Deputy Dockrell could not discover any difference between nationalisation and these proposals. Deputy Larkin (Junior) challenged the Minister to give his opinion on the whole policy of nationalisation. Deputy Donnellan called the Bill a dictatorial measure, and finally Deputy MacEoin said there was as much difference between nationalisation of the services and this Bill as there was between two &ldquo;ones&rdquo; on a piece of paper.</P>

As practical people, we should work out a system, call it what you will, which will be most suited to our own position and be derived from our own experience.

      <P>In his opening statement, the Minister was very informative on the results of his experience. He faced the issue boldly and he comes along now with a plan in this Bill which is in many respects novel. Surely, it is not because the proposals in this Bill differ from legislation in other countries that Deputies cannot see in this measure a really honest and courageous attempt to solve our difficulties. We have many forms of public utility control.  Some of them serve us well; others of them may not. We took over certain State Departments from the British Government and they are still functioning as State Departments.  If we had to build from the ground a system of State organisations, we might not have planned the same way at all.  Posts and Telegraphs, apparently, are well fitted into a position of State control in time of emergency but would one say in respect to the telephone service that a public utility corporation might not have given better service to the country?  Deputies of the Fine Gael Party have concentrated on the composition of the Electricity Supply Board.  I am not in a position to criticise either the composition or the functions of the Electricity Supply Board. I cannot discuss its successes or its failures.  I am not suggesting that it has had any failures.  I know very little about it.  I have heard it said from the opposite side of the House that this House debates the whole question of the working of the Electricity Supply Board and its policy.  I did not think that was so; I may be wrong.  I thought, of course, that if the Electricity Supply Board wanted additional finances from this House, that this House would have a perfect right to discuss the entire ramifications of the Electricity Supply Board, with respect to their request for that money.  The Electricity Supply Board is functioning under the control of men in whom, apparently, the State has considerable faith but none of us knows whether or not it might have worked better under a different system.  It does not even have to give <Col N="2373" /> an account of itself to an annual meeting of shareholders.  Audited accounts and a report, of course, are published and laid on the Table of the Dáil and Seanad as will be audited statements of account of this company but is there with respect to the Electricity Supply Board any users' or consumers' council such as is being set up under this Bill in respect of the users of transport?  How many citizens might decry the valuation system of tariffs employed by the Electricity Supply Board if they had an opportunity? Is it fair?  Is it the best system?  How many citizens are in a position to criticise the Electricity Supply Board for failure to engage earlier in the greater development programme that might have served us well during the emergency?  Not one. The Minister must have tremendous experience in the working of the Electricity Supply Board.  He has been asked questions on many occasions and has found himself not in a position to reply because he has left the Electricity Supply Board to function as an independent corporation.  He takes different powers under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have tried to make the point that we should discuss this Bill now.  All countries are planning and we say that we should plan.  I say we should go further than mere planning.  We should try to set up organisations, such as is proposed under this Bill with respect to transport, that will be able possibly to implement some features of the planning before we enter the post-war period.  Deputy Browne very kindly presented to the Minister a case for his action in respect of this Bill.  He drew attention to the fact that unrestricted, uncontrolled, competitive transport crept in immediately after the first World War. It crept into Britain.  It crept in here and although I am one who feels that competition of a good type is definitely necessary, none of us wants unrestricted, uncontrolled competition.  In this particular-instance the Minister asks, not alone that we should plan as we have planned and as he and his Department have planned in connection with this Bill, but for authority to have it implemented quickly so that, even if it means only taking <Col N="2374" /> steps to examine some of the very big problems associated with transport, those in control of the company may be in a position to act with a full sense of responsibility.  Granted, for instance, that the present chairman of the Great Southern Railways Company may be the chairman designate of the new company, how could it be expected that he would function and plan with the same forcefulness now as he would if the Bill were enacted?  Is it not obvious that the two sets of conditions would be entirely different for that person?  If the Bill were enacted immediately he would feel that he had the necessary power and authority in addition to his very heavy responsibility.</P>
    <P>On the question of the general principles underlying the Bill and the type of control, I see in this Bill a scientific, democratic approach to a very serious problem.  Transport is one of the life-lines of this nation's economy and with respect to the responsibilities of the new control I think our democratic institutions will have as much control over the workings of the transport board proposed in the Bill as they would have under any form or make-up that has been proposed during this debate.  The chairman has great powers.  He will be answerable to the Minister.  Why should not he have great powers and be answerable to the Minister when under the proposals this House is accepting the greatest responsibility? That is agreed.  He will have associated with him those representing the common stockholders of the company. Those directors will be elected annually by the stockholders.  They will realise that unless the company can earn more than will be required for the debenture holders the people they represent will get nothing.  Surely that must provide a considerable spur, if suitable directors are appointed?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>To raise freight rates, yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The chairman will have unlimited powers.  I do not know whether Deputies have found the super-man, the man who will act as chairman of this board and will take no notice, or very little, of the remarks or the influences of those co-directors <Col N="2375" /> who will be, in all probability, representing very vital sections in the economic life of this country&mdash;industrialists, commercial men, agriculturists, and so on.  If that were not deemed sufficient he has introduced an advisory transport committee into the Bill, which provides the country with a triumvirate of interests, a chairman, directors representing the common stockholders and the advisory committee. That triumvirate should make for a solution of the many problems associated with the finance, working, and operation of the transport system.  It will be agreed that there is very little use in making the point that the common stockholders are being presented with a gift of complete ownership of a concern which is valued from £15,000,000 to £16,000,000.  As far as I understand the fixed profit, it means nothing more than a national utility corporation.  It would be better if instead of criticising any person who may be designated as the responsible chairman of this board, we were to consider if we could possibly find such a person here willing to assume the tremendous responsibility of the office envisaged under this Bill.  It has been claimed that he is not a railway technician. Must he necessarily be that?  It will be admitted that the chairman of such a company could be a person with the broadest possible experience of management of company affairs and that such a man could be found in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Technical advice can be purchased and will give control with integrity, breadth of vision, and sense of responsibility towards this country's interest rather than control by technicians. I can visualise many matters that would have to be reviewed and, in all probability, attempts may have to be made to put some of them into operation before the post-war period. There is the question of zoning of the country with respect to deliveries and charges.  Something like that might be <Col N="2376" /> done now as part of the policy of such an individual.  There is also the study of transport developments in other countries; electric traction about which so much has been glibly talked, and about which so very little appears to be known outside Cork, or the ability of this country to pay for it.  The question of Diesel locomotives would have to be examined; also the standardisation of equipment.  I read yesterday that in one of the belligerent countries the number of parts in the building of a locomotive has been reduced by 1,000 owing to standardisation.  I know nothing about the building of locomotives, but I did not think there were so many parts required.  There is also the question of minimising the rehandling of traffic between rail and road to its ultimate destination.  That is most important and may take years of planning and studying before any scheme could be implemented which would cut out waste and keep together a fine body of Irish workers, as well as improving their conditions of employment. When we talk of the transport system we seem to forget that in addition to the stockholders and the users of railways there are others who depend on the industry as their primary method of livelihood.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to go into the various sections of the Bill now, as that can better be done in Committee. I join with members of the Labour Party and with other Deputies in drawing attention to Sections 40 and 45, of which some explanation is due. I feel that can be best given in Committee.</P>
      <P>The financial proposals can also be best discussed in Committee.  The proposals outlined in the Bill received considerable discussion in Cork, and I understand that there was considerable criticism of the terms offered stockholders and debenture holders.  An amount of such material will provide ready ammunition for those who may wish to score off the Government on the financial provisions.  I prefer to reserve my remarks about a Cork pamphlet until such time as it sees the light of day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one suggestion that I would like to make to the Minister while not <Col N="2377" /> necessarily requesting that it be put into the Bill.  Generally speaking, with respect to all forms of State or public enterprise under the control of the State, or guaranteed by the State, I feel that it might pay us well to have a re-examination of such enterprises by experts every five or ten years.  I have not given the matter very much study.  I can see tremendous difficulties in the way of finding-persons to conduct such a re-examination.  I do feel, however, that as the tempo of this war had developed the Minister could find some body to make such a re-investigation to see how those various State or public concerns, concerns guaranteed by the State, would have functioned over a period of five or ten years.</P>
    <P>I feel that this Bill is deserving of a Second Reading even if only from the point of view that we are being put to the test with regard to a call for planning.  When the plan is before us we refuse to accept it and want to postpone it.  If Deputies feel that this is a Bill that does not fulfil all that they would wish to see in a transport Bill, they can get down to a discussion on it in the Committee Stage.  I, at any rate, feel that the Bill should get a Second Reading from the House. That is due as a tribute to the many years of effort on the part of the Minister responsible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BridgetMRedmond" hpid="Mrs. Redmond Mrs. Redmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Redmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to raise my voice in support of the amendment.  I do so not in a spirit of vindictiveness or against the Government, but simply because I think such a course would be for the good of the country.  Several speakers have pointed out that there is a great deal of uneasiness in people's minds in regard to this Bill.  After all, if we come here to represent the people it is surely our duty to say here in Parliament what their wishes are. The people whom I have the honour to represent feel that there has been too much hurry about the Bill, and that for a time at least the Government should not proceed with it.  The Government have set up a Railway Tribunal to carry out an investigation into certain matters.  I am of opinion that the Bill should not be proceeded <Col N="2378" /> with until that tribunal has reported. I would ask the Minister to consider that point.  If the tribunal find that there is nothing of a dishonourable nature to be reported on, why then the necessity to hurry the Bill through? We do not want Parliament to be brought into disrepute by trying to cover up something that, possibly, is not there.  In order, therefore, to alleviate misunderstandings or any grievances the people may feel they have, I think it is in the interests of the country, of the House and of the Government that the further consideration of the Bill should be postponed.</P>
      <P>There are a few points in the Bill that I desire to deal with.  One concerns the position of private lorry owners and of hackney car owners. These men have as much right to live as anybody else.  Personally, I have a great dislike to monopolies, no matter what they may be.  There is an old and a true saying that &ldquo;competition is the life of trade&rdquo;.  For that reason I think that the rights of the people I refer to should be safeguarded in the Bill.  It has been said in the House that these people have nothing to fear.  I would like to have a definite undertaking from the Minister that they have nothing to fear.  I know that they are very doubtful in their minds as to the interpretation that may be placed on this Bill when it becomes an Act.  For that reason, I would like to have an undertaking from the Minister on the lines that I have indicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the chairman of the new company, I think that no matter what kind of man he may be, what ability he may possess, or what capabilities he may have, the powers which it is proposed to confer on him are too great for any one individual to have.  I think he should be put in the position that he would have to take directions from his colleagues on the board.  I understand that he will be the one man who will really count. After all, we are dealing in this Bill with the railway system of Ireland.  It is a huge undertaking that concerns the whole country.  In my opinion, the powers which it is proposed to confer on this one individual are too far-reaching and too wide.  It may be that <Col N="2379" /> later we will repent that we gave him such powers.  The people feel uneasy about this, no matter how capable the man may be, or how qualified he may be to fill the post.  I hope the Minister will look into this and make certain that this individual will, in some way, have to take directions from his colleagues on the board.  Even though the Bill may have to get a Second Reading, I would again ask the Minister to defer proceeding with the further stages of it until such time as the tribunal has reported.  I would ask him not to hurry it through, so that we may have time to ponder over the many good suggestions that have been made in the course of the debate. I urge that in no spirit of vindictiveness, but rather with a desire to cooperate with the Government in dealing with the biggest industry that we have in the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>We have now had considerable discussion on the various aspects of this Bill and, before I actually deal with it, there is another matter I would like to mention.  I deprecate the growing tendency on the part of certain Deputies to cast aspersions in a veiled way on individuals outside the House, who have no opportunities of refuting or answering those charges, made by Deputies under the privilege they enjoy as members of the Dáil.  Occasionally, those charges are backed up by such expressions as &ldquo;I know what I am talking about&rdquo;, or &ldquo;I can prove what I say&rdquo;, and there and then the evidence stops.  No further evidence is adduced, either here or elsewhere, in support of the imputations or aspersions cast on those individuals.  Usually the individual is not named, but most Deputies who make the charges here leave no doubt in the minds of listeners or of the public as to the individuals to whom they are referring.  If Deputies have charges to make and evidence on which they can base those charges, there are other places in which to make them and other tribunals to <Col N="2382" /> decide them.  There is a deplorable tendency to use the privilege of the Dáil to attack persons or groups of persons, safe from any consequences which might result if Deputies made the charges outside as ordinary individuals.</P>
      <P>One of the principles of this Bill is that of the amalgamation of Dublin United Transport Company and the Great Southern Railways.  As I said on another occasion, I believe that that principle is a sound one but, lest I be misinterpreted in any way in opposing the Second Reading, I want to make it quite clear that, when I spoke in favour of amalgamation, the other proposals now contained in this Bill were not available.  The only information then available was that the proposed amalgamation was to be portion of transport legislation.  I still adhere to that view, in so far as it is in this Bill &mdash;that a unified transport undertaking is the best system.  On no account, however, could I subscribe to certain matters in the Bill now presented to us.  I can go further and say that if, on the Committee Stage, the Government see fit to accept amendments, which I presume will be put down&mdash; and I propose to put some down myself&mdash;then I will have no hesitation in voting for the measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his opening address the Minister mentioned that this Bill contains a long-term policy.  He also mentioned that the present emergency restrictions had nothing whatever to do with that proposed long-term policy of the Government.  I presume that he took that precaution in view of the fact that numerous Deputies, and many of the general public, are perturbed by the nature of the restrictions and by the nature of the control now in operation. They feel a sense of danger that these restrictions may remain in the post-war period.  While the Minister mentioned the fact that the present restrictions had little or no relation to the proposals in the Bill he omitted to mention the fact that at the present time, or since the emergency, the only occasion in which the Great Southern Railways was able to make a profit was during, and arising out of, emergency conditions.  To try to discuss the measure in a manner detached <Col N="2383" /> from the emergency is, in my opinion, not possible.  Whether we like it or not, we are affected in more ways than one by the impact of the present emergency and by the restrictions and other effects arising out of the conditions which the emergency has imposed. There are certain matters in the Bill which I would like to get clarified before I proceed much further.  In Section 9, which the Minister has dealt with in the White Paper, sub-section (2) reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The company may, with the sanction of the Minister, acquire by purchase or by the exchange of stock of the company the whole or any part of any transport undertaking carried on by any other person and the property and assets used in or in connection with such undertaking.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister, in reply to Deputy McGilligan, said: &ldquo;Subject to agreement,&rdquo; as I understood him.  There is no mention in the Bill of agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. L. Cosgrave Mr. L. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite, but it says the company may, with the sanction of the Minister, acquire.  The Minister has a fair amount of experience of legislation and he knows that whatever intention he may have and whatever opinions he may voice in the course of the debate will not influence the judiciary or anyone else in interpreting this Bill.  I am sure Deputies have heard from time to time of judges saying that they were quite sure the law was intended to do something but they will have to interpret the legislation as on the Statute Book.  If an undertaking is to be acquired it might be advisable to alter the existing section and I would ask, if it is intended to acquire other undertakings would the Minister say the number of years' purchase that would be given and if it would be the same as in the 1933 Act?  Finally, would he say, if they do acquire an undertaking under this section, that the compensation payable to the employees who will not be absorbed will be the same as the 1933 Act? Coming to the financial position, I <Col N="2384" /> believe that there is not a great deal of difference except nominal difference between this and nationalisation. £4,000,000 of ordinary stock has been retained to give the Bill a less drastic appearance than nationalisation, but in fact it is nationalisation, possibly in its worst form.  I think nationalisation might not be a bad system.  On the other hand the Minister has abandoned the belief he had when a Deputy, that nationalisation was the best system.  I suppose he was younger then and certain allowances might be made for youth.</P>

      <P>As far as I can see, the difference between this measure and nationalisation is £4,000,000 of ordinary stockholders shares.  The Minister would be better advised to guarantee the whole account and have it earning 3 per cent. on the whole stock, not 3 per cent. on the guaranteed stock, and then 6 per cent., if it is possible to earn it, on the rest.  Numerous Deputies have complained in one fashion or another about the treatment meted out to the stockholders, particularly stockholders who may have been induced to sell their stocks last year.  We have got to realise that the stockholders had very little prospects under conditions as they formerly existed.  That the State has to guarantee stockholders, or the people who invest money in undertakings, that they will be recouped for their enterprise is a suggestion to which I think few Deputies could subscribe support. It is regrettable that stockholders who had stock in the Great Southern Railways Company over a number of years had little or no return, but it is even more regrettable that the manner in which the company was worked meant that money was taken from reserve and other funds so that money was paid out in dividends which were not earned.  The position has been that the company has been inefficiently managed on the one <Col N="2385" /> hand, and on the other it had to compete with private individuals operating transport services both for passenger traffic and the carriage of goods and live stock.  I believe firmly that you cannot have on the one hand an efficient national transport undertaking and at the same time allow unrestricted free competition.  There has been a good deal of loose talk to the effect that competition is good for trade.  This competition that is good for trade has largely contributed to putting this railway into the position in which it is.  You cannot have on the one hand transport available at all times, running according to schedule, at peak hours and at weak hours, paying dividends and providing transport for goods and passengers at a cheap rate, and on the other hand allow that organisation to run in competition with private firms which can run at the peak hours only and take the cream of the traffic, and which are not required to keep to a schedule of charges and to run at certain hours.  We must realise that it is not possible to do both things.  We cannot expect to have full facilities and efficiency on the one hand and then expect the national company to compete with almost unrestricted competition from private individuals.  I have no desire that the private lorry owners and in particular the business concerns which run lorries, cars, or wagons for the carriage of their own goods should be interfered with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If private operators are allowed to compete, and to give service at a cheaper rate than the transport company, which has to run at definite times, and has a far greater liability, then I am afraid some restriction must be placed on the private operator. It must not be forgotten that the railway company has far larger liabilities than have private operators.  Private operators, even the largest of them, have only a certain number of lorries. I think a fairly representative figure would be two lorries.  In many cases the owner drives one of them.  He may pay a man or two men what he considers, and what they are satisfied, is a reasonable wage.  He can charge whatever he deems necessary.  The railway <Col N="2386" /> company, on the other hand, has to pay a standard rate of wages.  It has a large undertaking to maintain, and is subject to control in so far as fares and freights are concerned.</P>
    <P>We cannot have it both ways.  We must accede to the principle that transport is a public utility, similar to the Electricity Supply Board, or Posts and Telegraphs.  If we are not prepared to accede to that, and to take whatever small or undesirable consequences that may result, we will have to adopt the other system in which unrestricted private transport can proceed, but that may not serve the needs of the country, or it may only serve certain needs.  No private haulier or lorry owner has the means, or is prepared, to carry dangerous goods or large quantities of heavy merchandise which a public transport company must carry.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that the railroad is the backbone of any transport system in this country.  I listened to his speech and, in case I misinterpreted it in any way, I read his speech.  If it is the case that the railroad is the backbone of any transport undertaking in this country, I wonder what are the Government's ideas concerning the obsolete and unstandardised equipment which this company has, or what prospect have we before we embark on a guarantee that may not be required but that leaves uneasy even the most optimistic member of the Fianna Fáil Party, with the exception of the Minister and a few back benchers who would shout &ldquo;yes&rdquo; if asked whether Queen Victoria outside should be painted pink.  But this is more serious than merely getting up and blowing the Party trumpet.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister is comparatively optimistic concerning the future of transport, optimistic possibly because he sees in the individual whom he proposes to appoint&mdash;I suppose there is no doubt in anyone's mind as to who the individual is&mdash;an individual who will be able, coupled with assistance, to make transport an efficient and profitable undertaking under the new company. I must say that considerable success has attended the efforts of the present chairman of the Great Southern Railways. <Col N="2387" /> He is principally a passenger man, but some time ago the company secured the able services of Mr. Dooley, who formerly operated a large haulier undertaking.  Neither of these men is a railway man.  One of them was a road transport man, and the other a road passenger man.  So far as I am aware, and I think most Deputies are in a similar position, no well-known or competent railway man has been selected.  If the railroad is the backbone of public transport, what indication or guarantee can the Minister give that the people who are likely to constitute the directing influences in the new company have experience of railway management?</P>
    <P>So far as I can see, the only people who have experience of railway management are some members of the old board.  I do not want to say anything disparaging of the old board, but the management of the railway by that board would not inspire confidence in any member of that board as an efficient railway manager.  If we are to accept it that the railroad is to be the backbone of any transport undertaking, I am certainly of the opinion that the present chairman is the person best qualified.  We know of him in so far as passenger traffic is concerned, and he is ably assisted by a merchandise man.</P>
    <P>No indication has been given by the Government that there is any possibility of more efficient railway services being operated by the new company. I wonder is the Minister right when he says that the railroad is the backbone of any transport undertaking in this country?  To a certain extent it has been the backbone up to the present. I do not want to express any opinion as to what our system of transport is likely to be in the future.  This, however, is certain: that, with the exception of heavy traffic and certain military necessities, there is likely to be a change from railway services to road services.  We have been discussing railway services, tram services and bus services, but we have no guarantee that in the future newer methods of transport may not be put into operation. I refer now to air transport. Then, again, we may expect heavier <Col N="2388" /> road transport, and perhaps, an altogether new system of passenger and goods traffic will some years hence be in operation.</P>
    <P>This company, so far as we are informed, is to deal with transport unmolested by future legislation, and the board are to be assured that this legislation is permanent.  If this legislation is permanent, subject, of course, to the changes which the Minister may make in the chairmanship of the board, have the Government any individual in mind who is capable of dealing with air transport or air development? So far as I can see, with the exception of the amalgamation, there is little change in this Bill from the system which has been in operation.</P>
    <P>Now, I come to a section of the Bill which gives the chairman the unrestricted powers which have been the subject of so much comment in the House.  It ought not to be necessary that an able and efficient chairman of the board should have such powers.  If the Minister is so confident of the ability of the chairman, whoever he may be, it is hardly necessary for an able, efficient and conscientious chairman to be armed with the powers which he has under Section 35 and the succeeding sections.  He can put through any proposal in the teeth of the verbal opposition of the other directors; that is what it amounts to, because under the Bill the other directors can only make their wishes felt by verbal or written opposition.  So far as effective action is concerned, no power remains in the other directors to prevent the chairman constituting a meeting alone, and taking any decision at that meeting with or without their concurrence.  Putting aside the question of the ability of a competent chairman to run the company alone, surely, the Minister does not consider that directors, with either ability or even legitimate pride in their own capacity to contribute to the affairs of the company, will be content to remain long on the board if the chairman, over an extended period, dissents from any suggestions, or generally from suggestions or opinions which they may offer?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2389" /> I have seen it stated that the company, as administered over the past two years, has had a successful experience in connection with the chairman who has, at the moment, under the Emergency Powers Order, over-riding power.  But there is no guarantee that such a state of affairs will continue&mdash; for two reasons.  If the personnel of the board is changed it may mean that the harmony which has existed will no longer exist.  On the other hand, if the personnel remains the same, it must be remembered that the members of the board and the chairman at the present time are operating under an Emergency Powers Order which is only, however lengthy it may be, of a temporary nature.  But the moment this Bill becomes law, the chairman of the board can ignore entirely&mdash;it is unlikely that he will&mdash;any suggestions of the other members of the Board.  Putting aside the likelihood of a stubborn attitude on the part of the chairman, I am sure the Minister realises that no self-respecting individuals, who believe that they can contribute something to the efficient management of the company, and who have been put on the board by the stockholders, will long tolerate continual discord, to put it no stronger, between themselves and the chairman, who can constitute the whole effective organisation alone without their influence.  I suggest to the Minister that the quorum of the board should be three, of whom the chairman will be one.  While the Minister may doubt that that would be in the best interests of his contact with the board, surely a company, efficiently managed, which can inspire the confidence not alone of the employees but of the general public, should need little or no interference from a Minister of State.</P>
    <P>I now come to the question of the powers which it is proposed the Minister will have when the Bill becomes law.  So far as the direction of transport affairs is concerned, after this Bill becomes law two people, acting in unison, can direct, according to their opinion, the whole of the transport undertaking.  One is the chairman of the new company, the other is the Minister for Industry and Commerce. <Col N="2390" /> Now the Government occasionally praise the extent to which the State has intervened in the affairs of the people.  Last week, in the Budget, the Minister for Finance gave expression to the view&mdash;I do not know whether it is his own view or not&mdash;that he thought the State had gone too far.  If the State has gone too far already, in this Bill a step that is far more extreme than any we have yet witnessed is being taken by the Minister in his capacity as Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He may regulate the fares, he may prescribe distances, he may direct the company to open or to close lines, according to his opinion, after, of course, he has received a report from the transport advisory committee.</P>
    <P>Now the functions of the transport advisory committee in relation to the Minister remind us of the functions of the Council of State in relation to the President.  The Council of State can meet and can make suggestions but, after that, the President can say: &ldquo;I will have nothing to do with any suggestions you make.&rdquo; Here we have the same situation.  The transport advisory committee can meet and consider and advise, but it stops there; the Minister need not take the advice.  Now, before the Railway Tribunal, which it is proposed to abolish after this Bill becomes law, different parties affected by proposed changes in freights and fares could put their case and the railway company, on the other hand, could argue their side of the question.  While it is possible that, to a certain extent, the Railway Tribunal has outlived its intended purpose, at any rate a case had to be made before the company could alter the charges which existed. Under the Bill, the Minister may receive suggestions from interested parties through the advisory council, but, after that, the Minister decides.  There are two objections to that.  On the one hand, the Minister may, in defiance of the company, force it to charge certain rates which the company knows, from its experience and its costings, are unremunerative, and immediately the company is faced with running unremunerative transport.  On the other hand, the Minister is faced with the <Col N="2391" /> danger which he took good care to give warning about in relation to nationalisation: political influence and political pull.  If employees of a railway or transport company can exert influence&mdash;and I have never found this Government other than amenable to political influence&mdash;under a nationalised system surely the same influence could be exerted under this arrangement. No later than to-day we had a question on the Order Paper about the Mountmellick branch line, and surely the Minister realises that, coming up to a general election, if agitation started in Mountmellick, the railways company would be ordered to proceed with all possible haste to reopen the Mountmellick branch line.  Nobody knows that better than the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. L. Cosgrave Mr. L. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>If you got in. Before the last election, a certain colliery in Deputy Linehan's constituency, which had long been unused or which had fallen into disuse for one reason or another, was started, although four or five years ago, when a proposition was made to the Government that it should to opened, it was said that it was uneconomic and could not be worked.  A month before the last election, however, when political influence could be exerted to have it opened, the Minister sent down a set of prospectors, at the instigation, I presume, of local Fianna Fáil supporters. There is nothing in the Bill to prevent such agitation starting, as the Minister knows perfectly well, as existed in connection with the Clifden railway and now exists in connection with the Mountmellick line.  In fact, it is far more serious.  I can visualise a state of affairs in which there would not be enough men to start branch lines, so strong might political agitation be at a time when an election was pending.  If the danger exists of labour people exerting political influence on the Government, surely the danger exists of labour people, business <Col N="2392" /> people and others in a large area, who desire to be served by the reopening of a particular line, exerting similar influence.</P>
      <P>I object to the excessive powers the Minister is seeking.  I need not reiterate the sections and sub-sections but under the Bill the Minister, in conjunction or in disagreement with the chairman, has power to start branch lines, to prescribe maximum distances, to prescribe maximum fares and to prevent the company from charging what they believe are remunerative rates.  That might be quite satisfactory, but it is my opinion that a Minister of State, and particularly a Minister for Industry and Commerce, has sufficient work to do in the discharge of the duties of his office without running the transport of a country in conjunction with his nominee.  Particularly do I regard it so because the machinery in the Bill for advising the Minister as to the reasonableness or otherwise of the charges is entirely inadequate.  The machinery is there; the provision is there; and the safeguards are there; but the safeguards and the provisions are entirely useless, if the Minister decides not to accept the proposals made to him.</P>
      <P>I come now to the question of superannuation.  It is undesirable that the directors of a company should be remunerated on a more generous basis than the ordinary employees.  Under this Bill, the ordinary employees' remuneration is fixed according to the Fifth Schedule.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>For a shorter period, and subject to the fact that redundancy takes place within six months.  No more unjust proposal could come before this House.  Even the greatest &ldquo;yes-man&rdquo; of the Fianna Fáil Party, Deputy O Briain&mdash;and this, in my opinion, is the strongest case which can be made against the section &mdash;mentioned that this six-months' period was not quite fair.  Deputy McGilligan, who had considerable experience of the working of transport, <Col N="2393" /> said that, under the legislation for which he had portion of the responsibility, it was found that the seven-years' period was insufficient.  But by this proposal, a Government which I always understood to pose as a poor man's Government and which, at any rate, was going to see that this country was not run on an imperial scale, denies simple justice.  It may not deny that simple justice, but it may mean that simple justice will be denied to the redundant employees of the Great Southern Railways and the Dublin United Transport Company.  Whoever advised the Minister on that section might advise him to accept an amendment on the Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>With regard to the advisory committee and the board of directors, it would, in my opinion, be far more efficient and far less unwieldy to unite these two bodies and to put on the board of directors a person, the nominee of the Minister, experienced in industrial and commercial matters, a person experienced in agriculture and fisheries, as the nominee of the Minister for Agriculture, and a person&mdash;to use the Minister's phrase&mdash;who can speak authoritatively on labour matters.  I do not know an individual in this country at the present time who can speak authoritatively for Labour. The two sections of Labour here differ.  Now, under the Bill, it is desirable, not alone in the interests of the company but in the interests of the workers, that whoever speaks for Labour will speak authoritatively.  As far as one can judge, from newspaper reports, the relations at the moment, or certainly which have existed up to recently, between the company and certain representatives of Labour organisations have not been marked by all the harmony that might be desired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I am not entirely satisfied that a certain amount of that lack of harmony is due to the fact that the Labour representatives are more concerned with their differences in the Labour Movement rather than with the rights of the workers or in seeing that the rights of the workers should be protected, but I do say that whoever represents the workers in this matter should represent them in the fullest <Col N="2394" /> sense, and not merely represent the members of a single union or, if so, that the representatives of that union should be in a position to speak for all the workers concerned, and to speak authoritatively for them.  I do not know whether the Minister has more information on the lack of harmony between the Labour representatives than I have, but I understand that certain negotiations have taken place between the company and one section of Labour.  If that section represents all the workers in the Great Southern Railways Company and the Dublin United Transport Company, and if the outcome is satisfactory, then it is all to the good; but during the earlier stages of this discussion it appeared to me that harmony between the Labour representatives in this House, whether or not they speak for the workers in the Great Southern Railways Company, does not exist.</P>
    <P>I come now to a number of matters which affect my own constituency, and one of them is the question of wayleaves. Most Deputies here have spoken of their personal experiences in their own constituencies.  They have mentioned their experiences in the working of transport undertakings, and particularly have we had a volume of protest or defence in regard to the Dublin citizens who may be affected&mdash; they certainly will be affected one way or the other&mdash;prejudicially by this Bill. While I do not represent Dublin City, I wish to point out that the tram runs from Dublin to Dún Laoghaire and to Dalkey, and a rather unusual situation exists there in connection with the roadway between Blackrock and Monkstown.  The liability for the cost of the repair of the entire roadway between Blackrock and Monkstown falls on the Dublin United Transport Company&mdash;now, I am not referring to the pathway but to the roadway alone &mdash;but from Monkstown to Dalkey the liability for the repair of the roadway falls on the transport company only in respect of the portion inside of the tracks and 18 inches on either side.  I understand that the difference there, as between Blackrock and Monkstown, arises out of an old agreement between the company and the district council <Col N="2395" /> in Blackrock, but in the Bill provision is made for agreement or arbitration, in connection with the payment of wayleaves between the Corporation of Dublin and the Corporation of Dún Laoghaire.  Sub-section (3) of Section 50 says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The company shall pay compensation to each road authority, in respect of the cesser effected by this section of the wayleaves which were immediately before the establishment date payable by the dissolved transport company to that road authority, and the amount of the compensation shall, in default of agreement, be determined by an arbitrator appointed by the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, in one of the few speeches which Fianna Fáil Deputies made on this Bill, one of them mentioned the fact that any matters which were in dispute could be submitted to arbitration, and of course, in the usual way in which Fianna Fáil Deputies wish Godspeed to the undertakings brought in by the present Government, he said that that is a satisfactory method, or that it ought to be.  It is certainly a satisfactory method, but not when the arbitrator is appointed by the Minister. There is nothing to prevent the Minister putting someone on this, to arbitrate between the new company and the rights of the citizens of Dublin and Dún Laoghaire, who will grant compensation rather in favour of the company than in favour of the citizens.</P>

      <P>Oh, yes, I see. However, the Minister may appoint a fair arbitrator, but I think it would be far better if he were to put the power of appointing an arbitrator into the hands of the Chief Justice.  I suppose it would have been too much to expect the Minister, as a representative of <Col N="2396" /> Dublin, to say that, in putting that in, he was safeguarding the rights of its citizens, but under the situation which this Bill will bring about the Minister may appoint the arbitrator, and I think that nobody&mdash;not even the Minister himself&mdash;will disagree with me when I say that the Minister's sentiments and affections are strongly in favour of the new transport company. So that, in that respect, I fear that his desire to serve the interests of South City and the rest of Dublin might come into conflict with that affection, with resultant detriment to the constituency.</P>
      <P>Now, Sir, I do not want to detain the House much longer, except to say this. I do not propose to dilate at length on the fact that the Bill is being introduced with a certain amount of speed. The Minister has had a far longer time to consider the provisions of the Bill than Deputies have had.  I am satisfied with the time that has been given to me, particularly as I took the precaution of talking towards the close of the debate, but could the Minister say that the enactment of this legislation will alleviate in any way the present situation or contribute to a more efficient transport system than that which is at present in operation? I am quite confident that he cannot, but, if he can say that it will improve the present position, then, despite the objections I have to these powers, I would almost be inclined to vote for the Bill as it stands.  I do not know whether or not the Minister has abandoned the idea of having the Bill become law by the 1st July.  Of course, I can quite realise that if it is not law by the 1st July, the next most suitable period would be 1st January, but, coupled with the Budget, and with the Drainage Bill, which is being shelved, I think that a certain amount of time would require to be given between now and the Committee Stage for consideration of the Bill.  Whether or not, after that, sufficient time will be left to enable the Bill to become law before 1st July is a matter which it is too soon to foresee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with the amendment in the name of Deputy O'Higgins, I <Col N="2397" /> must say that this is one of the rare occasions in which I find myself in agreement with the Taoiseach in holding that it would be more desirable to keep the findings of the committee separate from this legislation, and that then, if necessary, appropriate action may be taken.  Of course, however, the Taoiseach, in his best Machiavellian style, only stated half the case.  He said that on the one hand and, on the other hand, he said: &ldquo;You must leave the emergency and this Bill entirely apart.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We cannot leave the emergency and this Bill entirely apart.  The Great Southern Railways Company never made a profit until the emergency, and the profit it has made is the result of the exorbitant charges which it is allowed to make and which, I may as well add, numerous public concerns are willing to pay because of the fact that such concerns are allowed to make large profits, practically unmolested by the corporation profits tax.  There is hardly an industrial concern of any magnitude in this country which has not, since the emergency, made considerable profits.  Those profits, in one way or another, have contributed to the rise in the cost of essential commodities. Leaving that aside, the reason that the railway company has been able to get away with these exorbitant charges is that no alternative form of transport is available to the people at the present time.  You cannot consider this Bill entirely divorced from emergency conditions and, at the same time, conduct a discussion on it which must, in more than one detail, be affected by the conditions which have arisen.  The reason I believe that the financial provisions of this Bill should extend to a £20,000,000 guarantee, if necessary, with a 3 per cent. rather than a 6 per cent. dividend, is because up to last year the company earned less than would be required to pay a dividend, to discharge liabilities for defective stock, etc., and to repay the redemption on the debenture stock.  The Minister glows with a certain amount of pride at the success which has attended the company, but that arose only last year and then only because of the fact that no other means of <Col N="2398" /> transport was available.  Because the country is affected by the shortage of petrol and other essential commodities the company was able to make a profit. As far as I can see from the answer to the question put down by Deputy McGilligan on this matter, the company would need to make a profit in excess of £1,000,000 a year in order to work satisfactorily.  Last year was the first year that the company made anything over £800,000.  Up to that the average was £600,000, or perhaps more in the region of £500,000.  There is no doubt that under the conditions which have existed since the emergency and particularly since the appointment of the chairman, the company has done well.</P>
    <P>I must say I object to the new departure which this Bill makes.  The Minister instanced three boards which might be compared to the board which it is now proposed to set up&mdash;the Electricity Supply Board, the Turf Development Board and the Irish Tourist Association.  So far as the Electricity Supply Board is concerned, despite the malicious criticism which was levelled against it in its earlier days&mdash; criticism actuated, I suppose, by political rather than by patriotic motives &mdash;the Electricity Supply Board has discharged its functions well.  One Deputy made the suggestion that we had no guarantee that if it were put under a different kind of management it might not have done better.  Negative arguments like that do not get us anywhere. If we brought over some of these fly-by-nights from Europe of whom Fianna Fáil in its early days were so fond, it might have been better managed, but we have no guarantee of that.  It has been one of the most successful undertakings which the State has established since its inception. So far as the other two boards are concerned, I think that the Turf Development Board is a gigantic failure.  Seeing that turf costs £5 per ton to land in Dublin; whether it is produced by the Turf Development Board or otherwise, and that a subsidy of almost £1,000,000 has to be paid in order to bring it within the reach of the consumer, it is certainly not a success. The Irish Tourist Association, in the circumstances in which it is functioning <Col N="2399" /> during the war, as far as I can see is more or less a haven for a few political friends who had to be compensated for services rendered.  The only comparable example to the board which it is proposed to set up under this Bill is the Electricity Supply Board on the one hand, or the Department of Posts and Telegraphs on the other.  I regard public transport more or less in the same category as both of those bodies despite whatever we may say about competition being healthy.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that the two bodies are more or less similar but, if they are, why is it that under this Bill we have not the same provisions, the same kind of board, the same kind of management as the Electricity Supply Board, which has given good service and which has not been affected to any appreciable extent by political or labour interests?  I desire to say, in conclusion, that if the Minister will accept amendments or if he himself will introduce amendments to meet what we consider defects in the Bill on the Committee Stage, I shall certainly vote for the Bill; but unless he does that I shall be constrained to vote against it on this stage.</P>

      <P>On the entry of Clann na Talmhan to this House, I think we made our position very clear.  We said then that we would support any Bill introduced by the Government that we thought would promote the welfare of the country in general, and that we would oppose any Bill about which we had a different opinion.  As far as the present Bill is concerned, whilst we agree that transport requires to be reorganised, after giving the matter full consideration, we are reluctantly compelled to oppose it on the following grounds.  We feel that we would not be voicing the opinion of our constituents if we supported a measure which, in effect, means that the Government intends to give a free cheque to the extent of £16,000,000 to this company without giving the House any details as to how it is to be applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hold that it is the duty of the Government who are introducing this Bill and who are asking the Dáil to vote this huge amount to give particulars <Col N="2400" /> as to how the money will be spent and to give a detailed account of the prospects which the undertaking has of success.  The people whom we represent resent any form of dictatorship and we feel that the present measure is leading to dictatorship.  It proposes to place in the hands of one individual complete control of this new company.  We have got no information as to how the money will be spent, save that £9,000,000 will go to the purchase of obsolete stock.  A great many local authorities are interested in the reactions of this Bill. The people of the county I represent &mdash;Roscommon&mdash;are somewhat perturbed as to the position.  They would like to have some information as to the lines on which the new transport board will develop. Will it lean towards road or rail transport and to what extent will it deal with sea and air transport?  The big question so far as local authorities in rural Ireland are concerned is as to the liability for road upkeep.  If the chairman of the new company gets road-minded and insists upon putting heavy transport on the roads, who will be responsible for the upkeep of those roads?  For some years, due to the manner in which those roads have been made, the rural population find it very hard to travel on them.  They are definitely a danger to man and beast.  Speaking for my own county, I can point to sworn testimony given in the recent past as to the dangerous condition of the roads.  A great number of the rural population, living a long distance from a church, including old people, are not able to get to Mass or to other church service because they are not able to bring out their horse-drawn vehicles.</P>

      <P>I am just pointing out that the chairman of the board will, according to the terms of the Bill, be entitled to turn to road services and that it is due to the people, including the people I represent, that they should have some information as to what extent the making of those roads will be subsidised or if the new board intend to build roads entirely for <Col N="2401" /> themselves and leave the local authorities to maintain their own roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no money in this Bill for the making of roads.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephMeighan" hpid="Mr. Meighan Mr. Meighan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meighan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the trouble about it.  If the chairman of the new board utilises the roads built and maintained by the ratepayers, I am afraid they will resent it.  The Minister made a statement to the effect&mdash; I have not his exact words&mdash;that the new Bill would tend to bring trade to Dublin.  Are we to take it from that statement that it is the policy of the Minister to utilise the new transport system to transport the wealth of the country to the city, while no less a person than the Taoiseach gave us to understand some years ago that the policy of the Government was one of decentralisation?  If the policy of the Minister and the Government be to utilise the transport service to take the trade of the country up to the city, the people of the provinces will not be very pleased.  The Government should consider the weighty words of the Minister for Finance in reference to this Bill in his Budget speech.  While the transport services need recorganisation, even some members of the Government Party realise the serious financial problems which that will involve.  For that reason, this Bill should not be rushed through but consideration should be given to every detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even at this stage, I think that the Government would be well advised to reconsider the whole position.  Personally, I agree with the suggestion by Deputy Dillon that a board should be set up on similar lines to those of the Electricity Supply Board, which has proved satisfactory, financially and otherwise.  The Government should take a headline from that undertaking and introduce a Bill on somewhat similar lines.  The Taoiseach said to-day that it was his policy, and I presume the policy of the Government, to seek agreement with the companies concerned, instead of bringing in a Bill to sweep away everything from them without consideration. There was a good deal of sense in that but I suggest that the Taoiseach and the Government should carry that <Col N="2402" /> feeling a bit farther.  If it was so desirable to seek agreement from the two companies concerned, I suggest that it would be much more desirable to seek agreement amongst all Parties in this House.  I never listened to a debate in this House which tended so much to show that general agreement could be got in respect of this problem if the matter had been approached in a different way.</P>
    <P>If at this moment the head of the Government and the Minister concerned with this Bill would take into their confidence members of all Parties in the House, I have no hesitation in saying that they would be able to introduce a draft Bill in a short time that would have the unanimous approval of the House.  In present circumstances I think it would be most desirable, for the sake of the House and for the sake of the country, and it would be an outstanding achievement, to introduce a Bill that would receive national agreement and that could be regarded as a National Transport Bill, instead of the Bill that is now presented, which can only be a Party Bill at best, forced on practically the majority of the House.  In conclusion, I would appeal to the Minister and the Government not to throw away this opportunity and not to destroy that national unity which is theirs for the taking if they go the right way about it.</P>

      <P>Níl ach cúpla rudaí le rádh agam ar an mBille seo.  Some months ago I was in Mullingar.  I saw 12 to 16 goods trains on the lines there. There were 50 wagons in some of the trains, and more or less in others.  I asked myself what would be the position in regard to transport in this country if the railways were allowed to decline, and if we had not the railways at the commencement of the emergency.  I was forced to the conclusion that railways are an essential service in this country.  I understood why, in other countries, great and small, they have a Minister in control of railways.  In their wisdom they learned years ago what we are learning now, that railways are the arteries of national economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to congratulate Deputy <Col N="2403" /> Cosgrave as being the one Deputy in the Opposition who approached this measure in the spirit referred to by Deputy Meighan, giving constructive ideas.  He is the only Deputy I heard who did not denounce this Bill, bell, book and candle.  He saw something in it, and came forward with constructive ideas.  We all remember, not so many years ago, the competition on the roads, when privately owned buses were racing one another, seeking passengers, constituting a danger to travellers.  The conductors and drivers were underpaid, and worked long hours under all kinds of conditions.  The same applied to the carriage of goods by lorries.  When I represented Longford-Westmeath, I saw streets in my constituency lined by these lorries, and the owners were not paying 3d. in rates for a shed to garage them.  The railways, in competition with these lorries, had to pay heavy rates all the time, and trade union wages.  My mind has been made up on this subject for years, and I have advocated inside and outside the Party that something should be done to end that competition.  I see in this Bill something constructive to place railway transport and all transport in its proper place in the national economy.  Deputies will bear out the fact that there were stationmasters in charge of marshalling yards seeking traffic for the railways at any price. That certainly was a scandal, and anything that would end that sort of thing would be desirable.  I hope that, as a result of this Bill, the competition for traffic from Mullingar to Dublin, between the railway, the canal and the bus, will be brought to an end.  It is a complete waste of fuel, and is false economy.  I hope this Bill will put an end to it.</P>
    <P>We had the scandal that, under a previous Bill, the Great Southern Railways Company took over certain private hauliers and bus owners, and these men, who neither paid proper wages nor considered their employees, immediately they received compensation, drove a coach and four through the Act, and set up again in competition with the railways.  I do not refer to the present position, but even now they are doing funny things.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2404" /> It was clearly indicated by the sponsors of the Bill that privately-owned lorries will not be interfered with.  I do not want to see another loophole in a Bill by which private enterprise could secure a foothold to smash essential public services. Deputy Connolly referred to the position that would arise when this war ends, and suggested that there will only be an interval until the next war breaks out.  Deputy Cosgrave contended, if I understood him aright, that railways were becoming obsolete. Where would we be now if the hundreds of wagons that I saw lying at Mullingar were not available for the transport of live stock, grain, timber, turf and other merchandise, in view of the fact that the loading capacity of the wagon is equal to that of three lorries?</P>
    <P>If railway wagons and the permanent-way were done away with what would be the position here now?  Where would we be if we were dependent on motor transport?  Some Deputy referred to the farmers' views on this question. I have the greatest respect for the farming community, but if farmers were left without labour, and without services like railways, the fields would remain untilled, cows would not be milked, live stock would not be attended to.  Wealth and abundance would then be of no avail.  Each and every one of us has to realise that no matter what our occupation the services of all dovetail and that labour, professional people and craftsmen are all necessary in the economy of the country.  The farming community would not be able to carry on for a year without public transport services.</P>
    <P>The Road Fund is financed by contributions which originate in licences paid by lorries and motor cars.  Such contributions are essential in normal times for the financing of road works.  The amount so contributed for the maintenance of trunk roads has frequently been stated and has appeared on the records.  It is fallacious to suggest that railways do not pay a contribution towards the upkeep of the roads.  The sooner it is realised that they do the better it will be when discussing the Bill.  One Deputy stated <Col N="2405" /> that £9,000,000 was to be given for obsolete stock.  I see nothing in the Bill or in the Explanatory Note about any such amount.  I saw that some stock is to be transferred from the Great Southern Railways Company to the new company, but there is nothing in the Bill about throwing away £9,000,000 in obsolete stock.  Is it contended that the Dublin Transport Company is obsolete?  Is it contended that the bridges and the railway stations are obsolete?  In introducing the Bill the Minister pointed to lack of economy in the running of the railways, because of want of uniformity in rolling stock and locomotives.  It could not be argued that everything on the railways, which is to be handed to the new company, is obsolete.  In 1933 a section of the railway from Dublin to Galway was taken up and other branch lines were closed.  If there had been proper development of railway transport all these branches should have been reopened. It is proper that this Bill was introduced and this is the time for its consideration.</P>
    <P>I desire to draw the Minister's attention to Sections 36, 44 and 45 dealing with the compensation of officials.  I want to see that the rights of every man are safeguarded under this Bill and that the old employees, engine-drivers or station-masters at small wayside stations, are if possible retained by the new company.  There is a great tendency in amalgamations, whether of insurance companies or other concerns, to dispense with the services of old hands, irrespective of their service or ability.  As there is a belief that a new broom sweeps clean, when new administrators get power they are not satisfied until all those formerly associated with old companies are swept aside.  I want to see that the rights of these people are safeguarded.  Apart altogether from their national contribution during the present emergency, we should bear in mind that railwaymen made a great contribution to the national cause in the past, and played a very important part in the fight for Irish independence.  For that reason I would not like to see any of the railwaymen or their families suffering as a result of the operation of this Bill. <Col N="2406" /> As far as I am aware, their rights are safeguarded, but I would be false to those I represent if I did not point out that they want to be assured that that is so.  I am wholeheartedly in support of this Bill which is a step in the right direction.</P>

      <P>I heartily congratulate the Minister on introducing this Bill which is welcome and long overdue. It is going to give this country efficient rail and road services that were not previously available.  I want to refer to the question of redundancy. If the Minister could express his views on that question he would be conferring a favour on railwaymen.  There has been a lot of talk about postponing consideration of the Bill.  I think it is absolutely necessary that it be passed as soon as possible.  We have heard a lot of members on the Fine Gael Benches condemn the Bill.  I remember that in 1926, 1927, 1928 and 1929 there were 2,000 railwaymen and shopmen working only three days a week on the Great Southern Railways.  We had very few members of the Labour Party protesting against these workmen being on short time.</P>

      <P>A good deal of discussion has centred around the proposal to adjourn the Second Reading of this <Col N="2407" /> Bill.  My colleagues and I are in favour of that course being adopted.  During the course of a speech which he made this evening, Deputy Fitzgerald said that for a considerable time the country was asking that something should be done for the railways, which he said were the life stream of the country. With that statement we all agree. Later in his speech, he said that the Minister's statement, in moving the Second Reading of the Bill, was very informative.  My submission to the Dáil is that the Minister was anything but informative in so far as the future of the railways is concerned.  He certainly dealt at length with a number of blunders that had been made in the past, even since the legislation which he himself initiated in 1932 and 1933 was enacted by the House.  I well remember the optimism displayed by the Minister when introducing the Transport Bills of 1932 and 1933.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as this Bill is concerned, what I object to is that it does not indicate in any way what it is proposed to do with the railways with a view to bringing about an efficient transport system all over the country. This is a Bill of 58 pages, containing 117 sections and 10 schedules.  If you read it from end to end you will find nothing in it but this fact, that the railway and transport system of the country is to be handed over to one man who is to be an absolute dictator. Nobody in this House, or outside of it. dare say a word so far as his administration is concerned, notwithstanding the fact that the Dáil and the people through the Dáil are to be made responsible for finding a certain amount of money in the event of the undertakings over which this man is to preside not being successful.  I think it will be admitted by everybody that the treatment proposed for the directors and shareholders is on a very extravagant scale.  I wonder what would the position have been if a Bill of this kind had been introduced immediately after the pessimistic speech which was made by Mr. Reynolds in March, 1943. I think it is correct to say that at that time the shares of the Great Southern <Col N="2408" /> Railway could have been purchased for £3,500,000, or £4,000,000 less than the price that has now been agreed upon for the first time.  It is proposed that the railway directors should be compensated. Their compensation is on a very generous scale when compared to the treatment meted out to the ordinary railway worker.  It will be admitted, I think, that the scale is weighted in favour of the directors.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan, speaking of his experience of certain legislation which he had put through this House when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce, said that it took seven years to find out whether a man was redundant or not.  Under this Bill, unless it is obvious within six months that a man is redundant, no compensation will be paid to him by the company.  I suggest that in the case of a big undertaking of this kind when certain proposals are, perhaps, being formulated in the mind of this dictator, it will not be possible to find out within six months whether a man is redundant or not.  On the other hand, it may be obvious to the officials and to everybody concerned that a man will become redundant inside the six months, but, knowing that if they keep him for one, two, or three weeks after the six months have elapsed he will not have to be paid compensation, one can see that man being kept on after the six months' period in order to relieve the company of their liability to pay him compensation.</P>
    <P>In view of the Minister's statement that it is not proposed to put this legislation into operation until the post-war period is reached, I cannot see why this Bill should be rushed through the House between this date and the 1st July.  I think it is most unfair of the Minister to ask the Dáil to do that within such a short period, especially when we know that a tribunal, set up by the Minister, is investigating some very serious allegations against people who may be concerned in this undertaking when this legislation is passed. I think it is most improper that the Dáil should be called upon to discuss a measure of this importance at this particular time.</P>

I think that is recognised in every part of the country, if it is not recognised in the ranks of the Government and their supporters. I hope that even yet the Minister and the Government will agree to postpone the Second Reading of this Bill so that we may be able to face the situation fairly.  I suggest that in the present atmosphere, with this tribunal sitting, it is not possible to discuss this in a proper manner.  One of the people concerned may be the dictator of this company.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think anybody can deny that the position in which this man is to be placed will make him a dictator in every sense of the word. The House has not been told what his plans are.  The Minister may know what his plans are, but in this voluminous Bill of 117 sections there is nothing to indicate what the Government or the company, under this dictatorship, propose to do as regards the future of transport in this country.  In his Second Reading speech, the Minister referred to the blunders which had occurred, but if these blunders <Col N="2410" /> occur again the taxpayers will have the privilege of paying for them.  The Minister will have power to appoint the dictator and, no matter what happens then in railway matters, the House will have no opportunity to criticise any point, good, bad or indifferent. That is a disgraceful state of affairs. If this Bill gets a Second Reading, I hope that the Committee Stage will be adjourned until we hear the findings of the tribunal which is now sitting, as those findings are bound to have repercussions on the future of transport generally.</P>
      <P>I hope that the clauses dealing with railway workers will be altered, so that those workers will be treated at least as generously as the shareholders and directors.  Railway shares have risen considerably in recent months and that rise has been taken into consideration in fixing the compensation to shareholders.  Nothing similar has been done in the case of the ordinary worker.  This country owes a good deal to the railway servants.  We all remember that, when the country was in the throes of a revolution during the Black and Tan period, the railwaymen refused to carry the British military and ran great risks from day to day. It is very poor compensation to them now to find that, unless it is obvious that they become redundant inside six months, they will receive no compensation. As far as we know some of the people responsible for railway administration in this country, we can see that some of these men may be kept about a week over the six months, in order to avoid the payment of the compensation which the Minister obviously suggests they should get.  I hope the Minister will alter the sections dealing with that point, so as to enable these people to be certain that they will be treated properly and as a grateful country should treat them.</P>

      <P>This has been a remarkably long debate and I am sure it will not do a bit of harm.  To-day was the first day that I noticed many Deputies beginning to learn something about this important measure. Deputy Cosgrave succeeded better than most other Deputies of his Party, in bringing home to the House the importance <Col N="2411" /> of these proposals.  He quoted the Minister as having said, in his opening statement, that the railway is the backbone of the transport system.  Everybody will agree with the Minister on that point&mdash;even further, that the transport system in general is the backbone of the whole nation.  That being so, it is not surprising to see a sectional group like the Labour Party with false ideas as to why this Bill should be postponed, whilst hoping at the same time that it would not be postponed.</P>
      <P>There is practically no comparison between the amount of men that the transport system employs and the amount of other workers that it could affect.  We have not had a suitable transport system yet, and it is quite possible that this measure will not succeed in providing one.  The system we dream of would make an enormous difference to our people, and to no section would it be so important as to the farmers.  If Clann na Talmhan represents the farmers, they must represent a very limited portion of them, when they object to something which will improve the condition of the farmers.  On examining the question deeply, I believe that it is the transport system here that has caused the very considerable depression amongst the farming community and has increased the cost of living in the cities and towns.</P>
      <P>This is one of the most important measures that has come before the House.  The previous Government recognised the need for action when the income of the railways began to collapse in 1924.  I think Deputy Corish and Deputy Norton contended that there was no unemployment in 1924. There must have been, because the income was falling.  The late Government would not have introduced the 1924 Act if the railway income were not falling.</P>

      <P>I am connecting unemployment with income and profits, as those factors regulate employment. There must have been unemployment, or signs of it.  That effort in 1924 to revive the railway system was not a success.  It was badly thought out and badly planned.  Another effort was made in 1927 and it brought about a complete collapse in the income of the railways.  It left the railway assets so low that the company was not able to replace rolling stock.  Then a measure was introduced to curb, to some extent, the activities of motor transport.  The whole difficulty was that what the motor transport could do was not visualised.  As a result, up to 1933 or 1934, there was complete chaos, until the Act to regulate motor transport was passed.  It was no doubt advantageous to the farmers and the people in the city for the moment.  There were very cheap rates and extensive competition but there was no guarantee at all that the railway would be able to maintain itself.  Then we came to the point of the emergency when the war started. Some people held that it was the emergency with its higher prices and freights that revived the railway system and brought back some of the income.  I do not think that is quite true.  I believe it was a fresh mind, an energetic and intelligent mind that succeeded in reviving to some extent the railway company.  The Labour Party are very much misinformed. If this semi-dictator or complete dictator as they call him had not made his appearance some years ago how many people would be employed on the railway system?  Are not the people employed in that system dependent on the brilliance or otherwise of the management?  If the management does not succeed these people are going to lose their employment. Consequently a merger like this is, I hold, going to do a lot of good by giving the public confidence in the railway <Col N="2413" /> system.  I do not believe that the railways ever had popular confidence. Everyone of us knows what the attitude was to the railways previous to the last war.  There was, of course, keen competition.  I think you had 24 different railway companies operating here.  That was advantageous to the community for a certain time and then the amalgamation started.  The railway companies were never what one would call popular and certainly the management was not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the object in the mind of some of the members of this House is to try to continue to make the railway company unpopular.  It would appear that there is a want of confidence when the Government has to guarantee the moneys invested in the company.  If we succeed through this merger in getting an efficient transport system I think the workers will have to thank the Minister.  There is nothing at all to be said for the demand for postponing the Bill.  Everyone knew months ago that these arrangements were being made. A very important transport company in the city here agreed to amalgamate. Their position is very uncertain and it is not easy for that company to carry on knowing the position is as it is. Consequently, the sooner the merger operates and determines what the future of that company is going to be the better.  The fact that the tribunal is sitting at the present time does not come into the matter at all, to my mind.  That is only a sort of political twist.  There is no Deputy that does not know that that has nothing whatsoever to do with the merger.  When the tribunal comes to its findings that has nothing to do with the merger and nothing to do with us.  Somebody else will come to conclusions about that. We may, of course, direct that action be taken but that is a different matter entirely.  All this propaganda is to a very large extent insincere.  If we agree that transport is the backbone of our nation we should make some effort to bring back the people's confidence instead of trying to destroy it, for that is what they are trying to do.  If the system had the confidence of the public there would be no necessity to come to the Minister and ask for a guarantee, <Col N="2414" /> but for the last 11 days some members of the House have been doing their utmost to undermine the confidence of the people in this system which is vital to all of us.  If we do not succeed in establishing a suitable sound transport system the country will collapse.  There is no doubt about it.  If we have not a good transport system it must collapse. What we have to do is to get public confidence in the system.  We cannot do that by talking a lot of nonsense here because the public do not know that it is nonsense. The last thing I have to say on this question is with regard to the railway employees who become redundant. I am quite sure that the Minister will not forget these people and will see that they get a fair crack of the whip. I have had some experience of the last Government's operations and I must say that most of the people concerned in that way, many of whom are now dead, were left in a pitiable condition, but I am sure the Minister and the Government will see that these people get a fair crack of the whip now.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Reilly invariably makes a valuable contribution to the debates in this House, but I regret that he has departed from his usual course this evening.  The Deputy indicated to us what he considered to be the history of railway development for the last 20 years.  He told us there was an amalgamation in 1924 and something else in 1927, I think it was the cutting down of the capital.  He told us that notwithstanding all that the position of the railways has deteriorated and his sole contribution to the confidence of the Irish people in the railways was that we must dispense with an effective directorate and appoint a one-man dictator. That is how he asked the Irish people to have confidence in the scheme that is being introduced now. That was his sole contribution&mdash;that notwithstanding the fact that we tinkered with the railways in 1924 and in 1927&mdash;my dates may be wrong&mdash;the railways were deteriorating and we were so devoid of reasoning power and ability that you must take one man, jerk him up from the crowd and throw him into the position and say: &ldquo;Run <Col N="2415" /> the railways for us.&rdquo;  That is a very poor compliment to the business ability of our people.  If this were a normal measure, such as one dealing with national health insurance, workmen's compensation, or the development of agricultural produce, a motion such as we have before us from the Leader of the principal Opposition Party would deserve very serious consideration, and we should examine the reasons why we should postpone this measure.  But this is not a normal measure or an ordinary measure.  It is a measure far beyond the limits of anything that was introduced into this House for years.  None of us will deny that the Minister is right to take serious cognisance of the position of transport for the past ten years.  The Minister has a duty to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that transport required co-ordination and direction, but in an extraordinary and abnormal measure of this kind we are entitled to ask why we are being asked to consider it in the very limited time that is given to us.  The Taoiseach, of course, trained in the art of argument as he is, endeavoured to put the onus on the Opposition of saying why it should not be considered in that time, but I listened in vain to speakers on the opposite side for an argument why it should be considered in the short space that they have given us.  I endeavoured to extract from the Minister's statement a reason as to why this huge document should be flung at us and why should we be asked to consider it with all its implications for individuals, agriculture, industry and the whole country within nine or ten days.  Surely the Minister does not think that it is reasonable to expect the Dáil to do that.  If the Minister has so little faith in the intelligence of the business people of this country in regard to the railway transactions, why has he such an enormous opinion of the intelligence of the Deputies of this Dáil that he expects that they should thoroughly understand all the implications of this measure in nine or ten days?  He says the directors of the railways cannot understand all that is in it, and we must get a superman and <Col N="2416" /> put him in charge.  Yet he expects us to take all this letterpress and understand what it means and realise where it is leading us.</P>
    <P>Let us look for a few moments at some of the abnormal things in this measure that it takes out of the course of ordinary legislation.  First of all, we are guaranteeing £16,000,000.  It is quite possible that some of the people who may be called upon to pay some of that £16,000,000 may never see the railway line.  We have some experience in the constituency I represent of what paying for the failure of railway traffic means.  I know people who paid for deficits in the management and running of railway lines, and they never saw the railway lines.  That has happened for years.  We have here flung at us, to consider its implications in nine or ten days, a measure in which the taxpayers are called upon to give a guarantee to the tune of £16,000,000.  Perhaps it may not be £16,000,000 that will have to be paid; perhaps it will be only £1,000,000, but even £1,000,000 represents a heavy burden.</P>
    <P>We were told there was a heavy burden to be put on the taxpayers when the Children's Allowances Bill was brought forward, but here we are guaranteeing £16,000,000 in order to run the transport of the country.  And the control of that £16,000,000 is not in this House.  The administration of the £2,500,000&mdash;or whatever amount is given towards children's allowances &mdash;is controlled by this House, but the control of the £16,000,000 which we are to guarantee does not reside in the House.  The control of that amount, everything connected with the administration of it, is outside this House and will be reposed in one individual.  That is one abnormal thing in respect of the guarantee under this measure.  It is one thing that should make us consider very seriously the amendment proposed by Deputy O'Higgins, the leader of the main Opposition Party.</P>
    <P>There are other matters that demand consideration.  There is the power to make people redundant.  We know what happened in respect of other amalgamation schemes and the unfair treatment meted out to workers in <Col N="2417" /> respect of alleged redundancy.  Many railway workers have bitter experiences of that.  What do we find in this measure?  Let us imagine a branch line that employs 100 workers.  What is to prevent this managing director, this dictator, from closing that branch line down for six months?</P>

      <P>We can leave the branch lines alone for the moment.  There are other methods by which workers can be rendered redundant and kept on for a day after six months.  Let me read the section, because it is very important:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Every person who was, on the 1<i>st day of January</i>, 1944, and is, immediately before the establishment date, <Col N="2418" /> an officer or servant of any dissolved company shall, if his office or situation is abolished before the <i>1st day of January,</i> 1945,...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suggest every Deputy ought to note the following words very carefully:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...directly and solely as the result of the amalgamation effected by this Part of that dissolved company and the other dissolved company and not caused by decrease of traffic, reduction of renewal or maintenance work, alteration of methods of working, closing of railway lines or other economic cause...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>How does the Minister imagine a railway porter, a railway guard or a checker or anybody in any of these positions will be able to prove that it is not due to causes such as are enumerated here?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I opposed it then and I oppose this.  I suggest it is absolutely impossible for a porter, a fireman, or any of the various employees of a railway to prove that, by graphs, diagrams or statistics or any figures which the Minister and the manager may have. How is a worker to prove that it is not due to traffic or to something else and is directly due to the amalgamation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

These are two of the things that make this measure an abnormal one and that would justify us in giving very serious consideration to the amendment put forward by Deputy O'Higgins.  I refer to the guarantee of £16,000,000 and the ability to throw out of employment, without any compensation or any apologia, scores or perhaps thousands of men.  Now we come to the supermen.

      <P>I was forcibly reminded of the seven pillars of wisdom when I saw that there were to be seven men. We are to have six railway directors who will have no power whatever.  We will have another man who will have all the power.  They are to be the seven pillars of wisdom in the railway business of this country.  Six men are to be put in by the shareholders, to do what?  To listen to what the railway dictator has to say.  What are his powers?  It is just as well that we should indicate them clearly, as is done <Col N="2420" /> in the measure: &ldquo;The chairman shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of the board.&rdquo;  I wonder what does that mean?  The chairman can do anything he likes at a meeting of the board.  The Minister shakes his head.  To my mind, a quorum is that number legally qualified to carry on a meeting and reach decisions.  If I know anything, it is a quorum of a company or of a council, or anything else.  For instance, 20 Deputies are entitled to carry on the business here.</P>

Supposing a meeting has been properly summoned and nobody turns up but the chairman, what is to prevent him from doing what he likes then?  He constitutes a quorum.  He can do what he likes.  What is the good of having these six men then?  He is a quorum.  He has not to adjourn the meeting and say: &ldquo;I will have to summon them again.&rdquo;  He carries on alone.  He says: &ldquo;I will dismiss 400 of these men,&rdquo; and there is nobody to say anything else.  He says: &ldquo;I will reduce wages&rdquo; and there is nobody to say <Col N="2421" /> anything against him.

He can do everything himself. There is another section which says: &ldquo;No decision shall be arrived at by the board at any meeting without the concurrence of the chairman.&rdquo;  First of all, he can hold a meeting himself. Secondly, the six other people cannot hold a meeting without him.  Thirdly, they cannot reach a decision unless he concurs.  I wonder, therefore, what is the status of that individual.</P>

He has given us 10 days to consider a measure with these three vital and abnormal conditions which I have pointed out: a guarantee of £16,000,000; power to render men redundant and give no compensation; a dictator who can hold a meeting himself and prevent the other six people from holding a meeting, and who can nullify any decision they reach unless he concurs in it.  I do not think there is any argument to justify the Minister coming before the Dáil and asking us to do that after the 20 years of railway history Deputy O'Reilly gave us.  He said that we tinkered with the matter in 1924 and 1927.  Now he wants the people to have confidence, to guarantee that the railway company <Col N="2422" /> will be in an economic position to the tune of £16,000,000 of the taxpayer's money and to have confidence in a man who will be responsible to no one.</P>

      <P>I think it will be agreed that only a few of the speakers who participated in this long debate dealt with the Bill as a scheme for the organisation of the nation's transport services.  A large number of speakers confined their remarks to related <Col N="2424" /> matters and some to irrelevant matters; but only a limited number criticised the provisions of the Bill or proposed alternative provisions for the constitution of an organisation to direct our transport services.  It is true that we had from the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, and from some other speakers of the Party, a declaration in favour of nationalisation of transport.  It is clear that there is not unanimity amongst that Party upon that issue, and probably the Leader of Fine Gael was more concerned with the casting of a line to hook a possible coalition with the Labour Party than with the merits of his proposal as such.</P>
      <P>It is, I think, significant that the readers of the <i>Irish Independent</i> would secure no hint from the reports of Fine Gael speeches in this debate which appeared in that paper or the comments of the paper's political correspondents on the debate, that nationalisation of transport had now become the policy of the Fine Gael Party.  We had, of course, from the Labour Party a reaffirmation of their faith in nationalisation.  They nailed their flag to that staff 20 years ago and, since then, have learned nothing and forgotten nothing.  We had from the spokesman of Clann na Talmhan, Deputy Cafferky, a very vigorous defence of private competitive enterprise, which also rather surprised me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that on an occasion upon which a Bill is brought forward, proposing the establishment of a new organisation to be responsible for the direction, now and in the future, of the transport services, some consideration might have been given to the merits or demerits of the Bill, as Deputies saw them, and more definite efforts made to propose alternative provisions in detail.  Deputies excused themselves on the ground that they were rushed.  I do not know whether any of those who stated that this Bill was being rushed expected themselves to be taken seriously by those who knew the facts.  Twelve months ago Deputy Davin initiated a debate here upon the transport situation.  Does he remember that?  On an amendment introduced by him to the Vote for the Department of Industry and Com- <Col N="2425" /> merce, he initiated that debate in an endeavour to secure from the Government an undertaking that transport legislation would be promoted at an early date.</P>
    <P>He got that undertaking.  He got from me an assurance that the Government recognised the need for new legislation, recognised the need to have that legislation enacted before the end of the war and that the necessary steps towards its completion were being taken.  On the occasion of the general election, a formal undertaking was given on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party that, if returned to power, transport legislation would be introduced. Subsequently, the details of proposals relating to the acquisition of the Great Southern Railways and the Dublin United Transport Company were published.  Deputies cannot pretend that they had not ample notice of the intention to promote transport legislation, and ample opportunity to make up their minds upon the principles of transport policy which they proposed to defend, and it is only with the principles of policy that we are now concerned.  At this stage of the discussion of this measure, we do not deal with details but with questions of policy and principles.  Deputies who did not, before this, consider questions of policy and questions of principle were, I think, negligent in their duty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly was not due to lack of notice.  The Labour Party, as Deputy Davin was about to say, cannot and does not make that defence, because they, knowing that this legislation was forthcoming, established a committee of their Party, a committee which obviously went with great care into all questions of transport policy and prepared a report, a copy of which they were good enough to send to me, which showed every evidence of careful preparation and which recommended a definite line of policy.  Even though I do not agree with that policy, and even though it is obvious that the Labour Party itself does not agree with all the recommendations of its own committee, nevertheless the members of that committee are to be congratulated <Col N="2426" /> on the comprehensive report they produced.  They, therefore, cannot claim that they were rushed, because so far as the members of the Labour Party are concerned, they had not merely ample notice but they had already taken steps to ensure that they would be amply prepared for the introduction of this Bill.</P>
      <P>It is, I think, agreed that it is good policy to enact our permanent transport legislation before the end of the war.  We could, of course, postpone this measure until the war is over.  We could adopt the recommendations of the transport tribunal, to which Deputy Lynch referred, and submit our whole transport situation to a five years' scrutiny.  That course might commend itself to those who can get from Deputy Lynch or somebody else a guarantee that if we did postpone the matter for five years, we would not have missed the tide.  Is there any guarantee of that?  If we left this situation to remain as it is without change, as the transport tribunal report recommended in 1939, before the war, but as Deputy Lynch recommends now, in 1944, after four years of war, for five years, can we be certain that it will be as easy to deal with it, at the end of the five years, as it is now, that the opportunity which we now have of bringing into existence an organisation fully equipped to deal with the possibilities of the post-war period will not have been lost, and lost for ever?</P>
      <P>I confess that I had hoped that the text of this Bill would have been available for circulation to Deputies before Easter.  The fact that it was not so available was due to congestion in the draftsman's office.  It was, however, circulated three weeks ago to-morrow, and, while Deputies last week might have made some case that they had not an opportunity to consider it, I thought it ludicrous to hear Deputies making that statement to-day, three weeks after the circulation of the Bill, and after 30 hours of Parliamentary debate, which probably constitutes a record in the history of the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill has been framed to come into operation on 1st July.  It is, I think, fairly obvious that, unless there is more co-operation from the Dáil than <Col N="2427" /> there is evidence that there is likely to be, the Bill cannot come into operation on that date, and for reasons which I explained in my introductory speech, any postponement must be for a six months' period, from 1st July to 1st January; but there are reasons, and I want to put them to the Dáil, why it is desirable that the enactment of the measure should not be delayed.  Let me make it quite clear that if, having given those reasons, the Dáil still thinks we should not attempt to enact the Bill before 1st July, I do not propose to insist upon it.  There are no reasons why we should insist upon it&mdash; except these.  First of all, considerable publicity has been given to the proposals in the Bill, affecting two important commercial organisations in this country, and it is undesirable that there should be a protracted period of uncertainty as to the future of these organisations.  There is, in the opinion of the Government, therefore, good reason in public policy why a decision on this Bill should be taken early, but there is also a special consideration, which I want to put to the Labour Party, a consideration, the importance of which they can themselves weigh.</P>
    <P>I stated, in introducing this Bill, that it is not related to emergency conditions. That is true.  The passage into law of this Bill will not get rid of any of our emergency transport difficulties. That is true.  It will not result in any expansion in transport services, where the curtailment of these services is due to a shortage of coal, and not to any cause under the control of the Great Southern Railways Company, or which will be under the control of the new company which we propose to establish. But this is also true: That the difficulties which have arisen between the Great Southern Railways Company's management and the trade unions representative of the company's workers are attributable to the fact that the curtailment of these services, as a result of the emergency, is involving that company in a substantial loss of revenue.  The Great Southern Railways Company is losing revenue at the rate of £20,000 per week, and the position <Col N="2428" /> of the company, as I understand it, is that they are prepared to make available the whole of the profit of that company since the beginning of this year until the date of the curtailment of these services in order to keep all their workers in employment, but that a time will come when there will be no funds available to enable them to continue that policy.</P>
    <P>This new organisation will have a stronger financial position than the Great Southern Railways Company. It will have that stronger position by reason, first, of the fact that it will have a much smaller burden of interest charges to meet; secondly, by reason of the fact that it will have a new revenue resulting from the amalgamation of the Dublin United Transport Company with it; and thirdly, as a last resort, by reason of the Government guarantee of debenture interest.  This new company could undertake to carry the railway workers, who are temporarily redundant, much more easily than could the existing Great Southern Railways Company. It is, in my view, therefore, in the interests of the workers of the Great Southern Railways Company that this Bill should not be delayed and that this new transport organisation, with its stronger financial position, should come into operation early.  I believe that it would ultimately redound to the security of employment and to the security of remuneration of the railway workers.  Now, I put that case forward for what Labour Deputies may think it worth.  If they, having considered it, decide that it is not a good case to justify attempting to enact this measure by the 1st July, then I am satisfied.  If, however, they think it is a good case to justify attempting to do so, then, in my view, they would be taking a wise decision.</P>
    <P>We are asked to postpone the Second Reading of this Bill for the reason which is stated in the amendment moved by Deputy O'Higgins, the reason that there is at the present time a judicial tribunal inquiring into certain matters relating to dealings in Great Southern Railways stocks. When this Bill was circulated I had contemplated discussing it, or at any rate I had contemplated initiating discussion <Col N="2429" /> on it, on the 26th April, and I was told by the Government Party Whips that the Opposition Parties thought that that date was too early. I therefore agreed to the postponement of the debate until the following week.  If, then, I were asked to agree to a further postponement as a matter of convenience to the Opposition Parties, that request could have been considered, but where I am asked to agree to a further postponement merely for the reason stated in the amendment moved by Deputy O'Higgins, I shall oppose it, because the amendment carries an implication which the Government will not accept.</P>
    <P>That tribunal was set up by the Government.  It was set up by the Government at the request of Opposition Deputies, but also at its own desire and at the expressed desire of the chairman of the Great Southern Railways Company, so that the truth could be established concerning matters in respect of which allegations had been made.  If that tribunal produces a report which shows that individuals have acted in a manner which calls for action by the Government, such action will be taken.  If, apart altogether from the specific matters upon which the tribunal reports, there is an indication that there are reasons of public policy why operations upon the Stock Exchange should be brought under greater control than they are, then that also can be considered. But let us be quite clear as to what has happened or what is happening. Deputy MacEoin said that we should await the report of that tribunal so that we may know whose capital we are guaranteeing.  Those were his words.  Well, he is not going to get that information from the report of the tribunal that is now sitting. They are not going to do that.  I do not know, but I presume that if he wants that information he can get it from the register of shares in the company.  Deputy Dillon, however, had the idea that we should drop this Bill for the purpose of ensuring that those who purchased shares last year as a speculation would lose on that speculation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Col N="2430" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, it was evident that the Deputy had some such idea in his mind.  I think it is wrong to presume that if we were to drop this Bill now and say that there would be no legislation, there would be that drop in the value of the shares in the company that Deputies seem to assume, because let it be remembered that that company, for a year now, has had the benefit of good financial management, good financial management which was reflected in the accounts of the company last year, and that fact is well known to everyone who holds shares in the company or might be interested in acquiring them.  I do not know when this tribunal is going to report.  Frankly, I confess that when I moved the motion to establish it last November I thought that we would have the report by February or March at the latest.  Whether or not it will report at an early date, I could not say, but I think that in so far as there is nothing in this Bill which is <i>sub judice</i>, and nothing on which the tribunal may report which can affect the merits of the Bill as legislation, the amendment moved by Deputy O'Higgins is completely irrelevant, and I think it is quite obvous that it was just a political manoeuvre and was moved for the purpose of extending and strengthening the whispering campaign that is proceeding amongst the public in relation to this matter, and to support a suggestion that the Government is rushing this Bill through for some ulterior motive, either because they want to facilitate people who have been dealing in railway shares, or to make certain appointments, as has been stated here previously, before that report could be published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this connection I should like to say something that may be a matter of information and of interest to the Dáil. The chairman of the Great Southern Railways Company, Mr. Reynolds, came to me yesterday morning and asked me to drop the Bill.  His reasons are purely personal.  He is not a politician. He has never been a politician, and, therefore, has never been the victim of a &ldquo;smear&rdquo; campaign, as the Americans call it.  Those of us who <Col N="2431" /> have had that experience are not so much inclined to be perturbed, because we know from our experience that when the truth comes out it rebounds, and rebounds with boomerang effect, on those who started the campaign. Now, we are not dropping the Bill.  I am satisfied that it stands as a good measure for the future direction of our transport services, irrespective of the personalities who were responsible for its framing, or who will be subsequently responsible for its operation.  I am asking the Dáil to consider this Bill on its merits as a Bill, and not to allow themselves to be diverted by side issues such as are raised in the amendment moved by Deputy O'Higgins.  It was stated that I did not give enough information to the Dáil concerning the Bill when I was introducing it.  There was circulated with the Bill to Deputies a printed memorandum explanatory of its provisions, and there was also available to them the report of the Transport Tribunal of 1939, which contained a wealth of historical and statistical data, giving a clear picture of the situation with which this Bill was designed to deal, and my opening speech outlined the considerations of policy based on those facts which moved the Government to introduce this measure.</P>
    <P>I assumed that Deputies wished to know what policy the Government had in mind, and what considerations led it to recommend these particular proposals.  There may, however, be need to supplement the information I gave then. Some of the queries put by Deputies were relevant queries, and I am going to answer them.  I spoke for one and three-quarter hours when introducing the Bill, and I did not want to overload my statement with any statistical information which Deputies might be able to procure otherwise.  I think, however, many of the requests for information arose out of a complete misunderstanding of the measure.  If a company is constituted under the Companies Acts, it is not unusual to bring it into existence with an authorised capital considerably in excess of the capital that will in fact be paid up to finance the business of that <Col N="2432" /> company.  That practice of having a higher authorised than subscribed capital is devised usually to enable a company without difficulty to finance an extension of its business or to deal with the much more usual contingency of its original estimate of capital requirements proving unduly low.  The memorandum of association of the company is drawn widely to cover all the activities which the promoters of the company think desirable in connection with the undertaking.  Everybody who is familiar with companies constituted under the Companies Acts knows that that is the usual practice.</P>
    <P>This company is not being constituted under the Companies Acts, but the same procedure is being followed. We are bringing it into being with an authorised capital which will be substantially in excess of the paid-up capital on which it will begin operating. Section 9 of the Bill, about which Deputy Cosgrave addressed some queries to me&mdash;and I think some other Deputy in that Party also queried me in that regard&mdash;is the equivalent of the memorandum of association of a company formed under the Companies Acts.  It sets out the purposes for which the company is brought into being, but it does not necessarily indicate that the company is going to engage in all the activities mentioned. It is not, for instance, going to engage in aviation services.  It could not engage in aviation services unless it was authorised to do so under the provisions of our Air Traffic Acts.  If Deputies will get that picture of a company starting with an authorised capital which represents a sum substantially, as I have said, in excess of its subscribed capital, and with a memorandum of association which indicates all the activities in which it might sometime engage, but which do not represent the immediate intention of the promoters of the company, it will help to get rid of some of the difficulties which seem to beset Deputies in relation to this Bill.</P>
    <P>I have been asked what the additional capital will be used for.  Apparently some Deputies expect me to bring forward specific plans for the construction of new railway lines, new stations and new railway engines, <Col N="2433" /> and attach to each such item the estimated cost of construction to the total of the £6,500,000 which represents the difference between the paid-up capital and the £20,000,000 which is the full limit of the capital liabilities which it can at any time undertake. That is not the intention of the Bill. The comparison made here by Deputy O'Higgins between this Bill and the Electricity Supply Act was completely fallacious.  The Electricity Supply Act was introduced to authorise the construction out of public money of a single construction job in relation to which full plans and detailed estimates could be produced.  Whether the detailed estimates that were in fact produced informed or misled Deputies is a moot matter that we need not debate now, but there can be no comparison between the legislation necessary for such construction work and the type of legislation we are now discussing.  I am asked what experts were consulted.  It is not a matter for technical experts at this stage.  The future of our transport is now a matter for decision upon questions of policy. When the questions of policy are decided, when that policy is being implemented by the creation of an organisation empowered and equipped to carry out our decisions, then it will be for that organisation to get whatever technical experts are necessary as well as to utilise the services of the technical experts whom it has employed in designing new equipment, in determining new methods of working, and in coming to decisions on new buildings or other constructional projects necessary for its work.</P>
    <P>Let me try to get the financial provisions of the Bill clear to the Dáil, because it is quite obvious that they are not clear.  That may be my fault. I should have perhaps dealt more fully with them in my introductory speech or in the explanatory memorandum circulated to Deputies.  Let me begin by saying that all those Deputies who spoke about £20,000,000 of public money or £13,500,000 of public money being paid over to the shareholders of the Great Southern Railways Company or of the Dublin United Transport Company, were completely wide of the <Col N="2434" /> mark.  Not one penny of State money will be paid over to the shareholders. There is no proposal in this Bill to take any sum whatever from the public Exchequer to pay anybody.  The State is undertaking to guarantee the principal and interest of the debentures that are issued by the new company. It is not expected that the State's guarantee will be called upon.  Unless we contemplate a situation in which public transport services of all kinds will disappear, the capital invested in this undertaking cannot be entirely lost.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies spoke as if it were intended that Coras Iompair Eireann should confine its activities to railways. It is a transport undertaking charged with the responsibility of providing any and every kind of inland transport that the business development of this country requires.  It is not anticipated that any circumstances could arise which would involve the State having to make good its guarantee of the principal of the sums secured on the company's debentures.  It is not expected that the State guarantee in respect of interest due to the debenture holdings will have to be implemented. Let me make some reservation in regard to that statement in relation to the war period.  Nobody can foretell what may happen during the war period which may bring about a complete cessation of transport, and consequently a cessation of the company's revenue but, in circumstances approaching anything like normal, the revenue of the company should be more than sufficient to meet the debenture interest, even if we assume that it is not possible to increase the net revenue over and above the average earnings in the years between the enactment of the Railways Act of 1924 and the beginning of the war.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies queried the provisions of the Bill which empower the Minister for Finance to pay out of the Central Fund any money that becomes due in respect of the guarantee of interest on the debentures.  It is quite clear that when this Bill empowers the Minister for Finance to give his guarantee in respect of the interest payable on debentures that payment <Col N="2435" /> must be made if and when the guarantee falls due.</P>
    <P>Therefore the provision in the Bill is that the Minister will pay such interest forthwith out of the Central Fund, but every penny he pays to the company in respect of that guarantee becomes a first charge on the revenue of the company. Every penny of this money must be paid back by the company out of the revenue earned within the year following, and if it should fail to repay the amount advanced by the Minister in the ensuing year, then the money will be voted by the Dáil.  The Dáil will be asked to vote the money at that stage, and at that stage the Dáil can avail of the opportunity to discuss the circumstances which led to the necessity for the Minister for Finance making good his guarantees and decide what measures should be adopted to prevent a repetition of these circumstances or what amendment of the legislation would recommend itself to Deputies.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies appear to have an incomprehensible difficulty in understanding the difference between the proposed guarantee of the interest on the debentures and a subsidy to transport. The purpose of giving a State guarantee in respect of the debentures of this company is to ensure that it will get money for capital purposes at a lower rate of interest than it would otherwise be able to obtain it.  In other words, it is a scheme to cheapen transport, to reduce the charges that transport must bear and, consequently, to enable either reduced rates to operate or better services to be provided.  But it is intended that the transport facilities to be provided will be sold at economic rates, that the rates will be so fixed as to recover for the company the whole of the cost of providing those services, plus the interest which the company is liable to pay.  As I understand a subsidy arrangement, it is one in which transport is sold below cost, sold at less than an economic price, the difference between the actual charges in operation and what would be economic charges being made up by the taxpayer. I am against subsidised transport because I believe that subsidised transport would be inefficient, because <Col N="2436" /> I believe that it would, in the long run, prove costly transport&mdash;costly to the community as a whole&mdash;and because this country cannot afford to have a costly transport service if we are to secure the economic development in the post-war period which we desire or if we are to promote our competitive efficiency in international trade.</P>
    <P>The basis upon which this Bill is founded is that the task of transport reorganisation must, in the first instance, be a matter of financial reorganisation. The whole purpose of this Bill is to rearrange the finances of our transport undertakings so as to reduce the interest charges which our transport services have to bear and to permit that new equipment to be provided which will enable a reduction in operating costs to be effected.  We know that the old company could not provide new equipment because it could not raise any new capital.  It is impossible for the Great Southern Railways to raise capital without Government assistance.  If there is to be Government assistance, as is proposed in this Bill, in relation to the new company, then we can use it to secure that the company will in future get its capital at a lower rate of interest and, consequently, effect a substantial reduction in the overhead charges upon the company's revenue.</P>
    <P>We are trying to do for the transport of the country, as a whole, what has already been done for the Dublin United Transport Company.  Deputy Dillon referred to the Dublin United Transport as an undertaking that had always been profitable.  His memory is very short.  Not more than 10 years ago the position of the Dublin United Transport Company was worse than that of the Great Southern Railways. If, since then, there has been a substantial improvement in the position of the company, it has been due, not to anything done by this House, but to the good management which the company provided for itself.  As a result of that good management, the position of the company has continuously improved. In the year 1935, the Dublin United Transport Company was in a position in which it had to face the redemption of stocks in 1939, for which it had no money and no prospect of <Col N="2437" /> obtaining money.  Since then, by good financial management, there has been made available from the revenue of that company £1,400,000 for redemption of the obligations to which I have referred and for the reorganisation of the undertaking.  The wages paid to the employees of that company&mdash;I refer now to the basic wages and I do not take account of the bonus permitted under an Emergency Powers Order&mdash; were increased since then by no less than 24 per cent.  There has been set aside out of revenue a sum now totalling £80,000 to provide pensions and other benefits for the company's staff.</P>
    <P>All that has been done while maintaining unchanged the rates of charge for passenger transportation.  So far as I have been able to discover, the Dublin United Transport Company is the only urban transport organisation in this part of the world which has not increased its rates since the war began.  We are introducing this Bill in the belief that what good management and good financial organisation have done for the Dublin United Transport Company can be done for the new company which will result from the merger between the Dublin United Transport Company and the Great Southern Railways.  We believe that there is ample scope for a similar reorganisation of the finances of the Great Southern Railways.  We are starting the new company off with a reduction of interest charges amounting, roughly, to £110,000.  By provision of a State guarantee in respect of the company's debentures, we can immediately reduce the amount payable in interest to that extent.  We can provide for this company the additional revenue available from the Dublin United Transport Company, which has paid, in the past, 6 per cent. on its preference shares and 6 per cent. on its ordinary shares, the interest obligation in future being only 4½ per cent.  There will be the further revenue representing the amount now paid by that company in emergency excess profits duty.</P>
    <P>This new company will, therefore, start off in a much stronger financial position than could ever have been attained by the old company.  At question time to-day, Deputy McGilligan <Col N="2438" /> put a question which procured for him a number of figures relating to the past and anticipated revenue of this undertaking.  Deputy Dillon, or some other Deputy on the opposite benches, made reference to that matter.  He interpreted those figures as meaning that the net revenue of Córas Iompair Eireann would have to be increased to double the net revenue of the Great Southern Railways pre-war if it is to meet all the obligations that will fall upon it under this Bill.  That statement is true only on certain assumptions. Firstly, it is true on the assumption that the whole of the authorised capital is utilised.  Secondly, it is true on the assumption that the redemption of the debentures will be postponed until 1960 and that the company will pay into the redemption fund an amount sufficient to redeem in full the substituted debenture stock by 1955. Even on these assumptions, it is possible to do it, because, over and above the revenue which the company had pre-war, it will have this additional saving of interest of £100,000 and it will have the new revenue which will accrue from the Dublin United Transport Company.  It is my conviction, as I know it is the conviction of Mr. Reynolds, that, by proper managerial arrangements and up-to-date working methods, the net revenue can be expanded to provide in full for the meeting of all these charges.</P>
    <P>Let me explain, however, that it is intended that the redemption of the substituted debenture stocks will proceed from the beginning of the company. It is not proposed to leave all these stocks unredeemed until 1955. The Bill authorises the company to establish a redemption fund and to pay into that redemption fund such portion of its surplus revenue every year as it considers desirable.  It is not being required to make any specific payment.  It is being empowered to utilise that redemption fund to buy in its own debentures as they become available, and the intention is that these debentures will be continuously redeemed until 1955.  We provide that they must be redeemed for cash at par by 1960.  At that time, the company should be in the position that it will have only common stock, upon which <Col N="2439" /> no interest charge will be due unless profits are earned, and whatever new debentures are created in the meantime. These new debentures cannot be created without the approval of the Minister for Finance.  They will be created with his approval when it is clear that the new capital will be utilised either to effect reductions in operating costs which will improve the net revenue of the company, or to provide additional facilities required by the company or in any other manner which will improve either the company's finances or the services which it gives to the people.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have queried the acquisition terms for which the Bill provides.  Some of them have contended that the acquisition terms were too generous to the shareholders. Deputy O'Higgins and one other Deputy at least on the Fine Gael side suggested that so far as the Dublin United Transport Company was concerned they were too restricted. Deputy O'Higgins described me as putting a pistol to the head of the Dublin United Transport Company shareholders to get them to accept. Deputy Norton described me as their fairy godmother.</P>
    <P>One of the suggestions put forward in the course of the discussion by Deputy Norton, and I think also by Deputy Dillon, was that we should acquire the shares of the Great Southern Railways Company or the Dublin United Transport Company at their market value in a particular year or over a particular period.  That suggestion obviously relates to a different scheme from that contained in the Bill. We are not contemplating buying any shares for cash.  We are proposing to give to the shareholders of these undertakings, in return for the shares they have now, shares in the new undertaking.  There is no question of paying cash, and consequently no need to determine the cash value of these shares now or at any other time, but if it is seriously contended that we should determine the nominal value of the new shares that will be given to the Great Southern Railways Company <Col N="2440" /> shareholders, not in relation to the nominal value of their present shares, but in relation to the market value of these shares now or at some time in the past, it is tantamount to a suggestion that we should slash again the nominal value of the shares held by these people.  Is not that so?</P>
    <P>I asked Deputies, in introducing this Bill, to relate it to the Bill which we introduced in 1933.  You cannot consider whether the proposal relating to the shareholders of the Great Southern Railways Company in this Bill are fair or unfair, and leave the 1933 Act out of account.  In the 1933 Act we reduced the capital of the Great Southern Railways Company by more than half.</P>

      <P>The Fine Gael Party at that time protested strongly against that cutting of the nominal value of the capital of that company without consulting the shareholders, without seeking to get the consent of their shareholders.  This time I decided to learn from past experience and endeavoured to secure in advance the consent of the various classes of shareholders, but, apparently, that has not pleased that Party either.  We did, however, in 1933, reduce the nominal value of that capital very considerably. We cut the debentures 15 per cent. Some Deputy was asking about operations on the London Stock Exchange in Great Southern Railway debentures. Do Deputies not remember that the immediate result of our action in this Dáil in cutting the nominal value of the Great Southern Railways debentures was a decision by the London Stock Exchange Committee that no further transactions in Irish railway shares would be authorised there?  So violently did the London Stock Exchange authorities react against our action, so much did they resent it, that <Col N="2441" /> they took that decision that never again would money for Irish railways be loaned from the English market. We cut the value of the ordinary shares by 90 per cent.</P>
      <P>Will Deputies who talk about recent fluctuations in the value of the ordinary shares of the Great Southern Railways Company, remember that every £100 nominal value now held by these shareholders represents an original investment of £1,000?  There was a time when Great Southern Railways shares were regarded as the best security in the country.  Up to ten years ago their preference shares and guaranteed stock were trustee securities authorised by the Minister for Finance for the investment of trust funds.  These shares paid no dividends for many years until this year.  The earnings of that company were never sufficient to enable a dividend to be paid for a long time past.  Even in the years following 1924, in which some dividend was paid upon the ordinary shares, as Deputy Cosgrave properly pointed out, that dividend was not paid from earnings; it was paid from certain funds which accrued to the company in respect of the time in which the British Government were operating the railway system here.  I submit that it would be an act of injustice for us further to depreciate the nominal value of the shares of this company.  I am not concerned, and I do not think this Dáil should be concerned, with possible fluctuations in their market value because that market value is of no significance except in relation to what these shares can earn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us consider the position of these shareholders.  There were these debenture holders, the nominal value of whose shares was cut by 15 per cent. in 1933 but who upon the reduced nominal value were getting 4 per cent.  interest every year.  In no year did the company fail to pay that interest.  In no year was the company unable to pay that interest.  We are proposing in relation to these shareholders that they shall accept a reduction in their interest of 25 per cent.  In future, for every £4 per £100 that they got in interest they will get only £3.  We are giving <Col N="2442" /> them, in return for that cut in interest, the greater security of a State guarantee. But remember this, that these debenture holders were not without security.  I know that most Deputies here understand the difference between a debenture and an ordinary share.  A debenture represents a loan given at a fixed rate of interest to a concern on the security of all the assets of that concern, and the holder of that debenture, if his interest is not paid, has the right to take over the concern. Every month of every year you will read in the newspapers of the debenture holders of some firm appointing a receiver, as he is called, to take over the concern and run it in their interest or, if he cannot run it in their interest at a profit, to break up the assets of the concern, sell them as scrap, if necessary, in order to repay the principal due to the debenture holders.  The position of a railway debenture holder is somewhat different because it is at least questionable whether the Dáil would contemplate these debenture holders exercising their legal right to break up the property of the Great Southern Railways Company and sell it as scrap just because their interest was not paid.  But these debenture holders were not, as I said, without security.  They had that first charge upon all the assets of the company.  In substitution for that first charge, we are giving them the better security of a State guarantee and, by reason of that guarantee, we are asking them to accept, and they have agreed to accept, 25 per cent. reduction in the amount of interest which they will receive.</P>
    <P>That in respect of the Great Southern Railways Company alone, means an immediate saving of £70,000 a year.  Next to the debenture holders were the guaranteed shareholders. The guaranteed shareholders had not got the same rights as debenture holders but they had rights nevertheless.  In particular they had this right, that if in any year the 4 per cent. due upon their guaranteed shares was not paid, then it had to be paid in arrears in any subsequent year before a dividend could be paid on any other stock by the company.  It is true that the company was unable to <Col N="2443" /> pay its guaranteed dividend in some years and had to make good for that inability by paying two or three years' arrears of dividends at subsequent times.  The guaranteed dividend is paid up to date.  These guaranteed shareholders were entitled, when they invested their money, to expect 4 per cent. in return.  Even though getting it with some uncertainty they got it up to date.  We proposed to these people, instead of 4 per cent., that they would be assured by Government guarantee only 1½ per cent.  In effect, that is what the provision in the Bill means.  They accepted an arrangement under which instead of 4 per cent. they are to get 1½ per cent. which will be guaranteed by the Government.  The preference shareholders and ordinary shareholders are having their shares substituted £ for £ by the common stock of that company, stock which will not be guaranteed by the Government, and the payment of a dividend on which depends solely on the ability of the company to earn a profit.  I do not think it will be seriously contended that that is unduly generous treatment of those who had already suffered very substantial capital loss involved by the provisions of the Railways Act, 1933.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Dublin Transport Company we propose to substitute on the basis of £145 for £100, 3 per cent. debenture stock for existing 6 per cent.  Preference stock and ordinary stock upon which dividends, I think, were paid every year except one, and were paid last year at the rate of 6 per cent.  We regard that also as an equitable arrangement for the shareholders of that company, as that undertaking will bring to the new enterprise a revenue, even on a pre-war basis, more than sufficient to pay the interest due in respect of debenture stock issued to shareholders.  Deputy McGilligan spoke about the financial construction of this company, and also made a serious effort to get the facts straight, but it was obvious that he failed to do so.  He assumed that the £13,500,000 with which this company would begin life would be represented <Col N="2444" /> partly by tangible assets transferred by the Dublin Transport Company, and partly by questionable assets transferred by the Great Southern Railways Company.  His initial error was in relation to the Transport Company. I do not know how one would set about valuing a transport company. It is obviously impossible to value a transport company on the basis of fixed property.  The fixed property of the Dublin Transport Company was quoted at £2,000,000 but is valued in the company's balance sheet at £380,000.  In the balance sheet of the Dublin Transport Company on the assets side the item &ldquo;goodwill&rdquo; represents more than 60 per cent. of the value of all the items.</P>
    <P>What does &ldquo;good-will&rdquo; represent? It represents money paid by that company to buy out other operators in the Dublin area, and money invested in tramways which have disappeared.  Is there any question about the ability of that company to earn a revenue to remunerate the whole of its capital? There is none.  That company is earning a substantial revenue, and is capable of earning a substantial revenue in the future.  Should we not value it on its earning capacity rather than on its fixed assets?  It has been stated that a transport undertaking has no real assets except good-will.  If the Dublin Transport Company broke up to-morrow, of what value are the buses?  Who wants to buy a bus?  What is of value is the position it has established in the City of Dublin, with the right to run transport services there, exclusively, as it is the only transport operator in the city area.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan stated that we proposed paying £13,500,000 for junk.  That was a nonsensical statement.  We give them no money.  I want to emphasise that, in so far as they have shares, they are getting shares in return which represent value of almost the same kind.  It is completely untrue to suggest that the assets of the Great Southern Railways Company are nil.  I stated that its rolling stock is obsolete, that it is not <Col N="2445" /> merely obsolute but uneconomic to operate because it is not standardised. That is true, but the value of the rolling stock of the Great Southern Railways Company on the highest basis is not more than £4,000,000. £26,000,000 went into that undertaking, and that £26,000,000 represents the land that was acquired on which to build the railway lines, the permanent way to carry these lines, and the stations and buildings.  On what basis would you value that land now?  On what basis would you value the buildings now?  It is impossible to determine what is the precise value of the fixed assets of the company.</P>
      <P>Railway companies in the past always had a peculiar system of finance.  They did not prepare their balance sheets or accounts in the same way as ordinary companies.  It is proposed that this new company will change that; that it will get rid of the antiquated system of finance that hung like a millstone round the necks of railway companies in the past, and that we will have in Córas lompair Eireann what has been done already by the Dublin Transport Company, that we will get its finances arranged in the ordinary way&mdash;making provision for depreciation of assets as an ordinary company would make provision for depreciation of its assets.  For the first time in years&mdash;in the present year&mdash;the company allocated to depreciation a sum of £550,000.  It is proposed to make an attempt to value these tangible assets and to segregate tangible assets from its other assets, so that the balance sheet will present a fair picture of the position of the undertaking.</P>
      <P>I know that many people think that the stronger financial position acquired by the Great Southern Railways company in the last year over previous years was due to increases in charges. That is a complete fallacy.  Let me say that the increases in charges which were authorised did not in any case bring these charges over and above the standard charges approved for the company by the Railway Tribunal. Deputies will have to understand that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was contemplated when that company was set up that it could earn <Col N="2446" /> a revenue of £1,170,000 and, in order to ensure that it would earn that revenue, a Railway Tribunal was brought into existence, with power to determine the charges which the company would make for the carriage of various classes of goods.  In practice, the company was never able to charge these rates.  It could only charge these rates on the basis of getting no traffic, and it was continually going to the Railway Tribunal asking for permission to lower rates so that it could hold traffic in competition with private lorries and independent road transport operators.  As Deputies know, it never succeeded in earning that revenue of £1,170,000.  The total expansion of the company's revenue resulting from the increase in charges effected last year was £300,000, and arising out of the revenue of that year, no less than £550,000 was appropriated to depreciation for the first time.  The improved financial position was all secured by good management, and particularly by good management on the financial side, and was independent of the increases in charges and is an indication of what can be done for that company, or for the new company which will absorb it, by similar management in the future.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dockrell suggested that we had reached the stage at which railways were not necessary at all.  Other Deputies contemplated the possibility of fast internal air services, or was it Deputy Dockrell who foresaw a fleet of amphibious trucks sailing down the Liffey, taking goods off ships, driving up to land and off to Mullingar, so that there would be no handling of goods at all?  We are dealing here with the things that <Col N="2447" /> we can foresee now, and so far as we can foresee now the preservation of the railways is essential to the maintenance of a proper transport service in this country.  It may be, and I am not going to suggest the contrary, that at some future time a form of transport will emerge which will justify the closing down of the railways, but that has not come yet.  It is not in sight yet, and there is, in fact, little prospect of the successful operation of internal air services for goods or passengers in this country.  There is a minimum distance over which air services can be economically operated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>At the moment, and, so far as any development of air transport services during the war indicates, that will be the position in the future also.  A person who wants to get from Dublin to Cork is not concerned with the time it will take him to get from Collinstown aerodrome to some new aerodrome yet to be constructed outside of Cork.  That is only a matter of technical interest.  What concerns him is the time it will take him to get from O'Connell Bridge to the Mall, calculating the time that it will take him to get from O'Connell Bridge to Collinstown and from the new Cork aerodrome to the Mall.  Experience has shown that rail transport can beat air transport in speed in normal conditions in distances up to 200 miles, except there is a sea passage intervening. However, that is a digression.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My concern here is to repeat and emphasise what I said in introducing the measure that our railways are the kernel of our transport system, that we are going to maintain these railways because of their essentiality to the economic development of this country.  There is only one basis on which we can do it, and that is by securing for them sufficient traffic to make their economical operation practicable. That means that we cannot allow development in competing merchandise services on the roads except it is controlled by the same organisation which is operating <Col N="2448" /> the railways, so that arising out of the combined operations of that organisation there will come revenue sufficient to enable it to carry on all the services that are necessary.</P>

It represents the whole of its proposals for the reorganisation of our transport services in so far as we can see the problems associated with the reorganisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that later.  We had then the suggestion of nationalisation which I want to deal with.  I think that very few Deputies attempted to show that any real practical benefits would accrue to this country by substituting, for the proposals in this Bill, proposals for operating the transport services by a Government Department.  I am told that we should have copied the Electricity Supply Board model.  Let me say that of all the various types of organisation that have been devised in this State to carry on the economic activities in which the Government is interested, the very worst is the Electricity Supply Board.  I do not want Deputies to take out of that statement any reflection upon the individuals who constitute the <Col N="2449" /> board.  I am talking not about individuals, but about the constitution of the Electricity Supply Board.  I think it is fundamentally wrong to have upon the managerial body people who are themselves the executive heads of departments for the direction of which that body is responsible.  I hope at some time to come to the Dáil to propose a change in relation to the Electricity Supply Board which will substitute what I would regard as a more rational type of organisation.  I, certainly, would not support, in any circumstances, the creation of a similar type of organisation for the management of the railway services.  I believe that, of all the various types of organisation which we have devised to carry on the economic activities in which the Government is concerned, that which will prove best is the one contained in this Bill.</P>
      <P>Let me give a reason for that.  The only real difference between the proposals in the Bill, and what some Deputies describe as a public utility company, is that the common stock which it is contemplated will be created will be held, under the provisions of this Bill, by private persons and under their proposals by the Minister for Finance.  The essential difference is that the directors of the company, other than the chairman, would be appointed under their proposals by the Minister for Finance, while under this Bill they will be elected by the holders of the common stock.  I think it is better that they should be elected by the holders of the common stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I explained already that the Government had this difficulty in relation to the boards which it had nominated already: That it is not always possible to get people who will be completely independent of the Government, independent in their attitude to the Government, knowing that they are dependent on the Government for reappointment when their term of office expires.  It is not always possible to get people who, in coming to decisions relating to the concerns which they are managing affecting outside interests, will not have regard to political interests, not always in favour of <Col N="2450" /> the Government.  It is not always possible to get people who will give to the affairs of these concerns the same close and precise attention which they would give if they had a personal financial interest in the result of an undertaking's working.  I think it is desirable that we should have associated with the chairman of this company directors who will not be nominated by the Minister for Finance, who will have the same freedom as the directors of a private concern, the same independence and the same interest in ensuring efficient and economical management, because it is upon the prospect of efficient and economical management that the prospect of dividends on the ordinary stock will depend, and the responsibility of these directors will be to the stockholders and not to the Minister for Finance.  I think it is a good system.  It is one, I think, that is worthy of being given a trial.  It is, as I have said, a system which gives us all the benefits of nationalisation and none of the disadvantages.</P>
    <P>Now, we are told here that it is wrong to give the powers contemplated in this Bill to one man.  Let me say, straight away, that it is not a matter of principle with me whether the Government's representation on this board should be confined to one person or more.  I am sure, however, that no Deputy will seriously suggest that we should give these powers to more than one.  We are proposing that this chairman should have certain powers. Clearly, they are the type of powers that can only be exercised by one person.  You could not give similar powers to two persons without producing a position of chaos on the board. Why are any powers necessary?  Deputy Hogan referred to them at some length, and other Deputies spoke about them as representing a desire on the part of the Government to create a dictatorship.  It is nothing of the sort.  The person who goes as chairman of that company will be the Government's representative.  It will be his duty to see that considerations of public policy, the aim of achieving the maximum economic development of this</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2451" /> State, will predominate over the aim of making a profit for the shareholders.</P>
    <P>That will be his function and because that is his function we have to contemplate that these shareholders' directors will not be yes-men as Deputy Davin described them but people who may find themselves in conflict with the chairman.  It is because of the possibility of conflict between matters of public policy and the desire to make profit for the shareholders, between the representative of public policy and the representatives of the shareholders, that we have to provide in the Bill that, in such a conflict, the matter of public policy, as represented by the chairman, will prevail.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason that we provide, first of all, that the board can make no decision in which he does not concur.  That does not mean he could impose on the board a decision in which it did not concur.  It does mean that, if they are proposing to arrive at a decision which appears to be contrary to public interest, he can stop them.  We provide that the chairman alone may constitute a quorum at the meeting, to ensure that in the case of such a conflict the shareholders' directors may not make the meeting abortive by refusing to attend it.  We are proposing to take power to fix remuneration in certain circumstances, to provide against the possibility of the holders of common stock refusing to pay the chairman we appoint to carry out the national policy.  These are the reasons that these safeguards have been made.  If we contemplate establishing this organisation at all, it is clearly logical for us to ensure that the chairman appointed as the representative of the Government can give effect to the Government's will and cannot be thwarted in doing so by the representatives of the private shareholders.</P>

      <P>Many attacks have been made upon the present chairman of the company and I should like to make reference to them, as I think it will help to dispose of some of the misunderstandings which have surrounded this Bill.  I am told that the Government made a mistake in appointing as chairman of the Great Southern Railways a person who had no railway experience.  I wonder if the Deputy who made that remark gave a moment's consideration to the problem of the Government in selecting a chairman.  The only place in which we could get a man with railway experience was in the service of that company or the Great Northern Railway, or outside the country altogether.

I do not think that is necessary.  This company requires at its head somebody with business experience and competence, to handle the company's finances.  Do we consider it necessary to get an electrician as chairman of the Electricity Supply Board, or a sugar cook as chairman of the Irish Sugar Company?  Not at all; nor is it necessary to have someone with railway experience to be chairman of a national transport company.</P>

      <Col N="2454" /> That charge was made by one of the Deputies in the Labour Party, but not by others.  I think Deputy O'Sullivan would be one of those in a position to refute it.  I am aware of the fact that, when Deputy O'Sullivan sought an interview with the chairman of that company, to obtain leave of absence to take over the very dignified office of Lord Mayor of Dublin, the chairman offered him the position of labour supervisor, in charge of the company's labour relations, the management of its existing agreements with trade unions, and the negotiation of new agreements.  Deputy O'Sullivan rejected the offer on grounds which are very creditable to him, but the fact that it was made is, I think, sufficient answer to the charge that the chairman of the company was inspired by any feelings of hostility to the workers or to the trade unions.  I think it is worth mentioning that Deputy O'Sullivan is a member of one of the British unions to which I have been told this chairman is particularly hostile.</P>
    <P>I also wish emphatically to deny that there is any basis for the suggestion that the policy of this company has been directed with any hostility to trade unions in general, or to British trade unions in particular.  As the Dáil knows, the company is obliged by law to regulate its rates of pay, its hours of duty and its conditions of employment in accordance with agreements made or to be made between the trade unions representative of such employees on the one part, and such company on the other part.  This Government has never attempted to discriminate against trade unions with their headquarters outside the country, whatever personal views members of the Fianna Fáil Party may hold as to the desirability of such unions taking an active part here.  The Government has never considered that public policy required that they should interfere, if the workers of this country decided they would obtain the best protection of their interests by being members of those unions.  I want to say emphatically that, in so far as the chairman of Córas Iompair Eireann will have responsibility for carrying out Government policy, he will conform to Government <Col N="2455" /> policy in that regard as in every other regard.</P>
    <P>I hope I have succeeded in killing the idea that there is some attempt either to displace existing British unions which cater for Irish workers or to substitute such unions with unions whose headquarters are in this country.  That is not correct.  It certainly will not be the policy to be pursued when the new chairman is appointed by the Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin clearly misunderstood the provisions of Section 24 of the Bill. He interpreted that section, which empowers the company to subscribe to clubs, associations and other social activities for the welfare of the employees, as being a plan to provide for the promotion of a form of house union.  That is not the case.</P>

      <P>It is necessary to have such a provision in the Bill, just as it is necessary to have a provision empowering the company to subscribe to charity.  Otherwise, the company would never be able to use its funds for that purpose.  I said in introducing the Bill that we were leaving the existing negotiating wage machinery unchanged but that we did not know whether that course is desired by the trade unions representing the men employed in these companies.  If it is not the course they desire and if they prefer that some change should be made in the existing wage negotiating machinery I invite submission of amendments either to myself for the consideration of the Government or to the Dáil on the Committee Stage of the Bill.  I am quite prepared to recognise the full right of these trade unions to propose any changes they consider suitable or necessary in order to protect the interests of the workers they represent.  While I am on this matter I might refer to a statement made by Deputy Hughes, because I know that this statement has been frequently made by other people.  The Deputy said that he opposed this amalgamation between the Great Southern Railways Company and the Dublin United <Col N="2456" /> Transport Company because of the danger of a strike tying up all the transport facilities of the country.  My first answer to that is that I hope that we will be able to devise ways and means of ensuring that the disputes affecting conditions of employment of workers in essential services will be resolved to the satisfaction of these workers by some other method than by the use of strikes.  In so far as the situation now is, if a strike did occur it would lead to a complete tying up of transport no more after the passing of this Bill than it would before.  Each of these companies has established what is tantamount to a monopoly in its own area and a comprehensive total strike would tie up comprehensively the facilities in its own areas.  The risk of a greater tie-up is, therefore, not considerable.  I must recognise the danger is there but I do not think that it is a danger which could be minimised by any reorganisation of the transport services.  It can only be minimised by bringing common sense to bear upon these problems between public transport operators and their employees, and by agreement that we should depart from the antiquated methods which have caused so much hardship in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been some misunderstanding also concerning the superannuation position.  Let me make it quite clear that the new company will take over in full all the liabilities of both the amalgamated companies in respect of superannuation funds, but we contemplated in 1933 that in addition to all these funds there would be created pension funds for the ordinary traffic grades who have had no pension rights in the past although they did receive <i>ex gratia</i> pensions from the company on retirement at 65.  We failed in 1933, first, because of the defects in the legislation, and secondly, because of the disimproving financial position of the company.  We are proposing to start again.  At the moment the existing management of the company is already working out a comprehensive benefit scheme and pension scheme for the employees.  If this scheme is completed and in operation by the time the Bill is passed then the new company <Col N="2457" /> will take it over; but if it is not in operation the new company will take over the task of getting the scheme completed.  Deputy Davin has referred to the fact that these pensions schemes are, in fact, insurance schemes.  I think the Deputy would be unwise, from the point of view of the interest of the workers generally, to deprecate pensions schemes that are based on insurance principles.  There is the difficulty at the present time that the Great Southern Railways gives an <i>ex gratia</i> pension of 16/- on retirement at 65, which it reduces to 6/- when the employee reaches 70 and becomes entitled to the old age pension. I do not think Deputy Alfred Byrne can have understood the position. If they continued to give the worker 16/- per week it is not the worker who will benefit but the National Exchequer.  The worker would get 16/- pension but no old age pension.  There is that problem associated with pension schemes of all industrial concerns, and I feel the Minister for Local Government will give that matter his attention and see whether it is possible to adapt the provisions of the Old Age Pensions Act so as to enable more generous schemes to be operated by industrial firms that want to give pensions to their employees.</P>

      <P>I know nothing about it, but I am sure that any representations made by the representatives of the unions to the company will be <Col N="2458" /> listened to.  With regard to compensation for redundancy, let me relieve Deputies' minds.  I do not care what period goes into the Bill. There is no comparison whatever between the redundancy problem which arose out of the 1924 Act which amalgamated 26 railway companies operating, competing, and frequently overlapping services, and the problem that will arise from amalgamation of the two self-contained companies under this Act, companies operating monopoly services in separate areas.  There will be, in fact, little or no redundancy. And any redundancy there will almost exclusively be found in the executive and managerial grades.  It is quite clear that there is on this occasion no overlapping of services which can create the redundancy which was experienced under the 1924 Act.  Any redundancy which does emerge will emerge at once.  I should say, six months would be sufficiently long to create the permanent situation that will persist in the next few years.  If it is desirable, as I think it is, to have some period, it is merely to ensure that workers will not get false ideas as to the situation and that we will not continuously have litigation on individual cases.  The intention is that every worker who loses his employment as a result of redundancy arising from the amalgamation will be compensated and, no matter what period we put in the Bill, if after that date it is shown to me&mdash; and I give this undertaking on my own behalf and on behalf of my successor and I think I can put him in the position that he must be bound by it&mdash;that any worker was denied the compensation he would have been entitled to but for the lapse of the period in the Bill I will introduce a special Bill naming that worker and making it binding upon the company to pay the prescribed compensation.  The intention is that every worker who loses his employment through redundancy will get compensation and I can assure the House that there will be no attempt made on behalf of the board to evade that and if there is I assure the House I will remedy it.</P>

      <P>We can discuss it in Committee, if the Deputy wishes.  The Labour Party objected to the compensation proposed for directors who may resign.  It is proposed that the directors of the amalgamating companies who resign their directorships after the first meeting of the new company should be compensated.  If Deputy Davin or other members of the Labour Party think it is not desirable to offer too great inducement to them to resign, we can consider an amendment of that on the Report Stage.  Deputy Hughes raised some queries concerning the Railway Tribunal.  I think there is considerable misunderstanding concerning this tribunal.  I refer to the tribunal set up under the 1924 Act and abolished by this measure.  The public did not resort to that tribunal at all in recent years.  It was contemplated that the tribunal would provide a cheap means of adjusting differences between the company and its customers.</P>
      <P>It did not prove a cheap means; it proved most expensive.  The company went to the tribunal with an array of counsel that would intimidate anyone. Those who dared to go to the tribunal had to pick a similar array of counsel and it proved so costly that practically all the adjustments were made as the result of applications by the Department of Industry and Commerce after consultations with officials of the railway company.  We are, in fact, proposing to recognise in the Bill what has been the practice and to abolish the Railway Tribunal.  We are transferring to the High Court the legal functions of that tribunal; we are retaining for the Minister for Industry and Commerce the functions formerly exercised by the tribunal which relate to the rates of charge, the classification of merchandise, the conditions of traffic, pooling arrangements, agreements for the routing of traffic, and similar matters which, nine times out of 10, can be adjusted by consultation and only on the tenth occasion will require adjustment by Ministerial Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hughes is completely wrong <Col N="2460" /> in assuming that merchandise traffic rates could be fixed on the value of the goods.  The primary consideration as to the rates charged for goods is the cost of transporting them and, in the long run, that must operate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin has been anxiously inquiring about the intentions of the Government concerning the Grand Canal Company.  We are not proposing that this new company should take over the Grand Canal Company.  The problem of the control of our inland waterways is not confined to the Grand Canal Company.  In addition, there is the Shannon Navigation and the Suir Navigation.  There is a very distinct problem arising out of the fact that the persons who own or control these waterways as traffic highways are also the operators of carrying business, and the segregation of the business of maintaining a traffic highway from the business of carrying goods upon that highway would be a difficult and delicate matter.</P>
    <P>I am not at all sure that it would be good policy to give this new company responsibility over the Grand Canal Company.  If we take from the Grand Canal Company only this traffic highway, and leave it its business as a carrying company, I think it will be found that the traffic highway is not paying its way and we would be saddling the new company with a liability from which they should be relieved for the time being.  The Grand Canal Company has been paying dividends in recent years, not because of the earnings of its undertaking, but because of the profits secured on its investments.</P>
    <P>Deputy Maguire inquired as to the possibility of more traffic on the Royal Canal.  I think the prospect of more traffic on that canal is very slight.  It is not that the canal is not there to be used; it is not that there are not barges there to be used; it is that the traffic is not there to be carried. When that canal was established in 1818 the British Government of the day had doubts as to whether the canal would ever pay, doubts which were justified in the event. Because they had those doubts, they required the Canal Company to deposit <Col N="2461" /> with certain trustees £15,000 from which the cost of maintaining the canal could be met if the ordinary working profits were not sufficient to do so.  Provision has been made in this Bill for the liquidation of the residue of that sum.  That canal never paid its way.  There is no reason why traffic on that canal could not be developed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing to prevent anybody operating on that canal apart from the Canal Company. Deputy Alfred Byrne inquired whether all the agreements made by the Dublin Corporation with the Dublin United Transport Company are being transferred to the new company.  They are being transferred.  Every liability of the amalgamating companies becomes a liability of the new company. That is provided for in Section 7.  The Deputy may not have appreciated that, because Section 7 is rather technical, but the effect is to ensure a transfer of obligations arising under agreements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to discuss at length the question of the Dublin wayleaves. There is some misunderstanding in that regard.  These wayleaves were payable in perpetuity by the Dublin Transport Company under the provisions of the 1925 Act.  That Act was a private Act passed at the instance of the Dublin United Tramways Company in order to get the power to operate bus services.  It was opposed by the Dublin Corporation, and in order to buy off that opposition the company agreed to pay the wayleaves in perpetuity at the amounts paid in that year.  The company, in making that agreement, contemplated that the tramways would last for many years, but I do not suppose anybody here would contemplate that in years to come, long after trams would be forgotten, this new transport organisation would continue to pay this pension to the Dublin Corporation and the Dun Laoghaire Borough Council.  We are making provision to terminate the payment on the basis of transferring <Col N="2462" /> to the municipal authority and the borough authority a lump sum which represents the capital value of the way leaves as determined by an arbitrator in default of an agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">

      <P>With the passage of the 1932 Road Transport Act the whole position of the Dublin transport undertaking was put on a new basis.  It was no longer operating under private Acts; it was no longer obliged to negotiate agreements in order to run services in Dublin.  It got that licence from the Government and nobody else could get that licence, not even the Dublin Corporation.</P>
      <P>There has been a statement made to the effect that we are not proposing to municipalise the Dublin transport services.  I was in favour of municipal control of the services in Dublin when these services were entirely provided by tramways and when the public transport services throughout the country were mainly provided by the railways.  That situation has ended.  The coming of the omnibus, which constitutes a common factor between the two companies, has created a new situation.  It has made it possible to create a national organisation which will secure greater efficiency, and more economical working by reason of amalgamation.  The Dublin Corporation have made an agreement with the Dublin Transport Company concerning road maintenance. That agreement will also be taken over by the new company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The repeal of the Statutory Undertakings (Temporary Increase in Charges) Act does not affect charges for electricity, gas, or water.  That Act was continued year by year solely to maintain the maximum charging powers of the Dublin tramways.  Since that was passed, electricity charges were dealt with under the Electricity Supply Board Act, gas charges under the Gas Regulation Acts, and water charges were made the concern of the public authorities.  It will be no longer <Col N="2463" /> necessary to keep that Act in existence once this Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moran inquired about the protection of harbours.  There is ample provision in Section 72 to ensure that the company will not give any preference to one harbour authority over another.  I am anxious to make that section as watertight as possible, and if Deputies do not consider it sufficiently watertight it can be suitably amended on another stage.  I think I have dealt with all the important points that were raised.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may not have been here, but I dealt with that. There was one point raised concerning the exempt areas hauliers.  As Deputies know, we exempted areas around certain important ports under the 1933 Act which provided that they could haul goods for hire inside these areas without a licence.  That was a mistake and it led to evasion of the Act, and circumstances demonstrated that there were no conditions existing in these port areas that did not exist around any inland town of the same size.  We are proposing, therefore, to abolish these exempt areas in respect of the smaller ports.  The only change will be that the persons who did engage in the business of carrying goods for hire will have to get a licence, but the Bill provides that they must get a licence when they apply.</P>

That is the Bill.  We are putting that Bill to the Dáil as the best solution the Government have for the transport problems that existed in this country up to the war and that will reappear after the war unless we provide safeguards now to ensure that they do not.  I do not think we should adopt the recommendation of the Transport Tribunal and wait for five years and then look to see what the situation will be.  I think if we do that we will miss the tide.  I think that if we are going to take full advantage of the opportunities which will come in the post-war era and put ourselves in the position to meet the difficulties which will come in the post-war era, we must get ready now.</P>
      <P>We must create the organisation now and give the organisation the power and the finances.  We must make it clear to the people who will be in charge of it that no further changes are contemplated and that the responsibility will be theirs.  If we put them in that position and make it known that they will have the goodwill of the Dáil, I am certain that they can create a transport organisation which will make a vital contribution to the future economic development of the country.</P>

      <P>May I ask one question?  The Minister will recollect I referred to the position of the Railway Clearing System Superannuation Fund.  The Minister did not advert to that when replying.  The position is that the Great Southern Railways at present are withholding the necessary assent to secure the reorganisation of the fund.  It is placing the clerical staff in an invidious position.</P>

    <P>As I understand the position&mdash;I do not profess to be quite familiar with it&mdash; the Great Southern Railways have come to the conclusion that that fund was being badly managed.  There was a question of an increased contribution and the company was unwilling to make that contribution and decided to maintain the existing provision which will ensure for the clerks pensions at the existing rates and to supplement these pensions by a scheme of their own.  Certainly it would be my desire that these railway clerks should not lose in any way by reason of the disinclination of the management of the company to make an increased contribution arising out of their lack of confidence in the management of the fund. I think I can assure the Deputy that an arrangement will be made to ensure that the clerks of the Great Southern Railways will not lose by the change.</P>
