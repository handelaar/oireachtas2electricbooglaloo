      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, in view of the serious problems which will confront this country after the war and the need for genuine reconstruction, the sub-committee set up by the Cabinet to consider post-war plans will consult with agricultural organisations and with labour organisations.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in reply to a Parliamentary question addressed to me on the 27th October last by Deputy Martin O'Sullivan, the Committee of the Cabinet which was set up in November, 1942, keeps under observation the progress made by Departments in formulating proposals for post-war activities, and makes suggestions as to the steps which might be taken to expedite planning and the carrying out of preparatory work in existing conditions.  The primary responsibility for the preparation of such plans rests, however, on the Departments concerned, under instructions from the Government, and I have no doubt that these Departments will consult with agricultural and labour organisations whenever it may appear to them that such consultations would be appropriate.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if the Revenue Commissioners allow members of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce relief from income-tax in respect of the annual subscription to the chamber; if a similar concession is <Col N="614" /> enjoyed by members of other chambers of commerce; and if employees, whose incomes bring them within the income-tax limits, may claim exemption in respect of subscriptions to trade unions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain chambers of commerce have entered into an arrangement with the Revenue Commissioners whereby the surplus of their receipts over their expenditure is assessed to tax.  Annual subscriptions by their members to these chambers of commerce are, accordingly, allowed as deductions in the computation of the profits of the members and payments by the chambers to the members (other than capital payments) are treated as trade receipts.</P>
      <P>Subscriptions to other chambers of commerce are legally admissible as deductions to the extent to which they represent contributions towards expenditure which, if incurred by the members themselves, would be allowable in arriving at their profits.</P>
      <P>Relief from income-tax is granted in respect of so much of the subscriptions to trade unions as is allocated to superannuation, funeral or life insurance benefits.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Files and rasps form part of a large variety of tools, the import cost of which has increased considerably, resulting in much higher <Col N="616" /> retail prices.  On account of the wide range of articles involved, and the mixed nature of the business of firms retailing such articles, the fixing of prices would be a matter of great practical difficulty.  It is not at present proposed to fix such prices.  Specific complaints of overcharging for these articles will, however, be investigated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he is aware that smiths' coal is being sold at 4/- to 10/- per cwt. to these tradesmen; if he will state the price fixed by his Department, and whether such price is according to grade and quality of the coal available for use; also, if he will state the price fixed wholesale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received no reports that smiths' coal is being sold at prices as high as 10/- per cwt.  For a variety of reasons, it is not practicable successfully to fix maximum prices of coal by Order.  Imported coals are purchased at different c.i.f. prices, according to the district from which they are imported, the freight charged, and the quality of the coal.  In the case of native coals, production costs vary considerably, and it has been found necessary to sanction different prices for particular grades of coal according to the colliery from which they are produced, and the profits of these collieries are controlled.  The accounts of fuel merchants are kept under review, and there is no evidence that excessive profits are being earned by them.  If the Deputy has any evidence of suspected overcharging in any case, and furnishes the necessary particulars, the matter will be investigated.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a question on the same subject asked by him on the 1st of this month, and in particular, to some extracts from speeches made by him of which I reminded him on that occasion.  I do not interfere with the arrangements made by the Gárda authorities in the ordinary execution of their duty to preserve the peace, unless I see some special reason for doing so, and I see no such reason in the present case.</P>

In connection with this division a general lock-spitting and pointing out of plots was carried out.  The Land Commission have already had their plots indicated for a second time to several tenants and will be prepared, in order to facilitate turf cutting during the coming season, to do what they can to assist any other plot-holders who may have difficulty in identifying their plots, including plot-holders who may have made arrangements with the Mountmellick Old I.R.A.

      <P>In page 2, before Section 3 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>3.  Section 9 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion therein after sub-section (2) of the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2A) A prosecution for an offence under any section of this Act committed by an employer of a worker in relation to such worker may be brought at the suit of such worker or of any official of a trade union of which such worker is a member.</P>
      <P>During the course of the discussion in Committee it was suggested from the Labour Benches that the Principal Act might be amended to enable workers or their trade unions to prosecute employers for offences under that Act.  I have examined the matter, and, while it is not clear that they have not got that right at the moment, I agree it is desirable that the doubt should be removed, and the purpose of the amendment is to enable workers or trade unions to prosecute an employer for an offence committed in relation to the worker.  There are, of course, other offences under the Act, such as refusal to display the necessary abstract of the regulations, or refusal to admit a departmental inspector or to give him the information or facilities he may require.  It is only in relation to offences relating to workers that the right of prosecution of an employer will be given to the worker himself, or to a trade union acting in his behalf.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 2, before Section 2 (2), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2) Notwithstanding sub-section (1) of this section, the Minister may by Order specify a date as the latest date on which the corporation of a county borough or the council of a county may submit to him under this section a scheme relating to a particular local financial year, and thereupon it shall not be lawful for such corporation or council to submit such scheme after that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an amendment empowering the Minister to fix a date, should he consider it necessary, as the latest date upon which a corporation or council may submit a scholarships scheme.  Up to the present most councils have given us reasonable time for the consideration of their schemes.  I explained to the House on the last stage of this Bill that time is of the greatest importance, as consultations had to be over in good time to enable the budgetary arrangements to be made when the annual estimates of councils are under consideration.  Although we generally manage to get matters through before that, it is possible that difficulties might arise and, if such difficulties <Col N="632" /> became numerous, or if we had a number of cases of councils failing to send in their schemes in time, it might become necessary to make some such regulation as the one envisaged in the amendment.  At present I do not think it will be really necessary, but no harm is done in giving the Minister power to fix the date should he consider it necessary.  I should like to say to those interested in this matter as members of councils, that normally October 1st should be taken as the date on which scholarship schemes ought to be in the hands of the Department.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of Section 2 a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(6) The preparation and submission under sub-section (1) of this section of a scheme and the making under sub-section (3) of this section of a determination shall be reserved functions both in the case of the corporation of a county borough and in the case of the council of a county.</P>
      <P>This amendment makes it clear that the preparation and submission of scholarship schemes shall be reserved functions, both in the case of corporations and county councils.  It makes the position quite clear and will be in consonance with Section 7, which we had already in the Bill, giving councils power to decide in regard to expenditure on scholarships, so that not alone expenditure but the submission of schemes will be reserved functions of the councils.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, Section 4, line 50, to delete the word &ldquo;ordinarily&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;<i>bona fide</i>&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is considered that the words &ldquo;<i>bona fide</i>&rdquo; will give a better indication than &ldquo;ordinarily&rdquo;, which is at present the law in regard to residence, of the intention that all genuine residents specified in the functional area of the regulating authority shall, if other conditions are complied with, be eligible for the scholarship schemes.  I should point out that hitherto councils in certain cases have been in the habit of introducing a qualifying period of residence of one, two or three years.  It will not be valid to do this in future, and the point that will arise is whether the parents are ordinarily resident: that is to say, whether we use the word &ldquo;ordinarily&rdquo; or &ldquo;<i>bona fide</i>&rdquo;, I am advised that the legal meaning is the same; that applicants should be in the ordinary way genuinely residing in the area.  If there is a feeling that there should be a limit of time, may I point out that there are cases of Civic Guards, civil servants, employees of transport companies or of insurance companies who, in the course of their official work, have to be transferred from one area to another.  If it were provided that a period of residence was to become necessary, that might very well mean that the children of such persons, who had genuinely to change their residences in the ordinary course of business, would be debarred from going forward as candidates for scholarships in any area.  I think that would be iniquitous.  If there is any doubt the matter can be gone into.  The final decision rests with the Minister under Section 9 of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meighan</NameTxt>
      <P>In resuming on this Estimate I should like to say that I was misquoted in the <i>Irish Independent</i> to-day.  I am quoted as saying here last evening that there was a difference of from 25/- to 50/- an hour in the hire of tractors, reapers and binders and of threshing sets.  What I did say was that there was a difference of from 25/- to 50/- per acre in our county in the case of reapers and binders.  I did not give any figures per hour for threshing sets but I am in a position to do so now.  The figures for threshing sets range from 16/- to 25/- an hour.  As I said yesterday, there may be some reason for the difference between 16/- and 25/- an hour for the threshing sets, but I definitely cannot see any reason why there should be the difference of between 25/- and 50/- per acre for reapers and binders.</P>
      <P>There is a point in connection with horse breeding that I should like the Minister to note.  At the present time, Irish draught mares that get a nomination are not entitled to a nomination if they are sent to a Clydesdale.  Down in the West of Ireland the foals from those Clydesdales are, on an average, at six months of age, worth from £6 to £10 and even £12 more than foals from the Irish draught, while in the case of one and a half year-olds the difference is much greater.  I would suggest to the Minister that, for the present at any rate, while that seems to be the case, there is no reason why the Department should be the means of taking out of the pockets of the people £6, £8 or £10, or even £12, for these foals.  The demand is much greater for the heavy type, which commands an easy sale and a ready price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to know from the Minister if, under the Department's farm improvement scheme, farmers <Col N="636" /> can erect cattle sheds for outlying cattle.  If they can, of course, it is all right, but if they cannot I would suggest that such structures should come under that scheme.  It would be one way of conserving manure, which is very scarce at the present time.  Quite a number of people feed straw to outlying cattle in the wintertime. You have some small farmers who perhaps would have four, five or perhaps six cattle.  If they were afforded the opportunity of getting a grant to erect small open sheds in which the cattle could be fed, a good deal of useful manure could be got that way.</P>
    <P>From my short experience of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, which consisted in recommending two applications for loans from constituents, I can endorse everything that was said here last night by Deputy Sheldon about this body.  On behalf of one of the applicants I personally went to the offices of the corporation and explained the position.  I pointed out that the applicant was a very deserving person, living on a small hillside farm.  The family needed a £50 loan and could give what I regarded as fairly good security.  I was able to tell the corporation that I, personally, knew the family to be very industrious people, that they wanted some money to buy-in a little stock, as their land was pretty rough for tillage.  They also wanted a little money to buy a horse which they proposed to employ in drawing turf to a neighbouring town. They happened to be living in a district where fuel was plentiful and where they could make good money out of an activity of that kind.  Notwithstanding my appeals that case was turned down. In the other case the applicant applied on his own.  I have not been in touch with him except to be informed by the corporation that his application was refused.  For these reasons, as well as for the reasons given by Deputy Sheldon yesterday, I think that if the Agricultural Credit Corporation is going to be of any benefit to the agricultural community its stringent regulations should be somewhat relaxed.</P>
    <P>There is another matter that is disturbing our Party and the minds of <Col N="637" /> other farmers in the State.  It is a statement which was made in the Dáil on the 22nd October, 1943.  It appears in the Official Report, Vol. 91, No. 3, col. 994.  This is the statement made by Deputy Moran, a Fianna Fáil Deputy for South Mayo:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;. . .the sooner. . .any progressive Party. . .wipes out fixity of tenure, the better.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On behalf of myself and of the Party I would ask the Minister, when replying, to say if that statement has the official backing of the Party and of the Government.  If it has, I think it is a very disturbing situation.  So far as our Party is concerned, I think the issue has been made pretty clear on previous occasions and during our election addresses.  If it is necessary to make it clear again, I can only restate it.  It is to the effect that we, the Farmers' Party, stand for fixity of tenure for the tenant farmers of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meighan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is something that is disturbing the minds of the community, and I think we are entitled to a Government answer on the matter. With my colleague, Deputy Beirne, I should like to join in protesting against the way in which agricultural machinery was allocated in the County Roscommon.  Furthermore, Deputy Beirne has gone into the matter very well, and I wish to join with him in his protest.  But there is another more serious aspect and I do not know whether Deputy Beirne has referred to it or not.  The secretary of the County Committee of Agriculture in County Roscommon has stated quite definitely that he was instructed by the Department of Agriculture not to give any information on the allocation of this machinery.  I think the Government and all Parties believe <Col N="638" />&mdash;at least they were led to believe&mdash; that county committees of agriculture in their respective counties are charged with the responsibility of carrying out agricultural schemes and it seems preposterous, when that is so, that a Government Department, explicitly there for carrying out its functions, should officially notify the secretary not to give the committee any information.</P>
      <P>As chairman of the parent body of that committee, the Roscommon County Council, I strongly protest against it.  If it is the case, the members of the county committee are simply wasting their time, and the quicker they are abolished the better. The members could do something more useful on their farms at home instead of spending time and public funds in going to the place of meeting.  If that is not done we would welcome an inquiry into it.  It is a matter for the Department, and if they are not guilty there should be a full explanation.  On behalf of the parent body, in the first place, I protest, and in the second, I say that we should be told decently and at once that we have no business there and that we are to be abolished.</P>
      <P>Deputy Larkin, Senior, made a great many statements yesterday and I could agree with a good deal of what he said, but I would like to point out to him that this Party cannot see eye to eye with the suggestion that the Minister should take over land from the people, for the reason that I have already stated.  On that point, I would refer the House to the statements of a distinguished Churchman, made quite recently.  He said, and his words deserve serious consideration, that the farmers of Ireland recognised the 3 F's, free sale, fixity of tenure and fair rent as their Magna Charta and they should be defended to the death. A good many Deputies have spoken on the various other aspects of agriculture, and I do not think there is any necessity for me to dwell on these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to show the Minister and the House, through you, Sir, that anything I have said here has been said in good faith.  I have been very frank <Col N="639" /> in my statements and I have not attempted to make any capital.  I ask the Minister to consider what I said and where it is necessary, to have the grievances remedied or rectified.  If we continue lagging along in the way we have done for the last two years we will get nowhere.  It seems every year, when we come to consider the work done by the Department of Agriculture, that the results are not satisfying. If it continues much longer in this way, the Government will be well advised seriously to consider the appointment of a more fearless Minister for Agriculture, someone of the type of the late Mr. Hogan, who would not be afraid to take his courage in both hands and to put bold schemes into operation for the good of the country.</P>
    <P>I would make a vehement protest against the national insult offered to the farmers and the agricultural community by the Minister for Agriculture, as representing the Government, when he declined to reply to the motion which Deputy Cogan tabled recently. The motion was intended as a stimulus to increased tillage, and it is very disappointing to find it met by an insult. I was very sorry to note that when, for the first time in the history of the House, the agricultural community was ignored in that way, there was not a single protest made from any of the other benches.  I would like to congratulate my fellow countyman, Deputy Dillon, who stood on his own on that occasion, as the one man who had the courage and manliness to refuse to follow the headlines set by the others.</P>

      <P>As a Party, Clann na Talmhan certainly have a very great advantage.  They are one of the few Parties I have ever come across that are able to have the best of all possible worlds.  It is good policy to talk about fixity of tenure.  Very few people realise what it means and, obviously, neither Deputy Meighan nor Deputy Cogan has the faintest idea of what it means, although the word tenure gives an indication.  Everybody will agree that when the old system of landlordism was ended, the most important <Col N="640" /> achievement of the farmers was the securing of the right of free sale.  But there are more attacks and criticisms arising out of this fixity of tenure, from the Clann than since Fianna Fáil came into the House.  Members of the Clann talk about fixity of tenure, but there is not a day on which Deputy Cafferky or some other Deputy has not a question on the Order Paper looking for the division of land.  If the taking over of land by the Land Commission is not the wiping out of what I call fixity of tenure, I do not know what it is.</P>
      <P>If we are going to have full fixity of tenure, do members of the Clann want to give an absolute right to everybody to hold his land for all time and to use it any way he pleases?  None of the Deputies would agree with that viewpoint.  They would be more interested in dividing lands in Meath or Tipperary and distributing them among the migrants of the West.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say that I quite agree with Deputy Meighan's viewpoint as regards the speech made by Deputy Moran.  I think it was a dangerous suggestion.  Nobody would agree that a person working the land properly should not have the right to hold his land.  I want to make this point, that there is no use in anybody blaming either this Government or the last Government, <Col N="641" /> for what they term fixity of tenure, without indicating what they mean by fixity of tenure.  You cannot have fixity of tenure for the people of one county and no fixity of tenure for the people of another county.  I do not wish to dwell on that matter any further.</P>
      <P>Quite a number of Deputies have spoken in this debate.  Yesterday, in particular, the debate was quite a good one.  There were some very good speeches and some very valuable contributions to the debate.  There were some new speakers, Deputy Sheldon, for instance, who made magnificent contributions to the debate, to my mind.  A maiden speech was made here last week by a Deputy from my constituency and he put me in the position that I felt I would not be able to speak at all.  Deputy Skinner, in the course of his maiden speech, stated he represented the small farmers in North Cork, that Deputy Halliden represented the big farmers in North Cork and that the Minister for Lands and myself were disfranchised completely. It was rather an extraordinary viewpoint.</P>
      <P>I would say, having listened to quite a number of speeches in this debate, that possibly I could claim to represent another section of farmers.  They may not be the small farmers to whom Deputy Skinner referred, the farmers who spoke through him, and they certainly are not the big farmers whom Deputy Halliden represents; they are the farmers who do not agree with the pessimistic viewpoint that Irish agriculture is dead and gone forever; they are the small, mixed farmers who are satisfied to work as hard as they can. Very often they do not agree with Government policy.  Indeed, supporters of my own very often violently disagreed with the policy of the last Government, just as they disagree with the policy of the present Government, but, as sensible people and as anybody else in any other walk of life, they have to make the best of the opportunities they have, no matter what Government is in power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are not asking, and never asked, for any more than the rights <Col N="642" /> their forefathers claimed when they succeeded in getting the three F's.  All they ask is that they will be allowed to use their land and that there will be as little interference as possible from outside sources, such as Government Departments.  I never heard among those people any great demand for the things that various Deputies have asked here, but I have heard them complain bitterly during the régime of the present Minister.  I know there was a period when they were very hard hit, when the mixed farmers depending on a few calves in order to get money at the end of the year, or depending on poultry or pig rearing, had to manage without any Government assistance.  During that period the Government, by their actions, made matters very difficult for those engaged in mixed farming.  Their position is that during the emergency they are prepared to work as hard as any man or woman could work, and they do not believe that Irish agriculture should be dependent in the post-war period upon doles or subsidies.  It is obvious that if Irish agriculture has to depend on doles or subsidies, then Irish agriculture is not worth while debating at such length here.</P>
    <P>It is popular to ask for things; it is popular to suggest that you will get better results from tillage by giving subsidies; it is popular to suggest that you can get better results from the dairying industry by means of subsidies. That type of thing could be applied to every branch of agriculture. I am quite satisfied that what the working farmers want from the Government is nothing more than proper organisation through the Department of Agriculture and the provision of the markets that they need internally and externally, so that they will be able to dispose of their agricultural produce in a proper manner and at reasonable prices.  They merely ask that, so far as the export markets are concerned, the Department of Agriculture will see that everything possible is done to secure suitable markets wherever possible and that the farmers will get the highest possible prices.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="643" /> It was extraordinary to listen to some Deputies, who seemed to suggest that there would be no necessity, even in the post-war period, for an export market.  Everyone knows that under normal conditions there will be a vast amount of agricultural produce available for export.  One Deputy suggested yesterday that it was a waste of time to talk about post-war agricultural conditions.  Do people ever realise that when the war ends we will occupy the most favourable situation as regards markets that this country ever had, and we may not be prepared to take advantage of the opportunity? If we do not develop our agricultural resources we will have nothing to export. If we are not sufficiently active now we will have no bacon, butter, poultry or dairy products to export, and our cattle trade will have sunk to such a level that we will have scarcely any cattle to send to other countries.</P>
    <P>After the war we will be in the position that the markets of the world will be open to us.  We will have the entire Continent of Europe looking for foundation stock of every kind&mdash;cattle, horses, sheep and pigs.  There will be a vast market at our very doorstep, and unless we make preparations now we will not be in a position to take advantage of it.  No matter how long this emergency may last, it is the duty of the Minister to plan immediately to take advantage of the markets that will be open to us.  Unless we are active now there will be no use in attempting to capture those markets in the months after the war ends.  The one thing I fear is that carelessness now will leave us in the position that we will not be able to take advantage of the great opportunity that will be offered to us at the end of the war.</P>
    <P>There are many countries now suffering from the ravages of war, and once the war is over there will be no country, from the middle of Russia to the Atlantic Ocean, that will not be looking for foundation stock.  In this island we are, as it were, on the doorstep of Europe and we will have the greatest opportunity that an agricultural <Col N="644" /> country ever got.  If we do not prepare to take advantage of that opportunity, the responsibility will be on the Minister.  Little purpose will be served by the Minister complaining that he had to deal with an emergency situation, because the Minister had not to deal with any emergency situation; that was dealt with for him by the farmers, by their response to the State's appeal for increased production.</P>
    <P>We must take into consideration the carelessness of the Department of Agriculture in the early stages of the war.  They made a very poor attempt to provide such things as agricultural machinery and artificial manures, of which the people were short.  The response made by the farmers in those circumstances was magnificent.  There is no Deputy who represents a small mixed farming area who is not aware that the response made by those people was really magnificent.  It was not altogether a question of price, not altogether a matter of making money after hard times.  The farmers felt that there was a great responsibility placed upon them, purely from the national point of view.  The country got a splendid response from the farmers in the production of food and fuel.  Nothing else could be expected from the farmers in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>So far as I am concerned, I have no feelings of pessimism; I have no doubt as to the future of agriculture, because the farmer and the agricultural labourer will preserve agriculture, and I know that the farmers and the workers are all right.  If the people engaged in the organisation of the business would do their work even 50 per cent. as well as those actually engaged in agriculture, there would be no danger for the future of the industry. I am satisfied that, if the Department of Agriculture do their duty from the organisation side, the rest of the work will be capably done by the individuals on the farms; it will be done in such a manner that this country will have a very successful post-war agricultural history.</P>
    <P>I think it is a disgrace and it is <Col N="645" /> unfair for any Deputy, even though it may sound popular, to suggest that the agricultural community feel at the moment that they cannot possibly carry on unless they are spoon-fed. The Deputy who says that knows well that it is not true.  There have been times during this debate when Deputies hinted at that very line of argument on practically every subject connected with agriculture.  I shall go into detail about that in a moment.</P>
    <P>In general, there are two very valuable items of export trade which have not been dealt with to any great extent in this debate and with which I intend to deal.  The Minister will admit, I think, that in an agricultural country like this the most profitable type of production, the type of production that gives greatest profit for the outlay, is what one might term the luxury goods end of it.  There are two great ends in our export trade that we can aim at for the future, and I think we have practically lost one of them already.  In his opening statement, the Minister referred to the position of the national stud at Tully which had been taken over.  The position was that the British Government continued the national stud at Tully and the present Government intend to run it on similar lines.  I should like to refer to the possibility that this country has as regards export markets after this war.  Anybody who considers the racehorse, or the hunter, or the live-stock breeding side of it from the point of view of horses, should realise what the position will be in Europe after the war and will have to admit that there is a possibility of doing more for this country in that particular line of our industry than ever before.</P>
    <P>There was a period during the last 20 years when, in a certain type of racehorses, the Italians and the French were getting the better of the British and Irish breeders.  Everybody knew that, so far as a certain type of staying horse was concerned, the French and Italian horses were beating them whenever they met them in England.  It was so apparent that quite a number of racing stallions were imported from the Continent. <Col N="646" /> The position now is that in the three countries on the Continent where racing was a big industry, namely, Germany, France and Italy, there will be no such thing as a thoroughbred horse after the war, the studs and racing stables will have disappeared. Even if the animals are in existence, it will not make any difference, because no Jockey Club or racing association in the world will recognise their bloodstock after the war.</P>
    <P>People may think that that does not mean a lot to the agricultural community of this country.  In my submission, it does.  The development of racing here during the emergency, the fact that the Government have, to some extent, helped to develop racing, and the fact that the operation of the Red Cross Sweepstakes has helped to develop racing, have meant that the smaller producer of racing and hunting bloodstock in this country has now an opportunity that he never had before. Before that our position was that Irish racing was a very small thing.  There was no stake money of any size.  There were a number of race meetings all over the country with £50 and £100 stakes.  That has all been changed, and the farmer, or the man who is interested in racing, can now run his horses and, if the horses are any good, he can expect to win a reasonable stake.  Formerly these horses would have gone to England as yearlings or two-year-olds.  Now we are in the position, having taken over the National Stud from the British Government, that the Department of Agriculture apparently did not think of the matter and they have done nothing to deal with that side of our live-stock trade. If the Department of Agriculture, in the last four or five years, had done quarter as much as individuals have done in this country, it would mean millions to this country post-war.</P>
    <P>Quite a number of owners in this country, like Mr. Joseph McGrath, at the beginning of the emergency were able to purchase the best bloodstock in England and bring them over here for breeding purposes.  When racing was stopped to a large extent in England, hundreds of valuable horses and <Col N="647" /> mares were sold off.  Some of them were imported into this country.  Some were bought very cheaply and some were bought by Mr. Joseph McGrath for huge sums.  These people have established by this means a foundation stock from the best line of blood in any country.  These individuals will be able to take advantage of the post-war conditions.  If the Department of Agriculture had only done half of what they have done, the country would be able to take advantage of it. The breeding of racehorses and hunters is worth a lot to this country, which has been known traditionally for the great horses turned out here.  The country would have an opportunity after the war to export that type of stock all over the world.  It is quite obvious how valuable that trade is even for the half-hunter type, because the Spanish and Portuguese Governments are sending officers to this country to buy them still.  It is a pity the Government waited until the British left the national stud to them before doing anything on their own. There is no reason why, when the British Government owned the Tully stud, the Government here could not have done something similar, because we are in the position now that we have the national stud and it is empty. Nothing can be done until after the war, unless the Government buy from individuals in this country who have good bloodstock.  It would have been worth millions to this country.  I am satisfied that the people who had the foresight to bring in breeding stock into this country, instead of exporting them to England as was normally done, will actually make millions after the war.  But the entire benefit will go to the individuals who had the foresight to do it, and not to the State.</P>
    <P>There is another item at which most people smile when it is mentioned. But there are Deputies who will agree with me that the greyhound side of live-stock production is rapidly outdistancing in value quite a number of other items of our live-stock exports. I heard from a very good authority that it is anticipated that after the war the value of the greyhound exports <Col N="648" /> from this country will be at least £1,000,000 per year.  In my opinion, they have already reached that mark because, if one takes up the public sales which appear in the papers, the total amount of the sales last year reached an extraordinarily high figure, and that does not account for more than 50 per cent. of the exports when the private sales are taken into account.  That is a trade which could be developed.  It has one great advantage over the racehorse industry, because the greyhound industry can be carried on by the small man.  There are many men living in labourers' cottages in Cork and Kerry who have made a great success of the breeding of greyhounds.  There are many small farmers, and even workers in the towns and in the country, who have made hundreds of pounds by breeding greyhounds. They are harassed at the moment because it is almost impossible to carry on the industry.  While I know the Minister has no responsibility directly in the matter, the extraordinary position arises as regards the greyhound industry that there are four or five centres where it has really developed, in the south at any rate, namely, Dublin, Limerick, Clonmel, Cork and Tralee, and no owner of a greyhound who wishes to sell a dog, say, in Limerick, dare take his dog in a motor-car to the trials.  That may be right.</P>

      <P>I am putting a suggestion to the Minister.  I am not questioning that, but I suggest to the Minister that he should speak to his colleague, the Minister for Supplies, and tell him that it is as much in the interests of this country to allow people breeding greyhounds to utilise the hackney service as it is to allow people to go to dances in hackney-cars. I merely make that comparison. Surely the people who are producing something that is worth while to this country are as much entitled to avail of that service as people who go to dances?  This is the only opportunity I have of raising that matter at the <Col N="649" /> early stage of the greyhound season. By the time the Minister for Supplies' Estimate comes up it may be too late.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to get the Minister for Agriculture to deal with it.  Deputy Meighan last night made a very peculiar statement.  I do not think I am misquoting it, but I do not think he really meant what he said. If people objected to paying the high price for butter, he asked why did they not keep a cow?  He went as far as saying that some of them had tried it and they did not think it was a very satisfactory way of producing butter for themselves.  I wonder did Deputy Meighan realise the implications of that.  I wonder did he realise what he was saying.  Does Deputy Meighan suggest that an unfortunate man living in a slum in Dublin with a wife and ten children, who finds that, at the present price of butter, no matter what the ration is, he cannot afford to buy all his ration to supply his wife and family, should get a cow?  Does not Deputy Meighan know perfectly well that 90 per cent. of the people that he is referring to as purchasers of butter, as distinct from the farming community, could not keep a cow if they wanted to?</P>
      <P>That type of argument, in my opinion, is very dangerous.  It is often suggested that none of these demands, made by one section of the community against the other, is a demand of a class or sectional nature. I could not imagine a more vicious class distinction or anything that would impress upon a person's mind the idea that class distinction, or something like it, did exist than that a farmer, when making a case for a better price for milk, knowing that there are hundreds of thousands of people in the country who find it difficult to pay the present price of butter, should tell the consumer in the back lanes of a city or town to keep a cow and make his own butter.  I hope he did not mean it.  If he did mean it, it is a terrible thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Meighan mentioned many <Col N="650" /> other items.  He gave the prices of various types of potatoes that were being sold at from 5/- to 9/- a cwt. in his own constituency.  He mentioned the same fact in regard to eggs.  I entirely agree with him that there must be some enormous discrepancy between the potatoes being sold for 5/- a cwt. in County Roscommon and sold at 2/- a stone in every village in this country.  Of course, it is obvious what happened.  There are five times as many potatoes in this country in bulk as we need for human consumption, but the trouble is&mdash;and it is entirely the Department's fault&mdash;that the potatoes are all in one district and the people who want to sell them cannot get a price for them there and the consumers are in other districts where they cannot buy the potatoes for love or money, on occasions.  The whole difficulty, of course, is that the Department have not seen fit, so far at any rate, to deal with that situation in a proper manner.  Obviously, it is bad marketing and bad distribution that are the cause of the whole trouble. If there is a surplus of potatoes in a particular area and the producer there has to sell them at a sacrifice&mdash; because undoubtedly the figures that Deputy Meighan gave represent a sacrifice&mdash;and if there are large bodies of people in other areas who are prepared to pay a reasonable price, it ought to be the duty of the Department to put the potatoes within reach of these people.  Apparently they are not doing that.  Nobody would like to see a situation such as arose last year where there were potatoes rotting along the seaboards while the people in Dublin were queuing for them.</P>
    <P>The very same thing happened in regard to eggs.  Deputy Meighan mentioned that there were people getting only 2/- from the man who called to the door while the eggs were being sold at 3/2 in Dublin.  I think a certain section of the farmers of this country were themselves responsible to a great extent for the position in regard to the price of eggs because they assisted lately in the breaking down of the ordinary market that used to be held in every town in the country <Col N="651" /> with the result that there is now a kind of vicious circle.  You now get only one dealer going into a particular area with a little lorry or van.  He comes to the door and collects the eggs and there is an end to all competition as far as the egg trade is concerned. Formerly the ordinary law of supply and demand operated in the South. The big butter and egg merchants would go to the open fair in the villages of Cork, Tipperary, Limerick and Waterford, where there was, within my own memory, hot competition between these people for eggs and other agricultural produce, such as poultry, in the open market.</P>
    <P>A system has developed whereby, where a co-operative society is dealing in that trade, the particular person supplying them is tied to that co-operative society, hand and foot.  He supplies the society with agricultural produce and takes, not a competitive market price, but the price the society fix.  Other persons deal with the ordinary trader, who calls to the door, because they feel it a great convenience to have the lorry calling at the door.  They are dealing with only the one person who is going into that area and there is actually no open competition of any kind.</P>
    <P>That may not be as serious as it would be in normal times because, apparently, owing to the export markets, there is a certain amount of control on the price of eggs, but even in normal times that danger will always be there and much of it is due to the fact that there is no attempt to market or distribute properly for the home market apart altogether from the export trade.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies mentioned the distribution of tractors.  I have no complaint to make about the distribution of the tractors that I know were given to people in Cork, with one exception.  I cannot suggest that there was any political discrimination, or anything like that in County Cork. In fact I know there was not because, in North Cork particularly, a strong supporter of mine got one.  That would end my complaint as far as that is concerned.  I did want to make one <Col N="652" /> complaint.  A neighbour of mine who has two threshing machines worked with tractors was anxious to get a new tractor this year because the tractor he had was an old model and was practically finished.  The Department are not in a position to give him a tractor at the moment and, at any rate, he was not a very early applicant and would have to wait his turn.  He informed me, but I have not had an opportunity of verifying by the evidence of my own eyes, that a tractor was issued to a certain co-operative creamery in North Cork last year and that that tractor is lying in a garage and has never been used.  I only got that information within the last two days and have not had an opportunity of verifying it, but I will give the Minister the full particulars of where this tractor is supposed to be lying.  Of course, if that is possible, it would mean that the Minister must do one thing.  It is not enough that the Department should allocate the tractors to the persons that they think will use them to the best possible advantage.  It is perfectly obvious that there must be some control of the tractors afterwards.  It is not good enough that any man or any society or any firm should get a tractor, which is imported at the moment with the greatest possible difficulty, and leave it to lie idle when everybody in the country is clamouring for the use of agricultural machinery.  The statement made to me in regard to this particular tractor was very strong.  I was told that it is lying in a garage in a town in North Cork and anyone who wants to see it can go there.  If that is found to be the case, the Minister should immediately take back the tractor and give it to somebody who will use it.</P>
    <P>The Minister, on the same page of the debates as his reference to tractors, mentioned line.  I have one great grievance about lime.  A private producer went to the trouble of developing as far as he could, out of his own resources, a very large limekiln that had been worked for a number of years in County Kerry. Apparently, it was some kind of trustee quarry and had not been worked very well for a number of <Col N="653" /> years.  This person went in there, when lime was very scarce a year or two ago, and started to work it himself. He made a very good job of it, under great difficulty, because he had to bring the lime a considerable distance. The Department, when they discovered that this man was able to make a success of that industry, immediately captured it and they put a body that is subsidised by the taxpayer of this country into possession of the quarry.  That body, subsidised by the taxpayers of this country, was put into open competition with this individual, who had to invest his own capital and labour.  The people to whom the Minister handed it over were the Dairy Disposals Company. I do not see any reason why a subsidised body like the Dairy Disposals Company should be allowed to do that.</P>
    <P>I can warn the Minister that in parts of the country there is agitation, to say the least of it, about the actions of certain co-operative societies.  I want to say that, as far as East Kerry and parts of North Cork are concerned, the gravest possible objection is being made to the Minister's permitting a body like the Dairy Disposals Company to enter into all kinds of trading. Years ago, as a result of very strong agitation from Fianna Fáil, when a number of creameries were taken over in North Cork and East Kerry and handed over to the Dairy Disposals Company, Fianna Fáil Deputies succeeded in getting a central creamery in Rathmore.  The people in Rathmore wanted it.  They were delighted with all the employment it would give there. The position now is that 90 per cent. of the people of Rathmore would be glad to see it out of the place, because the Dairy Disposals Company have gone into the operation of ordinary trading against the traders and shopkeepers of the village of Rathmore. They informed me that the day the Minister opened the new central creamery there he told them that would never happen.  I believe they have been in touch with the Minister about it.  Every Deputy who represents a rural constituency knows as well as I do that the hundreds of thousands of traders in this country are working <Col N="654" /> under difficulties enough already because of the fact that, through legislation, co-operative societies can compete against them with the advantage of 7/6 in the £ as regards income-tax. That is bad enough in the case of co-operative societies, but it is scandalous when the Dairy Disposals Company competes against them.  I would ask the Minister to see that, where the Dairy Disposals Company takes over creameries or opens branches, it will not engage in ordinary competitive trading.  I think it is a complete denial of the right to existence of the ordinary trader if the taxpayers' money is to be used against him in a village like Rathmore in order to put him out of business.</P>
    <P>In my submission, one of the reasons why the dairying industry is in such a bad position is that 90 per cent. of the big creameries are operating as large chain stores.  The people of West Cork and other constituencies know that, in the case of a number of big creameries, the dairying end is the smallest part of their business.  They are huge chain stores, like Lipton's, or Woolworth's, or Marks and Spencer in England.  If they lost the creamery business in the morning it would not matter a lot to them.  We hear complaints about the price of milk.  The State is blamed for the existing conditions; the dairying industry itself is blamed; everybody is blamed.  But I can never understand how it is that, when the price of butter is fixed and a large subsidy has to be paid to keep the price to the consumer down, those creameries which depend solely on their butter production are able to afford to expend the vast sums which they have been expending on building for the last three years.  They could not get it at the top, on the price of butter, so they must have got it on the price of milk.  Various co-operative societies around County Cork have so much money to spare at the moment that they are going into competition with the ordinary farmer in the buying of land.  Recently, a farm was sold outside Mallow.  Quite a number of farmers were anxious to buy it, but they were beaten to it by the Ballyclough-Mallow group of co-operative <Col N="655" /> societies, who paid £6,400 for it.  The same happened in other areas.  If the dairying industry is in the parlous condition in which it is supposed to be, how is it that those societies are making all this money?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Who are they getting the money from?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>They must be getting it from the farmer.  They could not get it out of the consumer at the moment, because the price of butter is fixed, and we have subsidised it, so they must be getting it out of the milk producer.  Is not that a perfectly obvious proposition?  Quite a lot of those vast sums that are going into building and into the purchase of farms must have been collected from the farmers.  That £6,400 would have been just as useful to the farmers who supply milk to those creameries if it was distributed to them in the form of an extra price for milk as it will be by enabling them to look at a model farm run by the creamery.  There appears to be a very general demand in the country&mdash;and no objection I think by any section of the community &mdash;for the payment of 1/- a gallon for milk during the summer months.  I regret that incidents happened which should not have happened, and which gave a very ugly tinge to this demand for an increased price for milk.  It is regrettable that they did happen, because they damaged a good cause.  I believe that our agricultural community would be quite satisfied with that 1/- a gallon.  There is another danger; again, the people on those benches there want to have the best of all possible worlds, because a little hint has crept in already that, if the Government accedes to the demand for 1/- a gallon, even that will not do.  A statement was made by Deputy O'Donnell in this debate last week, in which he described a conversation with a friend of his in Tipperary.  As reported at col. 328 of the Official Reports for last week, he said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Last week I was speaking to a neighbour and said that we were going to get 1/- a gallon for the <Col N="656" /> milk.  He said: &lsquo;What good is it; we want 1/1 or 1/3.&rsquo;  I can tell the Minister that he will not find people falling over one another to produce milk at 1/- a gallon.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>My submission is that there has to be some honesty about a demand like that.  I want to know from the people who must, to some extent, be held responsible for the wild statements that were made here and there, whether their demand for 1/- a gallon is a genuine one, or whether, as Deputy O'Donnell seems to suggest, they will say, if the demand for 1/- a gallon is acceded to: &ldquo;Now that we have the 1/- it will not do; we want 1/3&rdquo;?  I do not think any consumer in this country, either in the small towns or in the urban areas or in the cities, has any objection in the world to giving the farmers what they consider a reasonable return, and my submission is that 99 per cent. of the farmers are satisfied that 1/- a gallon is a reasonable price.  The type of argument put forward by Deputy O'Donnell is not going to get anybody anywhere.  It will not do any good to start another vicious circle; it is not right to make further demands just because something has been gained as a result of pressure.</P>
    <P>Deputy Halliden suggested that the demand for an increased price for milk is not political.  I know it is not; there is a general demand for it.  But I do not think that Deputy Halliden was quite justified when he suggested in his speech in Tralee that the very fine organisation of which he has been an able honorary secretary for a great number of years is not a political body&mdash;the Irish Dairy Shorthorn Breeders' Society.  I do not think it was a political body, but it is a political body now, and the fact that Deputy Halliden may claim that the honorary treasurer of it is an ex-Senator of the Fianna Fáil Party will not get over that.  I will go as far as suggesting that one of the reasons for all the wild statements made is that the only people at the meeting were either supporters of or had some slight connection with the Clann na Talmhan Party.  I will go as far as to say that a number of Deputies in this House&mdash;<Col N="657" /> I am not including myself as one of them, although I was often at the conference before&mdash;who are good dairy farmers, and who had a close connection with cow-testing associations and with the Dairy Shorthorn Breeders' Association, were not invited to the conference because when the plan of campaign for the agitation was being arranged they might have said things that would not have suited. I refer to Deputies Bennett and O'Donovan in particular.</P>

The only further reference I want to make to the matter is that the ex-president who was not invited was Senator Dr. Paddy Doyle.  It may have been a delegate meeting, but if it was it was the first time in history that it was a delegate meeting.  I make no further comment on that except that Deputy Halliden, in my own presence, did not give that excuse when challenged by one of these persons.

      <P>Apparently I am talking so effectively through my hat that <Col N="658" /> I have succeeded in clearing up a great many things.  It is perfectly obvious that if a society of that nature, which claims to be non-political and non-everything, is going to allow itself to become sectionalised, it will not be the advantage to the agricultural community that it otherwise could be.  The good that a cow-testing association could achieve would be very much minimised if the idea went out that there was any kind of sectional interest in the matter.  I am quite sure that there would be a very great objection on the part of a large body in the agricultural community if they felt that cow-testing associations and similar societies were being run in the interests of any political Party.  That is a development to my mind that would be very undesirable, and I am quite sure that Deputy Halliden, if he considers the matter, would not like to allow that idea to get abroad.</P>

      <P>I think it would be very hard on the society and would be very prejudicial to its good work if that idea did get abroad.  They cannot blame us as outsiders for taking that view.  We can only judge by what we read in the papers.  We may have our own private interpretations in certain matters but the ordinary person can only form an opinion from what he reads in the Press.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other matter connected with the dairy industry which I should like to mention.  It arises out of certain remarks made to me by a visitor from England who had an opportunity of seeing the system we have in operation here.  I am merely putting forward what he said to me.  He told me that in considerable parts of the south of England in areas where milk production is carried on at present, the system of delivery is quite different from that practised here.  The cows are milked, the milk is put into tankers, the tankers are put out and the lorry then comes along and takes them away.  He remarked that it seemed to him that the system of deliveries to creameries in operation in this country involved a great waste of <Col N="659" /> manpower and time.  To my mind when the post-war period arrives, and when normal transport is again available, one of the first things we shall have to consider in connection with the industry is the organisation of a better system of delivery to the creameries &mdash;from creamery to creamery and from district to district.  That may sound costly but the present system whereby a man comes along with his own horse and cart and spends three or four hours each day taking milk to the creamery represents the waste of a man and an animal every time he goes to the creamery.  I think that it would be quite feasible to bring about a better organisation of deliveries than is in operation at present.</P>
    <P>Deputy Halliden dealt in a very effective manner with the veterinary aspect of this Estimate, but I see one difficulty in his suggestion about having a veterinary surgeon attached to each co-operative society.  I can see the advantages of such a scheme&mdash;the fact of having a veterinary surgeon where he would be readily available in a particular district&mdash;but I do not see how the idea would work by merely attaching him to a co-operative society.  I think the Deputy suggested that the services of the veterinary surgeon could be given at a nominal fee to members of the society.  A difficulty would arise from the fact that there would be a number of farmers in that area who were not connected with any co-operative society and they would have to pay the full fee.  I think that the development of a veterinary science in this country will have to be carried out by the Department.  It will have to take advantage of the great strides in England and the United States in veterinary research.  It will also be necessary for the Department to allocate veterinary surgeons all over the country to centres where they will be readily available to everybody.  As regards the difficulties which farmers experience in having to send a long distance for a veterinary surgeon, very often the heavy costs incurred arise from the fact that a yet may have to hire a car, if it is a grave <Col N="660" /> case, to travel ten or 12 miles to do the job.  No matter how small the fee he charges for his services, the outlay on the hire of the car will impose a heavy burden on the farmer.</P>
    <P>The Minister made reference to the fact that certain people were putting worthless fertilisers on the market. He warned the farmers against such fertilisers in a broadcast a long time ago.  There is another matter to which I think the attention of the Minister should be drawn.  Some years ago certain specific cures for various diseases in cattle, such as abortion, were put on the market, with very glowing tributes from the makers in the advertisements about them.  They were very costly remedies and quite a number of farmers spent large sums of money on them, but these things were absolutely useless.  The difficulty was apparently that the law was not sufficiently strong to prevent the sale of that type of article and it did not allow the Minister to deal with these people in a proper way.  I shall just give an instance of how dangerous these alleged cures can be.  In one particular case, to my own personal knowledge, the manufacturers sold through their agent, who was going round the country as a sort of commercial traveller, a large quantity of the stuff to a farmer at a cost of £25. Not alone was this specific useless, but it did great injury to the cattle. The farmer, of course, had a legal remedy; he sured them in the ordinary courts for damages.  He got his damages all right, but the decree was not worth the paper it was written on because the company which had discovered this wonderful invention just disappeared when people got wise to them.  Not alone was the farmer at the loss of the money which he had expended on the medicine and the damage which had been done to his cattle, but he had to bear the costs of the legal proceedings.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should see that no specific cure of any kind dealing with ailments in cattle should be allowed to be advertised in the public Press of this country unless it has been examined by the veterinary branch of the Department and unless they are satisfied that it is at least <Col N="661" /> of some use.  It is bad enough to allow an article to be sold that is useless, but it is a terrible thing that people should be permitted to sell an article which is definitely harmful. The unfortunate feature of the matter is that the aggrieved parties have very little hope of recovering any damages or compensation for injuries to their stock.</P>
    <P>There is another matter with which I wish to deal in the hope of getting a satisfactory explanation from the Minister.  The position at the moment is that supplies can be imported only by certain firms.  Last year, there was an extraordinary situation.  A firm in North Cork, of which I have personal knowledge, always imported their seeds from some of the biggest seed merchants in England&mdash;Carter and Nutting.  These are not people who commenced to deal with these merchants when the emergency arose.  For 40 or 50 years, they had been directly importing seeds from them.  Last year, there was a great scarcity of turnip, mangold, and other kinds of root seeds.  Carter and Nutting wrote to this firm and said: &ldquo;We are prepared to supply you with all the turnip, man-gold and root seeds you require.&rdquo; Naturally, the firm was delighted to hear that and sent an order four times as large as they normally would.  The order reached England and the next thing the merchants received was a wire stating that, while the British Ministry of Agriculture was prepared to permit the export of these seeds, the Eire Minister for Agriculture would not give a licence to import them. That wire was confirmed by letter from the firm subsequently.</P>
    <P>There may be some good economic reason for having all the imported seeds come in through a particular body, but I cannot see why a firm which had always been engaged in trading in imported seeds should not be permitted to continue in that business. The net result of the attitude of the Department was that this country was at the loss of whatever weight of seeds that firm would have imported. The importation of seeds in that case could not have any effect on the market because the price was controlled. <Col N="662" /> While genuine traders like the firm to whom I have referred would not get licences to import, seed was creeping in in a mysterious way through other channels and was being offered at an extraordinary price.  The nearer you approached the North Pole, the more likely you were to get turnip or other seed and the more you were likely to pay for it.  The Department's attitude may have been effective in preventing ordinary traders from bringing in seed from England but, undoubtedly, seed could be purchased at five or six times the regular price through irregular channels. Recognised traders could not import seed, but it came in in some mysterious way and those who purchased it had to pay dearly.</P>
    <P>One matter that hits other sections than the agricultural community is the decline in the pig and poultry industries. That decline has, undoubtedly, affected the farmers, but it has also had great effect on other sections. Every country Deputy knows that two of the most valuable assets of the provincial town were its local pig market, held monthly or fortnightly, and the weekly market in butter, fowl, eggs and similar types of agricultural products. These markets have completely disappeared and they have been a very serious loss to the towns. I agree with Deputy Browne that, if we are to revive the pig industry, encouragement must be given by fixing minimum prices, so that people will know what they will obtain for their pigs.  For some time after control was taken off, prices went fairly high.  The number of pigs commenced to increase and now the curers are dropping the price when there are a few pigs about. That at a time when bacon is badly needed!  That is a peculiar method of encouraging pig production.  It would be hard to expect this country to go into pig and poultry production during the emergency, because we had not even maintained the normal position in respect of these products during the immediate pre-emergency period.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest drops in exports took place in pigs from 1931 to 1938. The value went down from £2,185,898 <Col N="663" /> to £220,649.  Not alone did that affect the actual producer but it affected an ever-widening circle, practically everybody depending on the agricultural community&mdash;the shopkeeper, the tradesman and the professional man. If the money which resulted from those industries is not floating around a particular district, neither I nor anybody else can get his cut out of it.  The same remark applies to the export of pork.  The value of our egg exports dropped by about £500,000 in the same period.  The loss suffered by the agricultural community and by other sections of the community in respect of those items alone is very great.  If we are to have a well-off countryside one of the things which will have to come back, with the bringing back of the poultry and pig industries, is the local market, where there was open competition. The more control and the more centralisation there are, the harder the producer will be hit in the long run.</P>
    <P>Everybody has referred to the question of agricultural wages.  Very few Deputies offered a solution of the problem.  They contented themselves with saying that the agricultural worker should be paid more.  I was about to refer to Deputy Cafferky but I shall not do so because, apparently, he has already been dealt with sufficiently by the deputy-leader of Clann na Talmhan.  In his innocence, Deputy Cafferky saw fit to make a statement for which his deputy-leader had to reprimand him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>On another occasion, it was also suggested by the Leader of the Party that the Deputy was misinterpreted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Vote on Account, I referred to Deputy Cafferky's statement that the agricultural worker was not being paid enough.  I said that everybody agreed that the agricultural worker should get the highest wage possible and I <Col N="664" /> went on to indicate that the lowly-paid worker in the small towns had to pay high rates and had to buy his milk and every other necessary.  I said that he was as badly off as the agricultural worker, who might have a labourer's cottage and a plot.  I asked Deputy Cafferky to indicate what he thought would be a reasonable rate of agricultural wage.  I do not say it in any critical way but everybody in this debate has taken the line that the farm labourer is badly paid.  That is merely lip-service unless there is some suggestion as to what he should get and how he can get it.  Although some of the farmers admit that they are now making money, they say that their net income from a reasonably-sized farm is very small.  Accepting their figures, I do not see how they can afford to pay more than they are paying.  Even those who say that their net income is very small, state in the same breath that the agricultural worker should be paid more.  Something must be wrong somewhere.  Somebody who claims to know all about the situation should indicate to us what rate of agricultural wages should be paid, and&mdash;if we are to accept the farmers' figures&mdash;how he proposes to enable the farmers to pay it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great deal hinges on the question of unemployment assistance in the rural areas.  The question arises whether or not something should be done to put those in receipt of such assistance working with farmers. Occasionally, people do get away with it&mdash;people who should be working with farmers but who are cute enough to register in some other capacity than farm workers.  For instance, if a fellow registers as a road worker, he is placed in a different schedule from that in which the ordinary farm worker is placed.  If I go to the exchange to look for a man for farm work, I will not be told about him.  I am sure that quite a number of such men would be farm labourers.  I would have a certain sympathy with a proposal to send them out to do farm work, if the farmers wanted them.  I have often felt that something could be done on these lines: a farmer can afford, say, to keep <Col N="665" /> two full-time men.  He might say: &ldquo;I am not able to afford a third man.&rdquo; If there was a man unemployed in the area and in receipt of unemployment assistance, could not the State send that man to the farmer, pay him his unemployment assistance and get the farmer to make up the difference between that and the agricultural wage?  I am quite sure that a lot of them would be satisfied to do that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Broderick suggested last night that something should be done to release some of our military to help in saving the harvest.  There is a very general demand for that all over the country, I think.  As a result of the experience of last year, due to the shortage of machinery and labour, people, naturally, are frightened, and, as Deputy Broderick has pointed out, there will be a terrific scarcity of agricultural labour during the coming harvest.  Now, a considerable proportion of the members of our Army are men who were born and reared on the land, and it appears to me that there is no reason in the world why such men should not be released for work on the farms for a short period at any rate, and so far as would be consistent with the interests of national security.  They could be allowed to go home to their own farms, their fathers' farms, or the farms on which they worked prior to joining the Army. I do not think there would be any real justification for refusing such a demand, because the greatest security we have at the moment is the fact that the farmers are doing their best to produce everything that they can produce. Our main line of defence is the food and fuel that is being produced by our farmers.  From that point of view alone, the Government should give every assistance to the farmers and enable them to get whatever labour or other facilities they require.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to say that I trust that even my digression into the work of the Irish Dairy Shorthorn Breeders' Society did not awaken any terribly hard feelings in Deputy Halliden's heart.  The Deputy, like a lot of people who come into this House for the first time&mdash;it happened to me when I first came here&mdash;has got <Col N="666" /> to learn to take the rough with the smooth.  In that connection, I might point out that other members of Clann na Talmhan, since they came into the House, have become very proficient in taking the rough with the smooth. Deputy O'Donnell took a little tipping-up-when he first came here, but he did not get cross or excited about it.  Everybody here knows that the only Deputy who will escape a dressing-down in this House is the Deputy who never says anything here&mdash;and that is generally because he has nothing to say.</P>

      <P>I would say to the members of every Party in this House that, no matter what our personal views may be with regard to the last Government or this Government, or no matter what points we may wish to score on in a debate, there will always be a certain amount of disagreement, even within the ranks of a particular Party; and it is a healthy thing that there should be such disagreement. There will always be members of Clann na Talmhan, or of any other Party, who will even disagree with the members of their own Parties on some particular point.  As one Deputy said last night, there is no use in the representative of one county trying to force his views down the throats of the representatives of the other 25 counties in the State.  The problems of one county may be very different from those of another county. The problems of County Kerry differ from those of County Cork; the problems of Meath are different from those of Louth; and the problems of County Monaghan will differ from those of other counties, even neighbouring counties.  At any rate, we will differ on detail; we will differ on principle; we will differ as regards policy. We will differ in many ways, but I am sure that there is one thing that all Parties in this House will agree upon &mdash;whether Labour, Independent, Clann na Talmhan, Farmers, Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael, or whether they represent urban or rural community&mdash;and that is <Col N="667" /> that the farmers of this country have made a magnificent response to the nation's request for food and fuel. That is one thing upon which the members of all Parties in the House are as one; and they are satisfied that, no matter whom they represent, everything possible should be done by the Government to give an adequate return to the farmers for their labour. We may differ in detail as to how that should be done, but we are all agreed that the farmers are undoubtedly due for a magnificent recompense, and I am sure that every encouragement will go out from this House to show that we do appreciate the magnificent efforts of the farmers and of the workers who stood side by side with them in the present emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not happen to be a farmer or a farmers' representative, nor have I had any experience of farming, but I venture to pass a few observations, in an important debate of this kind, because I represent a section which plays an important part so far as the economic make-up of the farming community, generally, is concerned, and that is the consuming and purchasing public.  References have been made previously to the debate as a whole.  May I say that I have followed it with very great interest so far as the time at my disposal would permit? I know that other members, similarly situated as I was and with the same experience, have expressed themselves to the same effect: that it has been a most useful and interesting debate.  I think that a very high compliment has been paid to our primary and major industry by the fact that this debate has occupied such an extraordinary length of time.  Some people have described the time devoted to it as inordinate, but I do not think that that is quite correct.  I venture to say that if the Minister, who has been a careful listener, will assimilate even half the suggestions that have been made, or, more important still, if he will implement them, we will see this country as one of the most prosperous agricultural countries in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="668" /> There is, however, this much to be said: that I am afraid there is one aspect, in any case, which will set a limitation so far as the Minister himself is concerned, and it is one that concerns my colleagues on these benches.  I am sorry to say that sufficient attention has not been given to the possibilities of the home market. I would say that the major portion of the debate has been centred around the possibilities of our export markets. We recognise the value of our export market, but I venture to suggest that there is a very large gap to be filled here at home, close to the farmers' doors, which will bring them at least that measure of comfort and compensation for their labours to which they are entitled.  In that respect I venture to say that the Minister has limitations, because it will not be possible for a Minister for Agriculture to undo the position of unemployment which is responsible for such a large section of our people not being in a position to purchase the commodities produced on the farms.  The Minister can only take responsibility in that respect as one individual in his Government as a whole.  Unless that position is put right and unless sufficient organisation and thought are put behind the possibilities of what can be done to put thousands of our people in a position to buy these products, then I venture to say that we shall be listening to the same debates on agriculture, even over such an extended period as that in which we have been listening to this debate here for the last four or five days; without getting the things which our farmers desire and which they certainly need.</P>
    <P>There is another observation I should like to make, just as one in the position I have already indicated. One of the great indictments of the work of the Department over the period not of the past ten years, but of the past 20 years, is the haphazard and unregulated manner in which marketing is conducted.  One commodity referred to by our friends on the right&mdash;there is a motion down in connection with it&mdash;furnishes an example.  I refer to milk.  Our friends, the farmers, believe that they would be getting an exceedingly good <Col N="669" /> price for their milk if they were getting 1/- a gallon.  Here, in the City of Dublin, milk is being retailed at 3/- a gallon.  On various occasions I have seen such a simple commodity as cabbage being brought into the city from the County Dublin in the early hours of the morning.  I have been sufficiently curious to inquire as to the return to the producer for that cabbage.  I ascertained that, on the average, a head of cabbage would return to the producer about 1/2d.  I saw the same cabbage being retailed in our shops later that day, or the following day, at 3d., 3½d. or 4d. per head.  It would be interesting to those of us who do not understand these peculiar mysteries to ascertain precisely where that wide margin of profit goes, why it is that the producers are being cheated of that money and that the consumers are being forced to pay exorbitant prices.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of agriculture of which I have a little personal experience and in which I am particularly interested.  Most of the members of this House, despite the fact that they have no actual farming experience, have their roots in the soil. They have been, perhaps, born and reared in towns adjacent to the countryside and, inevitably, they have got some knowledge of the farmer's setup. Over a period of 20 years, I have gone, with my family, to a humble cottage on a small farm&mdash;just under 15 acres.  My farmer-friends will know what the type of that farm is when I say that it would be locally referred to as &ldquo;the place of three cows.&rdquo;  I have lived the life of the people there for a period in each of the 20 years. What struck me, particularly, was that there was absolutely no advance in the ordinary life of those people during that period.  A section of that little farm is allotted to tillage and another is devoted to the grazing of the three cows to which I have referred. Obviously, the soil must be impoverished over the years.  The persons concerned have no means at their disposal to enrich it with fertilisers or manures.  They rely on the sale of their three calyes or yearlings for their income and, if disaster should overcome <Col N="670" /> them by the death of one of these animals&mdash;well, then, it is just too bad for the family.</P>
    <P>I was curious enough to inquire on one occasion how precisely that family fared at the end of the year.  Two boys and a widowed mother were running that little farm.  The two boys were extremely good so far as tillage was concerned.  They raised a good crop of potatoes and sold cabbage plants to the farmers around.  That, with the money received from the sale of the little butter available after their own requirements had been supplied and the money obtained from the sale of the three yearlings or calves, represented the income of the family.  As against that, they had to meet their annuity, their rates and other commitments and they were merely trying to keep their heads above water.  Frankly, I discovered that they were living an extremely dull and drab life.  If the people in charge of the Department were doing their duty during the past 20 years, I find it hard to believe that these small holders&mdash;they might be described as cottiers&mdash;would be in practically the same position to-day as they were 20 years ago.  There were changes in and out through the years.  Things went better for them one year as contrasted with another year.  That was particularly so in respect of the two items just mentioned by Deputy Linehan.  When it was possible for them to turn their attention intensively to poultry-keeping and pig-rearing, there was prosperity in that little home.  But those industries have dwindled&mdash;particularly during the past three or four years.</P>
    <P>Here, I should like to pay a personal tribute to the work of the small-holders of Cavan&mdash;where I spent a couple of years.  In no county that I know of in Ireland is there a better yield from hard labour on a small farm about the 15-acre mark than there is in that particular county.  I strongly advise the Minister to give this very large section of our community&mdash;these smallholders number thousands&mdash;the attention which the Department can give them.  Time was when the advice of the Department was not acceptable throughout the country generally.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="671" /> Our farmers were regarded as conservative people, but that day is changing. Our farmers are now more responsive to expert, scientific advice. To improve the economic lot of the small holders along the seaboard it should be possible to continue&mdash;but not in a haphazard way&mdash;the development of ancillary industries such as those appertaining to kelp, carrageen and fisheries, generally.</P>
    <P>In the district of which I have spoken I have seen the kelp industry flourishing one season and flopping the next season.  The labour of the unfortunate people during the spring, and sometimes during the winter, went for naught because there was no market for kelp.  I understand that the position has been better in that respect recently&mdash;particularly, during the past three or four years.  My final suggestion in connection with these small-holders is that they should receive all the assistance possible to develop these two sidelines&mdash;poultry-keeping and pig-rearing&mdash;and as far as possible the other industries to which I have referred.  Otherwise, we shall have a position such as that which has obtained over the past ten years.  It should be possible, too, as an indication of the advance of the Department itself, to set up in every county, or in several areas in each county, a model or demonstration farm.  That has been suggested by my Clann na Talmhan friends and I compliment them on the suggestion.  A small farm of that type should be set up in the various areas to indicate to our small farmers to what extent it is possible for them, when proceeding on scientific lines, to ensure that their work will bring adequate reward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Driscoll</NameTxt>
      <P>This discussion has gone on for a number of days and so many Deputies have spoken on the different aspects of agriculture that there is very little more to be said, but, as a new member of the House, I should like to offer my congratulations to all the Deputies who have spoken.  I was very pleased indeed to see that the debate was taken so seriously, that each Deputy gave his views in a very fair manner and that <Col N="672" /> there was no bitterness.  Agriculture is one of our main industries, and I know that every member of the House realises and recognises that fact.  That, however, has been stressed enough already, and I propose to confine my remarks, as I intend them to be brief, to matters affecting my own constituency.</P>
      <P>Listening last week to the Minister's speech, one would think that the farmers were very prosperous.  I am sorry to say that that is not so in the case of the small farmer or, at least, the small farmers living in my constituency.  We have heard a lot about the price of milk being 1/- a gallon.  I have spoken to many farmers in my own district and they tell me that the price they are getting at present and were getting during the winter months is from 10d. to 11d. per gallon, and not 1/-.  I have seen one creamery book and, on a test of 3.5 butter fat, the price paid for the month of January was a little over 11d. &mdash;to be exact, 11.1d.</P>
      <P>In that district, the average farmer has six or seven cows.  He has to build up a little herd and the produce of that little herd is practically all he has to fall back on.  At one time it was different&mdash;before the hard times set in.  The pig-feeding industry was a very important industry, as was the poultry industry, in that part of the country.  The pig industry has disappeared and the poultry industry is not as flourishing as it should be.  It is naturally a poor district, a remote district, and the pig-feeding and poultry industries were very suited to the area, which is wild and mountainous. The land is bad and the soil poor, but you can feed a pig or rear a hen as well as can be done in the Golden Vale, if you have the feeding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The economic war, however, played havoc with these industries and the small farmers down in that district have not yet recovered from the effects of that war.  Milk production is the only industry they now have to fall back on, and, in asking for 1/- per gallon for milk in times like these, we are merely asking for a price which will enable these people to carry on until there is a chance to restore the <Col N="673" /> pig-feeding and poultry industries which were so suited to the district.</P>
    <P>We are not asking for too much when we ask for 1/- per gallon.  We realise the condition of other people. We understand that if this country is to pull through this emergency&mdash;we are all anxious that it should, and we are united in helping to pull the country through&mdash;the generations who come after us will also benefit, and it is only fair to ask these people who will benefit in future years to bear a share of the burden.  We do not want to put up the price of butter on the poor people who have to buy it, but there is a way of meeting that position. If the burden were even passed on to the national debt, future generations would gladly accept their obligations.</P>
    <P>I listened with great interest and pleasure to the different Deputies who spoke and I did not hear any Deputy speak seriously against this demand for an increased price.  I am sure that if any Deputy did speak against it, he did not really understand the position of the farmers and especially the small farmers who are trying to produce the butter.  The Minister said that in 1939, milk was 5.4d. per gallon, but in 1939 or 1940, figures were put before the Minister showing that the cost of producing milk at that time was 8½d. per gallon.  These figures were collected by Professor Murphy in Cork, who went to the trouble and expense of going out amongst the farming community and finding their costings.  He established beyond contradiction that the cost of production of a gallon of milk was 8½d., when the farmers were compelled to sell it at a little over 5d. How could these farmers survive? How could they have money?  I am aware that this year there is a bigger number applying to the Cork County Council for loans for the purchase of seed than applied last year.  Is that a sign of prosperity?  I am only sorry that the Minister's statement was not correct in relation to my part of the country.</P>
    <P>I am very interested in the cow-testing movement, but, for some reason I cannot understand, our dairy <Col N="674" /> heards have not gone forward in production in the last 40 years as they should have.  I think the Department of Agriculture was established about 40 years ago.  The type of cow which was giving milk before its establishment was a better producer of milk than the cows we have at present.  I honestly admit that stores were not as good, but the cows 40 years ago were better milkers than those we have at present.  I am anxious that the cow-testing movement should make headway, but it is not making the headway it should make.  The fact that it is not making headway is in no way due to the supervisors in the dairying counties.  They are hard-working, industrious and energetic young men who know their job.  I place the blame on the Minister, because he is paying these cow-testing supervisors a miserably small wage.  Men cannot work for a starvation wage.</P>
    <P>What I have stated about the price being paid for milk in West Cork&mdash; that the farmers were not getting 1/- per gallon&mdash;was borne out here yesterday by Deputy Heskin from Waterford. He had the same story as I have&mdash;that in Waterford they are not getting 1/- per gallon.</P>
    <P>One Deputy called for the introduction of compulsory cow-testing.  This Party would not agree to that.  We have had experience of that for 20 years and we do not want any more interference from the Government.  If cow-testing supervisors were paid a fair salary farmers might be induced to become members of these associations, as ultimately they would benefit from them.  I do not agree with Deputy Corry that Friesian cows would be good milkers or be suitable for small farmers.  During this debate many suggestions were made to the Minister concerning the improvement of agriculture, and it is possible that some good will come from them.  Milk production has gone down.  I received a letter from one of the biggest creameries in West Cork, which has 1,500 suppliers, and the views expressed in that letter indicate that if the price of milk is not kept at 1/- per gallon there would be a further reduction <Col N="675" /> in milk supplies.  I know many farmers who have reduced their herds. It is no pleasure to any farmer to have to reduce his stock because it often takes a lifetime to build up a good herd of cattle.  A farmer who has to sell his cattle does so from necessity and not from choice.  I urge on the Minister the necessity to do everything possible to encourage that industry. The same applies to pigs and poultry. I heard many complaints during the winter months about the scarcity of oil in farm-houses.  Deputies will understand how difficult it is for people to look after their cattle in the dark.  I admit that the Minister for Supplies did his best to provide supplies, but even candles were not procurable in parts of my constituency.</P>
    <P>I received numerous complaints from beet growers.  Those who grow the crop are supposed to receive £4 a ton for beet, but the sugar content must reach a percentage of 17.5.  It is only on very good land that the percentage reaches 17.5.  Owing to the lack of fertilisers that output is reduced. In England, I am informed that the percentage required is 15.5. Those who grow beet here are in a similar position to those who are producing milk.  Milk producers are supposed to get 1/- a gallon and beet growers are supposed to get 80/- a ton but they do not get these amounts.  I had complaints from a number of flax growers about the delay that occurs in getting flax scutched.  I understand that the millers are not to blame.  I do not know where the remedy lies, but I ask the Minister to give his attention to that question.  I admit that those who complained have only grown flax in recent years, and that people who had been growing the crop regularly should get first preference at the scutch mills.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that books dealing with agriculture should be introduced into the country schools.  Books of that kind would help to make the children more interested in the land.  When I was going to school there was a standard work by Professor Baldwin which was popular with the children.  I know that it had a good influence on those <Col N="676" /> who were remaining on the land, because it taught them how to sow crops and contained useful knowledge about the nature of the soil.  The Order Paper contains a motion suggesting that steps should be taken to provide grants to expand agricultural production and to enable farmers to build suitable houses for their workers.  The Government should take steps to prepare for the position that will arise when the war ends because farmers will then be confronted with many problems.  One of these will be the restoration of the fertility of the soil, the replacement of machinery and the repairing of houses and out-offices.  I do not believe that small farmers will have much capital at their command when the war ends, because their overhead expenses are now higher than ever.  The farm improvements scheme is a good one and the Minister is to be congratulated on introducing it.  I wish the Government could see its way to extend that scheme for the construction of farm building, cow-houses and piggeries.</P>
    <P>One of the principal things needed for the successful production of pigs and poultry is to have good clean houses for them.  Cowhouses in good condition will help in the production of clean milk.  Take the case of a man who has five, ten or 50 cows and sends his milk to the creamery.  He is getting a 1/- a gallon for it to-day.  The Minister for Agriculture told us that that man was getting 5½d. a gallon for it a few years ago although we know it was costing him 9d. a gallon to produce it.  If that man has to replace one or two of his cows he will have to compete in the open market for them against men who are getting 2/- or 3/- a gallon for their milk.  These are the conditions that exist in the country to-day as I know from my own personal experience.  I think the Minister should weigh well the facts that have been put before him by the different Deputies.  I feel certain that if a motion was brought before the House in support of what we have been urging it would get universal support. Therefore, if the Minister does not feel that he is able to do something to save our greatest industry&mdash;the keystone of all other industries&mdash;I suggest to him that he ought to clear out of <Col N="677" /> the job and let some other man face the situation.</P>

      <P>This has been a very interesting debate and has gone on for a long time.  I have been encouraged to enter into it by reason of the fact that farming is my occupation in life. I was brought up to it.  In my young days my father gave me the opportunity of studying farming conditions. I think it would be a good thing if all members of the agricultural community had the opportunity of expressing their views in a debate of this kind, because the more we know of the conditions of agriculture in the various counties&mdash;the ups and the downs and difficulties of the industry&mdash;the better it will be for all of us.  At this period in the year 1944, surrounded as we are by this great emergency, we have reason to be thankful to God for the unification of effort that we find is behind the Irish farmer.  In that atmosphere we should settle down and examine in more generous detail the business of farming.</P>
      <P>A number of speakers have given quotations from various periodicals. Some have gone outside the country to get their quotations from farming and other publications.  Any quotations that I propose to give to the House will be from the reports of our own able agricultural instructors.  I believe that, in paying a well deserved tribute to the instructors we have in every county&mdash;those men who are just touching the fringe of our young agriculturists of the future&mdash;we are only doing them justice.  Thank God we have in this country a team of agricultural educators in our agricultural instructors.  They are in every county and are equal to the best in any country.  Their efforts merit generous backing along co-operative lines such as we find has taken place in highly organised countries like Denmark. The example of those countries is often quoted for us here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose, as I have said, to quote from journals relating to our own country. I have before me the annual report for the year 1943 relating to the operations and schemes of instruction in agriculture carried out in my <Col N="678" /> own county of Laoighis.  The agricultural instructor there has rightly prefaced his report with what he describes as &ldquo;Targets for 1944&rdquo;.  I am giving these extracts so that they may appear on the records of the House, and I hope that farmer-Deputies&mdash;indeed, all Deputies whether from country or town and no matter what their occupation&mdash;will read them.  Thank God, we are all united behind the leader of the country.  All Parties are definitely united for the preservation of our neutrality.  The one big organisation that is behind our Army and auxiliary forces is that which is composed of the farmers.  It is the fighting force on the food production front and must aim at a 100 per cent. effort this year.  Under the heading &ldquo;Targets for 1944&rdquo; the report says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Speaking of the Irish small farmer a well-known Irishman of a few years since stated:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;At the worst he need never starve; he can feed himself and his family on the produce of his fields. At the best he has an inheritance which all other classes may envy him&mdash;a home of his own secure to himself and to his children's children, buttressed against attack and victualled like a fortress.&rsquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A fortress may be carried by assault or may be reduced by starvation through cutting off supplies. Our supplies have been in great part cut off since 1939 and since then the farmers have been appealed to, from pulpit and platform, to produce our essential needs of wheat and minimum requirements of animal food. These appeals have not fallen on deaf ears.  In each of 1940, 1941 and 1942 there has been a notable increase in the previous acreage devoted to the production of food crops, but, even still, 1943 shows that there is still leeway to make up, that we do not actually produce more than 75 per cent. of what wheat we use, that our production of animal food cereals falls far short of what is required to make good our loss of imports of these, and that we are not yet economically independent of outside sources of supply.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="679" />&ldquo;Our target for 1944 ought to be: wheat, 40,000 acres; barley, 20,000; oats, 20,000 acres; potatoes, 15,000 acres.  No Irishman and, certainly no Irish farmer, ought to need reminding of the fact that not quite 100 years ago millions of our fellow countrymen died from starvation and tens of thousands from following pestilences.  At that time we had the excuse that outside interference prevented us using our national resources to their fullest extent, but to-day no such excuse will hold good.  If famine and pestilence follow they will be truly of &lsquo;home manufacture&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I was sorry the other night to hear a member of this House&mdash;I do not want to mention a name because I dislike tactics of that kind in public speaking &mdash;criticising the important work which the farmer has to do during the emergency. The Deputy referred to wheat growing as &ldquo;suicide and insanity&rdquo;, &ldquo;mad and insane&rdquo;, &ldquo;the same folly re-enacted&rdquo;, &ldquo;to grow wheat on any land is extravagant folly&rdquo;, &ldquo;no sensible farmer would grow wheat&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am old enough to have 30 years' experience, and in my young days my father produced wheat eight years out of every ten, and I believe, whether there is an emergency or not, that the majority of the farmers&mdash;there may be some exceptions in parts of the country&mdash;can grow half an acre of wheat each year for their own needs.  The larger farmers can grow even more than the 10 per cent. which the Government, acting through the Minister for Agriculture, has found it necessary to require for the coming cereal year.  There was a lot of talk about wheat growing and about forcing the farmers to grow wheat, &ldquo;ruining the fertility of the land,&rdquo; and so on.  This is the first year the Minister forced anyone to grow wheat. Up to now farmers were only advised to grow wheat, and nothing but stark necessity forced the Minister to make sure that come what may, our future supplies of bread and flour will be produced from Irish soil and will carry us up to the 1945 harvest.</P>
    <P>It is not fair that any selfish farmer <Col N="680" /> should think more about the fertility of his farm than the lives of brave Irish sailors.  It has often been pointed out that the shipping space of the ships which cross the ocean at great risk is more necessary for the carrying of materials other than wheat, which we can produce in this country for ourselves.  This is the last quotation I will give you from the book&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorry</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  It is a very short one, but I will bow to your ruling.  As I have said, on the six weeks ahead will depend how our granaries will be filled and our foodstuffs ensured up to the harvest of 1945.  I am satisfied, from experience, that the farmers of this country are realising at last how necessary it is, but there are some of them who are still far too selfish.  I am not ashamed to say that, because I know farmers whose land is perfectly suitable for wheat yet, last year, because of the more attractive price offered for oats, they selfishly reduced their acreage under wheat and turned over to oats to get extra money.  I hope no such thing will occur this year, and that, instead of putting in the bare essential to comply with the Minister's Order, they will be generous and grow more than the required minimum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great deal of play has been made in this debate with agricultural wages and conditions.  I am sorry that the word slavery is so much associated with Irish agriculture.  When people try to brand our workers as being subject to slavery, let us remember that the working farmer and his sons work side by side with the workers in the field.  We all have done it, and surely when people talk and indulge in propaganda about raising wages in Irish agriculture, they must remember that man against man, head against head, the Irish farmer's son and the working farmer himself are equally entitled to a £3 a week wage if a £3 a week wage is said to be necessary for Irish agricultural work.  It is grand to hear all this talk about the raising of standards <Col N="681" /> but, before it is done, I think we ought to face the problems.</P>
    <P>There is one big thing needed in laying out our food programme.  We want to get a proper type of farm costings so that we will know where we stand. I do not wish to take up time at this stage of the debate by going into details of the costings of an average working farmer with 40 or 50 acres and the income he derives from the production of grain.  Take the case of a mixed tillage farm worked by a father, two sons and two agricultural workers. The two workers start at the minimum wage, and here is where we make a mistake again.  A lot of people are talking about &ldquo;a miserable £2 a week.&rdquo;  My experience is that there may be selfish farmers who look upon £2 as a maximum wage and not as a minimum wage, and cut their cloth according to that.  All over the country there are various perquisites common to agricultural workers as defined under the Agricultural Wages Act.  To go back to the case of the 50 or 60 acre farm where the farmer and his sons are working side by side with two agricultural workers, those workers will get over £100 each out of the income the farmer will get from his crops.  In other words, it often happens that every penny that came in from the grain available for sale from such a farm had to be devoted to the payment of those agricultural workers for the whole year.</P>
    <P>A goodly portion of the oats and barley on a mixed tillage farm must be retained for feeding the farm animals, and certain quantities of wheat and oats are necessary for the making of oatmeal and wholemeal. Before people talk wildly on this subject, I would like to see them examining it more closely.  I would gladly produce figures which would show that instead of £1 or 25/- that goes to the able-bodied worker who is fed with his farmer employer, the two sons I have referred to would not have 10/- a week to get at the end of the year if the farmer made up his accounts for every month.  I agree, and every fair-minded man will agree, that the farming industry has improved.  I am sure that nobody grudges that to the farmer, <Col N="682" /> because he has been through very many vicissitudes.  The better off the farming community, the greater the benefit to all sections in this country. A common interest lies between our farmers and farm workers.  It would be a bad day for the country if that co-operation which should and which does exist between right-thinking farmers and their workers, ceased to exist.  It would be a bad day if anyone intervened to injure that co-operation, because the interests of those people are definitely interlocked and they stand to gain rather than to lose by that co-operation being maintained.</P>
    <P>We want increased production all along the line at the present time. As regards the vexed question of milk prices, I am satisfied that a lot could be done by the development of cow-testing. I have had experience of cow-testing and I know what good it can do.  I think that anyone who examines the matter must agree that, by raising the standard of our milch cows even by 100 gallons, and converting that into butter, it would be a decided advantage to the persons concerned and to the country.</P>
    <P>On the important subject of tillage, speaking as a tillage farmer I believe we will have to give more attention to that part of our farms which of necessity is devoted to grass land.  I am satisfied, from some small experiments of my own, and from watching what is being done elsewhere, that a big improvement can be effected in the feeding of our cow herds and young stock if we would only give as much attention to that part of our farms devoted to grazing as we do to the part devoted to rotational crops.  I grant you that, at the moment, the shortage of artificials represents a difficulty, but even without them I know farmers who are doing excellent work in the reseeding of their farms, ploughing them up and seeding them down again.</P>
    <P>In lots of ways the quality of our grazing lands could be improved.  I know it cannot be done all at once.  I believe if the grazing lands all over the country were carefully looked after over a period of, say, ten years, the farmer doing a little each year, the results would be very pleasing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="683" /> This year, too, I think the Department would be well advised to develop their valuable policy of encouraging farmers to erect silos and go in more extensively for the production of ensilage.</P>
    <P>Ensilage means putting grass, which is a complete food for live stock, into cold storage against a lean period when food may be scarce.  If the farmers, and particularly the dairy farmers, had a big supply of grass stored in silos for the winter months and the early months of spring, we would find a big improvement in our milk production.</P>
    <P>On the much-debated question of reducing our soil fertility by the overgrowing of wheat, I think a farmer would be a foolish man if he grows wheat or oats or barley in the same land year after year.  I have seen many failures of oat crops and barley crops because of successional growings, just as many as I have seen in wheat crops.  That was really overdone, but I think the tendency of the future will be that unless the farmer can get his winter wheat sown under proper conditions, there will be big sowings of spring wheat.  I am glad to note that our cereal experts on the experimental farm at Glasnevin are bringing out varieties of wheat best suited to our climatic and soil conditions.  The Irish farmers must pay tribute to the varieties that have been produced there and that are now on the market for their benefit.</P>
    <P>I suggest that it is our duty to stand behind the county committees of agriculture this year in the food drives that they, and such bodies as parish councils, have initiated.</P>
    <P>Some speakers have dealt with the desirability of increasing our poultry and egg exports, apart from producing for the home market.  It is essential in the coming cereal year that every farmer, when he threshes, should earmark a certain quantity of his grain and not be influenced by anyone to part with it.  He will need it to feed to his live stock, his pigs and poultry, from May to the harvest of 1945.  When summer arrives we usually find all over <Col N="684" /> the country that fowl are only half fed.  If the owners of the fowl had grain stored on the loft or somewhere around the farmstead, egg production would not fall as it usually does in the summer-time.  Now that the Department is assuring us there is a market for us, I think that advice is sound.  I think that if a farmer would grow an entra half acre of oats to feed his poultry and an extra half acre of barley to mix with the oats and potatoes as a feeding for his pigs, our production in both those directions would increase appreciably.</P>
    <P>Turf plays an important part in the lives of the agricultural community. In most parts of the country we depend on turf as a fuel.  We have a certain amount of timber on every farm, but turf is the really essential fuel.  Now is the time to make preparations for turf-cutting and every Irish farmer who has turbary should aim at having his turf cut and dried under the summer sun in mid-June.</P>

      <P>Some speakers have referred to the need for extra facilities for agricultural education.  I agree that that is essential and that every section of the community should support the Government, particularly the Minister for Agriculture, in promoting agricultural training.  While we have a few valuable agricultural colleges and stations which are doing their work well, there is still room for extending the scope of agricultural education so as to embrace all the young farmers, because not one-tenth of the farmers' sons have an opportunity of receiving anything in the way of secondary education in agriculture except through the medium of lectures from the agricultural instructors or a <Col N="685" /> winter class, and the agricultural instructors cannot get round the county sufficiently quickly to cover the whole subject at one or two winter classes.</P>
      <P>I believe that extra money will have to be devoted to preparing some of the young men in our universities so that they will be thoroughly qualified to impart agricultural education to the young farmers of to-morrow, because in the post-war world you will find that there will be a keener fight for existence and that the methods of the past will not do.  Let no one think that any class of man can carry on farming.  That idea has been prevalent, but I think it has been exploded at last.  If you want to encourage the best young men in the country to stay on the land and be the future farmers, they must get equal opportunities with their brothers who have chosen some profession as a source of livelihood.  It is their right to get as good a chance of training in their future occupation as those who follow any other occupation or profession. Therefore, I am glad that there are certain developments taking place. I know that the Minister is fully alive to the position, and I would ask all our farmers to study the position carefully before they criticise too severely, because I do not think that some of the criticism which has been hurled against the agricultural colleges was deserved.</P>
      <P>In the journal issued by the Department of Agriculture for the last quarter there is a very valuable article dealing with an agricultural college at Warrenstown, County Meath.  That article is well worthy of being read by those genuinely interested in agriculture. It deals with the wide variety of subjects that have to be taught as part of the general training of a farmer. Those who read that article will willingly support the Minister in any claims he may have to put up in the future to the Department of Finance in aid of agricultural education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to draw the Minister's attention to a couple of matters which I think are worthy of notice.  In my district, and in other parts of the Midlands, there is already this spring a notable scarcity of agricultural <Col N="686" /> workers.  I do not like the idea of any Irishman saying that agricultural workers are driven out of their own country.  That is not true.  Any men who left the country left voluntarily. We are sorry that men who were engaged in the building and other trades had to leave.  But I know the conditions in the rural parts of the country and I know that a large number of men should not have left these parts in our hour of need, attracted away by better wage conditions on the other side of the Channel.  They should not have gone.  An agricultural worker who is single, without dependents, who can get plenty of food and clothing and who has a wage of £1 or 25/- has no reason to quit his own country in our hour of need.  In districts where labour is needed, I am wondering whether we could not avail of some scheme whereby, during the summer time, and particularly in the harvest, groups of workers from districts on the western seaboard, who used to migrate to English and Scottish districts, could not be encouraged, in view of the extra labour required to save our crops this year, to go to these districts which need them.  Provision could be made for housing them in halls or other places for two or three months and they would be there on the spot to be employed by farmers who may require them.  That is an idea which has occurred to me.  Something will have to be done, because this harvest every sheaf of corn will need to be harvested properly.  It is up to all of us to cooperate in finding ways and means of making a success of what I hope will be a bountiful harvest.</P>
    <P>The other matter to which I want to draw the Minister's attention is, whether it would be possible this year to have the application forms for the farm improvements scheme available over a slightly longer period than last year; in other words, if it would be possible to receive applications a month earlier than last year, with the closing period about the same time. Last year, when farmers were busy, they overlooked the time for making applications, even though the Department cannot be blamed, because they advertised the scheme extensively in all the provincial papers.  A farmer <Col N="687" /> may not have seen the papers or may have been too busy and the period had expired before he applied.  I think it would be an advantage if the period were extended.</P>
    <P>The last point to which I wish to refer is of importance this year.  I think it would require the co-operation of the Department of Supplies.  Sufficient oil should be earmarked to make sure that the threshings can be carried out next harvest.  Only a percentage of our threshing is now done by steam threshers.  A large number of farmers, particularly in the new tillage districts, have not yet developed the proper technique in stacking corn to withstand the winter, and it is essential that such corn should be threshed as early as possible.  Therefore, I think it is necessary that sufficient reserves of oil should be kept for threshing purposes.</P>

      <P>I could not allow this opportunity to pass without paying tribute, on behalf of those whom I represent, to our farmers.  This is the sixth day of this discussion, which has been a very interesting one.  I listened to practically all the speeches and nobody could say that one hour has been wasted.  All the speeches have been interesting and educational.  My principal duty, on behalf of those whom I represent, is to pay tribute to the farmers who have supplied our needs by producing food for us.  We are deeply grateful.  It is rather surprising to find such a difference between the price the producer gets for his produce and the price the consumer, especially in the towns and cities, pays.  One wonders where that difference goes. It appears that the farmer does not get sufficient for his produce. Our complaint in Dublin City is that those who have small incomes have to pay too much for their goods.  I hope something will be done to find a happy medium so that the farmers will get a reasonable profit and those with small incomes and large families will get food supplies at a reasonable price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join with others in expressing the hope that the acreage required will be filled.  There are only four or five weeks left for the country to answer the appeal made by the Taoiseach and <Col N="688" /> others.  I hope the acreage that is short will be made up.  It is rather alarming to read in our newspapers these constant appeals for further increases in the acreage, without having any knowledge that the appeals are being satisfactorily answered.  One Deputy, I think it was Deputy Gorry, said that he is aware of the fact that there are some farmers who have not played the game, and who have not tilled all that they could, while others have done their share and more than their share.  I wish to pay tribute to those who have done their share, and have done it well.  I say that we are deeply grateful to them.  Deputy Gorry gave us food for thought.  He complained that there were men leaving the country who had no right to leave, and he said that 25/- a week&mdash;whether he meant as pocket money or wages, I do not know&mdash;was sufficiently attractive to keep them at home.  He was referring to the young, single men. Twenty-five shillings a week is not an attraction to a man who feels that he should have a home and wife and family of his own.  When farming is made sufficiently attractive to encourage young men to remain on the land, when conditions on the land are such that he can fulfil his ambition of having a home and family of his own, then we will all agree that the position of farming is satisfactory, but not until then.  I suggest with other Deputies that there should be better wages for farm workers, more attractive conditions, and less dullness.  Country life might be improved by the provision by the Government or the local authority of a local hall, some place of amusement, some amenities that will make life more attractive than it is at the moment.  We used to hear that all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.  There are no Jacks in this country to-day, but I would say the same thing applies generally to Séamus, Seán and Tomás.  I believe that they are entitled to their amusements and to time off, just as anybody else.  If country life could be made attractive, we might not have so many people drifting from the country into the cities, and, unfortunately, being unemployed in the cities, competing in a market that is already overcrowded. <Col N="689" /> I am not saying that we do not welcome them.  We earnestly hope that, when industry is in full swing in the towns and cities, work will be found for all, and if there is not sufficient work on the land to keep the rural workers employed, that their services will be utilised in the towns and cities.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to milk and milk prices.  Milk is a very essential food and at the present price of milk in Dublin a very large proportion of our population cannot afford to buy it.  At the moment I think the Corporation School Meals Committee is the biggest purchaser of milk in Dublin City.  Thanks to the Government and thanks to the efforts of the corporation in the City of Dublin, we are now providing close on 40,000 children with one-third of a pint of milk per day and we are prepared to supply more if the Government will graciously assist us and pay their 50 per cent. quota in connection with any future supplies that we may want.  I believe many more schools will apply for the milk and, with the assistance of the Government, we will be able to give them the milk for the benefit of the health of the children.  I do say it would be grossly unfair if the Government were to put that responsibility on the local authority and the local rate-payers in full.  Perhaps that will not happen and I hope it will not.  The Government have given valuable help in providing milk under the School Meals Scheme, and I earnestly hope that the system that has been in operation up to last week in the City of Dublin will continue and that we will be able to purchase the milk for those who are asking for it.</P>
    <P>I hope that we will get some account at an early date that will satisfy our people that the acreage appealed for by all Parties concerned is well on the way to fulfilment.  I do hope that the lives of the farmers and farm workers will be made brighter and happier.  I earnestly trust that when the war is over we will not forget those who have helped us during this emergency.  I recollect the period after the last Great War when farmers were forgotten. Those who invested their money in the land, who cultivated the land and took <Col N="690" /> grave risks, were, in many cases, pressed very severely by their banks, shortly after the war, when prices collapsed and when the export market was not so good.  In many cases arrangements had to be made by the Government at that time to save the situation.  I hope that will not occur again.  I hope the farmers will be remembered.  I also hope that our sailors, who have done so much for us, who have risked their lives in bringing food that we required, will not be forgotten.</P>

      <P>I would not have intervened in this debate were it not for the fact that a number of non-farmers have stood up here and have attempted to tell the farmers what they should do.  I think all of us, whether we represent a city constituency or a county constituency, will at least pay this tribute to our farmers, that they do not want a whole lot of encouragement to do their duty.  They have always done whatever patriotism demanded of them.  As one who has represented an agricultural community for many years I think I can speak with some authority on agriculture&mdash;with greater authority than some others who have spoken on this subject.  I have almost daily contact with the farmers in my own part of the country.  I have established contacts with farmers all over Eire.  In County Tyrone and County Fermanagh I have shot with them; I have fished and hunted with them.  Because of those contacts and associations, I can claim at least some knowledge of farming conditions in this country. <Col N="691" /> There has been only one speech from Clann na Talmhan which I can describe as an intelligent contribution to a debate on agriculture.  That was made by Deputy P.J. Halliden. It was the only coherent, intelligent expression of opinion from that Party.  We had, too, a most interesting contribution by Deputy Hughes. It was one of the most interesting speeches he has made here during my association with this House.  We also had a contribution made last evening by Deputy Giles.  It made a special appeal to me, as one who loves a breath of fresh air, a breath of mountain air.  He expressed what the farmers of Ireland are thinking, about which they do not make themselves vocal, but which we all know to be true.  The farmers of this country are not down and out, notwithstanding the gyrations and moanings and groanings of Clann na Talmhan.</P>

      <P>The effect of the moanings and groanings of Clann na Talmhan was counteracted last evening by the breath of fresh air from County Meath.  I was most intrigued by Deputy Giles' speech, because it gave the lie to so many things that have been said in this country&mdash;the farmers want this, the farmers want that, the farmers want to be spoon-fed all the time.  I pity the Minister for Agriculture.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has not nearly so hard a job.  He has to deal with urban and municipal areas, but there is no end to the problems which have to be tackled by the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Lands.  Let us contrast the position of the farmers with that of the dwellers in the cities and towns, and see who are the greatest <Col N="692" /> sufferers.  The farmer has security of tenure.  Who brought about that security of tenure?  The old Irish Parliamentary Party, of which this Dáil is the successor.  Who made this eleventh Dáil possible?  Deputy Cosgrave and those who helped him to bring about those things are the people who to-day hold their chins up and their shoulders back.  Clann na Talmhan comes along now and tells the farmers in Fianna Fáil, and the farmers in Fine Gael, and the farmers amongst the Independents how we should re-organise society in this country to make it possible for everybody to get something; in other words we are all to be spoon-fed.  I do not know whether the Labour Party to-day are members of the Second International or of the Fourth International; at any rate, we have the Beveridge Plan, or some other plan&mdash;we have plans all over the State.  Clann na Talmhan comes along with another plan, but they have not told us anything about the reactions on the people in the cities and towns, who are just as necessary and important to this State as the farmers. There is no use in trying to get away with the story that the farmers are doing everything for the country. They are helped 100 per cent. by their brothers and sisters in the towns and cities.  I admit that the farmers are the main producers, but where would they be without the people who distribute their goods?  If Clann na Talmhan pursues their policy, it may come to pass one of these days that the conditions under which the farmers hold their lands will be disturbed. Originally, the land belonged to the State, and the farmers hold it only in trust from the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am an antiCommunist. That just shows the intelligence of Clann na Talmhan.  They know damn all about what they are speaking of.  I must say that I have some sympathy with the Minister for Agriculture.  He is the one Minister in this House, as distinct from the Minister for Justice, with whom I have more than 100 per cent. sympathy, if such an expression could be mathematically correct.  He tries to hold the balance between Clann na Talmhan and the honest, respectable, decent, hardworking farmers who are to be found in every other Party.  Deputy Giles appealed to me last evening, in this atmosphere of groaning and moaning, as a breath of fresh air from the mountains when he said: &ldquo;We are not down and out.&rdquo;  That is right and I was delighted to hear it.</P>
      <P>I stated at the outset that I did not want to detain the House unduly, but before concluding, I should like to point out to Clann na Talmhan and to other people who are non-representative farmers, that there are other sections to be considered by this House as well as the farmers &mdash; for instance, the poor docker in the cities of Cork and Dublin, who gets no subsidies except the dole for which he pays. We have to think also of the poor citizen who has to pay very high prices for his butter and eggs.  In that connection I wholeheartedly support the demand for 1/- per gallon for milk, for I know how hard the milk producers have to work, but we heard not a word during this debate from Clann na Talmhan about the poor in our cities and towns who have to pay through the nose for everything.  The farmers, at least, have roofs over their heads; they have food, shelter and clothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is all-important to the farmers but what about the poor docker or labourer in the cities of Dublin, Cork, Waterford or Limerick?  Has he those amenities?  Has he any security of tenure?  Not at all.  He has to pay through the nose for everything, yet we have those people to-day floating in on a wave of prosperity, indulging in moaning, groaning and wailing. With these few words I shall resume <Col N="694" /> my seat in the hope that they will clinch the whole issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>Speakers from all sides of the House have appealed to the farmers and the agricultural workers to give of their best as producers and I hope that during the continuation of the debate nothing will be said that will mar the appeal for co-operation made by all Parties.  It is a pleasure to one who has been a member of this House for 22 years to find Deputies from all Parties, even those representing cities, taking a keen interest in the debate.  Whether it is due to the emergency or to the action recently taken by an outside Government I do not know, but it is a remarkable thing and I think it brings home to the mind of everybody the importance of the working farmer and the agricultural labourer to the community. Appeals have been made by all Parties to the Minister to recognise the importance of these producers. Deputies went even so far as to suggest the granting of increased subsidies on essential commodities so as to ensure that the people, with whom Deputy Anthony was concerned, will have an abundance of food for the coming year.  Appeals have been made for increased subsidies also in the hope the farmer would be enabled to pay a wage to the agricultural worker, which would encourage agricultural labourers to remain on the land, and to give to the agricultural worker the same rights and privileges as are enjoyed by men engaged in other less important industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have the honour of representing an agricultural constituency, as I say, for 22 years.  I speak with some knowledge of the agricultural industry, and I do not at all agree that the small working farmer is making a great deal of money at present.  I do admit that his position has improved somewhat, and that he is able to-day to pay off some of the arrears and the debts incurred in former years, but he certainly is not in the position of having a great deal of money to his credit.  I refer, of course, to the working farmer; not to the man who has 500 or 600 acres.  The working farmer, to my mind, needs all the assistance we can give him.  As the <Col N="695" /> Minister has been promised support from all parts of the House in any action which he may take in this respect, I think he should take courage and inquire into the possibility of granting a further increase in subsidies on really essential foodstuffs which are required even in the towns and cities.  What does it matter if the subsidy be increased if we make sure that the particular commodity we require is produced for the people in the towns and cities who need it?</P>
    <P>I am certain that the workers in my constituency will give of their best.  I hope that no person will take up an attitude likely to create disunity at the present time, because it is the people in the towns and cities who will suffer as a result of any disorganisation in agriculture.  The agricultural workers have always been the backbone of the nation, and have ever been ready to respond to the nation's call in times of distress.  I am quite certain that the working farmer and the labourer will not fail the nation, and we should be all ready to appreciate and recognise their work.  I would appeal to the Minister to prevent the occurrence of any untoward incident that would be likely to interfere with production in agriculture.  I suggest that he should call the Agricultural Wages Board together and arrange that a bonus be promised to agricultural workers when the harvest is saved, just as was done ten or 15 years ago when I was more intimately connected with agricultural workers. In that way you will encourage workers to give of their best.</P>
    <P>Some complaints have been made about the manner in which the Agricultural Wages Boards are constituted. I have not that complaint to make so far as my constituency is concerned. There are two farm labourers, ploughmen, to represent the agricultural workers on the Wages Board.  That is as it should be.  If there is discontent arising out of appointments made in connection with other boards, the Minister would be well-advised to see that really genuine agricultural workers are appointed to represent labour interests.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="696" /> We have also heard some complaints as to the conditions under which milk production and dairying are carried on. I have heard of the experience of a small working farmer who had six cows. He lost some of his stock through disease and he has not the capital to replace them.  As we are raising rates for agricultural purposes, I can see no great objection to striking an extra halfpenny in the £ over the county so as to enable the agricultural committee to make grants available to small farmers under a certain valuation for the purpose of replacing stock lost through disease.  If that were done it would be of great assistance to the small farmer who has no capital of his own.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House, but there are a few remarks I should like to make in regard to markets.  I hope the Minister for Agriculture in this connection will work in conjunction with the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  We have an industrial arm in the towns as well as the industrial arm of agriculture.  The creation of industries in the towns and cities will provide a ready market for the farmer in his particular area, and we need not be dependent on the exporting of some of the commodities that are required for our own people.  Take, for instance, this question of extra tillage.  In my own county, where we have over 200 labourers' cottages, the land attached to these cottages has been tilled for the last ten or 15 years. If the Minister for Agriculture would get the county manager to give an extra half-acre to these people; it would mean that you would have a considerable number of extra acres of land tilled, without any extra expense, and that would mean more commodities for the people in the towns and the cities.</P>
    <P>Many of these plots, as a result of intensive tillage, are being run out of fertility, and it would not mean any extra expense for the county manager to make an order allotting these people an extra half acre.  The only difficulty that we have in my constituency is in connection with the big estate agents, who are always able to engage the best legal talent to raise points of opposition <Col N="697" /> as between the landlord concerned and the local authority.</P>
    <P>There are only two things that concern the people in the country at the present moment.  One is to produce the food that we require, and the other is to save it.  I have listened to the many appeals that were made in this House, but I believe that we cannot do very much with regard to keeping people on the land unless a further effort is made to make the life of the ordinary agricultural worker as easy as it is for workers in other industries. The agricultural worker should be given the same rights as the people engaged in other, and secondary, industries. It has been suggested that it is impossible to give holidays to farm labourers.  It is not impossible.</P>

      <P>I am only appealing, Sir, to the Minister, with other Deputies who have spoken here &mdash; all of whom recognised the duty that we owe to the farmer and the agricultural labourer&mdash; to see that the same rights are given to the agricultural worker as are given to workers in other industries.  We should not wait until the war is over to give the agricultural worker the same security as other workers in return for the excellent work that he is doing now for the nation.  Now is the time to give him the same rights and benefits as the man engaged in other industries, which are less important than agriculture.</P>

      <P>I shall not take very long in intervening in this debate.  I think that most of the things that could be said have been said already, but there is one thing that I liked about this debate, and that is that during the whole time it has lasted, everybody in this House seemed to be interested, for the first time &mdash; to my knowledge, at any rate &mdash; in agriculture. People from the cities and the towns, people who have never done a day's work on a farm in their lives, seem now to have an interest in agriculture. Even Deputies such as <Col N="698" /> Deputy James Larkin and Deputy O'Sullivan, the Lord Mayor of Dublin, are evidently taking a keen interest in agriculture, and I must say that I was delighted to hear all those people having something, at least, to say on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing that I find wrong with the Department of Agriculture or its administration is that for a number of years there has been no evidence whatsoever of anything having been done to place agriculture, or the people engaged in agricultural production, on any kind of a sound basis or sound footing.  We seem to be going on in a kind of haphazard way from year to year, meeting emergencies as they come.  In fact, there has hardly been a year since the war started that we did not find ourselves up against frightful difficulties of all kinds &mdash; difficulties which, with proper foresight, might and could have been got over.  Take this year, for instance.  An appeal has been made to all of us to sow wheat. We have the Minister for Agriculture going around the country, attending ploughing matches, and appealing to the farmers to grow more wheat.  We have the Taoiseach following him and telling the people that they must grow more wheat.  Then, however, you can walk around the country any day and find that the people who are willing and anxious to grow wheat cannot find the seed with which to grow it.  In connection with that matter, it must be remembered that we have had three or four years of this emergency, during which it should have been possible to get some kind of suitable seed wheat, but we find ourselves now, in the third or fourth year of the emergency, without a suitable seed wheat.  That is the case in my part of the country, at any rate.  In fact, I have met several farmers from my part of the country who were willing and anxious to grow spring wheat, but they could not procure the seed.  They could not get suitable seed wheat, and were told that all they could get was Manitoba III. Now, the first thing that one would ask in that connection is this: is there any guarantee that that will grow at all in this country, or that it will produce a decent crop of wheat?  I asked several Deputies in this House about that <Col N="699" /> matter, but nobody seems to know anything about it.</P>
    <P>I think that it is an awful indictment of the Government, seeing that we may be faced with starvation, that they have not been able to procure a suitable type of seed wheat of one kind or another, which would ensure a decent crop of wheat for the people who are paying for it.  I cannot understand at all why we should have these public demonstrations or meetings down through the country, asking the farmers to grow more wheat, when the people concerned cannot get, even for cash, the seed wheat which they require, and which ought to be provided for them.  I believe that this year will be a very critical year, and the Minister should take every possible step to provide for next year.  The Government has guaranteed a price of £3 per barrel, and we understand &mdash; perhaps I am wrong &mdash; that we had achieved a pure strain of seed wheat in this country, but that it got mixed up in some way with other strains and that, as a result, we have not now a pure strain of seed wheat.  I think that that is a terrible indictment of the Minister and his Department, especially since, during the last three or four years, we have been begging our farmers to grow more wheat in order to feed the population of this country.  Here we are spending £1,200,000.  I am not complaining about the Minister himself, personally, but I am complaining about the administration of the whole Department of Agriculture in so far as they did not do their job in this regard.  Whether that has been due to the policy of the Minister or to the administration of his Department, I cannot say.  It is a frightful indietment.  Anybody who walks round the country knows that even now, almost 1st April, there are still people looking for seed wheat.  They can get this Manitoba wheat which was released by the merchants but I have met several people during the past week who are sowing barley rather than take the risk of sowing this wheat.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="700" /> As I say, there has been no evidence during the past ten years of anything practical being done to improve the outlook, so far as agriculture is concerned.  It was only when the war came that we all, politicians and otherwise, woke up to the fact that the farmers existed.  The Minister and everybody in the House knows that, and I am glad that even the business man, the working man and the people in the towns have come to realise that agriculture is the one industry we must rely upon.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the income of people living in rural Ireland had increased by £1 per week during the past few years &mdash; I do not think I am misquoting him when I say that &mdash; and he went on to deal with wages on a percentage basis, telling us that wages have increased by 50 per cent.  I hold that wages have increased by 75 per cent. and I have no grievance because of that increase.  I should like to see the increase still greater, but the price of everything which the farmer has to buy has increased by 75 per cent. and perhaps by 100 per cent., and, what is worse, he cannot buy what he wants in the way of parts and implements.  The Department say they have no function in regard to telling people where they will find these parts and implements. Instead of help, we get nothing from the Department but orders and, to a great extent, compulsion.  I dislike talking about compulsion, because I am a believe in a certain amount of compulsion in regard to most matters, but that is the only thing the Department is doing at the moment.  They never seem to know where they are going.  The one thing in the mind of the Department is that food must be provided, regardless of how it is to be provided and regardless of whether the people who provide that food get a profit or not.</P>
    <P>Let the Minister throw his mind back to the period before the last war. The farmers then were not very well off.  They were, in fact, the absolute slaves of the community.  The war of 1914-18 came, and the farmers made plenty of money for the last two years of the war and for a few years afterwards. The fairly big farmer built houses, bought machinery, improved <Col N="701" /> his dwelling and erected cattle-sheds. Some people were foolish enough to go into debt with the banks for a few thousand pounds, but 90 per cent. of the farmers did all this work out of capital.  Things went well for three or four years after the war, and then came the &ldquo;flop&rdquo;.  Very few farmers of the type I refer to, the 40, 50 or 60 acre men, who are the backbone of the country, had money.  These men can never become millionaires.  If they are good farmers, they do their job well &mdash; I do not say they all do so&mdash; and these are the people about whom I am concerned now.  I am not so concerned about the farmer with big resources and big credit as with the 40, 50 or 60 acre man, the industrious farmer who has to rear a family and try to provide decently for them, and avoid having to export them.</P>
    <P>These people are, I am afraid, forgotten in the present condition of things in this country.  The big man can always make money.  He has plenty of resources and credit and can deal with matters in his own way.  In fact, the economic war, which has left us in the awful position in which we find ourselves and in which the farmers about whom I am concerned are still paying their debts even to Government Departments, was an advantage to the big farmer.  He was able to absorb the first shocks and take his losses, and he recovered his losses ten times over during the following years. He then bought from the 50 and 60-acre man at a miserable price and was always able to sell, even at that time, when the price was the best.  What the Minister must look to is providing, above all, for the medium-sized farmer and his family.</P>
    <P>There is scarcely any use in discussing this Estimate without referring to dairying, in which I am very interested from the point of view of getting rid of arguments and trouble.  At the moment a dispute is going on between the people interested in dairying and the Department of Agriculture for which there seems to be no reason whatever.  Dairying, as everybody has said, is the foundation of our whole life and more so now than ever, in view of what will take place when the war ends, no matter who wins.  Year after <Col N="702" /> year, for a number of years back, the quantity of milk produced has become less and the quantity of butter produced has become less.  The Minister and his officials will probably explain it by saying that, as we are not getting fats, we are using butter which we did not use in the past, but the fact is that, as the years go on, we are proing less milk.</P>
    <P>The Live-Stock Breeding Act was passed in 1925, the object being to increase the milk yield in the dairying industry.  After six or seven years experience, it was stated that the Act was not doing all that was expected of it.  Since then have we done anything to implement that enactment? Although we have cow testing associations, creamery associations and other organisations the milk yield is decreasing. I cannot suggest a remedy. Thousands of pounds have been spent every year by the Department on this problem.  Consequently, there should be some remedy.  I am not arguing against the amount expended, but I am not satisfied that value is being given for the money.  I urge the Minister to agree to the payment of 1/- per gallon for milk, as in that way trouble in the industry will be avoided.  If we want to make the production of milk profitable, farmers and their families will have to be paid a decent price for their work.  The position in many parts of rural Ireland is that farmers find difficulty in getting labour for milking purposes.  The position has been aggravated since so many of our people went to England and began sending money home.  There is great difficulty in getting labour to come in to milk cows morning and evening.  I could mention the names of 20 farmers who do not propose to continue to keep cows because they cannot get people to milk them.  Many people who are independent ask themselves why they should continue to slave when they find it impossible to get paid help. This question concerns all Parties, but the Labour Party more than any others.  I am a strong believer in paying good wages to capable workers, but the Act passed here some years ago put farmers in the position that they have to pay the same wage to the <Col N="703" /> greatest dud as to one of their best men.  It will be said, of course, that the amount is fixed by the Wages Board.  That board fixes wages and hours.  If a farmer employs a man at £1 a week, and provides him with board and lodgings, and he decides to leave after six months, the farmer can be prosecuted and will be made pay any difference between the fixed wages and the amount agreed upon.  That is an anomalous position.  The result is that a man who knows his work gets only the same wage as an inexperienced person.</P>
    <P>I suggest that there should be a reasonable minimum wage fixed for agricultural labour and that it should be left to farmers to pay more if they considered it desirable to do so.  Even if employers are willing to pay overtime for farm work there is difficulty in getting men to undertake it on Sundays.  Deputies on the Government Benches are aware of that.  By their mishandling the situation the Department has made it almost impossible to solve the labour difficulty. Nobody stands for the payment of better wages than I do, but the impression seems to be abroad amongst some people that they will not slave for farmers any longer.  Why not do away with the Act in question?  I am sure Labour Deputies will agree that it is not possible to have fixed hours on farms for milking purposes or for other work on the land.  Admittedly, many people on the land have now incomes that are better than they had in the past, but the difficulty they are up against is that they cannot get help, even though they are willing to pay good wages and overtime, if necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JeremiahRyan" hpid="Colonel Ryan Colonel Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They will not.  Farming is a difficult calling and in carrying it on farmers now find that they have to pay as much to boys leaving school as to men who have spent a lifetime at agricultural pursuits, milking cows or feeding cattle.  In future, I suggest that a worker should not be entitled to full wages until he has at least three years' experience on a farm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="704" /> It is madness to expect a farmer to pay as much to a young fellow leaving school as he would to an experienced worker.  The point is that the farmer very often is in a black knot.  He has to employ somebody, and will take anybody.  There has been a lot said in this House about the scarcity of labour and the fact that we have 76,000 people unemployed.  If you want labour and go to the Department, you are told to go to the labour exchange. Farmers do go to the labour exchange and undoubtedly men are to be got there, but they are the kind of men who want to get sacked immediately. They would not dream of working with a farmer, with the result that the farmer gets annoyed with them and has to tell them to go about their business.</P>
    <P>Three or four years ago, when the defence position looked more serious than it is to-day, great numbers of farmers' sons and young men throughout the country joined the Defence Forces.  They did not do so for the purpose of making a career for themselves in the Army, but rather to help the country at that period.  They are now badly needed at home by their fathers and mothers when farm labour is so scarce.  I urge on the Minister that any young fellow from the country who wants to go home to help on the land or produce food for the nation should be released indefinitely.  I heard some speakers on the Fianna Fáil Benches say that it is not a soldier's job to produce food.  At the moment I think it is anybody's job.  In this emergency the production of food is just as important as the defence of the country.  What sort of defence could you put up with a starving people? Therefore, I say that the production of food ranks in importance with defence &mdash;if it is not more important.  I cannot understand why young men who have spent two or three years in the Army will not be released for agricultural work.  University graduates can be released to take a degree.  But what I am urging is more important.</P>
    <P>I would urge on the Minister to use his influence with the Department of Defence to get all those young men released for the production of food, and especially farmers' sons who are <Col N="705" /> needed for work on their parents' land. The economic side of things is likely to be of more importance to the country in the future than the defence side. I have already referred to what happened after the last war.  The same thing is likely to happen after this one, if a solid foundation is not laid now in the agricultural sphere.  I do not deny that, at the moment, farmers are in a position to make money.  Deputies, however, know well that while that is so they are only paying back the debts which they incurred during the last seven, eight or ten years.  A lot of them are just getting on their feet.  The Minister for Agriculture said that they were making £1 a week more than they were some years ago.  I do not agree with that.  They are making more than they have been able to make for a long time.  I believe that if the Department and the Government decide to help, they can place the farmers in a very good position, one which will enable them to withstand whatever shocks may come upon them in the next five or six years.  I admit that there are opportunities to-day, and will be for the next few years, for farmers to make money.  They want, however, to get the assurance now that if they decide to do something they will be paid for it in the future, and that any chances they have of making money are not going to be thrown away.  It will not be disputed that when the war ends, no matter what countries are friendly with us or otherwise, for a few years at least we shall have no difficulty in selling anything that we can produce.  I think that no matter what the cost to the State, every decent farmer should be put in the position of being able to produce to his fullest capacity.  Now is the time to help farmers to stock their lands and to provide credit for small farmers.  Some Deputy on the opposite side said that small farmers can get all the credit they want from the banks.  They can get credit, but, as we all know well, if a small farmer owes £100 there is no hope of that man getting further credit either from a bank or from the Agricultural Credit Corporation.</P>
    <P>Whatever might be the uses of the <Col N="706" /> Agricultural Credit Corporation when it was first set up, those uses have disappeared. The security for getting a loan and cost of getting one are much greater.  Anyone who would go to that corporation now looking for a loan would be a fool.  Legal and other costs would be staggering.  I want to ask the Minister and the Government to discuss this problem and try to find a way to put every farmer on his feet. I do not include the waster or the fellow who does not work or never worked.  I do not believe there is a great difficulty in doing it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes spoke of a soil survey. I believe that would be an ideal thing, but I notice that the Minister is trying to put the blame on committees of agriculture.  Agricultural instructors do a great deal of useful work, and I think their services could be utilised in a more effective way.  As a member of the county council and the county committee of agriculture, I do not like piling on rate after rate on the people. I feel that 50 per cent. of what we are doing is a waste of money because we are only touching the fringe of something that is very big.  I believe instructors and county committees could do a lot more useful work.  But, if the Department or the Government is depending on the ratepayers to put up the money for the job, I do not think we will ever get anywhere.  In fact, £100,000 does not seem to be much, and I think there would be no hesitation whatever in the world in spending £100,000 or £200,000 in rural Ireland employing more instructors and starting on a different method.</P>
    <P>What I would suggest is that in every county there should be a farm under the auspices of the county committee and the Department of Agriculture. This farm should be worked on the basis that it must pay for itself.  All the agricultural colleges we have are subsidised by the Government.  It is all right for Clonakilty and Ballyhaise to carry out experiments, whether they lose on poultry or not.  In fact, we never know whether they lose or gain; we get the result of their experiments and that is all we know.  I would suggest that in every county there should <Col N="707" /> be a farm of a certain size worked under the auspices of the committee of agriculture and the Department, with its books open to inspection by anyone. I hold that an ounce of example is worth a ton of theory.  The agricultural instructors would be much better engaged on those farms than they would be in giving a lecture in a country village.  If the Government could not agree to that, I would ask the Minister and the Department to carry out about ten times the number of field trials in the areas in which have been carrying them out in the past.</P>
    <P>Referring to that, the agricultural instructor is always placed in an awkward position and he usually goes to a few good farmers.  That is very little use.  He should go around the county, into different places, and insist on field trials of all kinds being carried out.  If the Department will accede to the request to set up an unsubsidised farm in every county, the Government could be responsible, with the county committee of agriculture, for any loss that would be incurred.  The accounts could be open to everybody and the farm inspected by everybody. I find that where an agricultural instructor gets plots and carries out demonstrations, it has ten times the effect of a lecture given on some subject or another in a village.</P>
    <P>I find that the poultry instructresses do better work than anybody else, whether it is due to their method &mdash; and I think it is &mdash; of going into the house, talking to the woman, sitting down and having a cup of tea, and leaving some Department leaflets when she goes away.  In fact, I know of several women who knew nothing about poultry-keeping, but who, because of that kind of chat, took it up and made a success of it.  I believe the instructresses are doing good work by those methods, and I do not believe in sending men to school to give lectures to people who know nearly as much as the instructor himself.  The other lackadaisical farmers do not come at all. As I say, I feel that while the Department is carrying out its present policy, while it is fiddling at this and pinching at something else, no progress will be made.  I am delighted that I saw the <Col N="708" /> city and townsmen as well as Labour, taking a keen interest in agriculture, and I hope this debate will inspire the Minister to do something.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>In this Estimate presented by the Minister, there is an extra sum allocated to the matter of veterinary research.  Might I express the hope that progress in the eradication of diseases incidental to cattle in this country will be of a more progressive nature than that which has characterisd the efforts of the Department up to date in regard to the disease known as Black Scab? The Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures who happened to relieve his colleague the Minister for Agriculture, three-quarters of an hour ago, is very familiar with the position in the Cooley area.  It is well over a quarter of a century since that disease appeared there and so far as I can understand no progress has been made.  The farmers of that area have carried out the instructions that have been issued by the Department regarding the type and variety of potatoes to be planted each year. They have splendid, immune varieties, and yet there seems to be no hope of those people being able to sell their potatoes except on the export market. People outside that area, people generally throughout the country, seem to imagine that there is something radically wrong with those potatoes because of the unfortunate term used in relation to them, namely, &ldquo;scab.&rdquo;  The fact is that those potatoes are the same as the potatoes sold on the Dublin market &mdash; the same variety &mdash; but the Department is afraid that the soil that adheres to them might be the means of spreading disease throughout other counties. In order to preserve the potato seed industry in other parts of the country, the farmers in that particular area of Louth are prevented from disposing of their potatoes unless they export them to the British markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true to say, and it is only right that it should be said, that the Department within the past few years have done something to alleviate the position of the farmers there by the <Col N="709" /> erection of a factory, known as the alcohol factory, where the farmers can dispose of their potatoes for the production of alcohol.  Those farmers are at the moment selling their potatoes at £4 10s. per ton.  To be quite fair, I might say that you could add £1 to that amount and make it £5 10s., because the farmers are able to dispose of all their potatoes, big and small.  It is only fair to say that while £4 10s. is the net price they receive, the potatoes are really worth £5 10s. a ton, for the reason I have stated.  If you compare that price with the price prevailing in other parts of the Twenty-Six Counties, you will readily understand the position in which these farmers are placed by having to dispose of their potatoes at £3 or £3 10s. per ton less than farmers in other areas receive.</P>
    <P>I respectfully suggest that it would be only bare justice if the Minister for Agriculture would get into consultation with the Minister for Finance and urge upon him the desirability of increasing the price to these farmers by another £1 per ton.  It is not for me, as the Deputy representing that constituency to say it, because the fact is already well known, and tribute has already been paid to the farmers in those areas, but they have always been engaged in the most intensive cultivation of their land.  The population per square mile in Cooley is much greater than in any other part of Éire and the people there are only asking for bare justice.  I hope and trust that, since the Department cannot hold out any prospect of this disease being eradicated, thereby enabling the farmers of that area to dispose of their potatoes wherever they like, the Government will recompense them in some way for the loss they are sustaining and have sustained.  They can do that by increasing the price this year.</P>
    <P>I now come to beet, which is also grown extensively in that area.  The Minister, I am sure, is aware that the freight charge per ton from the Cooley area and other parts of Louth to the nearest beet factory, which is Carlow, are in the region of 15/- per ton.  I believe there is a rebate of 2/-, and that makes a net charge of 13/- per ton.  The Cooley and the other <Col N="710" /> farmers have to pay that amount on any beet that they rail to Carlow.  So far as I understand, the Minister for Agriculture has guaranteed to pay the difference, according to the areas, where freights exceed 6/- to 8/-.  What does that mean to the farmer in Cooley, who grows an acre of beet, assuming he has eight tons to the acre?  He has to pay 13/- on every ton.  If it is a five-ton wagon, that means £3 5s.  As regards farmers in other areas, the maximum they pay is 8/-, and that would mean a payment of £2 on a five-ton wagon.  Most farmers pay only 6/- a ton, or 30/- a wagon.</P>
    <P>I hold that the Minister would be giving the Cooley farmers and the farmers in other parts of Louth only bare justice by paying the difference between 8/- and 13/-.  He must remember that the farmers in that area have come to the rescue in so far as the growing of beet is concerned. These men have overcome the difficulties created by the lack of fertilisers. Owing to the fact that most of the holdings there are uneconomic, and that the cultivation has been so intensive and has extended over such a large number of years, those farmers are and have been compelled to increase the productivity of their soil by means of very hard work.  That hard work consists of going out in the early hours of the morning to get seaweed or wrack from the seashore in order to enrich their land.  So long as the emergency lasts, I trust that both in regard to the price paid for potatoes and the freight charged on beet, special consideration will be given to the farmers in Cooley and in other parts of Louth.</P>
    <P>With regard to machinery, I hope the Department will get away from the system of red tape as applied to machinery imports.  I have heard some Deputies, especially from Roscommon, stating that there was favouritism.  I would be very slow to think that there was favouritism, but there must be something in what was said.  This I do know: that there are farmers in this country who were in a position to get machinery, but, owing to the fact that they could not get a permit, they <Col N="711" /> lost the opportunity of getting that machinery in, especially tractors.  If that is so, I should like the Minister to do away with the system of red tape, and allow people, farmers or otherwise, who are in a position to import machinery, to do so, and to give them every encouragement in that direction.</P>
    <P>On the subject of labour, I have heard a lot of talk about the scarcity of labour.  Let me say at once that I think it is only right, if the harvest is to be saved, that there should be a full complement of labour. We are inclined in this country to magnify things out of all proportion. After all, the Department of Agriculture and the Government should be able to get over this matter of having sufficient labour to save the harvest. If other nations that are engaged in a life and death struggle can get over this difficulty, it is no credit to us, who have been enjoying peace for the last five years, that things like that cannot be got over without putting the whole economic balance of the country out of gear.  In other words, in order to get labourers for our farmers, we must keep all the unemployed young men in the towns in this country.  That is wrong.</P>
    <P>The Government, by careful planning, could ascertain how many labourers are required to assist farmers in particular areas.  Do not let us talk of this country as if it were a vast continent.  Everyone knows that in most districts here the larger part of the harvest is saved by what is known as job labour; that is, one farmer helping the other and, if a man has a couple of labourers, when he gets his harvesting done he lends them to some other farmer.  I admit that there is a difficulty where crops ripen about the same time.  There is always that difficulty.  There is always anxiety on the part of many farmers that some of the harvest will be lost.  But, in order to have the necessary number of farm labourers to save the coming harvest, there is no reason why a ban should be put on the movements of unemployed young men in the towns and cities.  It may have something to do with the ban which exists at the moment in regard <Col N="712" /> to young people going to England. Whether it is popular or not to say it, I hold that it is not right for any Government to prevent any young men who cannot get a living here from earning a living somewhere else.  We are not violating our neutrality by doing that. Germany can get people from Turkey, and Turkey can trade with Germany. I hope that this scare about the shortage of labour will not be used as a means to keep young men who cannot get employment in this country from seeking employment elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the question of seed wheat.  I would be the last person to blame the Government unduly, but I must say that some people have fallen down on their job with regard to the provision of seed wheat.  For the last four or five weeks I have been stopped every Monday, which is market day in Dundalk, by dozens of farmers who could not procure seed wheat.  They 'phoned to Ardee and Drogheda, and other places, within a 50-mile radius of Dundalk, and could not get a grain of seed wheat for spring sowing.  They could not get it in Dundalk, where some of the foremost seed assemblers are to be found.  To my surprise, a week or two afterwards I was informed that the only seed wheat available was Canadian wheat.  So much for the policy of self-sufficiency.  There was not a Deputy who had the manliness or courage to admit that.  We are trying to convey to the outside world that, notwithstanding what is happening outside, we can still manage to carry on in this country.  We cannot, and the sooner we admit that the better. We had not even seed wheat here for this year.  As I say, some people must have fallen down on their job, because there were farmers who had their land ready for sowing and they could not get the seed wheat to put in.  I hope we shall not have a repetition of that. I hope that the Department, after imploring the farmers to do all they possibly could to increase production, will not leave them in the position that they have not sufficient seed wheat for spring sowing.</P>
    <P>A good deal has been said about the home market and the help which the <Col N="713" /> Government can give, not alone to the farming industry, but to all other industries. I always held, and always will hold, that no country can become prosperous by Government action.  It is only by courage and determination and, I should say, genuine nationalism on the part of the people that this country can become prosperous and maintain its prosperity.  We have heard many complaints about the dairying industry, the poultry industry, and the pig industry.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, one of the chief reasons why the pig industry is not as prosperous as it was some years ago is the lack of feeding stuffs which we used formerly to import and which we cannot raise ourselves.  That is one of the things which we must admit.  The same thing applies to poultry and to cattle.  We are not getting the maize which we used to import.  Fianna Fáil Deputies do not like to admit that.  They have been so inoculated with the policy of self-sufficiency adumbrated by their Leader that they will not even allude to the cause of the decline in the dairying industry, especially in regard to the milk yield, which I think any farmer will admit is due, to a very large extent, to the absence of the feeding stuffs which we formerly imported for cattle.  The same thing applies to poultry and pigs.  Anybody who is honest must admit that if you ask a farmer, who was never without 30 or 40 pigs, he will tell you, amongst other things, that the decline in pig production is due to the shortage of feeding stuffs, plus the shortage of coal.  It would take a small fortune to boil stuff to feed pigs at present. You would have to stand by a fire all day putting turf on.  No amount of bombast or talking about self-sufficiency can get over those plain hard facts and we have to put up with them.  Instead of talking about post-war planning, we will be very lucky if we are able to keep going from day to day and month to month until this war is over.  We can plan very little, because we do not know what conditions will obtain when this war is over.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry as usual spoke about the home market and said that he <Col N="714" /> does not care a thraneen about the export market.  When a Deputy makes a statement like that, knowing perfectly well that there are train loads of store cattle passing through our railway stations every day to the North Wall, you can give him up as a bad job.  He is simply trying to ignore facts and these are the facts. No matter what we may have in the home market &mdash; and it is good to have a home market &mdash; our farmers cannot be prosperous unless we have an export market as well for our cattle, especially our store cattle.  Everyone knows that at the moment we are not able to absorb all the cattle raised in this country even under difficult conditions. The same might be said of all the other branches of our agricultural economy.  We have to face the situation as it exists.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that most, if not all, of our people are entering into the spirit of the time and are doing all that is possible to ensure that in so far as lies in their power there will be a sufficient acreage this year to guarantee, more or less, at least sufficient food for the year 1944.  At the same time, we have to recognise the fact that the farmers at the moment, even if they were ever so willing, are greatly handicapped in their work so far as increased food production is concerned. The lack of fertilisers and other things will undoubtedly affect the wheat yield and the yield of all other cereal and root crops.  However, we have to put up with that state of affairs.  The Government, I am sure, must appreciate the help they have received from all Parties in this House and from the people outside, especially the farming community.  As far as we on this side of the House are concerned, we shall give the greatest co-operation possible to the Government in any steps they may take, now or in the near future, to assure a plentiful supply of food for the people during the coming year.  I should like again to impress upon the Minister the case for the farmers of the Cooley area to whom I have referred, both in regard to the price and the question of freight charges for beet grown in that area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>In thrusting myself into the discussion at this late point, on the sixth day we have spent on the agricultural Estimates, I find myself affected with a greater reluctance to debate than usual.  That is due not merely to the fact that I am town born and town and city bred and that in so far as I can claim any acquaintance with agriculture at any time of my life it is only at one or two removes from those who are directly associated with it.  There is also the fact that I sit for a city constituency and to the superficial eye it might seem that neither I nor my constituents have anything to do with this matter of agriculture and how it is likely to fare in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also affected by this fact that, after so many days spent in this debate, and so many speakers having spoken on it, and so many topics having been opened, I find it impossible, with the limited means at my disposal, to correlate quite a number of the suggestions and ideas that have been shot out here.  But although it may seem arrogance on my part, I find it a source of complaint that not one of the many specialists whom we have heard on the matter thought fit to do what seemed to me to be a simple matter, namely, to get the details of these agricultural Estimates, see what the expenditure of the moneys made for, try to tie these together, to knit them up into some sort of agricultural policy, and tell us what that agricultural policy was, how it had worked in the past, how it was likely to work in the future, and tell us then what the country, which depends upon this main, basic industry, has to look to. Nobody has done that so far as I have either heard in this House, or read. I may seem arrogant in saying that should have been done, and if I make some attempt to do it myself, I hope people will not take it as arrogance on my part. I do say I cast an inexperienced eye on the situation but it is one that is definitely interested and it is one that is definitely sympathetic because I know definitely that, not merely my own fate and my children's fate but that of my constituents depend upon <Col N="716" /> how far agriculture thrives and prospers in this country.</P>
    <P>I say I am a city man.  As far as agriculture is concerned, in these times of emergency, I do not think that we really have much to compliment the Minister for Agriculture or his Department on.  Compliments have been paid to the farmers, and they are well-deserved, but as far as we in the city are concerned, as far as we town-folks are concerned, it is not what the farmer grows, in the main, that is of importance to us, but how far that Minister and other Ministers get a very small fraction of what the farmer grows into this city.  I do not know what the statistics are.</P>
    <P>I have heard them questioned up and down.  Possibly the Minister will correct me here and now, but I understand it is only a very small fraction indeed, say, of the oat crop of this country which is needed for human requirements, something in the region of, possibly, as low as 5 per cent, certainly not higher than 10 per cent. When one thinks of all the potatoes grown in this country and tries to relate these to human needs, not of the City of Dublin alone, but human needs all over the country, again it is a small fraction relatively of the whole crop that is required for human needs, and it is only that small fraction of either oats, potatoes or anything else that we in the city are troubled about. When we think of the messes that there were in regard to even the sale of the small percentage of the entire oat crop of this country that was required in Dublin, when we know that there was at least a certain amount of panic with regard to the situation in respect of potatoes, and when we who had gone through that panic lived to hear that more than enough potatoes to have completely quelled all thought of panic had been left to rot in the fields, then we begin to get some idea of what the organisation at the back of the Government is.  That is as far as the city man is affected immediately in these emergency circumstances by agriculture.</P>
    <P>I have to ask myself with regard to this whole matter, is it right in the circumstances that prevail and is it likely to be right in the future that agriculture is and will be our foundation industry? It is so at the moment.  It <Col N="717" /> has been so in the past.  It is from an agricultural community that we have piled up all these vast credits, these external assets that are held out to us as such glittering prizes, to be cashed in on sometime in the future.  Everybody who has written on this subject in recent years has said that agriculture has been, is, and must for years to come be considered as the main industry of this country.  I take a quotation from what has come to be regarded as the Bible of the present Government &mdash; the Banking Commission Report.  In that quotation this extract occurs:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Free State is predominantly an agricultural country, which means not only that the greatest portion of the population gains its livelihood in agriculture, but that the main exports required to pay for necessary imports are obtained from agriculture... Access to profitable export markets for agricultural products will in the future as in the past govern the prosperity and welfare of the main body of the Irish people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Some parts of the quotation are left out, but this extract continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;From the point of view of the balance of payments the home manufacturer of many industrial products will to some extent reduce the need of imports; but as regards raw materials and a whole series of semi-manufactured and finished articles imports will still be necessary to maintain the standard of living within the country.  Experience in other countries has shown that an increase in the standard of living involves increased imports, and there is no reason to believe that it could be otherwise in the Free State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And then this significant part follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;So far as exports are concerned there is very little evidence of any export of products from the new industries which have been established, and there has, in fact, during recent years been a marked decrease in the export volume of the older industries other than brewing.  The tendency has thus been to make <Col N="718" /> agriculture increasingly responsible for the maintenance of sufficient exports.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That appears on page 116 of the Banking Commission Report.  The writer of an article who quotes that, then sums up:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The report, therefore, conceives the position of agriculture as fundamental in regard to the balance of payments, the monetary position and the possibility of economic and social development.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let us take that as agreed.</P>
    <P>Agriculture has been our main industry. On it we have lived; on it we have piled up those external assets. It is so at the moment, and even if, painfully and at great cost to the consumer, certain industries have been fostered in recent years, there is not merely no great possibility of exports from those industries but there has been a decline in the exports of the old industries, other than agriculture. We can take it that agriculture means a livelihood, wealth, good social and economic conditions for the whole of us.  If agriculture thrives, we in the city thrive; if agriculture dies, we decay.</P>
    <P>This country has been marked by two great characteristics.  One has been emigration.  The other, to adopt this modern terminology with regard to other things, has been the flight from marriage or the flight from parenthood. Emigration was the old drain on this country.  The habit of emigrating to America was one which had been founded many years ago.  At the time of the Famine, it was a flight from poverty, and the only country that held out any hope to those whom we could not keep at home in any sort of decent employment was the United States. Then the conditions changed.  America got into her depression, and this country offered, relatively at least, a better condition of things than ever the great United States of America offered.  For certain years prior to 1932, emigration had been on a very definite decline, with the result that in about 1931 and 1932, for the first time since the Famine, this country showed more people returning to it than those <Col N="719" /> who were leaving.  Then we had the Fianna Fáil Government, and then we had the economic war.</P>
    <P>Both those things set the tendency back in the old direction, and with the present war we have got to the point where, on an average, 30,000 people leave our country every year, no longer to go to the United States of America, but to England.  Apart from that, a marked characteristic of this country has been what I call the situation with regard to marriage.  Our record with regard to that matter is unenviable.  Eighty-eight per cent. of the men under 30 years of age and 66 per cent. of the women under 30 years of age in rural Ireland are unmarried. The number of marriages contracted in this country is decreasing, and the age at which marriages are contracted is increasing.  There are less marriages, and those which are contracted take place at a later age.  One result of that, shown in the 1936 census of population, was that there were 78,000 less children in this country about 1939 than there had been ten years earlier &mdash; 78,000 less children in a population of about 3,000,000.  We have emigration now on a rising scale.</P>
    <P>In over 20 years or so of native government we have had no betterment in the conditions with regard to marriage and the production of children.  The number of children is decreasing, the menfolk and the womenfolk of this country are not marrying, large numbers are emigrating, and, co-incident with all that, we have achieved a position which economists will describe in enthusiastic terms, the position of being, relative to our size, one of the greatest creditor nations in the world. Money galore is made here and sent out of the country.  Now, with it we are sending our emigrants.  The situation is that the aged people and the ageing people are becoming a dangerous proportion of the population of the country, and those who are young and growing up to manhood are becoming a dangerously low proportion.</P>
    <P>How is the situation that we are in brought about by those conditions under which agriculture is our basic industry and must be regarded as in <Col N="720" /> some way the cause?  How is that going to fare in the future?  What approach is this country making towards achieving what is normally the ideal position, the position in which a man's income, the family income, the wages that people are able to earn in gainful occupation will be sufficient to give them all they need and to enable them to make provision against the accidents of life, sickness, unemployment and other things?  How far is agriculture leading us along a path which will lead us to a condition where we will be able to do away with social services?  Social services may be blessed in one breath, but, looked at from a particular angle, social services have a pauperising influence. The more people go in for social services the greater the condemnation is it of the social system under which they live.  What is the approach we have to that ideal position?  What are we going to do with regard to the future?</P>
    <P>One of the things, I think, that caused harmony to hover around this debate, is that we know we are living in a rather fluctuating situation. Nobody is very clear as to when the present war is going to end.  Some people do not even appear to be clear about how it will end, and certainly most of us are in the dark as to what conditions will supervene once the war is over.  But there is one thing we can count as clear, and that is that the present Government, through some of their Ministers, seem to know definitely who is going to win the war, and that is England and her allies. There is no doubt that the Ministry are developing whatever they can call a policy along the lines that, in this present war, England is certain to win.  That has nothing to do with our neutrality.  It is simply an estimate, the bringing to bear of judgment upon certain facts that are before our eyes, and coming to certain conclusions. There is no doubt that the Ministry have made up their minds that England is going to win.  We are backing England to win, backing her with far higher stakes than any man has ever gambled, and I certainly think, in this war, with far higher stakes than any other nation gambles.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="721" /> The Minister for Industry and Commerce went to University College, Dublin, recently and told us that, granted certain conditions, there was going to be no isolationist policy for Eire.  Of course, he had to put a little bit of a tag at the end to suit the groundlings; he had to say that, if this country remained in a mutilated condition, we might have to live in a condition of isolation, but, if we could forget that, or if that was mended for us, then we had to see ourselves entering into trade relations with the rest of the world.  I pass by that nonsense about cutting off our economic nose to spite our partitioned face.  The Minister does not even believe what he says.  The Minister did say that, at the moment, we are trading exclusively with England; he asked for appreciation of this fact, that we are sending over to England at least twice as much as we are getting back from her, and he said we were heaping up a vast accumulation of sterling assets which he described as properly to be regarded as cash after the war is over. It is a two to one bet apparently.  We are sending out twice as much as we are getting back, and we are going to leave the remainder there to accumulate for our use after the war.</P>
    <P>Clearly, we must regard it as certain that England is going to win.  Not merely must we regard that as certain but we must regard it as certain that she will not be bankrupted in so winning.  There would not be much good in our piling up these reserves if England were simply going to scramble through the war and not be able to meet her commitments after the war. Not merely, according to the speech of the Minister, will these reserves be available but we shall be able to call on them as and when we please when the war is over.  They are what he calls cash.  England is going to be able and willing to pay as and when we want the payments made.  I have not yet heard any English economist speak about the future as the Minister spoke at the University that night.  He based his policy on that.  We have based our whole attitude in relation to this war, or very nearly, on this belief which is the basis of the Minister's <Col N="722" /> argument.  I say &ldquo;very nearly&rdquo; for this reason.  In the course of that speech which was delivered in University College on the 7th of this month the Minister went on to say that the surplus we were exporting &ldquo;was determined not so much on our people's capacity or willingness to eat more meat and eggs as by their difficulty in purchasing more of these products at prevailing prices.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, we are doing a great trade with Britain.  We are sending her twice as much as we are getting from her, but we are not doing that really freely.  We are doing it because we have so much of a surplus; it is not really a surplus; it is only a surplus, because owing to prevailing prices our community at home will not buy the meat, the eggs and the other things going out.  That is a sad commentary on what that same Minister used to tell us years before, that if we had great industrial production here, the home market for the farmer would be marvellously improved.  Time rolled on and disproved these prophecies. We had the same Minister telling us in 1934 that the British markets would never again be available to free and unrestricted entry of agricultural produce and that the worst service anybody could perform to the farmer was to mislead him into the belief that that would be the situation ever again.</P>
    <P>I find in other publications the statement that, of course, industry in this country cannot thrive unless agriculture thrives because agriculture employs one-half of the population, and if they are maintained at such a low rate that they have very little purchasing power, they have not the wherewithal to buy the industrial goods produced here.  So we have this fearful dilemma.  Agriculture cannot get a good home market because the industrial worker has not money enough to buy as much as he wishes of our agricultural products, and we must export them even though our people are hungry.  The agriculturist, on the other hand, cannot buy the products of industry because he is so badly paid and his purchasing power is at a very low ebb.  While that is going on, and <Col N="723" /> while one party lacks the purchasing power to buy the commodities that the other is producing, we still continue exporting our surplus produce and piling up sterling assets.  These amounted to £300,000,000 before the war and year by year since we are adding to these external assets because the agriculturist has not the purchasing power to buy the products of the industrialist and the industrialist has not been able to supply a home market for agricultural products.  So we must export to Britain not because we really think it is good trade, but because the people at home cannot buy the produce here at the prevailing prices.</P>
    <P>Somebody else talked in this debate about self-sufficiency.  I thought at least that that cry would have gone for ever, tested by the hard experience of these last few years.  I remember one occasion when the Taoiseach was Leader of the Opposition and when he was in a very imaginative mood.  He contemplated the happy community we should have here if somebody would build an insurmountable wall around the country.  He pictured the country as a hive of industry in which everybody was running around trying to manufacture something for everybody else's needs.  We have very nearly, though not quite, got that insurmountable wall round the country which the Taoiseach desired and we know what has happened.  We have been subjected to a succession of rises in prices.  We have been subjected to control of a type that no ordinary person would stand in times of peace.  We have been subjected to the manufacture of new crimes every day, breaches of Orders, etc., and notwithstanding all that, we know that our standard of living has sunk appreciably since that ideal situation was brought about.</P>
    <P>I often ask myself would people now be in a more reasonable mood to consider a matter that has been agitating a few speakers in this debate.  We went in for a wheat policy here, and I have to laugh when I hear it stated that it has been the salvation of this country. One of the slogans very widely used during the last election was: &ldquo;Where would we be if we had not a <Col N="724" /> wheat policy in the country?&rdquo;  Supposing we had it all over again.  Supposing we were back again in the days of 1936 and 1937 and that we had definite information that the war was going to start in 1939.  Would we have gone in for the intensive cultivation of wheat in this country since 1936 onwards? I suggest we would not.  At least I suggest there would have been a better policy &mdash; to keep the land fertile, to store cereals and fertilisers. Then we would have been in a much better position to face the impact of the war than we were after this programme was carried out.</P>
    <P>One time in my life I had a post in the City of Cork, and in the &ldquo;digs&rdquo; in which I was living there was an old man who was living on some remittance. He was very ancient.  He used to make his appearance about 12 o'clock in the day, when the sun was high in the heavens and the streets were well aired, and he went to bed about 8 o'clock.  In that way he carried on a modest type of life.  All he had to know was that ahead of him, at a particular period of the year, there was a supervisory post which entailed for three days a vigilation in a certain supervisory way from 8 o'clock in the morning until 8 o'clock at night.  He decided that he would practice getting up early, and for a week before the day I watched that poor man being roused, stumbling down at the unaccustomed hour of 8 o'clock in the morning, getting his food at hours that did not suit him, and sitting up to an hour that was not healthy for him.  He did that for a whole week before the duties of the supervisory position came to be discharged.  When the day at last arrived, we could hardly get him out of bed, and he was carried back in an almost helpless condition, half-way through the day on which he had begun the duties.</P>
    <P>I often think about that old man in connection with our wheat policy in this country.  We went in for practising something years ahead of the war that was going to run out the fertility of the land.  We took in considerable stores, but although it was put to the Minister in the year before, we made no provision by way of storing fertilisers. <Col N="725" /> We did nothing that any provident Government would have done.  Yet, at this moment, there are people who will ask: &ldquo;Where would you be if it were not for the wheat policy?&rdquo;  I have seen that question discussed in the publications of other countries.  In one of these articles, not dealing particularly with wheat, it is stated: &ldquo;Of course, self-sufficiency can be achieved in any country, even with food, but self-sufficiency can be an extremely expensive way of securing life.&rdquo;  A comparison is then made to show the amount of the expense.  I should like to relate that to home conditions.</P>
    <P>In the days before the war, the calculation generally accepted in this House was one which set out that, if we imported wheat at the rates then obtaining, instead of paying for the wheat produced at home, we could have saved a round £1,000,000.  Suppose we had saved that £1,000,000 and that we had carried out the policy of saving that £1,000,000 for 20 years. Think of the capital fund that could be serviced out of that £1,000,000 over 20 years.  Suppose we had £1,000,000 with which to pay sinking fund and interest in respect of some accumulated debt for a capital purpose.  We are anxious to have a mercantile marine.  The calculation has been made in England that, if she had gone in for expensive self-sufficiency in food, she would have lost an amount of money equal to the cost of building the entire British Navy and British mercantile marine and maintaining both.  Out of the £1,000,000 we could have saved in this way, we could have our own mercantile marine.  We could have built that mercantile marine at home, keeping the money at home.  We could have given some new employment to citizens and we would have the ships which are now, apparently, so vital to our life.</P>
    <P>Self-sufficiency is, apparently, still being thought of by members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  If it is, do they ever stop to ponder this question: We are piling up what the Minister for Supplies calls &ldquo;our claims upon future production in England.&rdquo;  The English have told us in pamphlets, <Col N="726" /> lectures and speeches by Ministers that the only way they can hope to pay is: (1) by a funding process, spreading the debt over a number of years, and (2) payment only in goods, which means sending us more goods than they will take from us.  So the policy to which we are paying lip-service &mdash; self-sufficiency &mdash; is one which necessitates a very big surplus importation of goods, a greater importation than exportation of goods in the years after the war.  How that is to be squared with a pure self-sufficiency policy, I do not know.  These are the realities, not speeches.  The Minister takes credit for that and says that what we have done in that respect has not been sufficiently appreciated.</P>
    <P>Suppose the Ministerial viewpoint is borne out and Britain does win this war.  Suppose that not merely does she win it but that she wins it without going bankrupt.  Her people will be coming home from the armed forces at the conclusion of the war.  We all expect that, at least for an interval, there will be considerable activity in England.  New machinery will be required.  Men will have to be fed; needs will have to be catered for.  We know that, so far as the British Government and so far as most British political Parties are concerned, they are agreed upon a policy of expansion. Suppose they succeed in achieving this policy of expansion.  At present, we are losing about 30,000 of our people yearly.  What are we doing here with a view to achieving, in the period after the war, such a situation at home as will tempt extra 30,000's to stay at home instead of going abroad?  We know that the British standard of wages, in comparison with the cost of living, is higher than ours.  We know that the British standards of social services are higher at present and that they promise to be higher in future. Any time a question is put in this House as to why people are allowed to go abroad in these times, it is always met by the answer from the Ministerial Benches: &ldquo;There is only one way to stop them and that is by the use of methods only native to totalitarian countries, and will anybody here stand for the application of such forcible methods to our people?&rdquo;  Will <Col N="727" /> the same answer hold in peace-time? If, after this war, we are faced with a comparison very much to our detriment as between standard rates of pay and opportunities for work, how are we to stop these 30,000 persons multiplying into a much higher figure? Will the answer still be a good one &mdash;that you can only do it by force and, of course, a native Government would shrink from the use of force against people leaving the country?  Nobody could ask that people for whom we have nothing but the dole should be forcibly kept here if opportunities for life and livelihood beyond their imaginings offer on the other side.  But if that is the situation, where are we? Is our marriage rate to go still lower? Is our marriage age to go still higher? Are we to find ourselves more and more an ageing community, with fewer and fewer children, and are we to see more than ever before of our adult population go from us to England?  In that connection, putting these queries, I ask what is the policy with regard to agriculture, how has the Minister used the moneys with which we have provided him; has he added them into something that could be described as a policy and what are its prospects?</P>
    <P>I bring myself back now, with a certain amount of gloom, to a speech I have three times quoted in this House, a speech made by the Minister for Agriculture in Cork in December, 1941. I thought that that speech might be dated for the time at which it was delivered.  That speech was followed by a speech by the Minister for Local Government which furnished an equally gloomy picture of one other side of agriculture &mdash; the live-stock trade.  I thought that this speech in 1941 might be only dated for that particular period, that a better view might prevail and that some better idea of a constructive and hopeful policy might be substituted.  But I find that, towards the end of last year, the Minister for Local Government definitely repeated the same thoughts and gave support to very much the same policy.  I have the quotations before me but the House knows them already.  They are enshrined in the records of the House.  The Minister, <Col N="728" /> addressing his Cork audience told them &mdash;so far as I remember, they were a group of agricultural students &mdash; that we had set out on a policy of division of land and that there was no going back on that &mdash; that we were out for the small farm.  The Minister added that his view was that the small farm meant increased production costs for whatever was raised on the small farm. Now, there are other views on that, but that is the Minister's view: that we were out for the small farm but that, so far as the small farm was concerned, it was going to mean increased costs in relation to our production. In the same breath, the Minister said that it was extremely doubtful that they would get, after the war, anything like present prices for exported live stock.  In the same breath, the Minister also said that we must find a market for the exportable surplus of our agricultural production.  There is the picture that is presented to us. We are presented with a picture of the small farm, which would entail higher costs of production.  We are told that we should go back to that, while at the same time we are told that we must be prepared to face the competition of the other countries in the post-war period; but the small farm, according to the Minister, involves increased costs of production.  Yet we are told that we must have an increased exportable surplus of goods.</P>
    <P>How is that to be done?  Does the Minister propose to do it, or how does he propose to do it?  In that gloomy frame of mind in which he was at that particular period, he said that we would have to look forward to the virtual elimination of the export of dairy produce, and that if such a course should eventually become necessary, it would not be so disastrous to farming economy as might, at first sight, be feared.  He said that if, on the other hand, we decided after the war to continue in the export business, we could only do so by reducing the standard of living of our agriculturists or by reducing costs of production.  He went on further to say, referring to the pig industry, that if it became necessary to subsidise the export of bacon, or pig products generally, by making the home consumer pay more for his <Col N="729" /> rasher, the obvious thing to do would be to reduce pig stocks to about their present number, which was only sufficient to supply the wants of our own consumers.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, some months later, however, said that it was extremely difficult if, after the war, we would get anything like present prices for exported live stock, and that this might mean the virtual extermination of the industry.</P>
    <P>I have said, speaking as a city man, that everything in this country depends on the export of our agricultural produce. If dairy products are to be eliminated after the war: if the pig, and the products derived from the pig, are to be eliminated after this war, and if the live-stock industry generally is to be eliminated after the war &mdash; if, in other words, we are to look towards the virtual extermination of these industries, where are we?  The Minister was not content, however, to express those viewpoints generally.  He went into some detail.  He said, referring to the competition that we are up against from New Zealand:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Situated as we are, a country of small farmers with a long winter during which our cows must be housed and fed, we cannot compete on equal terms with the Antipodes. The question is often asked why our farmers cannot compete with New Zealand in the production of butter. Before the war we were both on the British market, and it may appear strange that New Zealand, so far away, could increase her exports and, evidently, build up a profitable business, while our exports declined, even though we helped producers through an export bounty.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, this is what the Minister gave as a part explanation of that situation:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The farms are bigger in New Zealand and can be more easily mechanised than ours.  They have practically no winter to provide for. Their milk yields, per cow, are higher.  They can, therefore, produce a much larger volume per person engaged in agriculture than our farmers can here.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="730" /> Having given these considerations as the fundamentals of the position, the Minister went on to examine the matter and said that we cannot change our climate; that we are not in the same position as New Zealand, and that if, after the war, we decide to continue the export business, we can only do so by reducing the standard of living of our agriculturists or by reducing costs of production.  He said, in effect, that we can only reach the New Zealand output per person by undoing the work of the Land Commission over the last 20 or 30 years &mdash; by clearing the small holdings and re-creating the larger ranches.  In fact, as the Minister told us, we might be compelled to discontinue those exports, and he said that the elimination of the export of dairy products, if such a course should eventually become necessary, would not be so disastrous to farming economy as might at first sight be feared: that the question would obviously have to be examined very carefully, and the object achieved by deliberate and careful planning.</P>
    <P>He then went on to speak about his fears in regard to the pig industry, and said that the second line that might have to be reviewed was bacon. The Minister illuminated the case with regard to pigs and pig products in that speech, which was made in December, 1941; but in November, 1943, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, at a dinner given by the Irish Branch of the Town Planning Institute in Dublin, injected this dose of pessimism into town planning by saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We found to-day that the least fertile areas of the country carried the densest populations.  How were we going to deal with that?  We were an agricultural community, depending on selling our exportable surplus in a market in which, so far as could be foreseen, competition would be more intensified in the future.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if we wanted to maintain our present standard of life we would have to make our agriculture more efficient, more highly mechanised, to apply to our soil &mdash; our natural resources &mdash; the most modern or most efficient machinery.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="731" /> That almost essentially involved large farms.  It would mean that we would have fewer farmers and workers.  It might also mean that we should have &mdash; though not necessarily &mdash;larger urban communities, perhaps highly industrialised.</P>
    <P>It would mean taking people off the land.</P>
    <P>Our alternative to that was to say that we wanted small farms and more farmers, less machinery and more farm labourers.  The choice had, however, been made and he did not want anyone to assume that the question was an open one.  The people were the only body who could make this choice between the large and small farms.</P>
    <P>That choice, he repeated, had already been made and the fact that we had to-day the Land Commission &mdash;and that it was likely to remain for another generation &mdash; indicated that the choice had been made.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think it has been made quite clear that the small farm does not necessarily mean either lesser or larger production: that it does not necessarily follow; but the Ministerial view, apparently, is that the small farm means higher costs of production, and yet we are going to put the production of these small farms in competition with the production of larger farms in other countries.  On the matter of how we are going to increase production, in view of the competition with which we will be faced, none of the Ministers has enlightened us.  Will the Minister for Agriculture do so to-night?  That is what has particularly concerned me with regard to our agricultural policy. In that connection, I might say, coincidentally, that the Minister for Industry and Commerce recently mentioned that it might be necessary to sacrifice certain things in order to preserve our social services.</P>
    <P>It would appear, therefore, that that is the Ministerial policy.  It would appear that there is a clear-cut view, amongst those who form the Government at the moment, that they have abandoned the policy of trading with other countries, and with England in <Col N="732" /> particular.  Certainly, they evidently realise, with clarity, that New Zealand has increased her production and is getting bigger yields from farming than we were getting before the war. That means that there will be more competition against us when the war is over, and I think that the Government must realise that the Argentine and Canada are going to be greater competitors, so far as we are concerned, than they were before the war, in the supply of agricultural products to the British markets.  Yet, realising that, the members of the Government Party in this House have not yet indicated by a single sentence in this House, or by speeches in the House or outside it, how they are going to reconcile these two, apparently irreconcilable, points.  As against that, of course, there are other people who have spoken and written to the effect that that is such a despairing policy that nobody could follow it.  Undoubtedly, if that were to be the policy of the Government, we would have to say that it is a policy of despair and that it can only lead to decay.  Nobody could speak otherwise, if that were to be the policy of the Department of Agriculture, but I find, in other Ministerial statements, some statements that do give ground for hope and that, I think, do seem to take cognisance of realities.  It would seem from the statements of the Ministers I have in mind, that they put to themselves the question: How will the farming community emerge when this war is over; how will the capital value of their farms be in relation to what it was in the year 1938, before the war started, and how will they be situated in regard to the possession of their farms or lands?  Will their lands have any capital value, or will they be exhausted or run out of fertility to such an extent as will take many years to repair?</P>
    <P>What about farm machinery or agricultural implements of all types?  Is the farmer to be in the position, when this war ends, that he will have to face the future, if he has one, and to give the exportable surplus of goods which the rest of the country requires he should give, if we are to achieve any standard of living in the whole community?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="733" /> It is said that the farmers are making some money at the moment. Deputy Sheldon last night said that that might be&mdash;I think he said that he himself was&mdash;but when he looked at whatever little credit he had, whatever little balance he had on the credit side, and compared it with the loss he had in respect of one item only &mdash;I think he mentioned loss of fertility in the soil&mdash;he found himself not to any great extent better off than he was in 1938.  Suppose Deputy Sheldon represents the community and that, even although the farmer may be getting some small credit, some little balance on the credit side, although most farmers would not agree that that is so, will what they have in hand help to replace their wasted assets in the last four or five years, to say nothing of the waste which occurred in their assets during the period of the economic war?  Certainly nobody can say that the farmers are in the position in which town industry and town business have been left.  I need not go into the figures which I have so often given to the Dáil, but nobody can say that the agricultural community as a whole have been given the leave that town manufacturing industry has been given in regard to the piling up of reserves, but if there is any reserve in the farmers when this war is over, it will be just barely sufficient to put them more or less in the productive position in which they were in 1939.</P>
    <P>What then is to be done?  That is where I, as a townsman, must yield to specialists.  I know nothing about farm operation.  I know nothing about the balancing of one crop as against the other, in the main, but I have read articles&mdash;there is no need to go through the details of them, although I have some of them here&mdash;which say this, that there will be a greater necessity for mechanised farming after the war than ever before.  I have read articles by people who do not agree that that type of mechanisation is impossible simply because farms are divided up into separate ownership.  It does not appear to me to matter a whole lot. The peasant proprietorship is something which will never be cleared out of the country and nobody expects or <Col N="734" /> hopes that it will.  It does not, however, seem to me to be the only factor in the situation, that land should be separately owned.  It is surely more a question of how the land is used.  I have seen plans&mdash;they may be Utopian and they may be plans which the temper of the people would not allow to operate or to which they would not easily turn; there may be deficiencies and defects to be found in them&mdash;which have been sent forward for examination both here and in England as to how there could be what is called a common pool of machinery, for use according to the needs of a particular group, and that could be done irrespective entirely of the separate ownership of pieces of land.</P>
    <P>I have seen other articles which say that our development of agricultural technique has advanced nothing in the last 30 years.  I have seen detailed statements by way of comparison as to the developments that took place in New Zealand in connection with the production of butter and the production of cheese, and in other countries with regard to various other products, Denmark being one great example of a country with which we are competitors. The conclusion to be drawn from any of these articles is that there have been technical developments elsewhere, as a result of which they get increased yields of milk and increased yields of every sort of crop, and that we are sadly lacking in our application of them.</P>
    <P>There, again, it is easy for me, a townsman, to say these things from a theoretical reading.  I do not want what I have said to be put to this conclusion, that, therefore, the farming part of the community is in default to the rest of the community, because, again, I understand that one of the sore points&mdash;and Deputy Sheldon referred to it&mdash;is the fact that while credit can be made available for all sorts of mad schemes so far as the towns are concerned, credit is restricted, and narrowly restricted, in the countryside.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sheldon referred to Denmark, and I take one extract from the article which I expect is the article on which he founded part of his comments&mdash;a <Col N="735" /> paper read by Dr. Beddy before the Statistical Society in November of last year.  He there gives figures which Deputy Sheldon understated last night.  He gives figures of what is called the capital investment in agriculture here as compared with Denmark.  In Denmark there is a variety of debts arising from different sources, and fed in through different banks and different societies, but the entire total comes to about £198,000,000, and, per acre of cultivated land, the debt is £25 10s. od.  In this country, the debt comparable with that is 25/- per cultivated acre.  If certain other things are taken into the calculation for this country, it might be said for comparison's sake that the debt per cultivated acre is £3 10s. od., but that has to be compared with a debt of £25 10s. od. per cultivated acre in Denmark.</P>
    <P>Debt is something which some people shrink from.  It has been said in a recent book on economics that debt is only a standard, that it is only a testimonial of the credit-worthiness of the person in debt, and that credit, on the other hand, is only a measure of the amount of debt which a person should be allowed to incur.  Debt and credit can be taken as more or less equal, according to these definitions.  Certainly, according to that, here we are again with our enormous external assets abroad of £300,000,000, and we find that the capital investment in agriculture here, at the highest, tots up to £3 10s. od. per cultivated acre, the comparable figure being 25/-; whereas in Denmark the amount invested per cultivated acre is £25 10s. Od.  I think that is the root evil in the whole situation.  It may be that that is over-simplifying a very difficult problem, and, of course, there are all these other problems which speakers here have spoken of in the past four or five days; but that at least is a fundamental matter.</P>
    <P>It is also of interest to note that, in speaking of the national debt of the two States, it is pointed out that there was a time when Denmark occupied the same happy position as we are in, of being a creditor nation.  Away back <Col N="736" /> in 1871, Denmark had a credit balance abroad, but since 1871 she has brought all that money home, and is now a debtor on foreign markets to the extent of nearly £30,000,000.  In 1871, foreign countries owed Denmark money; now Denmark owes the world £30,000,000.  But we are still in the happy position that we have all sorts of people abroad owing us money, and we apparently cannot finance a better agricultural structure than the one that has produced the results I speak of.</P>
    <P>Dr. Beddy, concluding this paper, after speaking of these financial matters, gave certain figures which indicated the standards of living in Denmark and here, and in every point, except, I think, two, we were below the level of Denmark.  We were a greater tea-drinking nation than Denmark, but, on the other hand, Denmark was one of the greatest coffee-drinking nations in the whole community, so that these can be almost wiped out, one against the other.  So far as other things are concerned, excepting only butter and milk, we occupy an inferior position, judged by the test of a standard of living, compared with the Danes, and that particular matter of our greater consumption of butter and milk, according to Dr. Beddy, is a reflection of our relatively low purchasing power, which restricts the shopping activities of the rural population, so that, even on that point, we cannot pride ourselves that it is a sign of a higher standard. Indeed, it is the other way about.</P>
    <P>Finally Dr. Beddy quotes another article which was written by one of the officials of the Agricultural Organisation Society, and, as the two seem to have met on this point, I think it just as well to put the phrase on record for comparison.  In an article in <i>Studies</i> for the month of December, 1938, the phrase is used that the way towards improving the whole condition of this country lies in the full development of our agriculture, on the basis of improved technique to meet the special problems of our climatic conditions. Doctor Beddy's phrase is so nearly an <Col N="737" /> echo of that that I want to get it in in comparison:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If Eire is to advance towards the realisation of her true and greater economic destiny it can only be on the basis of an agricultural system involving a far more intensive utilisation of her natural resources than at present.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later, he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At any rate the task of gearing a more highly developed agricultural system to the most suitable available volume and type of export trade is not an insuperable one.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am not going to weary the House for a much longer period.  I have seen statistical information about our exports.  I have seen these investigated particularly with regard to the export of such things as butter, eggs, poultry and other things of that type. I have seen statistics which show that in a period of about 12 years&mdash;in a period less than ten years&mdash;New Zealand had almost doubled certain exports in these lines in which we are competitors with her.  Our exports virtually have not moved at all.  Sometimes they went up, sometimes they went down, but, on the average, they were about the same.  I know that opposite us there is a great market. People sometimes question in these articles whether, if you did get more intensive cultivation and better agricultural production, you could sell what you produce.  It was pointed out that as far as dairy produce is concerned our pre-war effect on United Kingdom importation was 3 per cent. of all brought in and, if we doubled our exports of dairy products, as a whole, it would mean nothing more or less than the difference between a good and a bad season in England.  We appear to have a market and we appear to have climatic conditions here that other countries envy.  We have for over 20 years, with two Governments, been trying to get our agriculture into a better condition and, at the end, we are still just where we started.  Our marriages are in numbers decreasing, and the time of them is getting later and later.  The flight from marriage and the flight from parenthood is <Col N="738" /> going on.  The flight from the country, which had been stopped about 1930-31, is in progress, and we know from that angle of emigration that we are going to be subjected to much greater temptations in the near future than ever before.  I see nothing in the present Estimate to give us any hope that there is Ministerial policy which will stop that.</P>

      <P>It would take a good while to reply to this long debate, which took six days and in which 56 speakers took part, everyone of them averaging more than half an hour.  One thing that can be said is that there was not a whole lot in the speeches and that there is not much to reply to.  There is another thing that I should mention at this stage, and that is, that the repetition of points raised by Deputies was something it was hard to put up with. Many of the points made during the debate would not have been made if Deputies were better informed with regard to facts and figures, and better informed on what has been done here as compared with other countries, and better informed with regard to the activities in general.  To give an example: Deputy Hughes quoted at length from a Scottish journal of agriculture.  He wanted to point out that people in Scotland had discovered something of which we knew nothing until he mentioned it, that cows that calve in the autumn are much more profitable to the farmer than cows that calve in the spring.  I do not want to claim any credit for what was done in 1910 but, in that year, that experiment was carried out here and was written up at the time in the Journal of the Department of Agriculture. The journal was brought to me to compare with the Scottish journal and it is very difficult to believe that the writer of the article in the Scottish journal had not the article from my Department's journal before him when writing it.  Of course, Deputy Hughes had not that article.  The Deputy would never believe, I am sure, that a thing can be as well done in Ireland as it is done in Scotland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was done.  I should like to read some extracts about the article that was written in 1910, on which we are acting ever since. Deputy Hughes might as well have quoted it as from the Department's journal.  It was just too convincing, but not to Deputy Hughes, because it was done by an Irishman.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It may be assumed with a reasonable amount of certainty that a cow capable of producing 500 gallons of milk per annum when calving in April, will produce 100 to 160 gallons more if calved in November and is suitably housed and fed...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is the conclusion they came to as a result of experiments.  They go on:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Calculating on an increase of 150 gallons at 4.87d. per gallon (the price received for the winter cow's milk in the experiment), and allowing 1d. per gallon for the separated milk, the increased return would be £3 11s. Od. per cow...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>They go on to give the difference in the feeding of the two cows and found that a cow calving in the autumn would cost £1 15s. more to feed than a cow calving in the spring, and so they give the balance on the right side.</P>
      <P>The Department issues a leaflet&mdash; No. 62&mdash;on the management and feeding of dairy cows.  In that leaflet, which can be got now, it says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The time of calving has a considerable influence on the yield of milk.  The best season, so far as the total yield is concerned, is late autumn and early winter.  The principal reason for this is that cows are in good condition after the grass season, and if reasonably well cared and fed after calving, &lsquo;a second spring&rsquo; is made in the month of May when there is a plentiful supply of young pasture.  The yield increases instead of falling off as is the case with spring calvers at a similar stage in their lactation period.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is one instance of the point that I have been making: that if Deputies were a little bit better informed about how things are done here as compared with how they are <Col N="740" /> done in England and Scotland, a lot of the talk that took place in this debate might have been avoided.  As a matter of fact, I do not want to go into great detail on some of the speeches that were made because it would take too long, but I think if some of the Deputies, and in particular Deputy Hughes, would try to believe that things can be done just as well by the scientific people and by the officials of the Department of Agriculture in this country as they can by the officials and scientists in England and Scotland, we would have had a much shorter speech from Deputy Hughes.  If the Deputy were impartial enough to go into facts and figures, I think he would be convinced that, on the whole, things are done just as well here as they are on the other side.</P>
    <P>As I am on the question of facts, I may as well deal with the volume of output about which there was a great deal said in this debate.  I remember that on one day during the debate there was a dispute between two Deputies as to whether the output was £83,000,000 or £86,000,000 in 1942/43.  The strange thing is that the two Deputies were right, because one had read the figure of the net output, and the other had read the figure of gross output.  Unfortunately for us who are trying to get at the facts of the case, the figures relating to volume of output are published as gross output.  Deputies will realise that it makes a great difference whether you take the figure of gross output or net output, because, after all, it must be realised that if you take the year 1943, whatever pigs a farmer fed that year were fed on the barley, oats and potatoes that he produced himself; that whatever hens he fed were fed on the barley, oats and potatoes that he produced himself or perhaps bought from a neighbouring farmer, while in the year 1929/30&mdash;the basic year that we go back on this question of volume of output&mdash;farmers were bringing in any amount of maize and any amount of cake.  They were feeding pigs, poultry and other stock on these imported feeding stuffs, and all the stock counted in the output.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="741" /> After all, in comparing the efforts of the farmer now with his efforts in 1929/30&mdash;the farmer now has to produce all his own feeding stuffs as well as everything else&mdash;it is not fair to say that he has gone down in his output. He has gone down in his gross output. He has less pigs, less hens and less butter, but he has not gone down in his net output.  As a matter of fact he has gone up in his net output.  I do not want to blame any Deputy for what he said on that because the figures were published as gross output.  I think it well, however, that Deputies should know this because I am sure they realise that they might make the point here across the floor against the Government or against the Minister for Agriculture that we were not getting as much now as we got in 1929/30.  But, on the other hand, as this is a question of whether the farmers are doing their duty or not, we should be sure of our facts and figures.  Let us tell the other members of this community in the towns and villages what the farmers are really doing.  The farmers are really doing more now than they were in 1929/30 or in 1938/39.  I will give the House the figures because, I think, this is a thing that should go on record so that Deputies will know how we stand.</P>
    <P>The gross value of output was quoted by many Deputies.  As there was some dispute about it, perhaps I should give the figures.  In 1943-44 the gross output in value was £86,250,000; in 1938-39 it was £53,500,000, and in 1929-30 it was £62,000,000.  These figures were, I think, quoted by many speakers.  As far as they go they are all right. There is one thing that we must take to get nett output, and that is the farmer's outlay on seeds, fertilisers and feeding stuffs, and it is that which makes a big difference between gross and nett output when we compare one year with another.  The amount that he spent on these items in 1942-43 was only £2,500,000, because they were not to be got, but in 1938-39 he spent on them £8,750,000, and in 1929-30 he spent £10,000,000.  We must now deduct these from the gross output, already given, and when we do that <Col N="742" /> we get the following result: for 1912-43 £83,750,000; for 1938-39 £44,750,000; and for 1929-30 £52,000,000.  Now we have got, I think, a different picture.</P>
    <P>I do not know if Deputies are aware&mdash;I presume some of them are not, because I did not know it myself until I came to examine the position&mdash; of how the volume of output is got. It is got in this way.  They took the volume in 1929-30.  A certain value was taken for each commodity in that volume.  Cattle were worth so much per head, according to the statistics of that year, sheep were worth so much, and so on.  Cattle were classified in different classes perhaps.  At any rate they had a unit value for everything in the output.  They took the output again in 1942-43, and they said: &ldquo;Suppose we got the same value on our output in 1942-43 for every item that we got in 1929-30, then how do they compare?&rdquo; That is how the volume of output is got&mdash;by comparison.  On that basis, taking the nett volume of output, we find that the volume of output in 1942-43 was 9 per cent. above 1938-39 and was 10.3 per cent. above the volume in 1929-30, so that really Deputies were arguing on a false basis all through this debate on the volume of output, because we find, on examination of the position, that farmers did better in 1942-43 with regard to volume of output than they did in 1929-30, and that their efforts in production were much more successful.</P>
    <P>I noticed that all through this debate there were speakers day after day and hour after hour getting up here and talking as if it was an accepted fact that there were less cattle in this country than in the pre-war period, or prior to 1932.  There is no such thing.  As a matter of fact, these figures are published.  Deputies could, perhaps, claim that they are not getting the figures with regard to imports and exports, but statistics of live stock are published every year, and no Deputy has any excuse for basing an argument on a false figure. It does not lead us anywhere, because after all, every Deputy and every Party claims that they are out to do the best they can.  Many Deputies said that before they sat down.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="743" /> But, you cannot do your best by falsifying or mis-stating facts.  You must keep to the facts, so far as you can, and you must accept the figures that are given.  I do not claim that these statistical figures are correct to the very last cow, or the last pig, but we have always accepted them here, and comparing them, one year with another, they are reliably correct.  The number of cows has gone down by 40,000 in five years.  Five years ago the total number was 1,344,000; in 1943 it was 1,305,000, so that, in fact, the figures went down by about 40,000 in the five year period.  That is not a very appreciable reduction, it is a very small percentage, and it would not by any means account for any appreciable shortage of milk or butter.  As a matter of fact, you had big variations in every five year period before the war and we have always maintained in any argument we may have had, that the number of cows has remained remarkably constant over the last 25 years.  The number of cattle, especially older cattle, is higher than it was pre-war, so there again, if we are going to discuss agriculture, let us discuss it on a correct basis as far as we can anyway, and when we have got the correct basis, let us go ahead and draw our conclusions.</P>
    <P>There is also a misunderstanding&mdash;I do not say a deliberate misunderstanding&mdash;with regard to the question of the Livestock Breeding Act, the number of bulls licensed and the premiums of the different breeds.  The fact that a bull is passed for premium does not mean that he is going to get a premium.</P>
    <P>Bulls are exhibited in the Dublin Show and other shows for premiums. Inspectors from my Department mark a bull as up to premium standard, and if he is not up to it, they do not mark him.  Now, there may be, for instance, 100 people in that Dublin Show with authority from their county committees to buy bulls, but there may be either 200 bulls or only 50 at the show; so the number of bulls has nothing to do with the policy of the Department.  It only shows in the class of Aberdeen Angus that there was a large number <Col N="744" /> of bulls up to premium standard, or that in the Herefords there was a large number up to standard, and so on.  But it does not show at all whether all these bulls will be brought as premium bulls, or whether the Department has a policy of pushing Hereford bulls, or Shorthorns, or Aberdeen Angus, or anything else.</P>
    <P>There is one thing that we should keep in mind: that the Dublin Show is the principal show for the beef breeds. Practically all the Hereford premiums and the Aberdeen Angus premiums are given at the Dublin Show, because all these bulls are brought to that show. You have provincial shows like Cork, Limerick and Waterford, where practically all the bulls are Shorthorns, so that we must take all the shows together to form a picture.  I will give you an idea of the number of bulls passed both for licences and premiums, and it will convey some idea of how cattle breeding is moving in this country.</P>
    <P>First of all, I should say this in answer to the criticisms that inspectors who are inspecting for licences take no cognisance of the breeding of the bull, but judge altogether on conformation, that that is not right, and I would like to say that these inspectors are farmers&mdash;all farmers selected for the purpose&mdash;and are likely to have the same considerations in mind and to be actuated by the same motives as Deputies here are.  They are told that if any bull has a tattoo mark showing that he is descended on both sides from a good milking strain, they must, in that case, be much easier on the conformation of the bull than otherwise they would be.  They are instructed to be easy on bulls of milking strain.  The numbers of bulls licensed in 1943 were as follows: Shorthorns, 11,327; Herefords, 694; Aberdeen Angus, 421; all other breeds, 178. There you see that you have about 1,200 of all breeds except Shorthorns, and about 12,000 Shorthorns.</P>
    <P>Now take the premiums.  Licensing, as Deputies are aware, is largely a matter for the breeder himself.  The breeder presents his bull if he wants his licence, and you cannot take it as indicating the policy of the Department <Col N="745" /> in regard to breeding.  It is not altogether Department policy.  The Department does not interfere to any great extent with the county committees of agriculture.  They do lay down that the county committee may give up to 28 premiums for Double Dairy Shorthorn bulls and those premiums may be continued for an indefinite number of years; but on the other hand, where premiums are given by a county committee for Aberdeen Angus or Herefords, they must not exceed £15 and they may be paid only for four years.</P>
    <P>The policy of the Department is to try to give preference to the dairy bull rather than to the beef breeds, and I should say that they have not allowed any county to give less than two-fifths of their premiums to dairy Shorthorn bulls.  Under those schemes of the county committees, the number of Shorthorn bull premiums in 1943 was 1,597, and of these, 1,176 were dairy Shorthorns; Herefords, 326; Aberdeen Angus, 357; others, Kerrys in particular, and Galloway, 44.  A great deal was said in this debate about trying to influence the breed of our cattle.  I have told Deputies what the Department has done to try to influence breeding.  We have given a preference to the Double Dairy Shorthorn.  We have given preference to the Single Dairy Shorthorn and we have tried as far as possible to get county committees to give that preference.  We have compelled them, to a certain extent, through the value of the premium, and also to the extent that no county committee is permitted to give less than two-fifths of its premiums for Dairy Shorthorns.</P>
    <P>There are certain counties, as a matter of fact, which give all their premiums to Shorthorns.  I do not think we can go very much further as a Department.  We were asked to do some zoning by Deputy Dillon and others.  It was suggested that we should, in certain districts, permit nothing but bulls like the Holstein, the Galloway, and so on and, in the creamery districts, we should permit nothing but the Shorthorns, and in other districts, like the grazing districts, as we might call them, we could <Col N="746" /> permit the beef breeds.  We have not, in the Department, ever interfered or contemplated interfering to that extent. We have interfered to some extent, but the county committees are quite free to zone if they wish.  Any county committee can zone for Shorthorns, but we do not permit them to zone for the beef breeds.  Some of the dairy counties, such as Cork and Limerick, have gone in altogether for Shorthorn cattle.</P>
    <P>I do not think you will solve this problem by changing the breed or the colour of the cow.  I heard Deputy Corry, who is a very strong advocate of the Holstein, claiming&mdash;and I was surprised he did not claim more&mdash;that a herd of Holsteins will give you an average of 550 gallons.  I think any Deputy here knows that a herd of Shorthorns, if they are properly fed, will give you 550 gallons.  We need not go into the breeding of them at all.  If they are Shorthorns and are fed properly they will give you 550 gallons, so, if you feed the Holsteins you might as well feed the Shorthorns, and you will have good store cattle that you would not have in the case of the Holsteins.</P>
    <P>References were made to seed wheat and some Deputy said there was bungling.  It is all very fine to talk about bungling when the thing is over. I have often been struck in the Dáil with the extreme foresight of the Opposition when the thing is over.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was asked about it, and I said things would be all right or probably all right.  If I said things were not going to be all right, the Deputy knows very well what would happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to take a chance in regard to those things and sometimes we may be wrong.  We were doing our best to get all the wheat we could.  Three or four years ago what was the position and what questions were asked in the Dáil?  I was being asked then would I compensate certain persons because they got bad seed and because the wheat did not grow.  Deputies <Col N="747" /> know very well that that was what happened four, five or six years ago&mdash; that the people who purported to be seed merchants were sending wheat out to farmers which did not germinate; it was not fit to be regarded as seed wheat at all.</P>
    <P>We had to take action and protect the farmer and we had to see that he got proper seed wheat.  We licensed the merchants who were prepared to deal properly in seed and we had to make two classes.  We thought we could get enough seed merchants who would treat the wheat as we would like them to treat it, so that there would be proper kiln drying, proper storage, proper cleaning and a proper germination test, and then that they would sell it as absolutely guaranteed.  We found we had not sufficient equipment to give us all the seed we required. We had not only to allow seed merchants properly equipped to go into the business, but we had to allow others who would buy and clean and store the wheat under the direction of the Department of Agriculture and who would have a germination test. There was no kiln drying in their case &mdash;that was the difference.  We let them in, too, because we found we could not get enough seed otherwise.</P>
    <P>Having done that, we found we had 300,000 people in the business and we told them to get all the wheat they could.  We authorised them to get 180,000 barrels of winter varieties and 245,000 barrels of spring varieties but, unfortunately, they did not get it.  If they had got it we would have plenty, but they did not get it.  We were told in November it was hard to get good samples of seed wheat, but we kept advising them to do their very best. They did assemble 300,000 barrels.  We authorised them to get 400,000 barrels. Even with the 300,000 barrels, if things worked out the same this year as in other years, we would have enough. Our experience up to this was that more than half the land was seeded with the farmers' own wheat.  If that happened this year we would have enough, but we were unlucky both ways.  This year more than half the farmers came to the merchants looking <Col N="748" /> for seed and we had to turn on the Manitoba wheat that was referred to by many speakers here.</P>
    <P>I should like to say that we have had reports with regard to Manitoba wheat. It was sold in this country some years ago and I remember seeing it growing. We had reports of Manitoba wheat sown within the past few years and these reports are quite good.  It is a suitable wheat and the germination is very good in the samples we have had. It is a quick ripening wheat, quicker perhaps than our own variety, and it has very good standing qualities.  I think Manitoba wheat should work out all right.  Possibly&mdash;I will not say this for certain&mdash;it will not give the same yield on really good land as some of the varieties developed here, like Atle and some other good varieties.</P>
    <P>We are not very much short.  So far as I can see now, and we are coming towards the close of the period when seed wheat will be going out to the farmers, Manitoba wheat is going to count for about 3 or 5 per cent. of our crop.  That is not very much, but if we had not the Manitoba wheat there we would be hearing from people that we could have 20 or 30 per cent. more wheat if we had the seed, so it is very well to have it.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to cow-testing associations.  They drew attention to the fact that the Estimate was reduced.  That was a very small point. The amount of money going to the associations remains the same.  The only reduction was something like £100 in connection with travelling expenses. That reduction was made because some of the people concerned have no way of travelling.  There is no doubt that whatever money should go to the associations will go to them, even if they exceed the estimate.  The estimate represents what we think may be spent, but we are not tied to that estimate, and we are not in the position that we cannot spend more if the money is earned or is due to the associations.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Halliden said we should do a little more for cow-testing. I do not know what more we could do. I gave in detail what we have been <Col N="749" /> doing for cow-testing associations.  I may be wrong, but I went to some trouble to find out, and I cannot find any Government in any other country that is doing more than we are doing for cow testing.  I do not think the Government could be expected to do more than they are doing.  I do not agree at all that we can make this matter compulsory.  I had a proposition considered very fully some years ago.  It was put to me that we should give, say, a few shillings per cwt. more to those creameries who have all their cows under test as against those who have not their cows under test.  That looked to me to be a very attractive proposition at first.  But, when you consider that proposition fully, you say to yourself: &ldquo;A circular goes out to the creameries stating that their price for butter in the coming year is, say, 240/- but, if all their supplying members are in a cow-testing association they will get 5/- per cwt. more.&rdquo; Naturally the committee will try to get that 5/-.  They will set up a cow-testing association and, in turn, they will say to their members: &ldquo;If you join the cow-testing association you will get something like a farthing a gallon more than the present price,&rdquo; so that every member is tempted to join.  Will that be any good?</P>
    <P>I do not think that being a member of a cow-testing association is of any use unless you want to be in it and are enthusiastic about being in it because, unless you go to the trouble of doing the things that you must do for the purpose of keeping the figures correctly week after week, you might as well not be in it at all.  Obviously, if you compel members to go into a cow-testing association for the purpose of getting a farthing per gallon more for the milk, or something of that kind, they will do the thing in a haphazard way; they will not do the thing properly and will get no benefit from the association. What is more, I am afraid that it would have a very bad effect on cow-testing in the future.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk about loans for farmers.  Deputy McGilligan gave me the impression&mdash;I do not know whether he gave it to the House or not&mdash;that the more money farmers <Col N="750" /> owe, the more prosperous a country will be.  He pointed out that the Danish farmers owed £25 per acre and that we owe only 25/-.  He talked about the progress and so on in Denmark and gave me the impression&mdash;I suppose he gave the impression to other Deputies&mdash;that the more you owe the better the country is.  I do not know whether that is right.  Perhaps it is, because economists can prove anything.  But I am certain that, if the case were reversed and our farmers owed £180,000,000 and the Danish farmers owed only £9,000,000, we would get a lecture from Deputy McGilligan about the amount that our farmers were in debt as compared with the farmers in Denmark.  Deputy McGilligan is prepared to put the argument the other way.  I am 17 years in this House and Deputy McGilligan was here before I came in. I will say, with all due deliberation, that in these 17 years I never heard Deputy McGilligan make a constructive proposal.  He is the best critic I ever heard; he would destroy any case, or knock down any case.  But I never heard him build up a case.  Perhaps I will be told I am wrong, but I would be interested to find out what constructive proposals he made in these 17 years.  It is the easiest thing in the world to be destructive and to point out to the other fellow how he is wrong.  I think, if I sat down and thought about it, that I could prove that Deputy Anthony was wrong in his speech and point out all the mistakes that Deputy Flanagan, Deputy Larkin and others made in their speeches. But I do not see what good that would be if I could not tell them what they should have said.  Deputy McGilligan does not do that, and never did.</P>
    <P>He talked a lot about a speech made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I will not enter into that.  I know Deputy McGilligan too well to accept his interpretation of the Minister's speech, and I shall leave it to the Minister to deal with that, if he so wishes, on a future occasion.</P>
    <P>There were a few points, however, that Deputy McGilligan mentioned which I should like just to refer to. He spoke, for instance, about potatoes and said that only a small proportion <Col N="751" /> of the potatoes grown were used for human food.  That is true.  Probably about 20 per cent. of the potato crop is used for human food; the rest of the crop goes to animals.  But I do not think that any Deputy said that last year there was a panic in connection with the potato supply in Dublin and that, at the same time, potatoes were rotting in the ditches down the country.  I think he is mixing up two years.  I think the case the Deputies made was that in 1943 we had not enough potatoes and that the year before we had too much.  That is a different thing from what Deputy McGilligan said.  It is regrettable, but it is not, as Deputy McGilligan made out, a question of want of organisation to bring the potatoes that were rotting in ditches in the country to Dublin, where they were wanted.  The two years do not correspond, and that made the difference.  The fact is that we grow a good acreage of potatoes. We use about 20 per cent. for human food and the rest of them are fed to animals.  Sometimes we overshoot the mark, we have too much, there is a slump, and it is hard to know what to do with them at the end of the year. Sometimes there is a scarcity and it is hard to get enough potatoes at the end of the year.  Even a superman could hardly foresee, not only the acreage and the variety, but the weather that we will get, because the potato crop depends to a great extent on the weather during the year.  There is also the question of blight.  Many Deputies spoke about planning.  It is all right for Deputy Larkin to talk about planning.  You may plan for a big business, but you cannot plan for a potato crop, because there are bigger forces than Deputy Larkin or anyone else can contend with&mdash;the forces that control the weather and interfere with the potato crop.</P>
    <P>Then take the oats crop.  Deputy McGilligan said that only a small part of the oats crop is used for human food.  That is true.  Only about six or seven per cent. of the oats crop is required for human food; the remainder is fed to animals.  Sometimes people feeding animals overdo it.  They <Col N="752" /> conclude that there is not such a good market for oats and they feed the oats to animals, so that before the year is out we have not sufficient oats for human consumption because people who had oats did not keep sufficient. Sometimes they keep too much for human consumption and, towards the end of the year, we have too much for animals and there is a slump.  It is very difficult to avoid these things. We can only do the best we can to avoid them, but it is not so easy as some Deputies may think.</P>
    <P>Deputy Childers spoke of a few matters that I think are interesting. There is, for instance, the question that was referred to in the debate later by Deputy McGilligan&mdash;the joint or co-operative ownership of machinery. Deputy Dillon also mentioned it.  I think that that is a question that will certainly have to be considered when the war is over.  I think we will have to consider all the arguments for and against; whether it should be done by the parish unit, as some Deputies said; whether it should be done cooperatively or whether it should be done by the local authorities or the central authority; whether or not we should increase the power machinery on the land or whether we should stick to horse-drawn machinery.  It will have to be considered.  I think every Deputy realises that there are arguments for and against it.  One of the big arguments that I see against it is that if we had done that, say, ten years ago and had mechanised every parish in this country, the parish unit having all their tractors and tractor ploughs, reapers and binders and so on, of course, they would be all idle now because there would be no paraffin for them.  I am afraid that, circumstanced as we are, it would be a dangerous thing to advocate giving up the horse altogether.  The horse will be always useful.</P>
    <P>Another matter that Deputy Childers referred to was the question of the Young Farmers' Club.  I read a lot about that organisation in the English farming journals.  I suppose it has a use but I do not think it is the type of thing a Government could organise. I do not think it is the kind of thing <Col N="753" /> a Department of Agriculture could organise. I think it is a movement which would have to be organised by people outside and, when that is done, we can see how we are going to treat them.</P>
    <P>Veterinary research was spoken of a good deal.  It is a very big subject.  I mentioned in my opening speech that I had come to the conclusion that we need to spend more money on veterinary research in this country.  I still believe that, of course.  The only thing is, as I pointed out, that it will mean more accommodation for our veterinary research station, more equipment, more personnel and, as I mentioned then and reiterate for the benefit of Deputies who may not have been present at that time, we have the quality; we have really good men in this country in the veterinary profession but they want more help and we must get it for them.</P>
    <P>A point raised by many Deputies was the question of middlemen's profits. Many Deputies talked about the small price the farmer got and the big amount the consumer had to pay.  That is not true in all cases.  Deputy Cafferky, for instance, mentioned that, and the two cases he took were butter and bacon&mdash;the two most unfortunate cases he could take from the point of view of his argument.  From the 1st April, the creamery will pay the farmer 10½d. per gallon.  If you take it that two and one-third gallons of milk make a pound of butter, it means that the farmer gets 2/0½ for the amount of milk that goes into a pound of butter. That milk goes through all the manufacturing process of the creamery, is railed to Dublin or somewhere else, carries wholesalers' and retailers' profits, and the consumer gets it for 2/4. Can Deputy Cafferky or anybody else say that that could be done any better?  Out of the 2/4 that the consumer pays there is only 3½d. for all these intermediate operations and 2/0½ for the farmer.  Surely to goodness, that cannot be improved upon.  Take bacon.  Bacon is a thing that is often quoted.  In particular, the members of Clann na Talmhan seem to have&mdash; shall I call it an obsession?&mdash;on this question of bacon.</P>

      <P>A monopoly or obsession. Even if a member of the Clann na Talmhan brings his pig to the market or the factory, he looks to get 160/- a cwt. at the present time.  Every member of the Clann na Talmhan, I am sure, has killed a pig in his time, if he did not see pigs killed at the factory, and he knows that when a side of pork is turned into bacon it is a good deal lighter.  As a matter of fact, the bacon is only 75 per cent. of the weight of pork.  So the factory has paid 160/- for 112 lbs. of pork which will make 75 per cent. of the weight in bacon.  On that basis it will take 160/- plus a third of that to get enough bacon to make a cwt.; that is 213/-, is it not?  213/- is what the factory pays for the makings of one cwt. of bacon, and if a member of Clann na Talmhan goes into any shop in this country and buys a side of bacon, he must get that side of bacon, legally, for 250/-.  The difference is only 4d. a lb.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only talking about the side of bacon.  The factory, as Deputy Hughes reminds me, is able to run its business on the offal.  That is correct.  They are.  They admit that they are able to run their business on the offal.  The factory has to despatch that bacon and pay for carriage, perhaps to a wholesaler, perhaps direct to a retailer, but, anyway, all there is in it for carriage and for the wholesaler or retailer is 4d. per lb.  That is all they have between them.  It is a very different story from what we heard from Deputy Cafferky.  Deputy O'Higgins said here last night that the <Col N="755" /> farmer who sold his wheat sold it for 50/- and bought it back for £5.  The price of seed wheat, according to what I paid, is 70/- a barrel.  As a matter of fact, that is top price.  In case any Deputy might think that I got it at less than the top price, I did not. Even if I did sell that wheat for 50/-, which I bought back for 70/-, what had happened to it in the meantime? First of all, say, I sold it last October. The merchant took it in; he cleaned it; he took a certain percentage of small grain and grains that were not wheat at all out of it&mdash;of course, he put that to some use, I admit, but they were not worth 50/- a barrel&mdash;he then kiln-dried it, reduced the percentage of moisture by 3, 4 or 5, and perhaps 6 per cent.</P>
      <P>That represented a dead loss in weight.  He then stored it, under conditions prescribed by the Department of Agriculture.  Of course, he paid me when he bought the wheat last October and, therefore, was paying interest on his capital.  He did all that service for £1 a barrel.  It may be a great deal but I would much prefer to pay that 70/- for that barrel of wheat than to keep my own barrel at 50/- because I know it is worth more to me than the difference of £1 a barrel.</P>

      <P>Deputy Meighan talks about potatoes down the country selling at 5/-, 8/- and 9/- a cwt., and seed being sold at 3/- a stone.  Again, I bought some potatoes.  I have been looking up the price.  I see the price of half a ton of British Queen seed potatoes was £5 5s. Od.&mdash;10/6 a cwt. That is not too bad.  I believe they are getting up to 8/- a cwt. down the country.  They are brought up here. Perhaps there is no trouble as they are graded before they come up.  They are certified potatoes.  They have to be handed out to me.  I do not think that is a very big margin, especially as this is only an invoice and I have not paid the man yet.</P>
      <P>Then there is a half-ton of Kerr's Pink at £5 5s.  Those are sold in large quantities.  Earlier in the year I went in for a stone of May Queen, and a stone of Epicure, early potatoes, and the price was 2/- a stone.  That is what I paid for them.  Mind you, I do not want to be taken as defending the merchants. I think the merchants are doing very well.  On the other hand, I think the Departments concerned are not lax in looking after those matters, and, when we do make an agreement with seed merchants, for instance, to assemble wheat, we have always insisted that there should be a reasonable price charged to the farmer at the other end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another case quoted was that of milk.  Those are very ordinary ways in which Deputies sometimes let their enthusiasms <Col N="757" /> run away with them.  They say: &ldquo;Look at the farmer getting 9d. a gallon for his milk and the consumer paying 3/4 up here.&rdquo;  Of course, it is not the same gallon of milk&mdash;that is all. The gallon of milk that is sold for 9d. goes into butter.  As far as that milk is concerned, the consumer up here is paying only about 1d. extra on the gallon of milk when he gets it as butter.  If we are going to talk about the consumers' price in Dublin, let us take it as it should be taken.  The man who supplies milk to Dublin gets a much higher price than the creamery supplier.  He must get a higher price. The creamery supplier is what is known as a grass farmer, a summer milker.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought he had autumn calvers according to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  He did not take our advice.  He might have taken the Scottish advice that Deputy Hughes talked about.  He has a number of cows; they calve about the month of April, and very often they are in a very poor way when they are calving, after their hard winter.  They are milked all the summer.  They are fed on grass principally, and only get hay during the winter.  That is the usual history of those creamery cows.  That is grass-produced milk&mdash;the milk sold at 9d. a gallon.  The supplier is not under any obligation to the creamery to give them 20 gallons or 30 gallons or 100 gallons on any day.  Some days he may give them 20 gallons and some days only five.  When the supply runs short in October, it does not make any difference; there is no penalty.  But when a person comes to supply milk in Dublin he must keep up the supply all the year round.  He must give his 20 gallons every day.  It may vary 5 per cent. or 10 per cent&mdash;not more than 10 per cent., anyway.  The result is that he must feed his cows very well to keep them going all the winter. When his supply of milk is going down, in order to hold his contract he must go out and buy a cow.  He must pay a high price for that cow because he buys her at a dear time.  Then he finds that his herd is too big for his holding; he must get rid of his dry <Col N="758" /> cow, so he sends her to the canner. There is a big loss on that transaction. There is a big difference between the price he receives for the dry cow and that which he pays for the other one. The result of all this is that he is paid a whole lot more for his milk.  The producer here in Dublin in 1943 got an average of 1/8¼ for his milk.  That was his average for the year.  I know there is milk sold in Dublin at 3/- and 3/4 a gallon.  It is brought to the people's doors and handed out to them, perhaps, in bottles.  That is a service that they can afford to pay for if they want it brought to their doors.  I am concerned only with the person who goes into the shop and takes what is called loose milk over the counter&mdash;the woman who comes in and holds out her own jug for a pint or two pints of milk.  That costs an average of 2/4 a gallon.  Those are comparative prices. The producer gets 1/8¼ a gallon, taking the whole year round, for the Dublin supply.  The person who goes to the shop pays 2/4.  That is a difference of 7¾d.  It is not the difference between 9d. and 3/4; it is a difference of 7¾d.</P>
      <P>Those are some of the cases that were mentioned here as showing the extraordinary gap between what the farmers get and what the consumer pays.  If any other case that was mentioned were gone into in detail we would find that there is an equally good explanation of whatever the gap may be.  Before I leave that, I do not want to say that the seed merchant, the milk distributor or the provision merchant is not getting too much. Perhaps the Minister for Supplies will say to-morrow that he is getting too much, and will cut him a bit.  If he does, I am not going to object.  There was some talk about fixity of tenure. It is not, I believe, in order in this debate, but I should like to say this: perhaps Clann na Talmhan will tell us, during the debate on the Estimate for Lands, exactly what they mean by fixity of tenure, because I believe that fixity of tenure means that every farmer holds on to his own land, and how Deputy Cafferky is going to get land for other people under that system I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="759" /> Continuous cereal growing was referred to here, and Deputies spoke as if I were an advocate of continuous cereal growing.  I have talked myself hoarse at meetings of county committees of agriculture down the country telling farmers for goodness' sake not to be obeying the tillage Order in the letter, but to obey it in the spirit and do their tillage in proper rotation, and so on.  That is what I want.  I mentioned it everywhere I went.  I want to see the rotation that is practised in good tillage counties: one or two cereal crops, a root crop with manure, a cereal crop again, with grass seeds and with clover, and let down for grazing.  That is the lea farmer we heard of so often.  I mentioned clover, because Deputy Dillon asked whether we were advocating clover.  We are, of course, because when that land has to be tilled again, as it may have to be tilled again before this crisis is over, the clover crop will have added humus and nitrogen to the soil and will leave that area in a much better condition for tillage than it was before.  We heard some talk about this continuous cereal growing as far as wheat is concerned.  Of course that is wrong, but there is one thing I do not agree with at all, and it was mentioned by Deputy McGilligan, Deputy Dillon and other Deputies as, I suppose, what might be called a <i>post factum</i> defence for their anti-wheat campaign from 1933 to 1939.</P>
    <P>What they say now is that those people who were growing wheat from 1933 to 1939 are not able to grow it at present.  There is no truth whatever in that assertion.  Every Deputy who is honest with himself must admit that the tillage farmers who grew wheat all the time are still growing wheat better than the fellows who started in the last four or five years.  I myself have grown well over 10 per cent. of my land under wheat since 1933, and I certainly have no lower yield this year than I had in 1933 or 1934 or 1935.  It can be done; there is no doubt about that.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot of talk about the farm labourer.  We have heard it from people like Deputy Larkin, who <Col N="760" /> know nothing about the farm labourer, and from people who know all about him, like Deputy Cole.  Everybody who knows the conditions in the country knows that Deputy Cole was much nearer the truth than Deputy Larkin, who talked about coolie labour.  Deputy Cole gave us what are the usual conditions of the farm labourer and the usual relations that obtain between employer and employee.</P>
    <P>Those Deputies who do not know anything about the country should remember that the farm labourer has a very much cheaper house than the labourer in the city or town.  I think the average rent payable by a farm labourer for his house, a very good house, is about 2/3 or 2/6 per week. In fact some rents are very much lower.  I am putting them fairly high, if you like.  These Deputies do not know that in all cases, at least in cases where you have a decent employer, the farm labourer gets free milk, free potatoes and free vegetables, and if not, he is given a plot in which to grow vegetables.  He gets all these perquisites and he is provided with an opportunity of getting firewood on his employer's farm.  I should like to know what valuation a labourer in the town would put on these perquisites.  The agricultural labourer has a low rent, free milk, potatoes and vegetables and practically free firewood.  We must keep these things in mind.  They are not given by way of charity.  They are the right of the man who receives them and they are part of his bargain. When the terms on which he is employed are fixed his employer tells him that he will give him free milk, potatoes and vegetables.  These things should be kept in mind when Deputies ask me: &ldquo;Do you think that £2 per week is enough to live on?&rdquo;  It is very hard for anybody to say on the other hand that £3 is enough for a man in the City of Dublin to live on but a lot of them have to do it.  It is not fair to put a question like that to anybody.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of the Agricultural Wages Board.  It was set up in 1936 and there was a Labour Party here at the time.  The Labour <Col N="761" /> Party as far as I remember, made no protest against the provisions of the Act setting up this board.  The provisions of the Act were that the Minister for Agriculture should appoint representatives of employers and employees for the regional councils throughout the country and that on the boards he would appoint the chairman and three members.  I do not remember the Labour Party saying that I was wrong.  I know that the Labour members were delighted to see these wages boards being set up because it did not pay them to organise the agricultural labourers themselves.  They made no secret of that.  They made no protest and I think you will find, although I have not read the debates on the matter recently, that I was appealed to at that time not to interfere with the chairman.  I did not.  It is laid down in the Act that the chairman fixes the wage and he never refers to me.  He does, as a matter of courtesy, send me a copy of his order before he publishes it, but I have never done more than to read the order.  I never try to influence or to change it in any way.  The chairman is not bound to send it to me; he can publish the order without giving it to me at all.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the point of whether or not agricultural labourers should get more.  That is the point the board had to contend with. The board is up against a certain position and it is not an imaginary position. The members see what the farmer is in receipt of and the various things he can sell.  The labourers' representative on the board, on the other hand, sees what the labourer can live on with the present cost of living. The two points of view are put before the board, the labourer naturally trying to get more and the farmers saying that they cannot pay any more at the present time.  Although there is a provision in the Act that if agreement is not reached between the two parties, the chairman can fix the wage, I am glad to say that in 1943 and 1944 the chairman was presented with a unanimous decision.  There you have reasonable men, and we need not mind whether or not there are members of certain organisations on these boards.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="762" /> I quite admit that we have no members of the Workers' Union representing the labourers in County Dublin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take that as a threat. This is the first time that Deputy Larkin thought of organising agricultural labourers.  There must be something in it.  The chief consideration, however, is that the machinery is working smoothly.  I think it would be better if all Parties in this House let things that are working smoothly pass without interference.  I said in my opening statement that if we divided the total income from agriculture equally amongst all the people engaged in agriculture in this country, so that the small farmer in Donegal and Mayo and his sons and daughters would get just as much as the big farmer in County Kildare, they would receive something like £2 each.  They do not, of course, get an equal share, but that is the amount they would get if the total income were equally divided.  If you take it, therefore, that our agricultural income represents something over £2 per week for everybody engaged in the industry, a wage of £2 per week for labourers appears to be near the mark.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hughes said the Department was remiss on the question of dealing with contagious abortion.  If he read leaflet No. 13 he would have seen that the Department strongly advise that the agglutination test be carried out, always provided that the veterinary surgeon asks for it.</P>

      <P>Why should we, if the veterinary surgeon says there is no necessity for it?  Deputy Cafferky referred to the constitution of consultative councils.  I do not know if Deputy Cafferky, if he were in my position, would man these councils with supporters of Clann na Talmhan. I would never think of suggesting to any Party that they should adopt that practice.  The principal council, the Advisory Council on Production, is composed of every county committee <Col N="763" /> of agriculture in Ireland, and there are some supporters of Clann na Talmhan amongst them, together with representatives of certain organisations such as the organisation in which Deputy Halliden is interested&mdash;the Dairy Shorthorn Breeders' Society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come now to the question of the price of milk which was referred to by many Deputies.  We must be clear on one thing in dealing with this question: an increase in the price of milk to the creamery means an increase in the price of butter.  It cannot be avoided, and I am not talking from the Exchequer point of view.  It cannot be avoided if we are to be fair to farmers. I have told you already that it takes 2? gallons of milk to make a pound of butter.  The farmer gets 10½d. per gallon.  Farmers who want to dispose of milk in this country sell it in four main ways.  They sell it to a creamery, they sell it for consumption as milk, they sell it as butter to a Cork butter merchant, or they sell butter direct to the consumer or to a retail shop for sale to consumers.  I do not know exactly how these four classes compare in output, but one thing we know is that those who sell butter rather than milk are a very substantial class.  Quite a number of farmers sell butter either to the butter merchants for manufacture into factory butter or to retailers for sale to consumers. Quite a number of farmers depend on this class of business.  You cannot ignore these farmers.  It takes 2? gallons of milk to make a pound of butter in the creamery.  We reverse the position.  We say to the Cork butter merchants&mdash;I met them to-day&mdash;&ldquo;You must give the same amount as the creameries are giving.&rdquo;  That is to say, if we assume that 2? gallons of milk from the farmer make a pound of butter, then it is worth 2/0½ and the butter merchants must give 2/0½ for it. Suppose we give 1/- a gallon for milk, is it not obvious that the Cork butter merchants, in order to give the farmer who is not sending milk to the creamery the same advantage as the farmer who is sending milk to the creamery, must give him 4d. more for his pound of butter, or 2/4½?  The <Col N="764" /> retailer who takes butter from the farmer for sale must also give 4d. extra and farmers' butter must be sold at 2/8.  If farmers' butter is sold at 2/8, creamery butter must also go up in price to 2/8.  That shows that, if there is to be an increase in the price of milk to the creameries, there must be an increase in the price of butter.  You could subsidise the butter going to the factories in Cork for manufacturing purposes but you could not subsidise butter that is being supplied all over the country to consumers, either directly or by retailers, because too many persons are involved.  We tried that on one occasion before but we could not do it.  Deputies like Deputy Byrne&mdash;it would be his mentality, and he said it here to-day&mdash;argue that more should be given to the farmer but that the increase should not be passed on to the consumer.  That cannot be done. The price must go up to the consumer. No Deputy can have it both ways.  If he proposes to vote for this price of 1/- a gallon for milk, he must vote at the same time for a price of 2/8 per 1b. for butter.</P>
    <P>What was the case made for increasing the price?  Many Deputies urged that the farmer was not getting enough for his milk.  That is only an assertion.  Butter production, we were told, is going down.  Another assertion, which may be either true or false.  We were told that if we did not give this increase we should have no butter next year.  Very little was said as to why the farmer should get more.  We were told by some Deputies that it was impossible to get labour to milk the cows. If the cows are not milked at all, that means that we are finished so far as butter is concerned.  No Deputy said that there would be any improvement if 1/- a gallon were allowed instead of 10½d.  The number of cows is not going down.  The yield of the cows is, undoubtedly, going down.  We have increased the price of milk to the creameries since 1939 by a little more than 100 per cent.  That is on the price of 10½d.  I think that 100 per cent. increase is very good when compared with the increase in anything else on the farm or in any other line.  This increase was only announced last September <Col N="765" /> or October.  It will not come into operation until the 1st April.  We have not yet given it a trial.  A number of increases were made in the price of milk since 1939.  We went down a little bit in production this year&mdash;very little.  We should give this price of 10½d. a trial and see if we hold our own in 1944-45.  We may do better than we did last year.  The reduction in production is not so much.  There is a reduction of about 1 per cent. between the figure for this year and that for last year.  It is true that we have not enough butter.  I do not want to trouble Deputies with figures, but I ask Deputies to read the figures with which I furnished Deputy O Briain in reply to a question yesterday.  I set out there the production and consumption of butter and the imports and exports in all recent years up to the time the war commenced.  Deputies will find from these figures that, no matter what anybody may say, the consumption of butter has gone up enormously in recent years.  There are some figures of which one cannot be very sure, such as the number of cows in the country. That figure is estimated by the Gárda. But there is a figure which can be vouched to the 1b.&mdash;the production of butter in the creameries.  The balance sheet in every creamery is based on the amount of butter produced.  We know exactly the amount produced. We know that in 1938-39 or 1931-32 we exported milk and butter and we find from those figures that, while the consumption of butter gradually increased from 1929 to 1939 from 300,000 to 400,000 cwts. per year, now it is 600,000 cwts. and we have not enough.  If we had more butter, the same thing would apply.</P>
    <P>Deputies will ask: how is it we are getting less?  We are getting less than we got four or five years ago because then we could afford to buy as much butter as we wanted, but now everybody in this country is getting butter and that did not happen before.  When I say that everybody is getting butter, that is true.  But what Deputy will argue that everybody could now pay more for butter?  There are many people in the towns, villages and cities who are practically on the margin; they could not stand another 3d. increase. <Col N="766" /> If we said to these people: &ldquo;We will leave you 6 ozs. of butter at 2/4 per 1b. or we will increase the price to 2/8 per 1b. and give you more,&rdquo; many of them would say: &ldquo;Leave the price as it is.&rdquo;  We should have some consideration for the poorer people.  Remember, the price of butter must go up if the price of milk goes up, and the only fat available at the moment is butter.  If cheap margarine or dripping were available, we might say that the poor people had alternatives, but these cannot be got.  Butter is the only fat they have and we should try to give it to them at a price at which they can buy it.  Let us suppose that those people were here arguing the case with the representatives of the farmers.  Suppose they had heard from Deputy Halliden, for instance, that with cow-testing the milk yield could be brought up from 380 gallons to 550 gallons.  Would not any reasonable person amongst them say to the farmers: &ldquo;Why do you not join a cow-testing association; if you did, you would get an average yield of 550 gallons and that would give you £7 per cow more.  You are asking us to give you another 1½d. to carry you on in your old, inefficient, incompetent way, and that 1½d. would give you only about £3 more&mdash;on the 380 gallons.&rdquo;  The townsman could say to the farmer that if he were efficient and competent he could increase his income by twice as much as this 1½d. increase would give him.</P>

      <P>That is what the person in the town says.  I say there is no case for the increase.  I have been appealed to for the last five or six years to keep the dairying industry going until they would have time to reorganise it&mdash;to keep the subsidies going until they had time to improve the cows, and so on.  No attempt was made to reorganise the dairying industry by the farmers.  I have an ugly suspicion that if I said we would give 1/- a gallon, some Deputies would say the price should be 1/1 per gallon. There are Deputies in this House whose policy should be written up over <Col N="767" /> the door: &ldquo;A penny more for milk and 5/- more for wheat.&rdquo;  That is what their whole policy amounts to.</P>
      <P>Some Deputy mentioned root seeds. Now, here is the position in that regard. We go back three or four years, to the time when we could not import root seeds into this country. The people from whom we expected to get them told us that they could not give them to us, and we approached the seed merchants here, and they told us that they could supply us with all the root seeds we required.  They said, in effect, that they would form a group &mdash;eventually it became three or four groups&mdash;which would provide our requirements of root seeds, on condition that they got a guaranteed price to protect them against the possible import of such seeds.  Naturally, they wanted that price to be controlled, and, of course, they wanted to have some kind of control over the imports of these seeds, because the farmers would naturally want to get the seeds at the cheapest price they could.  We said, in effect: &ldquo;Yes, we will give that guarantee.&rdquo;  The result of that has been that we have enough now of these seeds to tide us over the emergency; that we are getting, for mangels, 2/- a lb., and 3/- a 1b. for swedes; but, of course, people in certain other countries became restive about that, and started writing to farmers in this country, advertising and saying that they could sell these seeds to our farmers at a cheaper rate.  At the time when the war started, and when we needed those seeds, we could not get them.  As a matter of fact, we would have been delighted to get them; but now, when we are able to produce our own seeds, these people start to advertise and write to our farmers asking them to take their seeds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Beirne, of Roscommon, spoke about the distribution of tractors in Roscommon.  In that connection I wrote a very long letter to the Deputy, but I have had no answer from him. It would appear, therefore, that the Deputy is not so much interested in the question of truth as in the instigation of propaganda against the Department of Agriculture.  He says that seven tractors in Roscommon were distributed <Col N="768" /> to an agent who was an ex-member of Fianna Fáil.  We have nothing to do with that agent.  In connection with the matter of the supply of tractors, we went to Messrs.  Henry Ford of Cork, which company had a number of tractors, and whose agents were concerned.  We gave them the names and addresses of the people to whom those tractors were being distributed.</P>
    <P>Henry Ford and Company, therefore, distributed the tractors in accordance with the list of names and addresses we had given.  I am referring to Messrs.  Henry Ford and Company, of Cork, who had no interest in any political Party in this country, but yet we are told by Deputy Beirne that it was only Fianna Fáil agents that had to deal with the matter.  That is not true, but in that connection I may say that some of these tractors were distributed through a Clann na Talmhan agent.  I could not help that.  As a matter of fact, I would be delighted to help the poor fellow, if possible, but, actually, it was Messrs.  Henry Ford that had to deal with the matter.</P>

      <P>Now, with regard to eggs: The position, so far as eggs are concerned, is that there is a non-profit making enterprise, known as Eggsports, Limited, who are supposed to fix the price that a merchant down the country shall pay for the eggs he collects from the farmers.  That, however, is not a price that can be enforced because it must be recognised that an egg from, let us say, County Sligo, may cost more to the merchant who buys it, than an egg which he buys in County Kildare, which is nearer to the City of Dublin.  The question of proximity to a large city has to be taken into consideration there, and the availability of ports; but Eggsports, Limited, do give an indication to the producer as to the price at a particular moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I realise that, and I agree that the prices should be announced more frequently.  Now, with regard to the question of the growing of wheat, which I have advocated for the last 10 years or so, Deputies on the other side&mdash;particularly, Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney&mdash;seem to think that they were right in their policy and that we were wrong; even though they now admit that wheat must be grown here. It appears to me that Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney must be like the Bourbons&mdash;who learned nothing and forgot nothing&mdash;if he holds that if the argument which he held formerly should still apply, but that, as he now says himself, we should appeal for the growing of more wheat in this country.  However, I suppose we shall have to leave it at that, because I do not think there would be any chance of agreement between the Deputy and myself on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies have conceded, very graciously, that we should grow more wheat, in order to supply bread for our people, but most of those Deputies, as it appeared to me, were not prepared to advocate the growing of wheat in their own counties.  They were all in favour of the growing of wheat, but not in their own counties. Deputy Broderick described, very graphically, his efforts to grow wheat, and it reminded me of the wrestling match between Hiawatha and Minnehaha, about the growing of grain or corn, and Deputy McGilligan said that if we had imported wheat from 1930 to 1939, instead of growing it here, we could have saved the amount of money that we have spent on the growing of wheat and used it in establishing a <Col N="770" /> mercantile marine service here.  That is a nice argument, but it is a wonder that Deputy McGilligan did not think of that when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce here.  At any rate, it was not done, but I should like to say further, in relation to this question of a mercantile marine, that even if we had a mercantile marine fleet here now, and that no wheat was being produced in this country, we could not feel very secure for the next three or four years, so far as our food requirements are concerned.  I do not believe that we would be secure.</P>
    <P>Somebody complimented Deputy Giles on his speech here, and I should like to do so also.  I was very surprised to hear Deputies in this House, such as Deputies Blowick, Cafferky, and others, from the County Mayo and similar parts of the country, describing the farmers in such poor terms as they did describe them.  To hear those Deputies one would imagine that the farmer in this country is a kind of a slave&mdash;as dour a character as ever lived in this country, and with nothing to redeem him whatever; as a man who works from dawn to dark, never enjoying himself; a man with an inferiority complex who thinks everybody else is better than he is; a man with a persecution complex, up against every other class in the country, against the trader who charges him too much and against the city man who is getting too much, and hating all classes.</P>
    <P>That was the sort of man described to us by these Deputies, and I was delighted when I heard Deputy Giles saying he thought the farmer was not such a bad fellow.  He described the farmer going to the fair and making a terrible fuss about getting another half-crown and then going into the &ldquo;pub&rdquo; and spending a pound.  I think that was a much better description of the farmer than that given by these Deputies.  We are also told that he is a mercenary individual, because if we paid him more he would give us more.  I do not think so.  The farmer has done magnificently; he has given us great work for the past four or five years.  He has done everything possible to give us more wheat, potatoes and everything else, but, <Col N="771" /> according to some of the Deputies here, if we had given him another 4/- for wheat, we would have had more than we wanted.  That is a wrong description of the farmer.  He is doing his best and giving us what he can, and is not the mercenary individual he is alleged to be, begging for doles and bribes.  So far as I am concerned, the type of farmer described by Deputy Giles is the type I have been representing. If Clann na Talmhan want the other type, they can have him and welcome.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask Deputy Blowick another question.  Deputy Dillon is not here, but perhaps either he or Deputy Blowick could answer it.  They complained about the number of pigs going down.  Would Deputy Blowick tell me how it is possible to produce pigs without feeding?  There is an old saying that you cannot make bricks without straw, but one might make some attempt to produce bricks without straw because you might get something else, but it is not possible to produce a pig without feeding, and there is none to spare in the country. Would Deputy Blowick tell me where, or who, is the farmer who had feeding in his loft and who would not produce a pig because I did something wrong about the industry?  If there is such a farmer, I might admit that I had done something wrong which kept him from rearing a pig, but there is no such farmer that I know of, who has feeding and who would not keep pigs because he was up against the Department. There is no feeding available, and we cannot help it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon talked about the same thing and nearly every Deputy who spoke started in the same way.  They all said that the Department should not be interfering so much with the farmer and then they told me how I should interfere to a greater extent. Deputy Dillon is the typical example, but I find that every Deputy has that failing.  They all say we interfere too much, but they all tell me then where I should interfere in the way in which they want me to interfere.  Deputy Dillon, for instance, made a very <Col N="772" /> eloquent speech and worked himself up into a heat about the Department's interference and then asked us to zone the country for cattle breeding, which is something I would not think of doing, because I have too much respect for the freedom of the farmer.  He suggested that we should zone the country and say to one farmer: &ldquo;You must breed Holsteins&rdquo;; to another: &ldquo;You must breed Shorthorns&rdquo;; and to another: &ldquo;You must breed Herefords.&rdquo; I do not propose to do that at all, but Deputy Dillon thinks I could.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Linehan, and, to some extent, Deputy McGilligan, spoke of policy, and I think I can say that I agree to some extent with what Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Linehan said.  Deputy Linehan, however, is wrong in his summing up of the position if we have not the stuff to sell when this war is over.  There is no decline whatever in cattle production.  We have as many cattle as ever we had.  I do not know whether we are consuming more beef than we did or not, but, at any rate, we have as many cattle as we had, so that point will not give us any trouble when the war is over.  The cattle will be there.</P>
    <P>Eggs and poultry production are down, I admit, but, as Deputies know, and as some Deputies have said, we are doing our very best at the moment to revive the poultry industry. Deputies may ask why we allowed it to go down, in the first instance, and I shall answer them.  I have said in this House and at all meetings of the county committees to which I went, that, at the beginning of this war, we had to make up our minds to meet a crisis.  We saw that there was a very big deficiency in the wheat position and in feeding stuffs.  We had to come down on the side of wheat, because if there was any stoppage of imports, the feeding of humans was very important. We had to stress wheat in particular, and it was wheat, wheat, all the time.</P>
    <P>However sarcastic Deputies may be now, when they are getting plenty of bread, if any of them had been in my place, or if any ten of them had been in the Government's place, in 1939, <Col N="773" /> they would have done exactly what we did.  They would have come to the conclusion that we must get the wheat grown first; that, when we got the wheat grown, we would go on to replace the maize by other feeding stuffs; and that in the meantime, if pigs and poultry went, it could not be helped, that they would have to go and we could not help it.  We now feel, however, that we are on the road back to a good supply of wheat.  We are also getting an increased acreage of oats and barley and we are advising people to go in for poultry again because we feel that egg production, after cattle, is particularly suited to this country.</P>
    <P>Our butter production is down somewhat, but I have explained that our consumption is very much up, and we have very little for export.  Deputy McGilligan in that connection spoke about a statement I made in Cork a few years ago.  I probably stated the facts as Deputy McGilligan gave them: that this is a country of small farms and there was, therefore, a high cost of production here compared with countries of big farms like New Zealand; that there will be keen competition on the foreign market when the war is over; and that we must export something from this country.  I do not know whether anybody will dispute these facts with me or not&mdash;that this is a country of small farms; that there will be keen competition when the war is over; and that we must export something.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan said that I was in a gloomy frame of mind on that occasion.  I was in a realistic frame of mind, and I think it would be wrong to try to adopt a complacent frame of mind all the time, and ignore the facts which face us.  With regard to dairy products, I pointed out in that speech in Cork that, even if exports are impossible when the war is over, we were then consuming 90 per cent. of our total milk output.  Now, of course, we are consuming 100 per cent., and would, in fact, consume more than 100 per cent. if we had it; so that I think that, so far as looking for an export market for our butter is concerned, the problem will be solved by increased consumption here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="774" /> With regard to bacon, I pointed out that we would be up against very keen competition.  It is all very fine to say that I was in a gloomy frame of mind, but I was looking to this fact: that we are evidently not able to produce, even with the big tillage effort we have now, more bacon than we consume ourselves, and in fact barely enough, so that we have no export.  Export of bacon, therefore, means the import of feeding stuffs, of maize.  Suppose we have to import the maize from Canada to feed the pigs we propose to export. It will take five ships to bring over five loads of maize to feed as many pigs as the Canadians will send over in one shipload of bacon; so that we will be paying the freight on five shiploads of maize while they will pay freight on one shipload of bacon&mdash;and we have to compete against that.</P>
    <P>That is what I pointed out on that occasion, and if there is a solution or an answer for that&mdash;I do not expect it from Deputy McGilligan&mdash;well and good.  We will not sit down and say we cannot do it.  We will do our best; we must reorganise the bacon industry and do all we can.  We are, however, up against that handicap, and there is no use in talking about being in a gloomy frame of mind.  We had better realise what the position is.  We are up against the handicap that if we are to bring feeding stuffs&mdash;and Deputies believe that it is cheaper to do so than to grow them here&mdash;shipping freights will be five times as heavy on those feeding stuffs as on the bacon coming from Canada.</P>
    <P>I want to say a word about three motions on the Order paper as I believe they will be taken.  I have already given my reasons for recommending the House to vote against an increase in the price of milk.  Motion No. 12 in the name of Deputies Cogan and O'Driscoll suggests:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That the Government should immediately adopt a long-term policy guaranteeing economic prices for all main products of agriculture.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Deputies mean &ldquo;by a long-term,&rdquo; but I hold that we have guaranteed prices for all the main products.  There are guaranteed prices for wheat and barley.  There <Col N="775" /> is a minimum price for oats which is much below the price oats is fetching. There is a guaranteed price for flax, for tobacco, for beet, for butter, and for milk.  There is a minimum price for pigs the owners of which are getting more.  There is practically what amounts to a guarantee for eggs and poultry.  For nearly all things that farmers sell they know in advance what they will get, except for cattle and sheep.  Motion No. 14 is tabled by the Fine Gael Party, Deputies Hughes, Bennett, Linehan, Ryan, O'Donovan and MacEoin.  It asks for the setting up of a select committee of both Houses to investigate the dairying industry, and to maintain the price of milk at 1/- a gallon.  I do not think a select committee of the Oireachtas would be a suitable body for a matter of that kind.  Anybody who was here for the debate will agree that a select committee of the two Houses would not be a suitable body.</P>
    <P>Motion No. 15, in the name of Deputies Halliden and Heskin, asks that 1/- per gallon for milk be continued from April 1st.  The points they make are that that amount is necessary to cover increased costs.  On Motions Nos. 2 and 3 increased costs appear to be raised.  Economic costs are mainly responsible in one case.  If they are mainly responsible I do not see that there is any case whatever for increasing the price from 10½d. to 1/-.  The third reason is that diseased cows are largely responsible.  I admit that there are numbers of diseased cows for which the farmer may not be blamed, but that question should be dealt with in a different way.  As I indicated, I mean to have something more done with regard to cattle diseases.  One motion stated that there is a grave danger of a calamitous shortage of milk and butter not only in the immediate future but also after the war.</P>
    <P>That may be, though if the Deputy's other contention is right, I am not sure about it.  I want to make it perfectly clear, fearing that Deputies who are here now but who were not present when I was speaking, that I am definitely asking the Dáil when these motions come on, to vote against the <Col N="776" /> three of them, because I do not think any case has been made for an increase in the price of milk.</P>

      <P>There is one matter to which I want to direct the Minister's attention and it is this: I understand the rates of subsidies now are not infrequently changed by Order made under the Emergency Powers Act, or that they can be so changed, but cases have arisen&mdash;I am not sure whether <Col N="787" /> they have arisen during this financial year or not; the Minister will be able to tell us; or whether it is the intention to permit them to arise in the course of the current financial year&mdash; where the rate of subsidy has been altered from time to time by order of an officer of his Department, sometimes with, and sometimes without, the consent of the Department of Finance, without making the necessary statutory amending Order.</P>
      <P>I should like to know if the Minister's attention has been drawn to the incidence of such events in the past and whether he is prepared to assure the House that in future, if there is to be any variation in the rates of subsidies or of bounties paid, the appropriate Order will be made, so that the attention of Dáil Eireann will be directed to the fact that the current rate of bounty or subsidy is being altered, and that such alterations will not be made without some instrument of that kind being brought under the attention of the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The present subsidies, of course, are not payable under the Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) Act and I think Deputy Dillon is raising the matter that Orders were necessary under the Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) Act in connection with every Order altering the subsidy or the levy.  But at the present time subsidies are payable as <i>ex gratia</i> grants and I do not think any Order is necessary because there is no condition whatever, or no levy.  I may be wrong&mdash;I will look up the matter to make sure&mdash;but I think no Order is necessary for the payment of subsidies under this Vote but, in any case, there will no alteration without consultation with the Department of <Col N="788" /> Finance.  The approval of the Minister for Finance will be necessary before any alteration could be made. With regard to Deputy Hughes's question, as I explained in my concluding statement on the Agricultural Estimate, the creameries will be paying about 2/0½d. for the quantity of milk that will make a lb. of butter and they will sell the butter to the wholesaler at in or about the same price, so that the cost of manufacture and of carriage must be met by way of subsidy.</P>

      <P>It is not exactly decided yet.  I was looking up the figures to-day.  It must be decided within the next few days.  I think it will be in or about 30/-.  The present rate will be higher because they are making butter from milk costing 1/- a gallon and that would mean that the present subsidy must be in the region of about 60/-.</P>

      <P>That a sum, not exceeding £10,486, be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1945, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with Sea and Inland Fisheries, including a Grant-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is not very much to be said regarding the figures of this Estimate because there is very little change. With the exception of three or four small items, the amounts put down are virtually the same as those in the Estimate for the current financial year, which was under discussion here in October last.  The exceptions are: Sub-head A, where there is an increase of £229, which is necessary to cover the increased bonus payable during the coming year; sub-head B, where we have included an additional £50 to meet the increased cost of travelling; sub-head C, where we have reduced slightly the provision for advertisements; sub-head F (1), where we are pruning somewhat the former provision for grants to conservators; sub-head F (3), at which is shown a small increase to meet the rising cost of wages for watchers of State fisheries; sub-head G (2), where the amount with which to provide boats and gear for members of the Sea Fisheries Association is less by £1,000 than last year's figure.  The explanation here is that the directors of the association are not anxious to incur liability for interest charges on borrowed money when they are having such difficulty in purchasing gear.  At sub-head H, Appropriations-in-Aid, there is a difference from last year's figures in each of the three sub-divisions. From lettings of sporting rights we are hoping to collect £100 more than in the current financial year, and we are hoping that the receipts under the Fisheries (Tidal Waters) Acts will also exceed by £100 the receipts in the present year.  On the other hand, the repayments expected from the Sea Fisheries Association are less by £2,000 than the figure set down in the <Col N="790" /> 1943-44 Estimate.  Such repayments proved to be unexpectedly high in the last couple of years, largely due to the earnings of the more successful members. Some of those have now cleared their accounts with the association, and consequently there will be less coming in next year.  The flow of income to the association from hire-purchase accounts will consequently be reduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that every member of the Dáil will be pleased to learn that, good as were the returns for the year 1942 as regards the quantity and value of the landings from our sea fisheries, they have been surpassed by the figures for the year 1943.  When both sets of figures are compared with those for the year 1939, it becomes evident how willing our fishermen are to work hard when offered a fair return for their labour.  The comparative figures are: 1943, 399,000 cwts.; 1942, 371,000 cwts.; and 1939, 237,000 cwts. It will be seen, therefore, that for the war years there is a very substantial increase in quantity, but the increase in value is even better.  For 1943 it was £610,000; for 1942, £504,000; and for 1939, £233,000.  The value, therefore, is more than doubled.  As I mentioned last year, those results are especially satisfactory when we realise that the increase in quantity and value is due entirely to the efforts of our inshoremen with their comparatively small sized craft.  The three vessels comprising our only deep-sea trawling fleet are being operated to full capacity, and their much needed contribution to our supply of fish food is appreciated, but the figures of their catches are more or less static.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Sea Fisheries Association will shortly be having its annual meeting, I do not wish to say anything in anticipation of the report which will then be presented to the members by the directors.  I am, however, aware that it will be a satisfactory report as regards general results and turnover, the dark spot being the difficulties of <Col N="791" /> obtaining marine engines and their component parts, fuel, oil and fishing gear.  My Department and the Department of Supplies are doing everything possible towards the solution of the difficulties in this respect.  As to the inland fisheries, the arrangement by which all our exports of salmon to the British market are purchased and paid for by the Ministry of Food in London continues to work smoothly enough, although naturally our supporters would like to see the terms improved in certain particulars.  With the inland fishermen, as with the sea fishermen, there is the serious handicap arising from shortage of gear.  I am not, however, without hope that matters will be mended in some degree during the coming months.  The general output of our salmon, trout and eel fisheries for 1943 was about average under war conditions.</P>
    <P>On previous occasions, I have assured Deputies that the directors of the Sea Fisheries Association were paying particular regard to the needs of smallholders in the Gaeltacht whose domestic economy is greatly facilitated by the provision of items such as curraghs or trammel nets, and I want to assure Deputies once more that this aspect of their duty is being kept well in mind by the directors.  I do not think I have anything else to say except to mention that the gross total of our Fisheries Estimate this year is £38,271 as against £39,062 for the previous year.  As, however, the Appropriations-in-Aid for this year are measured at something less than the amount for last year, the final result is a net increase of £1,034.</P>

      <P>I trust that the few remarks which I intend to make upon this Estimate, and such arguments as I bring before the House, will be dealt with by the Minister in his reply precisely as I put them, and that in this debate we will not have an example such as we had in the debate which has just been concluded&mdash;example of the Minister using the very cheapest tricks and artifices in misstating the arguments <Col N="792" /> which came from the Opposition Benches in order that he might answer his own misstatements instead of the real arguments put forward. When I come to deal with the Minister's opening statement on this Estimate, what strikes me as most remarkable is the baldness of that statement.  This year, the House will pass a Bill of the very utmost importance. It will pass a Drainage Bill. It is inevitable that there will be a clash between the interests of the drainage authorities and of the fishery authorities, and I had hoped that the Minister, in introducing this Estimate to-night, would give us some indication of what is the future which he plans for the inland fisheries of this country.  We have passed in this House legislation which enables the State to acquire the inland fisheries, district by district.  That legislation was passed roughly five years ago, and so far the Minister for Fisheries has allowed it to be a dead letter.  I should like to know from the Minister what is the intention of the Department.  Is that power of acquisition of inland fisheries to remain a dead letter, or is it to be put into force?  If it is put into force, how will the Minister deal with his end of what is a very complicated question&mdash;the question as to whether fisheries or drainage is to be of the greater importance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already on the Drainage Bill expressed my personal views upon that matter, but I should like to have the views of the Minister and his Department. May I say in passing that I do hope that when the clauses which deal with inland fisheries in the Drainage Bill are being discussed, the Minister will be in his place and put before the House the views which he holds on that subject?  That is not in any way animadverting on the ability of the Parliamentary Secretary to steer the Bill through the House, but it is expressing the hope that we shall get, not at second hand, but at first hand, the views of the Department upon the subject.  I should like especially to know from the Minister how the question of weirs will be dealt with.  Roughly speaking, about <Col N="793" /> 100 years ago weirs were completely illegal in this country.  They had been erected illegally, but they were subsequently by two statutes&mdash;one in the 40's and one in the 60's&mdash;legalised to a certain extent.</P>
    <P>In a Parliamentary inquiry held, I think, in 1837, if my recollection serves me right&mdash;I did not expect that an Estimate of this importance would be taken at 12 o'clock to-night; I am trusting for the facts to my memory, which I should like to have refreshed before I addressed the House&mdash;this subject of inland fisheries was examined. There was a vast amount of evidence given as to the injury done to inland fisheries by fixed weirs which still exist.  It was pointed out by one witness&mdash;it makes one feel almost hungry in these days when it is quite impossible to procure fish at a reasonable price&mdash;that when a weir was erected at the mouth of the Shannon, the price of salmon, which had ranged from 2½d. to 4d. per lb. in Limerick, suddenly jumped to 1/- and 1/4 per lb. owing to the scarcity of fish.  It is also, I think, a matter of common knowledge to anybody who takes an interest in the life of old Dublin that at one time salmon was so plentiful that there was a clause in the indentures of apprenticeship of every apprentice in the City of Dublin that he should not be fed on salmon on more than a certain number of days in the week.  That condition of fishing has completely ceased, and if the evidence given before the commission to which I have referred is correct, that is due almost entirely to the creation of these fixed weirs.  Furthermore, 100 years ago the inland fisheries in this country gave employment to 100,000 persons.  The employment fell in a period of ten years by 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>I wonder how many people are in employment in our Irish fisheries at present?  If the evidence given before the commission to which I have already so frequently referred is correct, that condition of affairs is due to the existence of fixed weirs.  I do not profess to know anything about salmon, sea trout or their habits, beyond the ordinary knowledge which the man in <Col N="794" /> the street has acquired.  But, if the evidence which was then given is correct, the weirs are not only a hindrance to the drainage of the country but they are at the same time a source of very great damage to the inland fisheries.  I read some two or three days ago an article in <i>The Times</i> on the condition of Switzerland at the present moment. I shall refer only to one part of it. Dealing with meat, it said that meat in Switzerland is extremely scarce, but that the inland waters of Switzerland were able to supply the people with all the fish they required.  I wondered greatly why it is that there is not that abundance of fish from our inland fisheries on the slabs of the fishmongers in our towns.  Everybody must be aware that there is great difficulty in getting any fish at all upon certain occasions.  My suggestion to the Minister would be that in some area which is being drained he would consent to the entire abolition of weirs.  I mean, of course, that when some large river is being drained he would exercise his compulsory powers to buy out the owners and sweep away the weirs and see what result that would have in increasing the fish population of our inland rivers and lakes.  I know that from the Government benches there repeatedly comes the statement that we can do nothing during the emergency. I wonder if that argument is completely sound or entirely justified? I quite admit that there should be as much economy as possible during the emergency.  But I do not see any reason why, during an emergency, money cannot be invested.  Money devoted to buying out private rights in fisheries is not wasted; it is invested. The Government can at present get money in the open market at an extremely cheap rate.  What the wizards of finance have been doing, I do not know.  During the last war, governments found it impossible to borrow.  Everybody who remembers that war will recall that the British Government had to float a 4 per cent. loan, free of income-tax, and that that loan did not even stand at par.  Nowadays, the Government can borrow at 3 per cent. and the loan will stand at par at once.  I do not see why, not <Col N="795" /> merely for fisheries but for other forms of development, money should not be borrowed by the Government.  It should be borrowed, not for the purpose of squandering but for the purpose of investment.  Therefore, I submit that the argument that money should not be invested by the Government during the emergency is not sound.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Sir John Esmonde Sir John Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to deal with one point of which I am sure the Minister, representing the same constituency as myself, will have knowledge. During the fishing season last year, a peculiar situation arose in Rosslare Harbour.  Owing to the emergency, the amount of fuel available for local fishing boats is limited.  The result is that they can fish only at certain times and in certain ways.  Last year, English boats came in.  A fisherman brought me out in his boat and I watched them fishing up and down.  I sent a telegram to what I considered was the appropriate Department and various other protests were made but no effective measure was taken because these boats were bigger than ours, had more fuel, and so swept the catch before our boats could get near them. I should like to see that prevented this year.  It is all very well to talk about sending down a gunboat&mdash;that was; I think, done&mdash;but the right thing to do would be to write to the people on the other side and ask them to keep out of our waters.  The Minister has, I am sure, heard about this matter and I am not attaching any blame to him because these things have to go through certain channels.  It is a pity, however, to see such things happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to a number of grievances affecting fish merchants and fishermen in South Kerry.  About two years ago, the railway and shipping companies made an order that fish which reached Dublin after 6 p.m. was not to be loaded on the night boat.  This was an extraordinary procedure because the boat did not leave the North Wall until 3 a.m. or 4 a.m.  The result is that the fish reaches the English markets 24 hours <Col N="796" /> later than it should.  This delay is very serious during periods of warm weather and, as a result, really large quantities of fish were condemned in the British markets last year and the year before, and the merchants suffered substantial losses.  The merchants are so anxious that the fish should reach the English markets with the least possible delay that they offered to pay the railway companies increased freight if their fish would be loaded on the night it reached Dublin, but this offer was refused. I cannot understand why this rule was introduced.  I discussed this matter with the Labour Deputies and they assured me that the dockers of Dublin were prepared to load the fish, provided the railway and shipping companies were satisfied.  Of course, the dockers would have to be paid overtime.  As this rule is in force for only two years, and as the British Government is anxious to get as much fish as possible from this country, I fail to see why the Minister cannot get the railway and shipping companies to accept the fish from South Kerry for the night boat.  Unless the Minister assists us, there is no use in our trying to force this matter.  If the Minister does not get these facilities for the shipment of fish from South Kerry, it will mean that the merchants will suffer heavy losses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The merchants of South Kerry are of opinion that the Fishery Department is not helping the industry to the extent it should.  This Department does not keep the merchants informed as to the regulations made by the British Government relating to fish exported from this country.  I consider that such regulations should be published and explained in the Press.  Many merchants are unable at the present time to get detailed particulars of the levy which is imposed by the British Government on fish forwarded from this country.  They have nobody from whom to get the information except their salesmen in England.  I was speaking to a merchant recently and he informed me that he wrote on two occasions to the British Ministry asking for information concerning the levy but his letter was not acknowledged. This is a very unsatisfactory situation, <Col N="797" /> and I think that the Department of Fisheries should give all the information possible to the merchants in connection with such regulations.</P>
    <P>I saw in the paper a few weeks ago that the controlled price of fish imported from this country had been reduced in England. I should like to know from the Minister if the British Government consulted his Department concerning this reduction, and what representations his Department made in connection with the reduction.  The result of this reduction in price is that our fishermen will receive about 5/- a hundred&mdash;126 fish&mdash;less than formerly. That is a serious matter for the fishermen because they pay an increased price for their oil and a high price for all kinds of gear.  I think that our Government should oppose in the strongest manner this reduction in price.  I am not satisfied that this Government or the last Government gave the fishing industry the assistance and help it should receive.  One must remember that the fishing industry is our second most important industry.</P>
    <P>I admit that good work has been done by the Sea Fisheries Association and I also admit that, were it not for the good work done by that Association, our fishermen would not be able to enjoy to-day the great boom in the industry which they are enjoying.  I admit that the problems of the industry are difficult of solution.  It is a very peculiar calling and is characterised by either a feast or a famine. The greatest problem with which this industry is faced is to find a means by which the surpluses and gluts may be successfully and economically preserved against the days of want.  If we can solve this problem, we shall, indeed, have solved the greatest problem in the fish trade.  I know it is very easy for me to criticise the policy of the Government and that it is far more difficult to suggest methods by which the Government could help the trade.  I am aware that we could consume in this country all the prime fish landed by our trawlers, and it is on very rare occasions we find that there is a surplus of fish here.  At certain times of the year, large quantities of <Col N="798" /> herrings and mackerel are landed on our shores, and the difficulty then is how to market and dispose of them. I think that our Government should do everything in its power to discover means by which we can preserve these kinds of fish when they are here in abundance.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion on which I spoke here on this Estimate, I directed the Minister's attention to methods that have been adopted in other countries for the curing or kippering of herrings and mackerel.  I think that that is a matter which is worth paying attention to, and I feel it essential that we improve our methods in that regard.  It appears to me that there is a great future for the kippering or curing of mackerel and herrings, especially with the aid of refrigeration.  There was always a market on the Continent for cured herrings and mackerel, and I believe that there will be a very great market when this war is over.</P>
    <P>I have seen in the newspapers recently that the Canadian Government have spent large sums of money on the tinning or canning of mackerel, and that they have derived large profits from that industry.  The people on the Continent of Europe have now got accustomed to tinned fruit, tinned vegetables, tinned fish, and so on, and I think it should be possible for us to compete with foreign countries in the supply of tinned mackerel or herrings on the Continent when this war is over.  I have also seen that the Sea Fisheries Association have discovered a new method of curing fish, and I hope that every facility will be given to them by the Government to enable them to continue in that work.</P>
    <P>When we come to consider the post-war problems of this country, I think it would be advisable for our Government to set up some committee of inquiry to ascertain our post-war problems. The British Government recently set up a committee to inquire into the post-war herring industry, and I think it would be advisable to set up a similar committee here.  I would particularly impress on the Government the necessity for extending <Col N="799" /> our home market, so far as the consumption of fish is concerned, and the securing of new markets.  I think that one of the best things that could be done here would be the helping of the home market, and the encouraging of our people to eat more fish.  We consume very little fish here, and it has been admitted that we are not a fish-eating race.  I think that the reason we consume such small quantities of fish in this country is the fact that the consumer has to pay too much for the fish; that there is too great a difference between the price paid to the fisherman and the price charged to the consumer.  I think that if the Government were to establish a flat rate for the transport of fish by the various carrying companies&mdash;railways, and so on&mdash;the price of fish to the consumer would drop.  If a flat rate were to be adopted by the railway companies, it would mean that people in, say, Kilkenny, could get fish at the same price as people in, let us say, Tralee.</P>
    <P>I also think that the Government should spend as much money as possible on the construction of boats for our fishermen, so as to enable them to compete with foreign countries.  I do not suggest that we would be able to compete with great countries like Britain.  We could not do so in our present circumstances, but I think that our Government should encourage the building of a number of small trawlers because, by doing so, we could ensure a sufficient supply of fish for our own people during the seasons when fish are plentiful.  I should also like to see our Government buying a certain number of large trawlers which could go to sea during all seasons of the year, so as to supply our home market with a steady supply of fish during the winter.  In my opinion, the Government should also set up refrigerating plants in all parts of the country, and I think that some form of control should be set up after this war.  I always thought that it was extraordinary to see our boats going to sea and bringing in fish, when the markets both here and in England were already glutted with fish, and no attempt being made to preserve or <Col N="800" /> cure the fish.  I think that the Government should make some effort to control that.  Naturally, when there is too much fish on the market, the price drops, so far as the fisherman is concerned. I think that there should be some method of control in that regard. Another matter to which I should like to draw attention is that of British or other foreign trawlers fishing within the three-mile limit off our coasts.</P>

      <P>I should like to impress on the Minister that it is no use for this Government or any other Government to try to help our fishermen unless they can give protection to our fishermen against foreign trawlers.

      <P>Some people say that it would cost too much to afford that protection, but I consider that it would be money well spent if protection were given to our fishermen, inside the three-mile limit at any rate, because such a large number of our people are dependent on that industry for their livelihood.  I consider that sufficient protection is not given to our boats.  I am aware that these matters are fixed by international agreement, but I believe that such countries as Norway and Iceland will not accept this three-mile limit.</P>
      <P>Before concluding, I should like to say that I think it is a mistaken policy to have agriculture and fisheries under the same Minister.  The problems associated with agriculture would occupy the whole time of any Minister while the problems of the fishing industry, which are very peculiar, would also provide fulltime occupation for any Minister.  As matters stand at the moment, it appears to be obvious that, owing to the importance of agriculture, the fishing industry is not getting a fair deal from the Government.</P>

      <P>And Deputy Healy, as I understand, has been remonstrating strongly against their threatening the Irish fisheries and suggesting that something will have to be done.  I remember those very words being used in Anagry 12 years ago.  Having proclaimed that something would have to be done, Senator Connolly explained to the admiring multitude that the thing required to be done was to put &ldquo;Dev.&rdquo; in and get rid of the trawlers. We have had &ldquo;Dev.&rdquo; in for 12 years now and we still have the trawlers.  I wonder what requires to be done now to get rid of the trawlers.  Is it to put &ldquo;Dev.&rdquo; out?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows that there are more ways of killing a cat than by choking it with a pound of butter.  There are two or three specific questions in connection with this Department about which I want to ask the Minister.  One is that it seems to me that one of the future industries of this country will probably be the tourist industry.  That seems to be accepted on all sides.  We are spending a great deal of money on providing financial facilities for the Tourist Development Board.  One of the distinguishing characteristics of tourist areas in this country is the availability of virtually free brown trout fishing and very cheap sea trout fishing to visiting tourists.  We cannot do very much to improve the sea trout fishing of our rivers, except by patrolling them carefully and preventing poaching, but it does seem to me that a good deal could be done through the State hatcheries for the improvement of brown trout in our rivers and lakes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am well aware that if you go to an expert on brown trout fisheries and advocate the introduction of a large quantity of fry into the rivers, he will proceed to explain to you that all the fry are eaten up before they become mature fish.  I do not believe a word of it.  No matter what proposal you make for the improvement of brown <Col N="803" /> trout rivers, experts are prepared to tell you that it is all futile and gets you nowhere.  I believe it is well worth trying, if even only in a restricted area as an experiment, the introduction of very large quantities of brown trout fry into the sporting rivers of this country.  I believe that, by that means, we could increase the trout population of certain of our lakes and rivers.  I believe it would be one of the most effective inducements to tourists to come to this country.</P>
    <P>A very large number of our tourists may naturally be expected to come from Great Britain and America, the English-speaking countries.  In both of these countries fishing is a very favoured holiday sport of those who travel far afield.  Fishing can be had in the West of Ireland from Donegal, through Connemara, down to Kerry, on terms more advantageous than almost anywhere else in the world.  I think the Minister should resolve to improve those fisheries to the limit of his capacity, and, knowing the objections that will be made to the general introduction of fry into the rivers, I urge on him to take a limited area and make the experiment of introducing fry, so that we can have proof that the experts who decry that system, or those of us who advocate it, are right or wrong.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney who wondered why the slabs of the fish merchants' shops all over the country were not loaded with fish.  I do not know why they are not, except that the fish merchants do not buy the fish.  Amongst my many other callings, I am a fishmonger.  I deal with the Sea Fisheries' Association, and I must say that you would find it hard to transact business with any more courteous or helpful organisation than that organisation.  They have a stall in the wholesale fish market, and anyone who wants to order fish from them can ring them up on Wednesday, if he wants the fish for sale on Friday. I can assure him that he will get every conceivable assistance possible for a salesman to give, and I further assure him that he will get prompt delivery of any fish he may see fit to order at, <Col N="804" /> so far as I know, as competitive a price from the Sea Fisheries' Association stall as from any other wholesale fishmonger in the country.</P>
    <P>But there is this odd lacuna to which I wish to direct the Minister's attention, that the Sea Fisheries' Association are so scrupulous to live up to their name that they do not handle salmon, with the result that if you want to lay a wholesale order with the Sea Fisheries' Association for £30 or £40 worth of fish for your Friday trade, you cannot do so.  You cannot go to the Sea Fisheries' Association to buy it, if you require salmon, because salmon being one of the most expensive of all fish, it is naturally the fish of which one buys the smallest quantity; it is not practical politics to order perhaps two salmon from one wholesale merchant and ten or 15 boxes of fish from the Sea Fisheries' Association. If you require salmon in your order, you have to go to some other wholesale merchant for your whole order, or quite likely be told that they cannot supply you inasmuch as you are not taking the bulk of your fish from them.</P>
    <P>I sympathised with Deputy Healy when I heard him expressing some surprise at the wide difference there is in the price paid to fishermen and the price charged for fish.  I stated repeatedly that herring is a most valuable food.  Where there is a surplus I should like to see it sold in the streets of Dublin at the rate of three or four a penny and, if necessary, the Government should enable that to be done.  But I am not at all sure that Deputy Healy truly represents the mind of the fishing industry and that those concerned would like to see the price of fish brought so low that it would be readily available to everybody. I think the orthodox view is that if there is a glut of fish it is better to cast it back to the sea rather than sell it very cheaply.  I think that is criminal.  I am not making any allegation against Deputy Healy, but I suggest that that is the orthodox view in the fish trade.  The trade feels that if the price falls below a certain figure it is no longer making an economic price.</P>

      <P>Because prices had gone too low.  That is what I am deploring. Deputy Healy seems to suggest that by taking fish off the market or by dumping it into the sea people who want to eat fish will pay more for it. I am in the fishing trade longer than the Deputy.  The Deputy has got his information second-hand.  I want to see fish sold to the people as low as a penny each.  I would like to see them get fish four a penny.  Deputy Healy complains that the fishermen cannot make a livelihood.  I see the force of that argument.  I am told that when vast quantities of herring are brought in and when there is no market they are thrown back into the sea.  There is virtually no sale for herring since the German and American markets were closed to us.  Has Deputy Healy ever heard of herring being thrown back into the sea?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is better to face up to these things rather than to cover them up.  The Fisheries Association should act as a go-between, so that surplus fish should be available for the poor of Dublin, who are often hungry.  I assert that nine out of ten, aye, 99 out of 100 people in Dublin would be glad of a herring as it makes a good dinner.  It would be a source of consolation to everybody interested in the poor to know that whatever there is a scarcity of, there is an abundance of cheap fish for people in straitened circumstances, so that they could provide <Col N="806" /> for themselves and their children. I agree with Deputy Healy that we should not underestimate the difficulties. While it is true that you may have a glut of fish one Monday, it is quite possible that on the following Monday herrings would be fourpence apiece.  I want a flexible machine so that the surplus will be available to the poor and that artificial scarcity would not be created.  It should not be beyond the resources of the Department to achieve that end.  I prophesy that if there is a guarantee given to men fishing for herring, whatever the state of the market, and that the association would step in and take any glut created by a big catch, much more herring would be brought in.</P>
      <P>In times like these if there was a large influx of herring to Dublin, Cork, Limerick, or Waterford it would be greatly to the advantage of the poor.  Fish could then be popularised as a desirable diet for the poor.  I am not blaming the Minister. I am in the fishing trade and I know what the difficulties are.  But I think the Minister might have done more as a go-between between the fishermen who catch fish and those who would be glad to eat it if they were able to buy it at a reasonable price.</P>
      <P>I should be glad if the Minister could give us some outline of the reasons why it is that fish appears to be so cheap at the quayside when landed and so dear in the cities where it is consumed.  Sometimes plaice would be 3/- a lb. on Monday and only 1/8 on Thursday, largely depending on the class of catch that arrives and very often on the state of the weather, which may be quite mild in Dublin but stormy off the Kerry coast.  Where you find a widespread disparity between the price paid fishermen and the price paid by consumers it would be helpful if the Minister would explain the reasons that he believes can be assigned for that position, so that Deputy Healy and others in the trade, who are conversant with it, might correct any delusion under which the Minister was labouring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to call the Minister's attention to the next question. <Col N="807" /> Perhaps he could say whether he will allocate some of the flax crop for the manufacture of thread for net making.  I understand that there is a firm in Dublin, the owner of which was engaged in the linen trade in the north, capable of making a suitable thread.  I suggest that, at least, the possibility of supplying trammel nets and long lines from this source should be explored as a great deal more fish would be available if trammel nets could be procured.  I know that the Department is doing its best in the matter of getting supplies, but I wish to find out what has been attempted in the way of supplying a flaxen substitute.  There should be a certain amount of rationalisation in the market.  It has often happened that fish landed on the west coast is carried to the east coast and passes on its way fish landed on the east coast or elsewhere, being brought to the west.</P>
      <P>When I was on the Sea Fisheries Association I made a point always of trying to get the authorities to have zoning carried out in marketing.  I know that that is a difficult thing to do.  The difficulty might be overcome or the position might be eased with refrigeration.  I should like to know to what extent refrigeration has been introduced at landing places around the coast.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Sea Fisheries Association, I suggest to the Minister that, in the matter of the periodical elections of the committee that take place, an instruction should be issued to the paid officials of the association not to interfere too much in these elections; not to interfere with the fishermen or try to influence them.  I came across a case in which the paid officials of the association actually went so far as to collect some of the fishermen's voting papers.  I do not think that is quite fair.  I think that the voters ought to be left to themselves to decide whom they will vote for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter that I desire to draw the Minister's attention to, and that is, the question of the boards of conservators.  I refer particularly <Col N="808" /> to the Galway Board of Conservators and to the denial, under the present system of election of conservators, of representation to anglers' associations. There is in my constituency the Corrib Anglers' Association.  It is an association which has erected a hatchery out of moneys raised voluntarily through subscriptions and functions of various kinds.  Last year the association put 600,000 fry into the Corrib.  That association is doing a better job in the work of the conservation and propagation of fish than is the board of statutory conservators.  I think it is most unfair&mdash;to put the matter no stronger than that&mdash;that a very numerous body of that kind, having all classes of the community as members, should have been denied representation.  I should also like to learn from the Minister whether amending legislation, dealing with the constitution of these boards, is to be introduced in the near future.  I think that the time has now come when some recognition should be given to these anglers' associations.  They are doing very good work all over the country and, in my opinion, they are the best instrument which the Minister has for the purpose of creating a healthy public opinion for the preservation and proper conservation of the fisheries throughout the country, and particularly the free fisheries.  They are helping to create a sporting instinct, which is a much better protection for our fisheries than any protection that can be afforded by the paid water-keepers. As I have referred to the water-keepers, I should like to point out that in the case of the board of conservators that I have already mentioned, practically all of its revenue is spent on water-keepers for the vested interests&mdash;the salmon fisheries in the Galway district&mdash;while very little is spent on the protection of the trout fisheries on the Corrib.  I know very well that there are many difficulties to be faced at the present time, and hence I do not wish to be too critical of the Minister and his Department in these matters.  In conclusion, I wish to stress that the time has come when some recognition should be given to the anglers' associations, particularly associations such as the one to which <Col N="809" /> I have referred, which are capable of doing big things.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who represents a coastal constituency, there are a few points that I wish to bring to the attention of the Minister.  Most of them have been mentioned already. One is the question of harbour improvements. I noticed in the newspapers a few days ago that another Minister, in the course of a letter to the Cork Chamber of Commerce or Harbour Commissioners, mentioned that the Government proposed to spend a certain amount of money on harbour improvements.  In the constituency that I represent there are a number of harbours, including the biggest harbour in the country.  With the exception, however, of Dún Laoghaire and Howth, every one of them is in a wrecked condition.  You would want an amphibious tank to get into them.</P>

      <P>The question of harbour improvements does not arise on this Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. L. Cosgrave Mr. L. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It does to this extent, that the Minister has responsibility for the control of fisheries.  I think we will all agree that, when you catch fish you must have some place to land them, and the usual place for the boats to land the fish is a harbour. I respectfully suggest, therefore, that the Minister might, with the assistance of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, consider the question of keeping the harbours in a proper state of repair and, if necessary, effecting any improvements in them that may be necessary. It would not take a great deal to put them into a proper state of repair.  At the moment they are useless to the fishermen and not a very pleasant spectacle for sightseers who may come as tourists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point that I want to mention is the question of protection. At the moment, I take it that it is not possible to do much in the way of providing adequate protection.  In view of the fact that we were not able <Col N="810" /> to do much in that respect before the war, we are not likely to be able to do it now, owing to the lack of the necessary fuel and the fact that the boats we have are wholly inadequate to cope with the heavier and faster boats which come into our harbours, even harbours which are close to built-up areas.  You have not to go to outlying regions like South Kerry in order to find those foreign boats coming in.  I have had complaints from people connected with the fishing industry in Dun Laoghaire. They find that when they go to sea in the early morning there are those large trawlers&mdash;British, Scotch or Welsh, sometimes two or three of them&mdash;in the fishing grounds.  When the Irish boats go out these move off. It is not good enough that they should be able to parade up and down the coast, taking the prime catch before the native fishermen have an opportunity of pursuing their work.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister could give the House any indication as to the amount of fish that is caught, taking one year with another.  Can he say if there has been any increase in the catches?  Can he give a rough indication as to the number of people employed in the fishing industry, and the income which the industry brings to them?  My last point is that I think it should be possible to have some organised scheme of distribution to make fish available at a cheaper rate than it is at the moment.  I quite appreciate Deputy Healy's point of view that the fishermen must live.  I congratulate him on being so outspoken, and hope that he does not get the pants taken off him at the next Fianna Fáil meeting.  It is quite true to say that in Dublin and in the larger cities and towns fish is now regarded by everybody as a luxury.  A few years ago herrings could be had at four for a penny.  Now you have the reverse position, when one herring costs 3d. or 4d.  People who could formerly have an adequate meal on herrings cannot do so now because the price is absolutely beyond their means.  Those who formerly could enjoy a certain amount of fish, not perhaps the select varieties favoured by some, but at any rate an adequate meal at a cheap <Col N="811" /> price, are no longer able to do so. I think that the Minister and his Department have not paid sufficient attention to the distribution of fish at a reasonable price.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasCarter1921" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to get some information from the Minister about the fresh-water fishermen, principally on the upper reaches of the Shannon and its tributaries.  These people are paying for nets and lines and they are controlled by the Electricity Supply Board to such an extent that they can only fish a certain number of hooks. Two men on a co-operative who were able to fish 1,500 hooks are now reduced to 300.  I would like the Minister to give me some information about the intentions of the Department regarding these men.  They are making a precarious livelihood.  They have no nets and I am glad that Deputies Bartley and Healy raised that point.  If they try to darn their nets they are prosecuted in court.  I think that if the Minister agrees to meet these men some time they would be glad to put forward their case to him.  I have advised them to go to a lawyer to get their position clarified, and I would be very thankful if the Minister would let me know how they stand at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to draw the Minister's attention to one matter in which I am interested and which affects thousands of people in this country.  The Sea Fisheries Association and all the others are evidently catching fish as plentifully as ever they were caught, but speaking for the rural community, fresh fish never reaches us.  Cities and towns are invariably well catered for, but fresh fish does not reach the rural community.  In times gone by we had a certain type of fish called stock fish, cured haddock, ling, cod or hake.  We get very small quantities of that.  Although I am living on the seaboard I have not seen fresh fish for months, and I think for months also we have not been able to secure salt fish&mdash;this cured fish I have mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am only one of thousands in the <Col N="812" /> rural districts in the same position.  We have fast days and Fridays throughout the year, and in the rural districts we have to work hard.  It is very unsatisfactory to come in to a meal and find you have only what is called dip&mdash; they have nothing else to fall back on. I have seen reports of boats coming in with large catches of fish which had to be dumped back in the sea because there was no demand for it.  I am asking the Minister to see that this cured fish can be bought in the country shops as it was in years gone by.  Every country shop at the cross-roads used to have fish for sale.  Now it is not available.  The only cured fish I have seen in a length of time is cured mackerel, and mackerel is not a tasty fish to eat because it tends to repeat. People in the country will not eat fish like that; they want cod, ling, haddock or hake.  I take it that the fish are still in the sea and that the boats are there.  Whatever little we did get of salted fish was this cured mackerel which had not been dumped back in the sea.  When we do get the other fish we have to pay 2/- a pound for it although you would get the best chop for about 2/-.  I wonder why this fish is not available and I would ask the Minister to see that instead of dumping this fresh fish back in the sea, it is sent to curing installations which should be established.  People in the country could then revert to that type of fish, and it would be available for fast days and Fridays throughout the year.  I ask the Minister to see that people in the country, who are the hardest workers, and who have no chance of getting fresh fish, should be able to get this fish which they appreciate in plentiful supply after their hard day's work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is most enlightening to listen to the views of authorities on production and retailing of fish on both sides of the House.  The underlying suggestion was that the aim of the fish trade was always to get the highest price.  Deputy Dillon talked about the dearness of salmon, but with all due respect to Deputy Dillon, cod was the highest-priced fish in Dublin for three weeks.  Where are you going to get cod?  The best fishing grounds, the <Col N="813" /> White Sea and the waters of Ireland, are closed to the trawlers of particular countries.  But our trawlers are only a joke.  Most of them are only little better than row-boats and they are quite unfitted to undertake the long journeys which would be required for successful fishing.</P>
      <P>I quite agree with the views of the men who know the subject.  Deputy Healy's family have been in the fishing trade for generations and were among the largest shippers of fish.  He suggested that the whole system of carrying fish should be overhauled in regard to the railways and the Sea Fisheries' Association.  I had a different criticism some years ago about the association, and we know their record.  To-day, it is true, they are more keen and adaptable to the needs of the situation, and of course they are always courteous when you ring them up on the telephone.  What are the facts?  We get plenty of fish in Dublin, and so long as there is private speculation in fish we will not be concerned about supplies.  I happen to direct the organisation of the workers in the best fish shops in Dublin. The whole concern of these shops is with choice fish.  They do not want to handle coarse fish, or to sell you a dozen herrings.  They do not want the poor people&mdash;they want to sell salmon, plaice and sole.  They have men doing nothing all day except filleting fish for their particular petit-bourgeois customers, but the ordinary worker does not get any more chance in Dublin than do the people Deputy O'Donovan spoke about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a market for fish, but no fisherman is willing to go to sea under the present conditions without getting a guaranteed week.  We had a statement made here to-night, and it will be introduced before the morning's light, in connection with putting of fishermen outside the scope of a particular Act on the grounds that they were not wage workers.  The man who goes out to sea to fish is like his comrade who goes down a stokehold of a ship&mdash;he must be mad, in view of the wages they get.  But, surely, when a man comes in with a good catch, he is entitled to get a guaranteed price. <Col N="814" /> Why do they throw it back into the sea?  Suppose there is a load of 150 cran landed at a particular port&mdash;the man who owns it can get a decent price only for 20 cran, and he has not even facilities to make manure out of the remainder.  The key to the situation is refrigeration and proper icing plants, but even the best of icing plants will not keep fish fresh for shipment overseas.</P>
    <P>These men land their fish in Kerry; the fish leave Kerry at a certain hour and, after a journey of seven or eight hours, they arrive in Dublin.  In Dublin they are immediately handled because, recognising that it is perishable stuff, the handlers are prepared to go out of their way to get the cargo dealt with.  There are occasions, after the the fish reach Kingsbridge, when the men will not be allowed to handle them.  If the train is only a quarter of an hour late, they are told: &ldquo;You cannot handle them.&rdquo;  The result is that the fish deteriorate by the time they reach the London market.</P>
    <P>We know we have not a market here for such fish.  You have, first of all, to get to realise that the people of this country are not fish-minded.  They have never been educated in the use of fish. Those who are anxious to have fish do not often get the opportunity to purchase them.  We hear all the talk about ling and other dried fish.  It is impossible to get that at the moment. The Norwegians are for the time being out of business and we never undertook that method of curing fish.  There are very few people in this country who know how to dry fish.  We do not kipper fish to any extent.  The few thousand fish kippered in Dublin do not amount to a row of pins.  You want a modern refrigerating plant in Dublin and you want the industry centralised.  How much better it would be if you could send the fish from Donegal or Kerry into a central depot with the assurance that, when it reaches there, there will be at least a guaranteed price?  If the market is tight you might get a little more, but at least you will get the guaranteed price.  If I were a fisherman, I would not land my catch without a reasonable return for all my labour.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="815" /> An important problem is the problem of distribution.  Fancy a man from West Cork saying he cannot get fresh fish, or any fish.  Outside the White Sea, Iceland or Newfoundland, I believe there are more fish around our coasts than in any other part of the world.  We have all classes of fish around our coasts.  At times there are masses of fish and yet we never do anything about it.  It is a tremendously vital trade.  It is all very well to talk in a flippant way about this matter, but it is a fundamental thing in our economy.  Those men who are engaged in fishing want some return for their labour.  They are not influenced altogether by love of country, or the development of the country in an economic sense, when they are engaged in fishing.  The fisherman wants some monetary return. I wonder how any of us would feel if, having laboured in the catching of fish, and sent them to the area of distribution, we are told that our catch is rejected.  That is the position of fishermen who do not get even the cost of carriage for their fish.</P>
    <P>I suggest it is the duty of the High Commissioner in London to look after our interests in this connection.  He is a very able man and very active in matters which concern ourselves and our friends across the water.  I suggest a representation from the High Commissioner would help to ease the situation.  These gentlemen sell fish in the London market at Billingsgate. I do not suppose our representations would carry much weight at the present moment with regard to prices in England, but at least we could keep the fish until we get an assurance that the price on the market in London is fixed.  There is no use in having fish landed here and then being unable to ship them.  As Deputy Healy says, as soon as the boats get orders they have to go to sea at once, but if there were proper organisation the fish could be sent out in time.  It would not take an hour to ship all the fish that would be sent from Galway or Kerry.  It is the kind of traffic that can be quickly handled.</P>
    <P>One would imagine that the Government <Col N="816" /> might think it advisable to get some experts to organise this industry on a proper basis.  The Minister for Agriculture has more than sufficient to do at present in connection with agriculture.  For six days we have listened to statements relating to his multifarious duties and the activities of his Department.  Now he is being asked to deal with fisheries.  Surely the Government ought to concentrate on this industry and have it organised in a better manner.  If you go down O'Connell Street, you can see the prices that are being charged for fish. If you go to any of the first-class shops, such as Dunn's, you will see the prices they are charging for different fish. They can charge anything for choice cuts.  We know they are not anxious to send salmon to England at existing prices there, because they could get far more for it in Dublin.  The price last week for salmon was 8/- a lb. Then, as regards plaice and sole, they are also fetching high prices.  I remember the time when the people would not buy plaice.  At the moment sole is almost worth its weight in gold.</P>
    <P>Why not fillet herrings, or turn them into paste, if necessary, and supply our institutions?  There are times when fish are thrown into the sea, but when there is such a surplus why should it not be distributed among our institutions? Take an institution like Grangegorman, where you have thousands of patients who are very willing to have food of this kind.  That is a point that might be considered.  There never need be any surplus on the market. All you want is proper organisation.  I am sure there is no one more concerned than Deputy Dillon about those matters, about the poor of Dublin especially.</P>
    <P>If you were to take a cart to-morrow and try to sell fish to the ordinary poor of Dublin, how would you fare?  The fact is that the people are not fish conscious.  They would sooner pay for a fillet of steak or a chop than buy a dozen of fish, even if they cost only threepence.  We will have to educate them and get the dieticians to tell them the value of the fish.  If you have kippered herrings or finnan haddock the people will buy them.  Finnan haddock <Col N="817" /> is a very tempting fish.  If we could have education in relation to fish imparted under the supervision of the Department, we would be doing a good day's work for the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say he hoped to be in a position shortly to obtain supplies of nets and gear.  I hope the nets and gear will be allocated to the various districts in an equitable manner, so that fishermen all along the sea coast, and not the fishermen of any particular part of the country, will benefit. I have received representations in this connection from the fishermen of the Erne estuary.  The salmon season commences there soon and these men are in a very bad way for nets and gear.  I hope steps will be taken to give these necessary supplies to those engaged in the salmon fisheries on the Erne.</P>
      <P>The principal reason why I intervene in the debate is to find out from the Minister what control he has over appointments made by boards of fishery conservators throughout the country.  There is general dissatisfaction in South Donegal over the appointments recently made by the Ballyshannon Board of Conservators.  There were vacancies for a secretary and an inspector and, although the fishery district which is governed by the Ballyshannon Board of Conservators contains two of the most Irish-speaking parishes in Ireland, Glencolumbcille and Kilcar, Irish was not made a condition of the appointment and the successful applicants have no knowledge of the Irish language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether these appointments are subject to the sanction of the Minister or not.  I am not interested in any particular candidate, but when local authorities throughout Donegal make appointments, the various Departments, particularly the Department of Local Government, insist that the person appointed must have a competent knowledge of Irish. These positions in the gift of the board of conservators are pretty well paid; an inspector is very well paid, and I do not see why exceptions should be made in these cases.  It would be interesting <Col N="818" /> to learn from the Minister what his attitude is to appointments of this nature and whether, in spite of Government policy in regard to the revival of the Irish language, appointments of this nature, in the very heart of the Gaeltacht, are given to non-Irish speakers.</P>
    <P>I should also like to know if there are any qualifications necessary, or if any qualifications are sought for in connection with positions of this nature.  I understand that for the position of inspector there were over 60 applicants, some of them with years of experience at fishery weirs and various fisheries in different parts of the country.  But a gentleman who had no connection with fisheries, no previous fishery experience, was appointed an inspector.  I want to know if that appointment was subject to the sanction of the Minister and if he is prepared to stand over that.  I do not know what powers he has in connection with the matter but, if he has not got them, I suggest that he should take powers to see that these appointments are made in the way that appointments generally are made.</P>

I want to ventilate that and to ask the Minister, if he has any control or power over these conservators, to see to it that in Irish-speaking districts it shall be a condition of these appointments that the persons appointed shall have a competent knowledge of Irish; that these appointments will be made through the Local Appointments Commission, and that, for responsible positions like that of an inspector and the secretary of a board of conservators, some qualifications shall be necessary and be provided for in the application forms.</P>

      <P>There is just one point that I want to put to the Minister. I did not know until this afternoon that this Vote was to come on to-night.  However, I could not let the opportunity pass without making some remarks on the question of fishing gear.  I regret to say that there are many men in my constituency who are absolutely unemployed now as a result of the loss of fishing nets, particularly salmon nets.  The Minister will remember that I have been in communication with him about this matter, but, unfortunately, nothing very much has been done and it is the cause of great hardship in Waterford.  The Minister is probably aware that arrangements were made by the British Legion to get certain nets and material for the mending of nets across from England, but up to this nothing has been done from their end this year.  The position is that they are confined to getting them for their own members.  There are many others who are not members and I feel very much for them, because it seems as if they had no one to speak for them.  I would ask the Minister to take a special note of it and, when replying, to hold out some hope to these men, because they are in a state of depression from what they have suffered in the past and what they are likely to suffer in the future.  I am sure the Minister realises the necessity for this and I need not labour the point any further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether any progress has been made in connection with the erection of a purification tank so far as shell fish are concerned.  I refer now to the mussel industry.  There is one tank on the Kerry coast which has proved to be a great boon to the men engaged in the industry there and has enabled them to command a very high price for mussels in the British <Col N="820" /> market.  As the Minister is aware; owing to certain things which happened in England as a result of mussels that were exported from the east coast, there was a sort of ban put on, with the result that the livelihoods of those who were depending on the mussel industry were jeopardised.  I would impress upon the Minister that, whenever circumstances permit, he should proceed with the erection of a purification tank at some convenient spot on the east coast which would cater for the mussel gatherers in Dundalk, Carlingford, Omeath, Mornington, etc.</P>
      <P>In regard to the provision of gear for the fishermen, I think the Minister should see that all tariffs on the importation of twine, etc., essential for the making or repairing of nets are removed.  Certain enterprising fishermen were able to secure a certain quantity of twine, only to find on its arrival at Dundalk that they were required to pay a tariff of 30 or 40 per cent. on it.  That necessitated an application being made to the Department for a permit, which resulted in a delay of a fortnight or three weeks at a time when the fishing season was on.  All these tariffs should be removed on small things like that so as to enable these men to get the things they want, no matter from what source, without the delay in respect of permits and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards territorial waters, I do not set much store on them.  Fish like to have freedom to travel through any part of the ocean.  I was surprised at Deputy Healy talking about English trawlers coming in when we all read a few weeks ago about Galway men objecting to Donegal men fishing outside Galway.  What is the use of talking about British or French trawlers? Is it not plain that we have not the enterprise to build boats big enough to go out in competition with these men?  So far as I can see from some of the speeches made here and on former occasions, what some of our fishermen want is that the fish should come into them and that they should not have to go out for them at all. Talking about a few trawlers coming within three or four miles of the coast <Col N="821" /> is displaying an inferiority complex. It is about time that Irishmen, who are so fond of pointing out what a great race we are, should live up to that and meet their competitors in every sphere.  When I was working in England, I did not think that I was inferior to the men there.  I think it is a joke to talk about our territorial waters when we have the example there of the Galway men, led by a few of the Galway T.D.'s, trying to prevent their fellow Irishmen from Donegal taking the fish that, possibly, they were too lazy to go out and catch. That is straight from the shoulder. That really happened.</P>
    <P>There seems to be no encouragement given to the unfortunate angler, especially the working man, who has to pay £2 a year for a licence.  He seems to get no chance.  Whatever may be the reason, salmon trout is not found in our rivers in the quantities that were there years ago.  I do not know what has happened to cause that state of affairs.  It may be that there is lack of civic spirit in putting down poaching. It is almost impossible to get a conviction.  We have to pay water bailiffs' salaries every year.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to Deputy Brady that it would be more important to get these people to carry out their duty than to be talking about the few appointments that were made in Donegal and inquiring whether the appointees had a competent knowledge of Irish or not.  I would ask him to inquire whether the persons who were recently appointed as judges had a competent knowledge of Irish.  I would ask him to inquire whether persons appointed to all the other big jobs, that command big salaries, in this country, had a competent knowledge of Irish instead of talking about the few jobs in Donegal, involving a few pounds a year.  Surely the board of conservators should have freedom in that respect.  As a Deputy, I should be sorry to introduce a petty thing like that in this House, in regard to some poor fellow who was lucky enough to get a job.  I certainly would not bring up the question as to whether or not he had a competent knowledge of Irish.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="822" /> I should like to impress upon the Minister the desirability of doing something in regard to the poor fishermen who earn their living by salmon fishing, especially in these months.  The season has already begun in some rivers.  The Dundalk River, I believe, will not be opened up properly until the month of May or June and I know that most of these men's nets are in a very bad state owing to the fact that they were not in a position to renew or repair them during the last few years.  I would ask the Minister to make it clear that no obstacles will be placed in the way of any fisherman who is lucky enough to be able to get the necessary quantity of twine to make new nets or to repair old ones.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>For the past 21 or 22 years, in this House, we have heard stressed the importance of the fishing industry.  Year after year the same complaints have been levelled against the Ministry and to-night during the debate on this Estimate the same complaints were made again.  I think the Minister for Agriculture has sufficient to do in the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate on the Estimate for Agriculture continued over a period of six days.  More than half the number of Deputies in the House have taken part in that debate.  The Minister was put to the pin of his collar, so to speak, to answer all the complaints and all the points that were dealt with on that Estimate.  In my opinion, in view of all that has been said in regard to fishing and in view of the fact that it has been repeatedly stated that the fishing industry is second only to agriculture, the importance of the fishing industry would warrant the appointment of a separate Minister for Fisheries.  I suggest that fishing has not been properly developed in this country.  We used to hear, prior to the Treaty, prior to the establishment of our own Government, that the fishing industry was not developed and that one of the first things to which an Irish Government should set its hand was the development of that industry. I suggest that so long as one man is in charge of the two important <Col N="823" /> Ministries, Agriculture and Fisheries, the fishing industry will not get the attention that its importance would warrant.</P>
    <P>I notice that there is a reduction in the Estimate this year for the provision of boats and gear.  I wonder is that because there is a lesser demand being made by fishermen or is it that the Department are not prepared to extend the facilities for the provision of gear and boats that were available in recent years?  The question of nets has been mentioned by Deputy Coburn, and I think the Minister knows that a great many of the fishermen to-day are at their wits' ends to know where to get twine, ropes and netting.  Because they have not been available in recent years, a great many fishermen who should normally be engaged in fishing on our rivers are at present unable to take part in that activity.  I know that at the present time there are men on the River Slaney, in Wexford, who, in consequence of the fact that ropes, twine and nets are not available, will not be able to go on the river this year, seeking a livelihood by fishing.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell us what provision has been made in regard to the provision of nets and ropes.  I should like him to tell us if there is any possibility of the fishermen on the Slaney being permitted to fish earlier than the 1st April.  I think some kind of promise was made to them within the last couple of years. These men complain bitterly that the River Slaney is one of the latest, if not the latest, river in the whole country. They complain that rod fishermen are fishing for months prior to the time they are permitted to do so and that that is very damaging to their interests.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of trawlers, Deputy Coburn suggested that we had an inferiority complex.  I do not think that is the position at all. I do not think our fishermen have an inferiority complex but, unfortunately, the fishing industry has never been firmly established in this country to the same extent as it has been in other countries and in consequence the <Col N="824" /> trawlers and fishing boats that our men have at their disposal are not sufficiently large to enable them to go into the waters of which these other people take advantage.  I suppose it is not an easy thing to have our territorial waters patrolled during the period of the war but it would appear to me that absolute laxity prevails so far as protection for our fishermen is concerned.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Cosgrave who mentioned the question of harbours and the provision of piers for fishermen. I come from a county of which, I suppose, three-quarters touches the sea.  In parts of the county, especially in the south, there is plenty of fish but because of the fact that the men have no facilities for landing the fish they are not in a position to derive any benefit from it.  The Minister knows the county which he represents as well as I do and I think he will agree with me that it should be the duty of some Ministery to make these harbours navigable. Some effort should be made to erect piers or landing stages for fishermen.</P>
    <P>With regard to the marketing of fish, I am prepared to admit that the Sea Fisheries Association have, to a great extent, benefited the fishermen in various parts of the country, but I suggest that that association is concerned only with conveying the fish from the sea coast to the big towns and cities.  I come from the town of Wexford, and it is almost impossible to get fish there on a Friday.  It would appear to me that all the fish landed in Wexford is brought inland or up to Dublin, or sent to England. It is a peculiar thing that, if one goes into a provincial town in the Midlands, it is nearly always possible to get fish, but in the seaport towns it is very hard to get it.  That is an anomalous position which should be rectified.</P>
    <P>A great many people are inclined to criticise the fishermen, but their job is a very dangerous and precarious one.  Those of them who are engaged on a share basis get very little money. There is a big difference between what they get and the price that the people in the cities and towns are asked to pay when the fish is marketed.  If the <Col N="825" /> fishing industry is to be properly developed, something should be done to secure a decent livelihood for our fishermen.  If the middlemen's profits were eliminated to some extent the fishermen would be able to get a better living, and there would not be such a great difference between the price charged for fish now and the price which would be necessary if those reforms were brought about.  I would suggest to the Minister that the Sea Fisheries Association should see that there is a better system of distribution, so that fish will be available in the towns and villages throughout the country.  I would also ask him to ensure that the fishermen get a better return from the dangerous work that they do.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Coburn who referred to the question of purification tanks for mussels.  I think the Minister knows as well as I do that a great deal of mussels are caught around the coast of Wexford, and a large number of people would get a living from that industry if there were a purification tank in the area.  I think the Minister should give consideration to that very important matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney asked me a few questions which he prefaced by saying that he hoped I would not misrepresent him.  I hope I will not do so.  I did not mean to misrepresent anybody, either in this debate or in the last one.  He asked me what attitude I would take on the Drainage Bill.  There is a clause in the Drainage Bill which, I am sure, the Deputy has studied, and he must realise from that clause that where there is a fishery interest the Minister for Fisheries has what amounts to the last word.  The Minister for Agriculture&mdash;who is also the Minister for Fisheries&mdash;naturally has to keep the drainage interests in mind.  He must weigh up which is the more important in each individual case.  It is quite possible that in one case he might decide that the fishery interest was a minor matter&mdash;that the drainage interest was more important.  On the other hand, if the fishery interest <Col N="826" /> were very important, and the drainage authority could get over the drainage difficulty by spending a little more in another way, he would see that the fishery interest was looked after. It is a matter of weighing up the <i>pros</i> and <i>cons.</i>  I have no reason to doubt the figures given by the Deputy with regard to the employment given by inland fisheries at one time, but they are giving nothing like that now. I take it that, at the time when so much employment was given, the fish were caught by means of lines; now, on account of the weirs, there is not so much employment.  The Deputy wonders why there is not more fish on the slabs in our towns.  I think Deputy Dillon answered that question fairly well.  I think there would be more fish there if there were merchants in the town who were energetic and anxious to have fish; they would get in touch with some organisation like the Sea Fisheries Association and fish would be made available.</P>
      <P>Complaints have been made against the weirs.  The only commission on inland fisheries that sat in recent years &mdash;I think it sat about 1934&mdash;would, strange to say, go further than we have ever gone in the way of weirs. In fact, they recommend that all the fish should be caught by means of a weir right across the water, so that there would be no further necessity for netting or anything else.  They considered that that was the rational way to do it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish raised a question about trawlers down in Rosslare. I think that, generally speaking, whatever Deputy Dillon or other Deputies think, the trouble from trawlers has been very little for some years past.  There may have been isolated instances like this one in Rosslare. At the moment, we are having correspondence which will lead to discussion on this whole question of fishery limits, and I do not think I can say any more in regard to the matter at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney asked about the 1939 Act.  Of course, it has been put into operation in many respects with regard to protection and <Col N="827" /> that kind of thing, but it has not been put into operation with regard to purchase of the ownership of fisheries in the estuaries and so on.  I think that is a matter which had better be left over for the present, because those privately-owned fisheries have an inflated value at the moment owing to the emergency and the high price for fish, so I think it would not be advisable for the State to buy them out. On the whole, I think the purchase of those rights will have to be left over.</P>

      <P>There was a question raised by Deputy Healy with regard to the transit of fish from Cahirciveen. <Col N="828" /> My Department is doing everything possible through the Department of Industry and Commerce to bring about an improvement, but there are difficulties that are not so easily got over. In any case, I have not got the last word in the matter.  If the fishermen in that area wanted any information with regard to the trade and the prices in Britain, it could be got easily from the Department of Fisheries.  I do not think that Deputy Healy could complain that any letter he sent to the Department is not answered; in fact I do not think he could say that his letters were not promptly answered and there is no reason why he should not seek the information in that way if he desired.  The British do not consult us when fixing prices for fish other than salmon.  The buyer fixes the price which he is prepared to pay and the seller can either give or keep the fish.

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already informed the Deputy, the British do not consult the Department here in regard to the fixing of prices.  We hear about these reductions only after they have actually taken place.  We may protest against them; sometimes we may succeed in our protest but we do not always succeed.  I do not think that a reduction in the price of fish to the consumer would be a very popular step with the fish trade or fishermen in general.  I agree with Deputy Larkin that, even if the price of fish were reduced, it would not induce some people to eat fish.  It is a well-known fact that when people could have a table d'hôte dinner in which fish was included, they passed over the fish <Col N="829" /> course.  They would not take fish although they had not to pay anything extra.  Even when herrings were very good value, when they could be bought at 3d., 4d. or 6d. a dozen, poor people were prepared to pay ? or 2/- sfor steak rather than buy herrings.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon raised the question of trout hatcheries.  It is not true, I think, that experts disagree about the distribution of fry and ova for the brown trout.  A rather strange thing about the distribution of ova is that it is more a psychological help than anything else.  I know that, in the distribution of ova for salmon, an association makes quite a lot of fuss about the amount of ova they get. Probably the amount would not be more than they would get from three of four salmon in a river or lake but the fact that they get these ova makes them more interested in the protection of the fisheries.  For that reason the distribution of ova and fry for the brown trout is not being neglected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>A great deal more could be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree, and something more will be done as the years go on.  Deputy Dillon raised the point also that it was impossible to get salmon through the Sea Fisheries Association.  The association was started as a producers' organisation, to look after the financing, first of all, of the equipment of members and then to look after the marketing of their catches.  None of their members is in the salmon business.  They do not finance them in the salmon business <Col N="830" /> because they cannot get a hire-purchase agreement for line and gear for salmon fishing as a salmon net is liable to be confiscated if there is a prosecution and, therefore, it is not regarded as good security.  The association, therefore, do not deal with men in the salmon fishing business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely if the association deems it expedient to go into the fish and chip business and set up shops for that purpose, they would not say that they could not sell chips because they did not deal in potatoes.  They would get the potatoes from another company.  Could they not get all the salmon they would require from some company in the salmon trade?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They have not gone into the fish and chip business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But surely they could buy salmon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They always regard the association as a producers' association and they have not looked to any other side of the business.  It is quite possible that, on reconsideration, they would go more into the trading side and buy salmon from somebody else, but so far they have not done so.  A point was raised by Deputy Bartley as to the possibility of spinning thread in this country from flax for the making of lines and trammel nets.  Some progress has been made in that respect and I am glad to inform the Deputy that we may be able to announce the details shortly.  I should like Deputies to understand, however, that so far nothing definite has emerged, and I do not want them to be too optimistic. The flax we grow in this country goes through the Ministry of Supplies and is exchanged for fibre of two kinds. There is binder twine, of which we get a certain amount, and the other variety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Why cannot you use flax fibre?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the question which is under consideration and it looks <Col N="831" /> as if the results will be satisfactory. I should like Deputy Bartley to give me some particulars of the case he has in mind in which he stated that an official of the Sea Fisheries Association interfered with an election, because that should not happen.  The whole question of the constitution of boards of conservators will come before the Dáil in the near future, that is to say within 12 months.  The question of fishery legislation will arise under a consolidating Act and then the question of inland boards of conservators will be considered.  At the same time the question referred to by Deputy Brian Brady can be raised, that is the question of the control by the Minister over appointments.  At present the Minister has very little control.  He does sanction an appointment made by a board of conservators, but he has no power, I am afraid, with regard to the qualifications.  He has no power to refuse sanction unless he has very good reason, such as that the board had not made the appointment in accordance with the conditions set out in the advertisement or that it had made the appointment in some irregular manner.</P>
      <P>The question of harbour improvements is a very big matter, although Deputy Cosgrave seemed to think it was not.  At times the Department of Fisheries is intimately concerned with it.  If the question of the improvement of a harbour arises, the Minister for Fisheries is asked if he has any observations to make and, if there are fishing boats likely to use the harbour, the Minister may recommend that certain improvements should be carried out but, of course, it is for the other Department to deal with these recommendations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Deputy Cosgrave asked for some figures.  I shall send him the annual report on fisheries in which he will get the figures which he seeks.  Deputy O'Donovan is anxious to get cured fish.  We ourselves never went into that business.  We cured herring and mackerel, but we did not go in for curing all the other fish which Deputy O'Donovan has in mind.  I recommend Deputy O'Donovan to write to the Sea Fisheries Association, who may make some suggestions with regard to supplying him with fish every week, as they have done in other cases. The price of fish is a very big problem. We must bear in mind that fish is very perishable and that it is consumed on only one day in the week, so that the fisherman must earn his living on two or three days of the week in preparation for Friday.  The fish shops do practically all their business on one day and they must carry a staff that will be sufficient for that.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Fish and poultry.  In any event, they have to carry a staff which is rather large for other days of the week than Friday.  Deputy Larkin referred to wages.  Fishermen in this country do not receive wages.  They get a share in the trawler and the boats of the Sea Fisheries Association. Sometimes, that share is small and, sometimes, it is large.  In recent years, it has been very good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>A share.  With regard to the reference to purification tanks, we are anxious to wait until we see how the Cromane plant gets on.  We want to see the returns from that tank before we set about building another tank.  We should be largely influenced <Col N="833" /> with regard to the size of another tank by our experience there.  If things go well&mdash;and things have gone well in Cromane; there has been a remarkable increase in the amount of mussels passing through that tank&mdash;we shall build another tank on the east coast.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The tide will come in again.  Deputy Mrs. Redmond referred to fishing gear, particularly salmon nets.  It is difficult to get nets.  We succeeded in getting twine for the mending of nets.  We are doing everything possible in that way and we shall continue to do that.  I am aware that the British Legion in Lismore got some nets last year.  They did that of their own initiative, and I am not sure whether they got any this year or not. Deputy Coburn mentioned the question of a tariff on twine coming in for nets. That impost is, invariably, remitted on my recommendation and, if anybody applies to me in connection with it, I shall attend to the matter.  Deputy Corish referred to the time for fishing on the River Slaney.  Under the fishery code, any change in the season for fishing must be preceded by a public inquiry, properly advertised. As a result of that inquiry, it must be reported to me that the fishery, as a whole would be improved by the change which is recommended.  No change was recommended as a result of the last inquiry or the inquiry before that.</P>

      <P>There is no conceivable reason why this Estimate should be taken to-night.  There is plenty of time to deal with it, and, if it was never taken, Government business could be transacted.  Everybody in the House is prepared to facilitate Ministers in getting their business done in a reasonable way but if Ministers want us to take up, at 2.15, a group of Estimates requiring the expenditure of millions of pounds, I shall be no party to giving them any facilities.  I shall debate and divide on every Estimate and do everything I can to protract the business. We have helped the Government in any way we could to get their business transacted in this session. There is no justification for trying to silence debate by calling a group of Estimates at 2 o'clock in the morning. Let the Minister move the adjournment and he can rest assured that he will get every co-operation in getting the Estimates through after Easter.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Dillon.  It is most unreasonable to ask the Dáil, at 2.10 in the morning, to <Col N="835" /> pass such an important Estimate as that for the Department of Justice.  A number of Deputies have had to go home because trains and trams left early and they could not get to their homes after a certain hour.  Even if the Vote for the Department of Agriculture took so long, does anybody suggest that there was undue delay? Everybody who spoke on the Estimate was entitled to speak.  All the 139 members could have spoken if they so desired.  The debate which took place showed the importance of the Estimate and showed the interest the people are taking in the subject and how they want to help the Government to get the land tilled so as to provide the necessary food.  I do not think that the Government, in a fit of pique, because the discussion occupied six days, ought to ask us, after 2 o'clock, to take up consideration of so important an Estimate as that for the Department of Justice.</P>

      <P>Might I add my voice to the appeal that has been made to the Minister and the Government Party?  I would ask the members of the Government Party and other Deputies to realise what we are asked to do at this hour in the morning.  If there is any Department that should represent the word &ldquo;democracy&rdquo;, it is the Department of Justice, which lays down the principle of the equality of all people under the law.  We are asked now, at almost 3 o'clock in the morning, to put through all the Votes concerned with the Department of Agriculture.  We are also asked at this hour of the morning to put through all the Votes dealing with the Department of Justice and with the Army.  Now, about one-third of the total expenditure on all the various Estimates for this year is concerned with these Estimates on which we are now asked to vote at 3 o'clock in the morning; and we are supposed, in this Assembly, to be the responsible representatives of the taxpayers.  There is no getting away from the fact that, if the gun is put up to our heads, in effect, and if we are told that all these Votes have to be cleared up by 6 o'clock in the morning, it will only mean the imposition of a punishment <Col N="836" /> upon us and the people whom we represent, because, as has been said, this Dáil has spent six days in discussing the main, primary, and principal industry in this country&mdash;namely, agriculture.  I suggest that we have often spent months in discussing cheap political Bills, and it was not regarded as a waste of time; but now, because we have spent six days in discussing the Vote for Agriculture&mdash;the most important Vote that could come before this House&mdash;the people whom we are supposed to represent are to be punished by not giving adequate time for a proper discussion of the remaining Votes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must admit that the Minister for Justice has always displayed, both inside and outside of this House, a very firm sense of justice; and, therefore, I put to him the question: is the proposition that has been put up to us now, a just one?  The Minister for Justice has never had any trouble since this emergency began&mdash;nor has his Government&mdash;in getting through any Estimate associated with the Department of Justice, the maintenance of law and order, or the safety of the country generally.  Since the emergency began, Votes connected with the Army or the Department of Justice went through as speedily as possible, and with all the efficiency at our command.  Therefore, I suggest, that it is unreasonable to ask us to devote our attention, in an alert and intelligent manner, to these Votes at this hour in the morning.  I realise that we ought to release the Minister for Agriculture from his seat on the Front Bench, since he has been sitting here all those days listening to the debate on agriculture and fisheries.  It is unreasonable to expect him to sit here any longer, and I think that it would have been quite a reasonable thing to release him, even at 9 o'clock, so that the House might be enabled to take up the other Votes.  I would be prepared to agree to sit all night, in order to release the Minister for Agriculture, and take up the other Votes in the meantime, but I do not think it is reasonable to ask us to do this now, at this hour in the morning, and I would appeal to the sense of fair play <Col N="837" /> of the Minister for Justice and of the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">

      <P>I think that, perhaps, it would be a little unfair to make the charge that, in making these arrangements, the Government were actuated by a fit of pique because of the rather prolonged debate on the Vote for Agriculture.  I think it would be more correct to say that the arrangements were prompted by the fact that the Government had an eye on the time that would be taken up by discussions on the Estimates as a whole, and that they feared that it would not be possible to carry all the Estimates through within a reasonable time in the summer period.  I think that that was what prompted the suggestion that we should sit until 6 a.m. Having said that, may I join my voice to those who have spoken on this matter and who have suggested that, having regard to the importance of a Vote, on which practically all members of the House would have something to say, it would be totally unfair, and unbusinesslike to say the least, to hold members here until a late hour in the morning so as to put Votes through without adequate discussion.  I am sure that all members of the House are content to remain on here until 6 a.m., if they are forced to do so.  I am satisfied that they would do so willingly, if they thought it would be in the best interests of the country.</P>

Incidentally, I think it is unfair to those gentlemen who have left the House already.

So far as the members of our Party are concerned, at any rate, we have kept our group here together, and are quite prepared to sit here until 6 o'clock in the morning, or whatever time may have been decided upon; but, in our opinion, it is outrageous that, in view of the agreement that was come to to-day, there should now be a change. I do not think that there was anything outrageous in spending five days on the debate on agriculture.  That suggestion has been made here, I think. On the contrary, I think that even if the debate on agriculture had taken ten or even more days, it would have been a fine thing.  It was the greatest and most important debate that we have had in this House for a long time, and if this agreement about the termination of our sitting had not been come to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Some of the new <Col N="839" /> Deputies do not seem to understand this, but there is a difference between an agreement that is come to between Parties in this House and an announcement made by the spokesman for the Government Party as to the order of business for the day.

There was no question of pique in the matter; but it must be recognised that some of the new Deputies here may wish to take a longer time in the discussion of every Estimate than was formerly taken; and judging by the time that has been taken up by the discussion on the Vote for Agriculture, it would look as if we would be here till Christmas if a similar amount of time were to be taken in discussing the remaining Estimates.  I am just as anxious to get home as any Deputy in this House, but I am quite willing to remain here for as long as may be necessary.  It seems to me to be a curious thing, however, that it is only now that this question has been raised.</P>

I asked the Government not to insist on taking all the Votes, but I did not do so very forcibly.  At the same time, I thought it unreasonable, and I protested.  It was for the purpose of not curtailing the debate on agriculture that I let it go by default, although I put it to the Minister that it was unreasonable to expect the House to deal with all the Votes.  However, it was decided more or less in a haphazard way to continue and to see how far we could get.  Now, having finished the Agriculture and Fisheries Votes, and having relieved the Minister for Agriculture, <Col N="840" /> who has had to sit for so many days on the Front Bench, I think the Government could very well accept the motion to adjourn now.</P>

      <P>Deputies will, I think, agree that there has been no want of reasonableness on this side of the House so far as the House is concerned and there is no attempt to be unreasonable now.  The debate on agriculture, probably justifiably, took a long time, but we are only begining the Estimates, and I have heard in my years here on both sides of the House frequent complaints when the House was kept sitting through the months of July and August.  If we were to take the time occupied by the first Estimate as any indication of the time which might be sought to be taken on all the other Estimates, I think the Minister for Justice would not be far out in his suggestion that we would not get through the Estimates very much before Christmas.  It was not with any desire to rush matters that we asked the House to complete the Estimates before us to-day by 6 o'clock in the morning.  Deputies who have experience of the House will remember that it frequently happened that the Justice Estimates were got through in an hour.</P>

      <P>I do not think it took three days, but if it is the wish of the House that we ought not to sit any longer to-night, I, on behalf of the Government, am prepared to meet the House.  I hope, however, that the House will remember it and try to be reasonable with us in our endeavour to get the Estimates through.</P>
      <P>Progress reported.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 2.25 a.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 18th April.</P>
