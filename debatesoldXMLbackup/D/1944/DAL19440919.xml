    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is now in a position to indicate in detail what steps have been taken by the Government to formulate schemes of economic and social importance which can be brought into operation immediately after the present emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in reply to Parliamentary Questions addressed to me on the 27th October and 30th March last, a Cabinet Committee was set up in November, 1942, to direct the post-war planning activities of all Departments.  I also stated that a committee with wide terms of reference was engaged in the consideration of the post-war policy in regard to agriculture. This committee has already submitted a number of interim reports to the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Cabinet Committee, which has been meeting frequently, has considered and approved in principle a large number of schemes submitted to it by the several Departments and has continued to urge on all Departments the desirability of expediting arrangements for the co-relating of these schemes and their development to the greatest extent possible in existing circumstances.  The matters covered by these schemes include agriculture, land division, afforestation, fisheries, housing and other constructional works, transport and communications and general industrial development. Details of certain projects, such as rural electrification and arterial drainage, <Col N="1498" /> have already been made public and other schemes will be published from time to time according as they reach the appropriate stage.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will recollect that at the end of last year a separate branch was established in the Department of Industry and Commerce to which was assigned the task of ensuring the execution on a basis planned in consultation with the various interests concerned, of all building activities in the post-war years, whether sponsored by the Government, by local authorities, or by private enterprise.  A considerable amount of preparatory work has already been accomplished by this branch, and much valuable information accumulated.</P>
    <P>I should like to impress on the Deputy, however, that the scarcity conditions which characterise the emergency will not disappear with the cessation of hostilities, and that many types of materials, and possibly certain types of labour, will be scarce for varying periods after the war.  Most of the plans, therefore, which are being prepared now can only be given effect to gradually according as the supply position improves, and it seems inevitable that for some time a system of priorities will have to be operated, at least so far as building and constructional works are concerned. The necessary preliminary steps to this end are under consideration.</P>
    <P>I should add that special attention is being given to the planning of works with a high employment content for the larger urban areas and for those rural areas which past experience has shown to be most likely to need works of this kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will recall that the Minister for Finance in the last House indicated a certain sympathy towards certain types of pensioners who were <Col N="1500" /> in receipt of pension from industrial firms and in receipt of small pensions from trade unions.  He indicated that he was prepared at that stage to approach sympathetically cases of that kind.  May I say that the Minister for Industry and Commerce also referred at a later stage to the question of small pensions as far as railwaymen were concerned.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary indicate that he is prepared to reconsider this question in the light of the sympathetic assurances given in the last House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Sympathy has been shown to these particular classes of the community in the steps taken since 1941 to deal with old age pensioners and blind pensioners residing in county boroughs and, in more recent times, with certain types of old age pensioners residing in rural areas.  I am not in a position to say that anything further can be done at this stage to deal with these particular classes.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether he is aware that honorary consultants to hospitals and sanatoria have been informed by officers of his Department that they are not permitted to use their petrol ration for the purpose of travelling to and from such institutions; and whether, in view of the valuable public services rendered by such honorary consultants, he is prepared to sanction the use of their petrol ration to facilitate them in carrying out such honorary medical service.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that honorary consultants to hospitals and sanatoria have been informed by officers of my Department that they are not permitted to use their petrol <Col N="1504" /> ration for the purpose of travelling to and from such institutions.</P>
      <P>Petrol and private motor vehicles have been allowed for the use of members of the medical profession in travelling on urgent and necessary visits to patients in cases where public transport is not available or suitable.

Surely, if petrol can be used for pleasure purposes, the Minister should be able to facilitate gentlemen who are giving their services free to sanatoria?  If they are to depend on public transport, it will mean that either their private practice will have to be sacrificed to a later portion of the day, or that they must give insufficient time to the patients in these institutions.</P>

They are allowed petrol for the purpose of performing urgent necessary duties to the public. In so far as they have these urgent duties to perform, they are entitled to use their motor vehicles for that purpose. In so far as their duties are not urgent, or can be discharged by means of the public transport available, they are expected to avail of the public transport services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A deputation from the public bodies of Galway discussed this matter with the Department of Industry and Commerce in March, 1943.  It was explained to this deputation that the principal emergency factor affecting Galway was the need to operate vessels to the ports nearest the destinations of the bulk of their cargoes so as to secure the quickest turn-round of vessels and to save internal transport.</P>
      <P>More recently, a shortage of shipping for cross-Channel traffic has made it necessary to confine vessels to the shortest sea routes, irrespective of internal transport.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, is he not aware that some of the stuff that is coming at the moment into the ports of Dublin and Cork is being sent overland to Galway? For the saving of transport overland, would he not consider directing that some of the boats should go to Galway port, especially in view of the fact that owing to the position at Galway docks he had to grant a loan some time ago to pay the salary of the harbour master there?  Would the Minister not consider sending one or two small boats to the Galway port?  In so far as shipping to the western area is concerned, it would be more suitable to have the boats going to Galway than coming to Dublin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The main problem of importing goods across Channel at the moment is the scarcity of shipping.

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if, in view of the unsatisfactoriness of green timber and turf as fuel for the threshing of the very large corn harvest this year, and the danger of fire attendant on their use in steam threshers, he will make available either coal or seasoned timber for this season's threshings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the implication that turf and timber are not satisfactory fuels for threshing purposes.  That the contrary is the case is borne out by the general experience of the last few seasons.</P>
      <P>In the existing critical supply situation it is not possible to make coal available, other than to a limited extent for the movement of threshing sets from farm to farm.  The question of procuring suitable timber for use in the actual threshing operations is one for the farmers themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that I am speaking for one of the biggest tillage areas in the State, and that the farmers there have nothing but inferior turf or green timber for the threshings?  Is the Minister aware that timber is very scarce in parts of the County Wexford?  There are some places where you cannot get it.  I have attended some threshings this year myself. I have been in haggards and have seen the steam dying down two, three or four times in the one day. That means the work of all hands at the threshings is stopped until steam <Col N="1507" /> is got up again.  The result is that it takes 12 hours to do eight hours' threshing.  I would ask the Minister to try to relieve the situation a bit, especially in South Wexford and in parts of North Wexford where there is neither turf nor timber.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that dissatisfaction prevails among the workers employed in the coal-mining industry, especially in the area of Castlecomer, because, owing to the frequent curtailment of their working time caused by flooding, air conditions, collapses, breakdown of machinery, illness and accident, they have difficulty in qualifying for annual and public holiday pay under the provisions of the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1939; and if he will reconsider the representations made to him in this matter after the passing of the Act by the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, which seek a reduction in the qualifying number of hours stipulated in sub-sections 1, 2 and 3 of Section 10 of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received representations to the effect that in the case of Castlecomer miners a reduction should be made in the number of hours required in order to qualify for annual and public holidays with pay under the provisions of the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1939.  These representations have been fully considered but I regret that I cannot see my way to accede to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not believe that everything possible should be done, particularly at the present time, to encourage the maximum production in our coal mines and will he say what is the meaning of having this provision in the Act since he declines to give it effect in regard to so deserving a body of workers as those engaged in the coal mines?  This provision is no use so far as these men are concerned and theirs is a case in which there should be no hesitation in giving effect to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear as to how the change suggested, in the Deputy's question would result in increased production of coal.  I think that it is highly undesirable that there should be different regulations for different classes of workers.  Castlecomer miners ordinarily work a shorter week than miners in other places.  That is a matter of local arrangement.  It is still possible for those miners to qualify for the benefits provided by the Holidays (Employees) Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesPPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister prepared to give this question further consideration?  If he does so, he will realise that some provision should be made to enable these workers to qualify for annual holidays.  The Minister is aware that, in this industry, the workers suffer severe hardships both in regard to the atmosphere in which they have to work and the conditions under which they have to work.  As indicated in the question, there are many other aspects of the industry which should be considered.  I ask the Minister if he is prepared to give further consideration to the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The plea that working conditions are unfavourable, and that special treatment is justifiable, has been made in respect of a large number of classes of workers.  I am, personally, of opinion that it is undesirable that statutory provisions, which are intended to provide for minimum conditions of employment, should vary as between one class of workers and another.  To avoid discontent, it is desirable that there should be uniform <Col N="1510" /> treatment of workers as far as legislation is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesPPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no body of workers in the country for whom there is more generous sympathy, particularly amongst the working-class population, than the miners.  Everybody extends sympathy to the men engaged in our coal mines and, in view of their special position, I should like to press upon the Minister to give further consideration to their case. The people of Kilkenny, particularly those in the coal-mining area, are satisfied that, if these workers were given the benefits of this section of the Act, it would mean an increase, to some extent, in the production of the Castlecomer coalfields.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem to which the Deputy refers is, I understand, peculiar to Castlecomer.  In the case of other mines, the ordinary working week is one of 48 hours.  In Castlecomer, because of historical reasons, the working week is one of less than 40 hours.  This problem is, therefore, peculiar to the Castlecomer miners. There is no statutory bar on the Castlecomer miners working the same number of hours as those employed in other coal mines.</P>

I should like to impress upon the Minister the desirability of enabling those men to qualify for holidays.</P>

      <P>A tabular statement containing the information requested in the first three parts of the question will be circulated with the Official Report.  As regards the remainder of the question the Government guarantee to local bodies against loss on turf production is quite explicit in its terms.  The Deputy has quoted it rather freely.  It covers all reasonable expense incurred by county councils in producing turf for use outside their areas, and in the case of urban bodies producing turf it ensures a market for any surplus turf of good quality offered for sale.  Every case must be examined in relation to the actual facts before it can be decided whether the conditions of the Government guarantee are wholly or partly applicable thereto. Most of the urban authorities (including town commissioners) had at the 31st March, 1944, cleared their debit balances by meeting them out of ordinary revenue.  At that date a small number of them had overdrafts on separate turf accounts but only in two instances were the overdrafts of any considerable extent.  The Corporations of Cork and Limerick undertook special schemes of turf production in which persons in receipt of unemployment assistance were employed. The statement does not include particulars of expenditure on such schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if representations have been made to him by the Dublin Corporation in respect of (1) the provision of a riverside walk by the River Tolka; (2) the cleaning and regarding of the river bed from Glasnevin Bridge to the Great Northern Railway bridge at East Wall Road; and if he is now in a position to state when sanction will be given for both schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Proposals for the provision of a riverside walk by the River Tolka have been received, and plans for the work have been approved.  Certain lands have to be acquired and the corporation propose to proceed under the Unemployment (Relief Works) Act, 1940.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The application of the corporation for a certificate under that Act related <Col N="1517" /> to four individual sites, three of which are situate on the north side of the river, and the fourth on the south side. In the case of the sites on the north side one is already the property of the corporation and a certificate is not necessary.  In regard to site No. 2, adjoining Drumcondra Road, the corporation's proposal was to improve the site by the planting of trees in agreement with the owner but not to acquire it.  In such a case the Act does not apply.  The remaining sites are suitable for certification and the corporation were asked on 25th ultimo to submit further details.</P>
    <P>The scheme for the cleaning and regrading of portion of the River Tolka bed was considered in conjunction with a proposal to construct fish passes at all weirs and obstructions on the river from The Mill dam at the D. W. Distillery to Finglas Bridge. Difficulties arose in connection with the provision of the fish passes due to the reluctance of the D. W. Distillery Company to agree to the corporation's proposals and these difficulties are still the subject of negotiation between the corporation and the Distillery Company. A recent proposal of the corporation to proceed with the cleaning of the river bed separately is at present being examined in my Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware of the dilapidated condition of many small farmers' houses throughout the country whose valuation exceeds £25, and whose occupiers are accordingly debarred from securing the free grant of £40; and if he will now consider raising the valuation bar to £40, so that those farmers whose valuations are between £25 and £40 will become eligible for the £40 grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no proposals under consideration at present for an extension of the law governing the allocation of grants for the reconstruction of farmers' dwellings.  The information in my Department would not support the statement of the Deputy as regards the dilapidated condition of houses of farmers in occupation of holdings between £25 and £40 valuation. Eighty per cent. of the agricultural holdings are under £25 valuation and qualify for reconstruction grants under the present Acts.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health <Col N="1519" /> if he will state whether a proposal for the provision of an extension to Peamount Sanatorium with increased facilities for patients and nursing and medical staff, has been submitted to his Department; if he is aware that over 300 patients anxiously seeking sanatorium treatment are on Peamount Sanatorium waiting list; and if, in view of these circumstances, he will see that nothing less than bed accommodation for 300 additional patients will be sanctioned.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I informed the Deputy in reply to his question of the 18th April last, everything possible is being done to extend bed accommodation for persons suffering from tuberculosis.  Measures are being taken to provide additional bed accommodation by an extension of Crooksling Sanatorium, by the provision of temporary accommodation at Ballyowen, Lucan, and by an extension of Rialto Hospital.  All these works are being pressed forward.  They should result in the provision of 249 additional beds.</P>
      <P>I understand that there are over 100 persons from Dublin City and County amongst those on the waiting list of Peamount Sanatorium and the measures referred to when completed should result in a considerable lessening of the Peamount waiting list.  It is also understood that there are 55 persons on the Peamount waiting list who are likely to be provided with accommodation in their own counties as a result of action which is being taken by the local authorities concerned.</P>
      <P>Sanction has already been given to the provision of 100 extra beds in Peamount, while there is at present in progress the erection of a garden pavilion and a rearrangement of the accommodation in the institution, which should result in 31 further beds being provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The latter part of the reply is the only part dealing with my question, where the Parliamentary <Col N="1520" /> Secretary admits that his Department is providing 100 beds in Peamount against an application for beds for 300 patients.  If that is the position, why prevent the Peamount Sanatorium providing accommodation for 300 people on the waiting list?  What are these people to do?  They may be dead before the Department is ready to deal with the problem if it is proposed to provide only 100 beds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">

    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say how many have been applied for? Since coming into the House I heard that they applied for 200 beds&mdash;not 300 &mdash;but the Parliamentary Secretary is only going to give them 100 beds.</P>

      <P>The Corporation of Dublin as sanitary authority is the body responsible for dealing with outbreaks of fever.  The information which my Department has obtained from the corporation indicates that 25 persons were diagnosed as suffering from paratyphoid fever following examination at the public health department of the corporation where they attended, and that they were subsequently admitted to hospital.  In the case of nine persons who were under the care of their family doctors, they were admitted to the hospital on the recommendation of their medical attendants.  The Deputy should be aware that there is no power conferred on the Minister which would empower him to recommend payments out of the funds of the local authority.

      <P>Under the Dublin Corporation, there is an officer who has addressed all the owners of the various premises in each of the city blocks and who has explained the whole matter to them personally.  So far as I know, the vast majority have agreed to and have carried out the requirements of the Order, that is, in the matter of the provision of fire appliances, of access to roofs and of the training of some members of their staffs in fire fighting.  The vast majority of the business people of Dublin realised not only the importance of this work as an emergency measure but its value in the future when the war is over.  In addition to the addresses given by the fire prevention officer in the city under the A.R.P. scheme, we had a very valuable address by the Dublin Fire Chief, who pointed out that the destruction caused by fires in Dublin was greatly reduced by the fire training given.  I think the Deputy is wrong in saying <Col N="1526" /> that there is any widespread objection to this Order.  The majority of the businessmen who realise that somebody has to pay for fires and that the more fires we have the higher the premiums, are not only satisfied to operate the Order as an emergency measure, but are hoping that some scheme under civil direction will be in operation when the war is over.</P>

It is very excellent, but what I want to bring to the Minister's notice is that in spite of the number of business people who consider that this is money well spent there are very many others in the City of Dublin who are paying the comparatively small amount they are asked to pay very grudgingly and that the unfortunate voluntary workers who have to go around to the various offices get a great deal of abuse.  If the matter could be ventilated to a greater extent, I think it would be to the benefit of all concerned.</P>

      <P>It is our opinion that the passing of this resolution will mean, to some extent, throwing good money after bad, and will probably further obscure the transport position in the country.  The Taoiseach indicated to-day, in reply to a question by the Lord Mayor of Dublin, that a special committee had been considering a number of plans for the economic development of the country in the post-war period.  I asked him whether that committee had considered transport by road or by rail as part of the plans, and he indicated that they had, to some extent at any rate, and that this Bill which the Minister has introduced to the House is a necessary foundation&mdash;I think that was the word he used&mdash;to their work.  It is because it is necessary to have a cheap and efficient transport system in the country as a foundation for the satisfactory development of production and distribution here that we are opposed to the passing of this resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nothing is more important at the present time than to see that every possible step will be taken to reduce the cost of living on the one hand, to see that the overheads which affected the prices which our people had to pay for the necessaries of life are reduced, and that those overheads which raised <Col N="1541" /> the prices of our products here and prevented them from adequately and effectively competing in other markets, will be reduced, too.  The proposals in this measure are such as will render it impossible to make any serious attempt to reduce the cost of living in the country, or to prepare our agricultural and other industries for effective competition in the markets we will have to find abroad.</P>
    <P>The tribunal which considered the general position of public transport in 1939 dealt with the railways, and dealt also with some of the other transport companies in the country.  In dealing with the Dublin United Tramway Company it stated on page 108 of its report that that company, whose capital was about £2,200,000 at the time, had proposals for paying back a certain substantial part of their capital inside ten years.  The report states in paragraph 254, that the company proposes over the next ten years&mdash;the report was written in 1939&mdash;&ldquo;to repay £1,100,000, which, after payments have been made for new omnibuses, will have the effect of reducing the capital and borrowings from their present figure of £2,210,933 to the £1,360,000 represented by the preference and ordinary stocks.&rdquo;  Commenting on that proposal, the report says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are of opinion that the company should not be empowered to charge such fares as may be necessary to earn a net revenue sufficiently large to enable this proposal to be carried out.  In our opinion it is unreasonable to expect that for the next ten years the community residing in the areas served by the company should be obliged to pay, not only for the current cost of provision of the services placed at its disposal by the company (which cost would include the amounts required for annual repairs and the liability for renewals when they fall due), but also to provide out of current revenue in such a short period so substantial a sum as £1,100,000, of which £682,100 is for the repayment of debentures which have formed part of the company's capital and borrowings for very considerable periods in the past <Col N="1542" /> varying from over 30 years to over 40 years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The tribunal found that the Dublin United Tramway Company at that particular time were proposing to take a substantial amount of capital and repay it, so that the people using their transport system in the city here not only would have to pay for the upkeep and maintenance of the transport system during that time, and pay for the cost of the money invested in the, tramway company, but would have to pay £1,100,000 more than the cost of running that service, and hand it back to the lenders through the tramway company inside ten years. The proposal which the Minister puts before us is infinitely worse than that.  He takes the transport system of the whole country, that is the railway and the roads and the Dublin United Transport Company, and he not only proposes to repay £1,100,000 of capital that is in the tramway company but £700,000 in addition, and he proposes to repay, between this and 1960, £8,048,556. There is a proposal that the new company, between this and 1960, will not only pay for its development, pay for its upkeep, and pay for carrying on the transport system of the country, but will also have to pay £9,875,556 as well. The company which is going to take that money out of the pockets of the transport users is a company which, as far as the railways are concerned, has been shown to be paying out moneys in dividends for a number of years past that it has not been earning.</P>
    <P>At the present time, instead of putting additional burdens of that kind on the users of road and railway transport, we should be stripping our whole machinery of everything that might put such a burden on them and that might raise travelling rates either for passengers or goods.  We should be trying to get out of the shocking position in which we are at present and increase production and make distribution easier, so as to provide a cheaper living for our own people. We will have to find and hold increased markets abroad for our additional production here, so that it may improve our economy, and in that <Col N="1543" /> effort we should be free of unnecessary transport charges.</P>
    <P>We are resolutely, opposed to these proposals because, in the first place, as well as simply carrying on the difficult business of transport, it is proposed to charge transport users in the next 15 years £10,000,000 more than that business ought to cost.  It is only gradually that we are getting information as to what these proposals mean. Before the tribunal which investigated the question of shares, evidence was given which showed that the proposals contained in this measure did not materialise as proposals until September, 1943.  The Minister himself, in his evidence before the tribunal, said that in the earlier stages the reorganisation contemplated was a company with a capital of £10,000,000, to acquire compulsorily the Great Southern Railways system.  That, apparently, was the proposal until about September, when it was changed.  Responsibility seems to be shirked for the proposals as they are at present.  It was indicated by several people, including the Minister, before the tribunal that the proposal for a £20,000,000 company came from the Civil Service and not from the railway company or the Minister. When the new proposal was referred to the Government in September, 1943, the attitude of the Government was&mdash; as indicated in the Minister's evidence &mdash;that the Government had no objection to the proposal.  That is to say, the original proposal was that £10,000,000 would be provided, apparently by the Government.  That £10,000,000 would have been sufficient to repay in full all the debenture stock and 65 per cent. of the preference and other stock.  At that particular time, the market value of those stocks was substantially below that figure.  The guaranteed preference stock was quoted in the market in June, 1939, at 30; the 4 per cent. preference stock at 13¼ and the ordinary stock at 9¼.  The £10,000,000 would have been sufficient to pay off the debentures and to pay 65 per cent. of the nominal value of the other shares.  That was changed and full value was to be given for the railway <Col N="1544" /> shares, while the Dublin United Tramway Company was to be taken over and other great developments were to be gone ahead with, of which we have no information of any kind.  Under the present proposals, the full capital of the Great Southern Railway is resurrected. Up to September, 1943, it was not the intention to do that but, under the present proposals, it is intended to do it.</P>
    <P>These proposals are likely to put an additional charge on the taxpayer and on the country generally.  When the original Tribunal of Inquiry of 1939 reported, it stated, on page 84:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In particular, it is of great importance that a clear and dispassionate appreciation of the factors affecting the success or failure of the Great Southern Railways Company under the new conditions should be available before any final conclusions are reached as to its future economic possibilities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce for the time being in 1941 was of the same opinion.  He thought very little of Deputy Davin for pressing to have the report I speak of published; but in his public statements here and elsewhere he said that no satisfactory proposals could be put forward until we got out of the present emergency. In spite of the fact that this tribunal, in a spirit of detachment, indicated in 1939 that, even without any of the disturbing factors that the emergency has brought about, it would take five years before any final conclusions could be reached as to the future possibilities of the railway company, we are now asked to give the full nominal value to the capital of the railway company and to hang that round the State here in future in such a manner that the greater part of it will have to be repaid in 1960.</P>
    <P>The only basis upon which the Minister rests the Bill is that he will provide a satisfactorily organised railway and road system.  We have got no information&mdash;good, bad or indifferent&mdash;that would lead us to believe that that is so.  The former Minister for Industry and Commerce, again in 1941, made it clear that&mdash;in his <Col N="1545" /> opinion, at any rate&mdash;the people responsible for the poor conditions of the railways were the directors of that time, the shareholders of that time and the staff of that time, and he repudiated the suggestion that anybody else was responsible.  It is practically to those people that the general ownership of the new transport company is to be handed over.  That makes it quite impossible for us to have any hope that there will be reasonable development or reasonable management. From the figures that have been provided, it is quite clear that, instead of a cheaper transport system being provided now to meet the urgent exigencies of the time, we are to be provided with a system on which enormous unnecessary expense will be undertaken, since something like £10,000,000 is to be taken from the transport users between now and 1960, over and above the actual cost of the transport system.  We are therefore opposed to the passing of this money resolution, as we believe that it is merely attempting to throw good money after bad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Money Resolution in which we are asked to give the Minister the necessary authority for the purpose of underwriting the expenses of this Bill when enacted into law.  I take this opportunity to protest against the manner in which the House is being asked to discuss this Bill.  We have a Bill described as &ldquo;Transport Bill No. 2&rdquo; and on the Committee Stage alone the Minister has submitted approximately 80 amendments, not one of which has been explained on the Second Stage, not one of which has been explained by the Minister in the House, and not one of which has been covered by the explanatory memorandum issued with the Bill in the first instance.  These 80 amendments are thrown to the House by the Minister and we are told to fit them into the Bill as best we can, no matter how technical they may be.  Then, when the House has spent sufficient time in doing that, we are to look at the Bill, and that is the type of Bill we are asked to accept in Committee.  I think that is an unfair way to treat the <Col N="1546" /> House.  There now seems to be no doubt that there was no urgency for this Bill when it was first introduced. All the elements of speed with which it was sought to enshroud the Bill at that stage have been dissipated completely by the leisurely way in which the Bill has been dealt with in the meantime.  It would have been much more satisfactory if the Minister had embodied his amendments in the Bill when it came up for Second Stage discussion in the House.  We would then, at least, be able to see the Minister's mind so far as the Bill is concerned. As it is, we have a Bill which the Minister said represented his mind and we have grafted on to that Bill 88 amendments of a highly technical kind and we do not know how many more amendments the Minister may introduce on the Report Stage in this House apart from whatever Ministerial amendments may emerge when the Bill comes up for discussion in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>I think it is a very clumsy way of dealing with this whole matter of transport.  I think it is a very unsatisfactory and very inefficient way of dealing with an important Transport Bill of this character.  These are methods which, in fact, resemble the methods of the railway company which we are endeavouring to remedy by the passage of this Bill.  Apart from my desire to enter a protest in regard to the manner in which this Bill is being served up to us and the spate of amendments which the Minister has thrown at the House&mdash;because virtually that is what he has done&mdash;I should like to ascertain from the Minister the present position in connection with the tribunal of three judges which was set up to inquire into allegations of improper transactions in railway shares. We are asked to pass a Money Resolution to finance the cost of implementing this Bill.  We ought to know to what extent we may be overdoing expenditure so far as providing compensation to persons who may be found guilty of improper transactions in railway shares is concerned.  It was stated in Press reports, some of which claim to be reasonably reliable, that the tribunal had completed its report and that the report was on its way to the Government.</P>

      <P>No.  The fact that the Chair is permitting me to carry on is the best evidence that I am thoroughly in order.  This motion is a Financial Resolution by which we are asked to underwrite the cost of this Bill and we cannot know what we really are being asked to underwrite until we have the report of these three eminent judges. They may come to the conclusion that many &ldquo;get-rich-quick merchants&rdquo; have been trafficking in railway shares and are going to be handsomely compensated under the provisions of this Bill.  If that is so, quite obviously there is a duty on the Legislature to take steps to ensure that these gentlemen will not enrich themselves any further.  I am merely asking, as a person of some responsibility, as a member of the Legislature, whether or not this report has been received by the Government; whether or not the House will have an opportunity of seeing the report before it passes this Bill; and whether or not the public generally will be made aware of the contents of the report so that the public may be in a position to express an opinion on the evidence tendered at the tribunal?  I do not know why the Minister should be annoyed every time anybody mentions these irregular dealings in railway shares.

The Minister knows how annoyed he got on previous occasions when we asked that the Second Reading of this Bill should be postponed pending the report.  There is no reason why the Minister should get so annoyed in the matter.  My simple query is, has the Minister received the report from the tribunal of three judges, and, if so, when will it be released so that the public and the House may be made aware of its contents?</P>

      <P>I strongly oppose the voting of money for this particular piece of legislation.  Having regard to the almost revolutionary changes in transport facilities throughout the world and having regard to the existing emergency, I do not think that this is a time when we, as a State, should embark on a vast expenditure of public money in the modernisation of the railway system.  It is quite conceivable that changed methods of transport may render railways obsolete so far as this country is concerned. Therefore, it is a dangerous thing to commit public money on such a large scale to such a proposal.  It is also highly dangerous for the State so to commit itself in regard to public transport as to become a menace to the small user of the road, to the independent lorry owner conveying his own goods or his neighbours' goods for hire.  When the State commits itself to such a huge expenditure it becomes the potential enemy of every small user of the road.  I believe our first consideration should be the safeguarding of the interests of the small property owner, whether he is a lorry-owner, a van-owner or a businessman delivering his goods, or a farmer using a lorry to bring his produce to the market.</P>

      <P>I might remind the Deputy that he has tabled <Col N="1549" /> an amendment for Committee Stage to that effect.  Furthermore, the House has agreed to the Second Reading of this Bill.

      <P>I have no intention of going deeply into these questions but, as we are called upon to vote public money for this Bill, it is necessary to make clear the reasons why we object to such money being provided.  It is necessary also, as Deputy Norton pointed out, to take into consideration the fact that the proposals for compensating existing stockowners in the railway company may be altogether too generous and may be proved unjustified by the findings of the tribunal.  For that reason, I think the House should be very slow to vote this money.  If there were any urgency about this Bill I think it would have been passed some months ago.  This House has been in existence for a number of months and if there were real urgency about the Bill the Minister would have seen to it that it was enacted.</P>

Apparently, the Minister has discovered that the Bill as originally introduced was altogether wrong and has had to mend his hand considerably. Whether the amendments are improvements or not is a matter for further consideration; but, certainly, the Minister has shown that the Bill, as originally introduced, was ill-considered and he has had to mend his hand.  Therefore, he has practically proved that there was no urgency about the matter and that there is justification for further delay and further careful investigation and consideration of the whole problem.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Sir, approved of by the House, but I submit that this is the proper time to ask the Minister to say what, in his opinion, is going to be the initial cost to the community of the financial provisions of this Bill.  I think it is true to assert, as Deputy Mulcahy has done, that it is going to add to the cost of transport to the community as a whole, and I wonder whether the Minister, in considering the financial provisions of this scheme, has adverted in any way to the cost of similar schemes elsewhere or the method of carrying out huge schemes of this kind elsewhere.  This Bill is supposed to be the last word on Government policy and, as somebody has suggested, is supposed to be the foundation of the post-war development plan which, we are led to believe, has been worked out in detail by the Cabinet.  Most of us are in complete ignorance as to what, generally, the post-war plan is, although it was asserted by the Taoiseach, when speaking in Ennis on a recent occasion, that they had a detailed scheme in connection with every aspect of planning for all kinds of schemes which, presumably, will be undertaken as soon as the war is over and, again presumably, as soon as materials can be procured to carry out these schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, on a previous occasion, in connection with a very big scheme&mdash; not as big, I think, as this scheme: I refer to the Shannon Electricity Development Scheme&mdash;when it was presented to this House, the Minister in charge of that Bill came before the House and gave particulars, in great detail, as to how the money, asked for on that occasion, was going to be spent.  Now, as soon as this Bill passes the House in its present form, not a member of the people's Parliament is to be allowed to come in here and ask one question concerning the administration of the measure, and I think I am entitled to ask now&mdash; especially if the majority of the <Col N="1551" /> members of the House are going to vote for the sections in the Bill and the amendments proposed by the Minister&mdash;how the money provided for in the Bill is going to be spent.  I think that the Minister will agree that it is not unfair for me to ask him whether it is proposed, under this Bill, to provide for the electrification of the main lines in this country and, if so, what proportion of the money will be set aside for that particular purpose. If you are going to have rural electrification, I think it is only right to presume that that will be associated in one form or another with the electrification of main lines and particularly with the suburban sections of these lines, after the Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>I quite agree with Deputy Norton that those members of the House who wish to take an active interest in making this Bill a better Bill are not being given a reasonable opportunity of carrying out their duties in that regard.  I asked the Minister before the recess&mdash;I think it was on that fateful night which led to the general election&mdash;to say whether the Bill meant a complete exposition of Government policy or, if he intended to amend it later on, would he take it back and relate it to the speech that he had made.  I now ask him whether he would be prepared to take it back and relate it to the speech he then made and to the speeches he made, later on, in the course of the general election campaign, because I think that a great deal of confusion, which is likely to take place in the consideration of all these amendments, could be avoided, if the Minister would agree to take back this Bill now and submit it later on with the principle of these amendments included in the Bill.  I do not think there would be any loss of dignity in doing so.  Then, each Deputy in the House would know the Minister's final views, if they are final, and could argue them out in this House in favour of their own point of view.  It seems to me that there is going to be a good deal of time wasted on these amendments.  I do not want to waste the time of the House on this Bill.  I appreciate the <Col N="1552" /> object of many of the amendments proposed by the Minister, and I appreciate the Minister's intention in bringing them in, but I think that at this stage they will only cause confusion. I have been a member of this House for a good many years, but I know of no occasion since the House was established when a Minister brought forward so many amendments to a Bill.  The usual procedure was to bring in Ministerial amendments on the Report Stage, but here we have a Bill with 117 sections&mdash;many of them dealing with matters of almost prehistoric interest, and concerned with another Parliament&mdash;and there are 88 Ministerial amendments and 10 schedules to the Bill.</P>

      <P>Well, Sir, I hope the Minister will excuse me for saying this&mdash;and I say it on my own behalf&mdash; that you would require some of the ablest lawyers in the land to explain some of these Ministerial amendments. My point is that it will take considerable time to deal with all these amendments and, therefore, I think it would be a saving of time if the Minister were to take back the Bill, give further consideration to his proposed amendments, and incorporate them in the Bill.  Then we could sit down and have a frank and friendly discussion on the Bill as it would be then presented to the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I should like the Minister to take advantage of this occasion&mdash;perhaps the only occasion of which we can take advantage, as representing the taxpayers here&mdash;to give us in detail, so far as he reasonably can, an account of the way in which the money now asked for in the Bill is going to be spent in the days to come.  In that way, we might be able to avoid the imposition of additional and, possibly, unnecessary taxation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The passing of this resolution implements the proposal to operate, with a State guarantee of something like £16,000,000, a national transport organisation that will be controlled, virtually, by the Minister, and put him in the position of a dictator. I hope that the House will not lightly pass a sum of that magnitude&mdash; a very substantial sum to a small country like ours&mdash;without being satisfied that that money will be spent in the national interests.  We have heard a great deal recently about planning, and about the necessity for vigorous post-war planning in connection with many branches of activity, both in the industrial and agricultural spheres. One thing that, I think, we should realise with regard to the post-war situation is that, if we are anxious to restore our position in the export market to what it was in the past, the provision of a cheap and efficient national transport scheme is vital.  I do not think that the Minister has satisfied the House that the organisation he proposes to set up here, and under which we are asked to vote this sum of money, will give us a cheap and efficient transport system for the type of community which, in the special circumstances of the rural life we have here, will be needed by our community.</P>
      <P>It has been pointed out by the Leader of the Opposition that there are very substantial commitments involved in this Bill that have to be repaid in a very short period.  The Minister may reply by saying that the company will have power to issue new debenture stock, to borrow money and that these repayments can be made by new borrowings.  So far as we are concerned, we have argued before, and we are still convinced, that the existing stock, the holdings of stockholders in the wasting assets of the old company, are certainly over-valued.  That will throw a very substantial burden on the new company and will inevitably result in costly transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the agricultural standpoint, I feel that we must have cheap and efficient transport because I believe that post-war competition in the export market in which we have sold our <Col N="1554" /> surplus products in the past will probably be keener than ever before.  The war inevitably has brought a newer technique in methods of production, more efficient methods in production and possibly more efficient methods in transport as well.  We must be alive to all these circumstances which are developing outside.  We must be pre pared to face up to that keener competition which is the result of these new developments.  The Minister has not attempted to satisfy the House on these points.  The paucity of information leaves the House in the position that Deputies cannot make up their minds definitely that the matter has been closely examined.  The Transport Tribunal which reported in 1939 recommended, whatever transport organisation may be necessary here for our post-war requirements, that there should be an experimental period, a period of trial.  They referred to the revolutionary ideas in world transport generally and suggested that we might at the end of a period of five years decide on fundamental changes in the type of transport that is necessary in this country.</P>
    <P>Taking all the circumstances into account, and the fact that we are asked to write down the stock of the Great Southern Railways Company, that the Minister assured the House some time ago that the assets were almost completely wasted, that the whole system&mdash;railway stations, rolling stock and everything else&mdash;required to be renewed and reorganised, I think the valuation of this old stock will mean a very severe burden on the new company.  That burden will inevitably be passed on to the taxpayer and to the people who want cheap and efficient transport in the country.  I think that will eventually react on production in the country.  That is what has made me personally critical of these proposals.  The Minister, at all events, has not satisfied me that we are going to get that cheap and efficient transport about which he spoke.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of the debate you, Sir, made the point that a number of matters referred to by <Col N="1555" /> various speakers were matters of principle which had already been accepted by the House on Second Reading.  I think it would be well, in view of our experience here in the debate on Second Reading, to qualify that ruling, if not technically, at least so far as actual truth is concerned, by saying that the Bill has been accepted by the silent portion of the House, but has been vociferously opposed by those who chose to express any opinion on it.  With the exception of one or two members of the Government Party who, judging by their remarks on Second Reading, had not even taken the trouble to read the Bill, seeing that they expressed violent disagreement with the proposals in the Bill or took an entirely new viewpoint that was not justified by the Bill at all, the Bill was opposed by almost every Deputy who took part in that debate. It is quite true that we are not at liberty to discuss again the principles which we have accepted, but there is one principle that we are still entitled to discuss when we are dealing with the question of money to implement the Bill.  We are entitled as public representatives to consider the utilisation of the money which we are now going to authorise.</P>
      <P>In this Bill we are presented with a very wide scheme of reorganisation so far as the management and control of public transport in this State is concerned, but there has been a complete lack of information from the Minister that would give us any visualisation as to how the moneys we are asked to underwrite will be expended.  Even though these moneys may be raised from private sources, in so far as we are giving legal authority and a legal monopoly to certain gentlemen to undertake public transport in this country, we are entitled to know the main lines of technical development which they foresee in regard to transport as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite true that in the course of the next five years there will possibly be revolutionary changes in the technical basis of transport but that would not fundamentally affect the general long-range view of those who <Col N="1556" /> have undertaken this reorganisation scheme nor relieve them of responsibility to set before this House some justification for the expenditure of the finances we are asked to underwrite. If we had no precedent to go on it might be said that we were expecting more than ordinary human beings were able to perform in asking that they should give us some perspective in regard to the technique of transport in this country, but only recently another department of public service in this country, also largely under the influence of the Minister, presented a very fine report, the report on rural electrification.  That report was so detailed that it even dealt with the steel bolts that were to be utilised in the overhead wires.  If the Electricity Supply Board could present us with that mass of information, not only of a technical character but in respect to the actual transmission services to the rural consumers and even dealing to a certain degree with the social effects on the areas they were going to serve, surely it is not unreasonable to ask that we should be given some enlightenment as to the lines of development in the minds of those charged with authority in regard to public transport when this Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>Speeches have been made by eminent persons associated with the railways within the past few years in which they gave very definite indications that they had already considered this matter, that they had certain viewpoints in regard to the re-equipment of the railways and of the possibility of acquiring certain new forms of technical means of transport. Undoubtedly, they would not have entered upon&mdash;and neither would the Minister nor his advisers&mdash;the consideration of this Bill and of the finances required for it without having given some consideration as to the kind of transport system they were envisaging for the development of this country following upon the passage of this Bill into law.  We have been given nothing at all to go upon, and yet we are being asked to pass this Money Resolution and to give this public commitment on behalf of the citizens. On that ground alone we are entitled <Col N="1557" /> to some information before we agree to it.</P>
    <P>There is another very important factor which has been surrounding the whole of this debate, a debate which should have been kept within the sphere of public transport but which unhappily had to be coloured by the discussions of matters on the stock exchange.  There has been that unhappy atmosphere of trying to disabuse our minds of extraneous factors and to concentrate purely on the principles of railway organisation.  That has been due to certain happenings outside this House.  This House was perturbed at these happenings.  A committee of inquiry was set up which has now been in session for a considerable period.  Whether that committee has reported or not I do not know.  Whether the committee has found it difficult to arrive at its findings we do not know.  We are not entitled to say that it has been unduly dilatory in the matter, but we are entitled to ask questions.  On repeated occasions in this House we have been assured both by the Minister and the Leader of the Government that an opportunity would be afforded to Deputies to review the financial commitments, and the basis of the transfer of ownership of the stocks in the dissolved companies into the new company in the light of any findings contained in the report of the committee. Now, we have met again in September, and still we have no information to go on.  It is quite possible that, when the Bill has become an Act and the transfer of ownership has taken place, when, possibly, we are already on the verge of being asked to face financial commitments already entered into, we will then have the report.  We may then be told that the Government do not see any ground on which to afford us an opportunity of reconsidering the whole matter.</P>
    <P>This is our last chance of expressing the viewpoint of the ordinary citizens outside the House who, regardless of the views of the Government or of those who sit on the Government Benches, have felt all along that there were reasons why we should pause and consider before we took definite action <Col N="1558" />&mdash;until such time as we knew exactly the grounds on which we were being asked to guarantee certain commitments out of the public Exchequer.  We have not yet got the report of the committee. Therefore, one has to utilise this opportunity of making a protest. I think it would be invidious on the part of those who have been making protests consistently in this House and outside of it and who accepted the responsibility of bringing the matter before the public at the general election, if they were to allow this occasion to pass without making one further protest.  For the two reasons I have mentioned, I think we are quite justified in suggesting that this is not a matter which should receive the confidence of the House.  We are being left completely in the dark as to the means or methods by which these large sums of money will be expended.  It is now almost seven months since the committee of inquiry was set up by this House.  We are still in the dark, and still left without any means of protecting those who sent us here against the possibility of inroads being made into their pockets by certain gentlemen outside this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been very fully debated.  Probably no Bill has come before the House since it was established that has been more fully debated than this one.  Not merely <Col N="1559" /> was there a protracted Second Reading discussion on it, but there was, following that Second Reading discussion and the Vote which ensued, a general election in which the Bill was almost the main issue of contention from public platforms.  It was reintroduced, and again debated on Second Reading in the House.  I suggest to the House that we have discussed the principles of the Bill sufficiently, and that those, no matter how they may vote in divisions on the Bill, who are interested in the measure must now recognise the fact that the principles of the Bill have been accepted by the House.  Our duty now is to go through it, clause by clause, and see if the machinery which the Bill proposes to establish to give effect to the principles of which the House has approved is the most efficient that can be devised for that purpose.</P>
      <P>I have circulated a number of amendments. A large proportion of these amendments propose to effect only drafting changes.  Some of them were inspired by the amendments submitted since the Second Reading by other Deputies.  A few of them represent additional provisions which I think it is desirable to make.  It is true that it is the usual practice for a Minister to introduce his amendments to a Bill on Report Stage.  The fact that I did not follow the usual procedure has been questioned by Deputy Davin.  Now, I did not follow the usual procedure.  I circulated the amendments before the Committee Stage at the express request of the Leader of the Labour Party.  Am I now to be pilloried for doing what I was asked to do?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.  On the contrary, I made it clear that there were other provisions which it appeared to me to be desirable to insert in the Bill and which are also provided for in the amendments I have circulated.  If Deputies resent my action in producing my amendments, which are designed to give more definite effect to their ideas, the ideas which are contained in the amendments circulated by them, I am prepared to withdraw these amendments. I thought Deputies would appreciate the trouble I went to in trying to facilitate them by indicating in advance the extent to which I was prepared to meet their views.</P>
      <P>In so far as I could follow the remarks of Deputy Mulcahy, they were mainly directed towards proving the contention that the obligation which it is proposed to place on the new transport organisation to redeem, before 1960, the whole of its substituted debenture stock is too onerous, and will involve an unduly high price for transport in the intervening period. That is a matter we can discuss on the relevant section of the Bill.  I think I can satisfy the House that it is not too onerous an obligation.  I hope, in any event, to satisfy the House that it is the safest provision to make.  It is quite clear, however, that if the company makes an attempt to discharge that obligation, whether it succeeds or not, there will be no question of the State guarantee of the debenture interest having to be called upon.  If the State guarantee of the debenture interest has to be called upon, then the company will not be able to make any provision for the redemption of the stock.  If, in fact, there is redemption of the stock, the company will be in a position to pay the debenture interest and the State guarantee will be purely nominal.  I do not wish to discuss the matter now. I think that discussion on it will arise more properly on the appropriate section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the Bill will involve administrative expenses, I can assure the House that they will be practically nil. Although some administrative expenses will result in connection with <Col N="1561" /> the setting up of the advisory committee, I thing they will be less than the administrative expenses that arose under the 1924 Act in connection with the operations of the Railway Tribunal which this Bill proposes to abolish. It is, I think, a fair assumption that there will be revolutionary changes in methods of transport as a result of recent developments, particularly developments occasioned by military necessity during the war.  I fundamentally disagree with the view expressed by Deputy Cogan&mdash;a very foolish view, in my opinion &mdash;that, because there are to be changes in methods of transport, we should postpone indefinitely the creation of the organisation which is going to investigate those changes in methods of transport and apply them to the circumstances of this country, if found suitable.  It is too late to commence to thatch your house when the storm has broken.  The right time to establish the organisation which is to handle our transport problems is now, before the operation of new methods of transport is practicable and before it is even possible to decide what new methods are suited to our circumstances. It would be unwise to attempt to decide now what new type of equipment or what new methods of operating transport services are suitable to our circumstances.  Even if it were the time to decide, neither this House nor the Government is the body which should be given the responsibility of making the decision.  We have not the technical competence to arrive at such a decision.  We are proposing to establish a company and to charge that company with the responsibility of providing efficient transport services for this country, using whatever methods are most suitable in the opinion of the technical experts in its service.  We are proposing that that company should be secured finance adequate to enable it to apply to this country whatever system appears to be best suited in its judgment to our circumstances. It may be some time yet before it will be possible to arrive at satisfactory conclusions as to whether new types of equipment and new methods of operation are practicable and desirable.  I do not think that <Col N="1562" /> that is a reason why we should delay the establishment of the organisation which is to have the responsibility of making that decision.  I should strongly resist any proposal that decisions of purely technical questions of that kind should be made by this House or a Government Department, which has not at its command the technical experience which would be required for the making of such decisions.</P>
    <P>I think that this Bill is urgent.  I thought that it was urgent months ago. I think that it is desirable that we should not lose any more time in getting rid of the deadwood which has hampered transport development in the past and that we should lose no time in creating a new organisation which will be not merely efficiently devised but competent to proceed without delay with the execution of whatever plans it considers most suitable. We have already lost valuable time and we have now to make that good by securing the enactment of this measure, with whatever amendments the Dáil may consider necessary, before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy made some reference to evidence given before the tribunal of inquiry into stock exchange transactions.  I do not want to accuse the Deputy of deliberate misrepresentation, but it is not true that it was stated at the tribunal that the proposals in his Bill were the product of civil servants and it is not true that it was stated that, when these proposals were brought to the Government, they evoked from the Government merely the decision that they had no objection.</P>

The decision of the Government was that it had no objection to the Board of the Great Southern Railways circularising its shareholders, making it clear that the circularising of the shareholders did not commit the Government.  The <Col N="1563" /> Deputy may have misread what appeared in the paper but, if he reads it again, I hope he will endeavour to correct any misapprehension his remarks may have caused.</P>

The extent to which new capital may be utilised in the future will be determined by conditions in the future.  The company may issue additional debenture stock, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, up to a limit of £6,500,000.  We do not decide that it will have to issue any particular sum&mdash;£1,000,000, £2,000,000 or £3,000,000.

The House has passed numerous measures, establishing companies, with similar provisions &mdash;laying down a maximum capital liability, which cannot be exceeded without fresh legislation&mdash;without contemplating that these companies would immediately avail of their full power in relation to the raising of additional capital.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In line 23, after the word &ldquo;Eireann&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;or in the English language, The National Transport Company&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to have the English translation of the Irish title of the company inserted in the Bill.  I have no very strong feelings in the matter, but if the company is to be called by its English name, it ought to be called by the correct English name, whatever it may be.  In the Constitution, we have called this country Ireland and Eire, the English and Irish versions being accepted.  In the case of the National Health Insurance Society, the Irish title only is used in the relevant legislation, with the result that persons using the English description of the society call it the unified society.  Of course, it is not the unified society at all.  It was originally colloquially described as the unified society, but the correct name <Col N="1567" /> is the National Health Insurance Society.</P>
    <P>If persons are likely to use the English title of the proposed Córas Iompar Eireann, it is desirable that they should use the correct English title, and the object of the amendment is to ensure that the English title will be correctly stated as the National Transport Company.  It is not a matter on which I have any feelings one way or the other.  If people call the organisation Córas Iompar Eireann and use only that title, no difficulty arises, but if persons resort to calling it by its English title, as people describe this country by its English title, they ought to have the correct English title to use.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not so much an issue of transport policy as of general Government policy, and the desirability of having the English version of this organisation was considered by the Government and the decision was against it.  I see no reason why a comparatively simple name like Córas Iompar Eireann should not come into common use just as the title of our air company, Aer Lingus, is in common use.  The illustration given by the Deputy is rather unfortunate.  I think the name of the National Health Insurance Society is a particularly difficult one to pronounce for people who are not Irish speakers.  I was concerned to secure that we would get for this company an Irish title which would be easy to pronounce, and particularly a title the correct pronunciation of which would not be difficult for persons who are familiar only with English sounds.  I could not agree to the proposal that we should insert the English title in the Bill, and I think that, in the course of time, the term Córas Iompair Eireann, or the initials of these three words, will come into common use to describe this transport organisation.</P>

      <P>Before line 34 to insert the following&mdash;</P>
      <P>the expression &ldquo;the Dublin Corporation&rdquo; means the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor, Aldermen and Burgesses of Dublin;</P>
      <P>the expression &ldquo;the establishment date&rdquo; means the 1st day of January, 1945;</P>
      <P>the expression &ldquo;functional area&rdquo; means&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  in relation to the council of a county, that county (excluding any borough or urban district therein),</P>
      <P>(b)  in relation to the corporation of a county or other borough, that county or other borough,</P>
      <P>(c)  in relation to the council of an urban district, that urban district;</P>

      <P>(b)  the corporation of a county or other borough, or</P>
      <P>(c)  the council of an urban district.</P>
      <P>This also is a drafting amendment.  As the Bill was originally framed, there was only one reference to the Dublin Corporation in it, and that body could be described in the section.  I am proposing certain amendments which will involve the mentioning more than once of the Dublin Corporation, and consequently it is desirable to have in the definition section a description of the Dublin Corporation and of its functional area.</P>

      <P>An offence under any section of this Act may be prosecuted by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I think it desirable that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should have power to prosecute for offences under the Act.  The giving of that power to the Minister in no way relieves the Gárda Síochána of the obligation to enforce the law, or aggrieved persons of the need for protecting their own interests.

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Every regulation made under this section shall be forthwith laid before each House of the Oireachtas and if either House shall within twenty-one days on which such House has sat next after the regulation is laid before it pass a resolution annulling the regulation the regulation shall be annulled accordingly but without prejudice to the validity <Col N="1570" /> of anything previously done thereunder.</P>
    <P>This amendment seeks to ensure that every regulation made under the regulations section of the Bill will be laid before the House, so that the House may have an opportunity of considering it, and, if it thinks fit, of annulling the regulation, without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done under it.  I assume that the Minister will not offer any objection to the acceptance of the amendment because it is a very well defined practice in our legislation to provide that regulations made by the Minister will be tabled in the House, so that the House may have an opportunity of expressing an opinion, if it so desires.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the Minister may make regulations under Section 25 which is an important section from the point of view of making available to the House information which the House may desire.  He may also make regulations under Sections 87, 89 and 92.  There is no serious impediment imposed on the Minister's efficient control of the proposed transport company by requiring him to lay these regulations on the Table of the House, so as to provide the Dáil with an opportunity of discussing them.  Even if the regulations are repealed or in any way amended, from the Minister's point of view, it does not invalidate anything previously done under them. This is a well-known practice in our legislation, where Ministers have power to make regulations.  I hope the Minister will see his way to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy misunderstands the nature of the regulations to which this refers.  The Deputy remarked that it is a well-known practice to have a provision of this kind.  I should say it is not the practice&mdash;that the practice is quite the reverse.  There are certain matters to be prescribed here and the regulations referred to in this section are regulations made in relation to any matter referred to in the Act as &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo;.  These relate to purely administrative matters, such as the form in which an application will be <Col N="1571" /> made and the particulars which must be furnished in any application.  These are purely administrative matters and the regulations are different entirely from the type of regulation which is sometimes necessary under legislation to give effect to a definite policy, or to avoid the inclusion in the Bill of a great number of detailed sections.  The various things that are to be prescribed in Sections 70, 71, 74, 80, 85, 87 and 92 concerns only form; for instance, a person may apply for an alteration of the railway charges, or charges connected with the carriage of merchandise, and certain particulars will have to be set out in his application.</P>
      <P>Section 25 is the only section where the power to make regulations may be of importance.  We can discuss that aspect when we come to deal with the section.  Under the existing law governing the presentation of accounts, statistics and returns by railway companies, the manner in which they are to be prepared is prescribed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  In fact, Section 25 makes no change in the existing law and it would be undesirable to establish as a precedent that administrative matters, such as the form and the making of applications, should be subject to regulations of the type envisaged.  It would be contrary to the practice not merely in transport legislation in the past, but to all legislation in the past.</P>

      <P>Section 25 is the most important of all the sections in respect of which the Minister has power to make regulations.  It is a very important section from the point of view of the House and of the community generally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an important point involved with regard to public responsibility for the railways in the future.  Under this Bill we will underwrite £16,000,000 of capital.  This company may never make a profit.  It is quite possible that it may lose money. From the point of view of the debenture stockholders it does not <Col N="1572" /> matter what the railways may lose, because this House will guarantee them the interest on their stock. If the public are to be put in the position of having to guarantee the stock, the highly appreciated stock of this company, I suggest it is not unreasonable that the public should get full information as to the accounts, statistics and returns which the company are required to produce to the Minister.  Under Section 25 it is provided that &ldquo;The accounts with respect to its railway undertaking to be rendered by the company under the Railway Companies (Accounts and Returns) Act, 1911, shall be compiled in such manner as may be prescribed by the Minister after consultation with the company.&rdquo;  This company is the Minister's baby.  This may be a very difficult and unprofitable baby so far as the public are concerned.  It may need considerable financial attention and we want to make sure that if the Minister is to require the company to produce accounts, statistics and returns, the company will produce them in a manner which will satisfy every reasonable public requirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider it is unreasonable for the Minister to resist the suggestion that whatever regulations he makes under Section 25 should be tabled in the House, so that the House and the public may have some assurance that the company will be required to produce the maximum amount of information for the knowledge of the House and the community generally.  If the Minister says he intends to do that, then merely tying himself down to table the regulations means little.  On the other hand, by being tied down to table the regulations the Minister gives the House and the community an assurance that he is willing to leave open to examination the question of whether he has or has not required the company to produce the maximum information possible.  I think the Minister will hardly contend that in a matter relating to the accounts, statistics and returns to be provided by the company, it is unfair to ask him to table whatever regulations he proposes to make.  If the regulations are all right from the point of view of any <Col N="1573" /> reasonable person, it will make no difference to the Minister; but if they are not, then I suggest there is a good case for asking the Minister to table them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with the sections dealing with railway rates and charges and the classification of merchandise, the Minister is empowered by order to do certain things. How are those orders to be made? Are they to be subject to any publicity? In Part IV there are certain matters which have an important bearing on the actual operation of the railways. It is the most important part of the Bill, because it throws into the hands of the Minister what used to be in the hands of some sort of judicial authority.  Whatever the Minister is to do there is to be done by Order.</P>
      <P>That part of the Bill brings in the Eighth Schedule, and there you have certain matters to be prescribed.  There is one at least which cannot be regarded as the formal type of matter to which the Minister refers, where the charge is to be made by weight, or measure, and the Minister is to prescribe the method by which these charges are to be calculated.  That might make a very definite change in the system of railway charges.  If that is to be done by regulation, which regulation is not to come before the House an important point is involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as my reading of Part IV goes, the Minister will not operate by regulation; in the main he will operate by something called an Order and that Order will take effect at once and will not be open to any criticism through publicity here, or any possibility of change.  In other words, the whole organisation of the railways hereafter is thrown on to a Government Department and is removed from the light of scrutiny by the Dáil.  That is the scheme the Minister has in mind. There are certain matters to be done by Order, and they are not caught by <Col N="1574" /> this phrase with regard to regulations. There is probably going to be no publicity with regard to it at all.  There will be publicity of course when the railway begins to operate the charges, but as to arrangements beforehand, or any negotiations about them, or the bringing to bear of public opinion upon them, all that is being discarded as far as this measure is concerned.</P>

      <P>As I explained to the House, in 90 cases out of 100 the matters which arose under the 1924 Act were settled between the Department of Industry and Commerce and the railway company without reference to the tribunal, because in practice the people found it far too expensive to go to the Railway Tribunal to get those changes made. There will be many such minor changes which, in fact, will not need to be submitted formally to the advisory committee.  It is to simplify and cheapen the procedure which was <Col N="1575" /> established in regard to those matters under the 1924 Act that the change is proposed, but that is an entirely different matter from what Deputy Norton was aiming at here.  Deputy Norton has dealt with the section which provides that, where the Minister may prescribe certain things, he shall do so by regulations.  The Deputy wants to bring the Dáil in, and give them power to annul the regulations.  They will not relate to any of the matters to which Deputy McGilligan was referring.  They will relate only to the form in which the application must be made.  They will relate to the information that must be given in support of the application&mdash; purely administrative matters which have no legislative importance.  As far as Section 25 is concerned, I have said here that the provision in this Bill is similar to that in the 1911 Act, under which the existing accounts of the railway company are made in the form prescribed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  There is no question of the Legislature having power to interfere with the form prescribed by the Minister.  The intention of this section is to secure that there will be ample information in a suitable form made available to the public through the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>I will resist this amendment because I think it is undesirable that we should bring the Dáil into those purely administrative arrangements.  There will be no question of principle involved, and there is certainly nothing which could lead to discussion here upon matters of policy.  In so far as policy arises, it may be properly stated that the matters to which Deputy McGilligan referred would be concerned, but in that particular case I am going to oppose on principle the initiation of debates in the Dáil upon decisions of that kind.  It is for the machinery set up under this Bill to determine whether a particular trader is to get a special rate, or whether conditions of carriage are to be altered in a particular instance, and I certainly would not contemplate that we should have Dáil debates on those matters after a decision is arrived at.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that I was proposing to delete sub-section (1) of Section 25, but in making that statement he did not advert at all to amendment No. 43.  I can only assume, therefore, that the Minister is very anxious to misrepresent my position in regard to the whole matter.  If the Minister looks at amendments Nos. 42 and 43, he will see what my purpose is.  First, there is an effort to get a debate on Section 25 by moving the deletion of sub-section (1).  If that is carried, something will have to go in instead, but the Minister will have to think in the meantime on the arguments advanced in the House.  If amendment No. 43 stands, which would put the Minister in the position that whatever information was to be compiled by the railway company would be prescribed by the Minister after consultation with the company and with the Transport Advisory Committee which is set up under the Bill. There an effort was made to bring in somebody, a third party, other than the Minister and other than the railway company, so as to ensure that at least somebody not as closely associated with the company as the Minister is, somebody not as closely associated with the Minister as the company is, would have some say in the type of accounts, statistics and terms to be provided by the railway company.</P>

      <P>The Minister put his finger on the point which this group had in mind in drafting this amendment. We did it with the knowledge that the majority of the members of this House decided, rightly or wrongly &mdash;in my opinion, wrongly&mdash;to pass over the whole of the administration of this organisation to a chairman-dictator, who would only have the obligation to consult with the Minister on certain matters from time to time.  If Deputies of this House in the future, after the establishment of this organisation, want to find out for themselves and for those whom they represent how this company is going on, they can only do so, unless they are financial experts, by studying the accounts which the Minister will oblige the new company to furnish to those who are entitled to receive them.

      <P>The Minister knows that the able accountants who will be available to tender advice to the board of the new company, whether the board is composed of one or seven, have a very happy knack of presenting accounts in a form which the ordinary layman cannot understand.  I would say that that applies very largely to the present form in which the accounts are presented.  I have a suspicion that there is a tendency right through the <Col N="1579" /> Bill to hand the whole show over to Civil Service administration.  Rules and regulations may be made, but those of us who have experience in this House know perfectly well that the regulations are red-tape regulations drafted by the heads of the Civil Service and signed by the Minister. We know that from the sad experience we have had, in spite of promises to the contrary.  We know how the Emergency Powers Act has been abused in that respect, and I do not want, at this stage in the history of this so-called democratic Parliament, to hand any more powers of that kind over to the heads of the Civil Service, and deprive the representatives of the people from getting accounts and returns rendered in a form which the ordinary layman can understand.</P>
      <P>We are prepared to withdraw the amendment, as Deputy Norton has indicated, if we can get an assurance from the Minister that he will even consult the Transport Advisory Committee before making those regulations. They would be acknowledged as being capable of speaking on behalf of the community as a whole, and of the different sections of the community. The Minister, of course, has taken care that he will not say what he is going to do in regard to that.  This is a much more serious matter than most people can see at the moment.  I want to ensure that, after this Parliament has decided to hand over such drastic powers to one man or seven men, the taxpayers who are incurring a prospective liability under the financial provisions of this Bill will get all the information they require from their accredited representatives in this House.</P>

    <P>This amendment is intended to rectify a mistake in drafting.  The Bill as drafted provides that the Companies Clauses Consolidation Act, except certain sections, will be incorporated with and form part of this Bill. Sections 39 and 91 were not excepted. Section 39 of the Companies Clauses Consolidation Act provides power for re-borrowing in respect of mortgages or bonds paid off, and would be inconsistent with Section 15 of the Bill. Section 91 of the Companies Clauses Consolidation Act deals with matters normally left wholly to general meetings of the company, such as the choice and removal of directors and auditors, and remuneration, for which specific provision is made in various sections of the Bill.  The omission of those two sections from the numbers of the sections excepted was an oversight in drafting.</P>

      <P>The changes in local government instituted by the County Management Act and the City Management Acts seem to have had their origin in the Poor Law Report of 1926, issued by the commission set up to deal with the question of the destitute and the sick.  It would appear as if the Minister of the day availed of that <Col N="1584" /> particular commission's report to introduce legislation of a kind which eventually resulted in taking away completely from local authorities the powers that they had.  The result of the Poor Law Commission of 1926 was merely to abolish the boards of health and incorporate them in the county councils.</P>
      <P>It was reasonable to assume, having regard to the fact that local government had been in operation at that time for over 40 years, that changes were necessary in its administration and it would be quite understandable if a commission were set up to investigate where defects lay, if indeed there were defects, if there were inefficiency, or if there were worse.  But, as I say, the Minister of the day deemed it necessary completely to remove from local authorities the powers that they had. I was anxious to discover from the reports of that particular time what precisely were the reasons that government his very strange action.  The only one I can get in connection with this report was his reference to what he described as &ldquo;complexity of function&rdquo;&mdash;an extraordinary phrase to warrant the serious changes that he then proposed to make.  He says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Generally under modern conditions the problems that the commuties of cities and urban areas have to solve, and the number of matters of a varied and intricate kind they have to attend to are of such a nature that it has been found to require in nearly all countries a radical change in the type of machinery in order to get the work done.  In putting forward these proposals, we are not influenced by any other considerations or by the experiences of any other country.  The proposals are radical to a certain extent, but are not revolutionary.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think we might add that they were radical, revolutionary, and certainly reactionary.  It is interesting to find that our present Minister for Finance, who was later Minister for Local Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; admirably expressed what would appear to be the opinion of, I think, a large section of this House of the measure as then introduced. This is what the present Minister for Finance said on that occasion:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We think this Bill is not in accordance with our ideas of the management of public affairs.  It does not give the amount of control to the people as represented in local councils that they ought to have.  It is not in accordance with our ideas of the freedom of choice that ought to be given to the people who are running our municipal or local affairs.  We think that the policy of distrust, evidence of which is in almost every section of the Bill, is not one that ought to commend itself to this House.  We are for giving the fullest possible freedom to the people, thereby inculcating the teachings of citizenship to the people.  We think anything that cribs or confines the authority of these local people unnecessarily will eventually do more harm than good.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think that presentation of the position is one that we would certainly heartily subscribe to to-day and I think the Minister at the time was a prophet in his own way because it is true that the system of local government is doing more harm than good and is heading for a state of affairs that will not be in the best interests of the people as a whole.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach also, in reference to the Bill as it was introduced at the time, referred to what he described as &ldquo;the grudging way it was proposed to give back to the people the right of governing themselves in local affairs.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was the opinion, apparently, of the members of the present Government at that particular stage so far as the introduction of the Bill was concerned but, I am glad to say that, having delved into the reports, I did not find the present Minister for Local Government making any contribution in favour of the change in administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1586" /> The Minister at the time&mdash;Deputy Mulcahy&mdash;gave as his reason for the change what he described as the &ldquo;complexity of function&rdquo;.  In other words, apparently, the problems that had arisen in this country were so intricate and insoluble as to demand a radical change&mdash;as he described it. But, obviously, local government presented no greater difficulties in this country in 1928 or 1930 than they did in, say, great corporations like the London County Council, the City Council of Glasgow or the very excellent City Council of Birmingham. Surely they had their own problems, and presumably they inquired into whatever defects there were over the years since their initiation, and possibly, very wisely, they adjusted themselves to the conditions as they found them.  But here, the Minister decided that he should make a clean sweep and remove all powers vested in local authorities and transfer them to what are now known as city managers and county managers.</P>
    <P>It may be presumed that, since the system has been in operation in Dublin since 1930 and is still continuing, that is a justification of the original introduction, but I want to disabuse the minds of the members of this House of the idea that what is taking place in Dublin is on all fours with what is, I understand, taking place through the provinces at the present time.  The present Minister for Finance had personal experience of the first City Manager in Dublin.  I think I can describe him as a personal friend of his.  The corporation and the Government of the day were certainly very fortunate, to say the least, in having a man of the type of Gerald Sherlock to take over these peculiar duties in 1930.  I understand he did not take them over with a very good grace. But Gerald Sherlock was a Dublin citizen who loved his Dublin and was determined, at all costs, even outside the very regulations that placed him in his position, the regulations of the Act of 1930, to concede, as far as lay within his power, at least a semblance of authority to the members of the corporation who came in to serve under him.  I said on a former occasion <Col N="1587" /> that one of the first things he said to me, personally, was: &ldquo;Unless I give the members something to do in this chamber they will not remain here, and that would be bad for this council and it would be bad for the city.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He set out, in quite unorthodox form, almost to circumvent, I think, the official regulations in ensuring the setting up of certain committees, such as the General Purposes Committee, the Housing Committee, and other such committees, with a view to attracting the members of the council and keeping them interested in their work, and I think it would be true to say&mdash; and I am sure that my colleagues in the corporation here will agree with me&mdash;that to a very great extent, in some matters at least, it would be very difficult perhaps to detect the very great divergence of operation as between the new and the old administration. That was certainly true in some particulars, but that was entirely due to the type of man who took over the manageship at that particular time.  He had one outstanding characteristic&mdash;and it must be said to his credit&mdash;and that was that he was prepared at all stages to stand over the members of the Dublin City Council in their administration of the affairs of the city, and to stand over them, particularly, in connection with the people in the Custom House.  He never allowed himself to be influenced merely by an ordinary document that came before him from the Custom House, and whether such a document came from the Minister or from any other official in the Custom House, he was at all stages prepared to join issue with the Minister or the Minister's officials on very many matters.</P>
    <P>When he was appointed in 1930, one of his first acts on the city council was to present a report, amounting to five or six pages, of what he had been doing in the preceding month, and he prefaced his remarks by saying: &ldquo;I feel it my duty to inform you of what I have been doing in the past month&rdquo;, and he proceeded to give the council an account of what had been in his mind, and gave them an opportunity of discussing it.  Now, contrast that <Col N="1588" /> with what has been happening in recent times in regard to reports to the Dublin Corporation, when we find that reports of that nature have gradually been dwindling away, getting less and less every other month, even on highly important matters, to the extent, finally, that this matter of making a report to the council has disappeared entirely.</P>
    <P>The result is that the Dublin Corporation now gets no report in any form as to the conduct of its proceedings in the previous 12 months; Mark you, the City Manager took that stand &mdash;and I must say, in fairness to him, that he took it because he felt that he had authority to do so under the Act of 1930, or at least he felt that the Act could be so interpreted&mdash;because he felt that he was entitled to do so; but now we have the anomaly that a subsidiary board of the Dublin Corporation, to wit, the Grangegorman Mental Hospital Committee, are entitled to have the Manager's report put before them.  It is true that it required an agitation to bring that state of affairs about, but still we have the extraordinary anomaly that a subsidiary board of the Dublin Corporation must be supplied with a report, whereas, in the premier corporation, we have none. I mention that as a sample of how matters concerned with local administration are being conducted.</P>
    <P>I have heard City Managers being described as dictators, and, perhaps, being removed from the sympathies of the ordinary members of the councils concerned, they may not be so closely in touch with the people.  I am not suggesting anything of the kind.  I admit that they have a very difficult task to perform, and that they find themselves in a very difficult position&mdash; almost an impossible position&mdash;because they find themselves, so to speak, between the hammer and the anvil.  If they want to give the members of the council a little of the powers that they think the members of the council should have, they may possibly find themselves up against the officials of the Department.  If, on the other hand, the City Manager stands up for the rules and regulations, he may find himself up against the law officers.  Under <Col N="1589" /> the Acts of 1930 and 1940, if the City Manager decides to act in certain ways, he may find himself up against the law officers, and I suggest that the whole situation is impossible, as it stands at the moment.  I am sorry to say that, as things are at the moment, the whole system of local administration is an absolute failure, and has gone completely adrift.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister will deny that there has been a lot of dissatisfaction in connection with the administration of these Acts throughout the country.  I do not think he will deny that these feelings of dissatisfaction culminated a few days ago at the meeting of the municipal councils, where certain sections of the 1930 Act were denounced.  It can be said that you can proceed to get more powers than you have now.  That is true.  We could proceed under that Act to take over housing, and so on, but I would point out that the members of the municipal councils feel such a sense of utter hopelessness about the whole position that it would be absolutely useless to try to improve it at all, in present circumstances. The scheme was fundamentally unsound, and it was felt that merely to tinker with it would bring about no improvement. That system has been kept alive because of the things I have referred to.  There is a semblance of fairness because we have put up with this system for 14 years, but may I say openly that we have only been able to do so because we have been able to circumvent certain regulations with regard to things which the Act of 1930 set out to prohibit.  The conditions in the country now, however, are different, and we are carrying through a policy of which we have long since got tired.</P>
    <P>Now, the Minister in this House, having regard to the excellent services which local government has rendered to this country, both under this Government and the previous Government, would deeply deplore, as I would, any lessening of the standard either of administration of local government or of representation, but, inevitably, that will take place.  You are bound to have members in any local body who will feel that their only duty is to say &ldquo;ditto&rdquo; to whatever the manager has <Col N="1590" /> to say, but obviously their influence would be nil in a council where the members of the council would feel it to be an honour and a glory to be a member of that council.  That cannot be so where the members of the council feel that they have no say in the administration of the council.  Only recently, it may be remembered, the business of a very important committee was held up because there was not a quorum, and they had to wait until one member came along to form a quorum.  Now, the committee concerned dealt with a very excellent institution so far as this City is concerned, and they did very important work, sympathetically and excellently, in the interests of the people concerned, and although it was a large board, nevertheless, in former days, there was always an excellent attendance at every meeting.  Now, however, the people who are members of that board feel that they have no influence or nothing to say, with the result that attendances are lessening and lessening until, quite recently, the business fell through because of the lack of a quorum.</P>
    <P>We have had an example here in Dublin of such a lack of interest. Take, for example, the occasion of the last local elections in 1942.  I will concede to the Minister that we injected into that campaign for the local elections, features that might very well be associated with a general election.  The local elections were held at a time when feeling was very high so far as emergency legislation, and so on, was concerned, and I am willing to admit that we were prepared to get the decision of the people on local matters as well as on other matters.  Notwithstanding the enthusiasm that was worked up on that occassion, only 37 per cent. of the people went to the poll.  I ask, if that was the response on an occasion when a maximum effort was made to bring the people to the polls, what will be the response on the next occasion when it will only be an ordinary humdrum affair?</P>
    <P>I have referred to the fact that in some cases county managers find their position practically impossible.  I understand that sometimes when managers throughout the country make certain representations to the Minister's <Col N="1591" /> Department, if their applications or recommendations are not exactly rejected, they are so scaled down as to suggest to the individual manager that he is no longer master in his own house.  While that is so, while the position on the one hand is that you have these managers described as dictators&mdash;and even dictators can afford to be magnanimous on occasion&mdash;on the other hand these managers find themselves helpless in trying to respond to the reasonable demands of local people.  Members of the Minister's Party in the corporation will bear me out in these statements.  They have, themselves, on more than one occasion, openly declared that the principle of local government was seriously impaired by this Act.  In fact, one prominent member of the Minister's Party said that the work of the Dublin Corporation, so far as the powers of members were concerned, could be discharged in two days&mdash;one, the day when the question of striking a rate had to be considered, and the other, a day perhaps of more interest to some members, when the election of Lord Mayor took place.</P>
    <P>That was how he described the present system and he is quite prepared to substantiate his arguments along those lines.  I think it deplorable that we should have our system of local government pared down in this particular way.  I cannot trace that the present Minister in any way contributed to the introduction of this particular form of local government.  I do not know that he was even in favour of it, but probably through a sense of loyalty he had to support it.  I think it is indisputable that there is a general wave of disaffection so far as the present system is concerned, and that there is an urgent desire that the Minister should avail of the opportunity presented by this motion to recast the whole framework of the local government code.</P>

      <P>I have listened with interest to the Lord Mayor who has <Col N="1592" /> undoubtedly made a good case as far as the city is concerned.  While admitting that some reform in the system which obtained some years ago was necessary, I think it will be agreed that when we changed over to the managerial system a complete revolution took place.  You completely took away all authority from the hands of local representatives.  As a matter of fact, as far as county councils and bodies of that description are concerned, I think it is the greatest waste of time to hold elections for these bodies because the people elected count for absolutely nothing so far as the decisions of these bodies are concerned.  The Lord Mayor has stated that two days would suffice to discharge the business of the corporation under the new arrangement, but I think one day is all that would be necessary in the case of county councils, that is, the day on which we are ordered to strike a rate, as we are ordered, by the county managers. There is just one other function that we are permitted to discharge, namely, the appointment of rate collectors.</P>
      <P>We in this Party consider that the present system is most unfair and undemocratic and it is necessary that something should be done to restore true representation for the people.  I do not suggest for a moment that we should go back to the system in operation in 1929 and 1930.  There is a good deal to be said against the system that then prevailed and I agree that it was necessary that something should have been done to reform it but the appointment of these county managers, sweeping away all authority from the people, was undoubtedly beyond the limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know it is a fact that county managers have been advised from time to time by the Minister to be lenient.  As a matter of fact, he told us occasionally that they will do what we ask them to do.  I think he has even gone that far, but I can tell the House that they just sit there and listen to us.  A manager says: &ldquo;You can talk away; I will just do what I like afterwards.&rdquo;  Does the Minister not realise that if such a system is continued in this country, in a short time you will have no such thing as <Col N="1593" /> local bodies at all?  Does he not fully realise that men of commonsense will not go forward for election to the county councils under such a system? When we take up the newspapers we read that such-and-such an order has been made&mdash;made by the county manager.  Generally, of course, county managers are strangers to the counties in which they operate; it is necessary that they should be strangers to a certain extent, but what do such managers know about local circumstances, for instance, in regard to labourers' cottages?  They are supposed to be guided by representations made by people who do know the circumstances, but very often a county manager acts as he thinks himself or as some hidden authority advises him, as regards the allocation of these cottages.  Personally, I do not believe that the Minister is a whole-hog supporter of this system, and I would ask him to consider this motion carefully and to remember that there is a halfway house between the old and the new systems.  We do not want the present system to be completely abolished, but we do want a system adopted under which people elected to local councils will at least have some say in local administration.  Of course, we hear a lot about the abolition of corrupt practices. Unfortunately in times gone by such practices were not unknown, but they were by no means general. There is no guarantee that it is not possible for such practices to continue under the present system or that they are not being continued.</P>

      <P>We hear a lot about efficiency, but if the Minister inquires into the matter he will find that big ratepayers in general do not believe that the managerial system has led to great efficiency. Speaking on behalf of this Party, I would ask the Minister seriously to consider this question.  Something must be done to bring about a change in the present position.  If the Minister does not reconsider it&mdash;I do not want to be a prophet but I can tell him that he will find that people who count for anything will not go forward <Col N="1594" /> for election to county councils because they do not believe it worth their while.  They are just merely a laughing stock, to be summoned to meetings as the county manager thinks fit and to carry out the orders he has made in regard to the raising of money.  As regards appointments and matters of that kind, we just read in the local newspapers that such appointments have been made.</P>
      <P>I do not want any Deputy to think that I am referring personally to any county manager.  As the Lord Mayor stated, county managers in general have my sympathy.  They are sincerely trying to carry on in a position which has been made impossible for them. I agree with the Lord Mayor that they are between the hammer and the anvil. They are in the position that they have to carry out this experiment.  I would ask the Minister to consider the matter seriously.  If he does so, I think he will find some way under which at least the voice of local authorities can be heard in local administration.  By giving certain powers to the county manager and certain powers in between to local representatives, he will find that local administration will be conducted much more smoothly and in a manner which will make matters easier for him as Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was impressed, as I am sure a number of other Deputies were, with the statement made by Deputy O'Sullivan.  His statement was free from exaggeration, and in it he put up a fair and moderate case. In doing so he complained that his motion was on the Order Paper for the best part of 12 months.  When I found that it was being taken to-day, my one regret was that it was not on the Order Paper for another 12 months because I think that the whole managerial system is one that is worth trying. At the moment it is only undergoing its trial and is in its infancy. Those of us who look back at it impartially can see the advantages of it. We can also see the drawbacks in it. I agree with Deputy O'Sullivan that under the scheme as it stands the impossible is being attempted.  I believe time will demonstrate that it is impossible to keep a representative council, with limited powers, with the excessive <Col N="1595" /> powers that the manager possesses.  The answer may be made to me that the councils are not too bad and that they are fairly representative at the moment.</P>
      <P>That would be a true answer, but, when it is convenient, we forget that all the weight and influence of five great political parties were thrown into the last local elections in order to get the best men into the field for the political fight and not for the sake of the councils. Every one of us inside our own parties knows that, at the approaching local elections, it will certainly be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to get a suitable type of candidate to go forward again.  The men already there say &ldquo;We might as well be at home looking after our farms or our business; there is nothing for us to do when we go to the meetings.&rdquo;  I believe those statements to be true.  Most of the county managers have attempted to do the impossible.  They have carried out their rather awkward duties in a really heroic manner.  Half their trouble is to try and find work for the council when it meets: to try and impress upon the members that they have, in fact, an important function to carry out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan referred to what has been done in the City of Dublin. I have seen the scheme in operation in certain areas, and I have seen it work well.  On the other hand, I have ample information that it works anything but well in other areas.  A scheme is not sound if the success of it depends entirely on an individual.  Although I say that, I say freely and frankly that it is too early to start remodelling.  I would like to see this question removed completely from the political atmosphere: to see every one of us leaning back for perhaps another 12 months, and then setting up a representative committee to endeavour to better the scheme that is already there and not to scrap it.  While I say that, I also want to say that in my opinion the present scheme is unworkable.  If part of it be the necessity for keeping a representative council linked on to a manager, then, five or six years have shown that is impossible, and that with their present functions you are not going to <Col N="1596" /> get the proper type of representative men.  If efficiency is the only thing that matters, I would be inclined to say that in nine cases out of ten you will get greater efficiency with one highly competent man than with nine or ten equally competent men functioning as a committee.  The individual can do things more rapidly.  He can take decisions without having to win over the others.  But if efficiency is the only thing that we are aiming at, then we should not be here.  We should not have a Parliament on top of elected representatives controlling an expenditure of £50,000,000 a year.  To say that it was impossible to get our counterparts in each of the various counties would be to say that they could not be relied on or trusted, that they were incompetent and corrupt.  If all that matters is to make the way clear for efficiency, and that the way to do that is to have one man, then that principle should apply on top just as much as in the middle.</P>
    <P>I believe that there is something good to be got out of the present scheme.  I do not believe that in its present rigid state it is going to be a success, but I believe there is something in it that will produce a local government system throughout the counties which will be satisfactory both from the point of view of the general public and of the ratepayers.  I think it would be a tragedy if at this early point in our freedom the local councils were to be in no way representative of the local people.  It would be a tragedy if the representatives of the local people were to turn around and say: &ldquo;Let one man do it,&rdquo; if there was to be no local interest and no local advice so far as the local councils are concerned.  If we are to avoid that situation a common mind must be brought to bear on the question of stimulating a desire to make the best out of what is there, even if that means a little bit of elasticity, of chopping here and of giving there.  I would rather approach the question in that spirit than by saying that the scheme is not satisfactory, and that it must be scrapped.  I do not think that the general masses of the people were satisfied with things as they were before <Col N="1597" /> the county managers came along. It is equally true to say that a very big volume of opinion is dissatisfied with the situation since then.  There is a future in this country for something in between what we have and what we have not.  Even though certain county managers may be making the thing more harmonious by trying to provide functions and duties for the councils, we have other managers, and let us not forget it, who exercise their full statutory authority, and leave little or nothing to the councils.  If I were a party to this motion I would certainly urge, in the interests of local government as a whole, that no precipitate action should be taken at the moment, but rather that the scheme should be regarded as being on trial, and that the Minister would give an undertaking that, at the end of a period of 12 months, there would be a review of the whole situation with the object of making the scheme more successful, and in the direction of getting more local interest in local government and making it more attractive to local representatives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are quite a large number on the Order Paper and I am hoping that the Minister will give the House the benefit of his profound knowledge in regard to some of them. The Labour Party have served a very useful purpose by putting this motion before the House.  I do not quite agree with Deputy O'Higgins that further time should be allowed to elapse before <Col N="1598" /> this county management system is thoroughly investigated.  I believe that the operation of those Acts&mdash;quite a number of Acts are involved&mdash;has created a very bad tendency, a tendency to drive the ordinary people away from all interest and activity in local matters.  In the course of 12 months, the people may be called upon again to elect local representatives Before such elections are held, it is desirable that reforms should be introduced into our system of local government. The present managerial system has proved bad inasmuch as it is undemocratic.  We claim to be, and are, a democratic people, living under a democratic Constitution but, if we are to deprive the people of the opportunity of taking part in local government, we may very soon destroy interest in governmental affairs completely. I do not hold the view, which Deputy O'Higgins seems to express, that this managerial system may be more efficient than the democratic system of local government.  Democracies can be as efficient as any dictatorship.  While locally elected representatives, when they come together, debate various points and may waste a certain amount of time now and again and occupy a considerable amount of time in coming to a decision, it is, nevertheless, true that the decisions arrived at by the people's local representatives are more effective and almost invariably command more cooperation from the people than any orders or regulations made by officials.</P>
      <P>The great danger of this managerial system is that it is extending still further the strangle-grip of bureaucracy upon the people.  We have a position at present in which the ordinary affairs of the people, in almost every aspect, are controlled almost entirely by a paid official.  The destitute who seek relief must go to the paid official, and to the paid official only, for succour.  The aged, when requiring assistance, must also depend upon the paid official.  In the management of the local services&mdash;roads, hospitals and everything else&mdash;the influence of the local representatives is being eliminated and we are reaching a stage in which the official will be in absolute control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1599" /> We heard during the passing of the County Management Act, and from people defending it since, that there was a considerable amount of corruption under the old system of local representation, but have we any effective safeguard against similar corruption amongst paid officials of the local authorities?  Is not the struggling young official, who is hard put to make ends meet, just as liable to be influenced by bribery or some other inducement as the poor struggling county councillor?  If an official of the local authority has to decide between two persons who are applicants for a labourer's cottage, is there not the same danger in regard to corruption as there is in regard to the locally elected representative?  I think that there is a far greater danger, because the locally elected representative is a politician open to the criticism, opposition, and vigilance of political opponents.  The official is, to a large extent, immune from that criticism.  Even in the short time that this Managerial Act has been in operation, there is ample evidence in many counties that it has not produced efficiency.</P>
    <P>Complaints were made against local authorities before the County Management Act was passed, for neglecting to repair cottages, to maintain roads in certain places, or to provide efficient water supplies.  But I think even greater complaints have been made since this Act was put into operation. I do not see any reason why the Minister should not now consider ways and means of improving local government, by amending the Act. Some useful advice in that direction is given in the report of the Vocational Organisation Commission.  In that report opportunities are provided for the establishment of elected local authorities more or less on vocational lines. That is an aspect of this question to which the Minister should give consideration. In spite of what the Minister may have said in this House about local authorities and elected county councils having considerable power, it has been clearly proved that they have no power.</P>
    <P>In County Roscommon, when the <Col N="1600" /> elected representatives sought to, restrict expenditure, which the manager thought desirable, the council was squelched and the manager was given power to carry on their work.  I have heard members of local authorities, who have given considerable time to the work, express the view, not only that they had no powers but that the ordinary people who elected them knew that that was the position. These veterans on local bodies feel that they have been put in a humiliating position, and they are seeking the earliest opportunity of retiring.  If that situation develops, and if the best type of representatives cease to interest themselves in local government, when the electors will have no direct representatives on local bodies, that will be a far-reaching step away from representative government and from efficient government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am under the impression that this motion is one of the most essential that could appear on the Order Paper.  Before I became a member of this House I was associated with practically every public body in Laoighis, but if local elections are to take place next year, as one county councillor I will not contest them, because I find that my time would be much more advantageously spent at home, rather than sitting at meetings at which the manager listens to what is said and then does what he desires. It is seldom that I am in disagreement with the views expressed by Deputy O'Higgins, but I cannot agree with him that this Act should be given a fair trial.  We have had experience of this Act for some time and I think the only thing to do is to call for its death and burial.  Deputy O'Higgins and the Parliamentary Secretary are not members of local authorities and cannot know the opposition there is to it.  The best thing to do is to scrap the Act. The motion requests the Government to introduce proposals to amend it.  I do not think it is going to ease the situation by trying to patch it.  The only thing to do is to scrap it, and to give back power to local representatives.  Deputy Donnellan and Deputy Coogan spoke about corruption.  We heard of cases <Col N="1601" /> of corruption being proved beyond yea or nay before the County Management Act was in operation.  A good many people seem to blame the Fianna Fáil for this Act, but quite recently I was informed that Cumann na nGaedheal was responsible; that the egg was laid by Cumann na nGaedheal and hatched by Fianna Fáil.  It was stated that Cumann na nGaedheal at one time had preparations made for the introduction of a similar Act, and that it was left to Fianna Fáil to pass this Act.</P>

      <P>I am of opinion that Fianna Fáil is not going to change the Act and that the Government is not going to change it.  That is a matter for the people.  If it was made an issue at local elections, and if people were asked if they wanted county councillors or county managers, their preference would be for county councillors.  I am quite satisfied that much depends on the type of manager appointed.  In many counties managers are prepared to co-operate with and to take advice from county councils, while in other counties the managers are pulling against the councils.  I hold that you cannot have good local administration where county councils are pulling one way and county managers another way. If I may refer to the county council of which I am a member, since last January we had meetings and passed resolutions, but I can safely say that not one of these resolutions was put into effect by the county manager.  If county councillors ask why this or that was not done they are politely told that it was an executive function and that it was not their business.  It seems to me to be silly to have county councillors and also county managers.  Why did the Government not do the honest thing when they went about it, and exclude councillors completely?  In order to take the &ldquo;hard look&rdquo; off the Act, and to shove it down the people's throats as being democratic, they decided to have councillors and also to have managers who would have the last word.</P>

    <P>I should like to be in agreement with this motion, but if it is put to a vote <Col N="1602" /> I say definitely that I would not support it, simply because it asks the Government to introduce proposals to amend the Act.  I would not like to be a party to a motion asking to have the Act Act amended.  I want to have the Act scrapped.  If every county councillor had the interests of his county at heart he would not go near the meetings. If the people want to have the County Management Act scrapped it is a matter for themselves.  Many councillors ignore the meetings because they consider they are only wasting their time, when the county manager takes no notice of their proposals. For instance the agenda of a certain mental hospital consisted of two items, the minutes of the last meeting and fixing a date for the next meeting. Imagine such an agenda being circulated, and no other business mentioned. Then very often a report appears in the local Press containing the county manager's orders.  A person who takes an interest in local affairs may ask what was the position with regard to certain matters, and he has to be told by a councillor that he did not know.  The county manager will have regulated the whole business without acquainting the council, and, without receiving recommendations from the council, will do as he thinks fit.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 8 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>My object in attempting to amend this section was to secure that the company to be formed would not be owned by persons who are common stockholders of the Great Southern Railways on the establishment date, or whatever other date is arranged.  The only satisfactory way, in my opinion, in which the transport situation could be dealt with here is the way which apparently the present managing director and the Minister thought up to about September, 1943, that is, that the company would be bought over, that the stockholders <Col N="1603" /> would be compensated in whatever was a reasonable manner for their interest in the company at the particular time and that some form of public organisation or machinery would take it over and run it either on the basis of the Electricity Supply Board or as a State business.  When we are asked, with the limited information at our disposal, to pass this section, the House is entitled to know what were the circumstances which caused the change of mind on the part of the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister considers that I misinterpret some of the statements published in the Press.  I submitted, when speaking on the Money Resolution, that, up to September, 1943, the Minister was of opinion that the Great Southern Railways shareholders should be bought out and that a company of £10,000,000 should be formed to buy them out; that it was a Civil Service idea that the company should be a £20,000,000 company and, instead of a buying out, there should be a conversion, which would leave the company in the possession of the present stockholders, and that the Government, when they considered the matter, would take no more responsibility in a positive way for it except to say that they had no objection to the proposal.</P>
      <P>First and foremost, I think it is up to the Minister to deny that what is implied here with regard to the original idea of a £10,000,000 company is correct.  If he does not deny it, it is certainly due to the House, considering the importance of the measure, that he should explain why he changed his mind.  In the report of the Minister's evidence before the tribunal into Great Southern Railways stock transactions in the <i>Independent</i> of 14th March, 1944, the Minister is reported as saying:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;At the earlier stages, the reorganisation contemplated was a company with a capital of £10,000,000 to acquire compulsorily the Great Southern Railways.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In his evidence, as reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of 22nd February, 1944, Mr. Reynolds was somewhat more explicit. He is reported as saying:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1604" />&ldquo;He suggested the adoption of a seven-year plan and the formation of a new statutory company with a capital of £10,000,000, this company to buy out the Great Southern Railways. He pointed out that during the period of reconstruction the new company would not be able to earn enough to pay interest on its stock and that the Government should be prepared to guarantee interest for a number of years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the outlook with regard to the £10,000,000 company.  In reply to the chairman of the tribunal, who said, by way of question: &ldquo;And that there should be a statutory company with a capital of £10,000,000?&rdquo; the Minister replied:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That was the tentative idea about the time.  He received the memorandum from ....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and then follows the name of an official who was the Assistance Secretary of the Department&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;....on September 6th, and the confidential file on September 8th. The change in the plan came about this time, and the new proposals were more favourable to the shareholders.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Secretary of the Department is somewhat more explicit with regard to the change.  In the <i>Irish Press</i> of 22nd February, 1944, the Secretary of the Department is reported as having stated that</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On 20th September, he had a protracted conversation with ....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>a named official</P>
    <P>&ldquo;....who proposed a conversion scheme as a basis of discussion.  As a result of this Mr. Reynolds handed over to....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>the named official</P>
    <P>&ldquo;....a draft letter and circular, the circular being a circular to shareholders containing an outline of the proposed proceedings.  After a discussion, the letter was revised and the circular and letter were given to....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>the named official.</P>
    <P>Again, the Minister is reported in <Col N="1605" /> the <i>Independent</i> of 14th March as having said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The file remained in his office from July 14th, until early in August, 1943, when it was given to the Assistant Secretary of the Department, after a consultation with the Secretary and himself, and the Assistant Secretary was instructed to arrange a meeting with Mr. Reynolds.  The Assistant Secretary added a minute in September suggesting a company with a capital of £20,000,000 in redeemable bonds. There were further consultations with the Secretary and the Assistant Secretary on September 7th and September 23rd in which the question of reorganisation was discussed, and he indicated his views, which were conveyed to Mr. Reynolds.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On October 8th, the Department brought to him a letter from Mr. Reynolds and a draft circular which Mr. Reynolds proposed to submit to shareholders.  The Secretary and the Assistant Secretary retained the confidential file as far as he could recollect, and finally Mr. Reynolds's draft circular and a draft memorandum to the Government were approved by him (the Minister) and he issued a certificate on October 12th to enable it to be brought before the Government.  It was considered at meetings of the Government on October 15 and 19, and the Government authorised him to say that they had no objection to the proposals.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...to the proposals&rdquo;&mdash;p-r-o-p-o-s-a-l-s. It is on these reports which have reached the public through the Press of evidence given before the tribunal that I say that our information, so far as it goes, is that until it was proposed from the Civil Service, in September, 1943, that there should be a £20,000,000 company which would convert the stock of the Great Southern Railways and apparently leave possession of the company in the holders of the ordinary stock, both the managing director of the railways and the Minister were apparently working with the conviction in their minds that the best thing to do was to buy out the Great Southern Railways and to buy it out for £10,000,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1606" /> I think we are entitled to ask here what were the considerations that brought about that particular change. Again, we are entitled, I think, to be entirely against this section when we go further into the matter and see what kind is the company to which possession of the present assets and all this new capital are to be given.  In the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Saturday, 22nd February, 1941, a letter appeared arising out of some discussions that had taken place here, initiated by Deputy Davin, on the non-publication of the tribunal report of 1939, and some comments made editorially by the <i>Irish Independent</i> on the previous day.  The then Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. MacEntee) discussed the attitude of the <i>Irish Independent</i>, which at that time considered that because of the misfortunes that had befallen the railways, some of which, in their opinion, were attributable to the Government, the Government should assist the railways. The then Minister for Industry and Commerce wrote this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;But the real gravamen in this matter is the attempt which is being made by your journal to push on to the shoulders of the tax-paying community in general what is mainly the responsibility of those immediately associated with the Great Southern Railways Company.  The problem in that regard is stated quite baldly in the following excerpt from the last report of the Great Southern Railways.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are then given the revenue receipts and expenditure, and certain other figures for 1940, winding up with:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The loss on working for the year 1940 was £44,761.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The then Minister for Industry and Commerce continued:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Those immediately responsible for this situation are not the Government, nor the tax-payers, but the directors, shareholders and staff of the railways.  These are the parties upon whom the primary and immediate responsibility rests for setting things right.  As I have no doubt your newspaper has a great <Col N="1607" /> deal of influence with them, why not advise them to get together and try to do that without delay?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>According to the Minister for Industry and Commerce for the time being in February, 1944, the people responsible for the condition in which the Great Southern Railways was were the directors, the shareholders and the staff of the company.  But their handiwork, reflected on in that particular way by the Minister, was not confined entirely to the losses in the year 1940.  The Minister said the loss on working was £44,761.  The report issued by the Tribunal of Inquiry into Public Transport in 1939 publishes a statement of the receipts and expenditure of the Great Southern Railways Company&mdash; the whole undertaking&mdash;for the years 1925 to 1938.  These figures have been analysed by the Council of the Cork Chamber of Commerce which, in a brochure just issued, has directed attention to the general position of the Great Southern Railways Company in the past, and the present proposal.</P>
    <P>Based on the figures contained in the report, the brochure issued by the Cork Chamber of Commerce shows that between 1925 and 1931, inclusive, the net profits&mdash;that is, the net operating result of the Great Southern Railways Company&mdash;were £1,471,000 and that the dividends paid in these years totalled £3,013,000.  That means that the Great Southern Railways Company, between 1925 and 1931, had paid out in dividends £1,542,000 more than they had made by way of net profit.  When we take the years 1932 to 1939, inclusive, the situation is that the total amount of net profits made in any year during those eight years was £64,000&mdash;there was only one year in which there was a net profit, and that was in 1938&mdash;but at the same time during those years the net losses were £1,164,000.</P>
    <P>In the eight years from 1932 to 1939, inclusive, there were net losses as a result of the operation of the Great Southern Railways Company to the extent of £1,100,000, and yet in that period they paid out dividends to the extent of £582,000.  The people to whom we are asked to hand over the ownership <Col N="1608" /> of this new company, with all the vast accumulation of capital that is contemplated, and who are to have responsibility for all the machinery of the railway company which, according to that report, was completely broken down&mdash;the people who are to perform these miracles are the people who were capable of these financial results in the years 1935 to 1939.  They are the people who, from the point of view of carrying on the transport of the country, left the situation that was so fully described in the report and by the Minister in very many of his remarks when he was dealing with this matter on the two occasions upon which the Second Reading of this Bill was taken.  These are the people we are asked to set up here as the owners of the company, the people who will look after our transport in these very critical conditions.</P>
    <P>I do not see any reason why same people, even with a very elaborate amount of explanation, could venture the country's interests in these matters in such a way.  It was quite clear from the tribunal report that the five people who were set up to examine the railway situation and who reported in 1939&mdash;that is, Mr. Ingram, Mr. Beddy, Dr. Kennedy, Mr. O'Brien and Mr. Diarmuid O'Hegarty&mdash;accepted a certain situation in the conditions in which we were passing away from the bad effects of the economic war.  They took certain representations from the company's officials at that time that, with certain assistance, and being provided with capital, they could make certain useful reorganisations and changes, but they were careful to say that it would require very careful scrutiny.  They advised a national transport board of some kind to stand outside the operation of the company and urged that it would require careful scrutiny for a number of years to realise whether the people then in charge could make a success of it.  In view of the facts, and in view of the astonishing shifting of ground and shifting of mind on the part of the Minister and the suggestions that we get in the evidence before the Stocks Tribunal, we would want a lot more information from the Minister with regard to his attitude.  I doubt if anything <Col N="1609" /> that the Minister could say would be able to persuade reasonable people that this new company should be put into the hands of and be owned by the common stockholders of the Great Southern Railways.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what point Deputy Mulcahy is trying to make by these quotations from statements that were made in evidence before the Stocks Tribunal.  In the case of this Bill the members of the House have an advantage which they do not usually possess in so far as they have been given&mdash;because of purely accidental circumstances&mdash;an insight into the process by which conclusions as to transport policy were reached.  I am quite prepared to admit, if that is what Deputy Mulcahy wants, that on more than one occasion in the process of arriving at a decision as to the best transport policy for this country I changed my mind.  I think that is the point the Deputy is trying to make.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that the Minister changed his mind elaborately and substantially, and we have been given no reasons for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason why I changed my mind was that I thought of a better idea.  I do not know any better reason why a person should change his mind, and the man who does not change his mind under certain circumstances is a fool.  As long ago as 1938 it was obvious that new transport legislation could not be avoided.  I told the Dáil so in 1938, and in December of that year I proposed a motion here for the establishment of the Transport Tribunal, from the report of which Deputy Mulcahy has been quoting. That tribunal reported.  Everybody here has, I presume, read its report. I read it, and agreed with many of the observations, and disagreed with others.  I came to the conclusion then that its proposals for dealing with our situation were completely inadequate, and that the ameliorative treatment they were proposing would not effect the permanent cure that I <Col N="1610" /> considered was possible.  It was decided by the Government, when that report was received, that action would not be taken in the preparation of transport legislation during the war. The effects of the war upon the transport services of the company, the possible effects upon the finances of the company, were all so uncertain as to make it impossible, we thought, to consider at that stage the principles of legislation that we would be prepared to propose, apart from the fact that Ministers were preoccupied with far more urgent questions.</P>
      <P>When the Government decided to take control, in the manner in which it did, of the operations of the Great Southern Railways, and appointed the chairman of that company with certain powers, we had in mind one of the recommendations of the Transport Tribunal.  It is true that the decision to make that Order and appoint the chairman with those powers was prompted by the circumstances of the time, by the knowledge that the railway management had failed to cope with emergency problems, and that the Government could not escape its responsibility merely by blaming the railway management.  The action that was taken then was primarily dictated by emergency conditions, but we had in mind the fact that the tribunal had recommended that, for a period of years, there should be Government representatives on the board of the company, who could advise the Government concerning its internal difficulties, and who could from the inside acquire the knowledge that would enable them to make proposals for reorganisation which we knew would at some time have to be formulated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsequent to the appointment of Mr. Reynolds as chairman of the company, for the purpose of running the company during the emergency, and arising out of the various discussions which I had with him upon conditions as he found them in the company's organisation and as to the future possibilities of transport reorganisation, I came to the conclusion that it was undesirable to adhere to the original decision to postpone transport legislation until after the war; that, on the contrary, <Col N="1611" /> the national interests required that we should proceed to effect the change in organisation which we considered desirable during the war, so that the end of the war would see in existence the new organisation that we considered to be necessary.  That change in policy was dictated by the acquisition of fresh knowledge as to the circumstances of the Great Southern Railways, and fresh ideas as to the potentialities of transport reorganisation.</P>
    <P>At that stage we sat down to consider what form reorganisation should take.  I made certain tentative decisions. They were expressed in a Minute which appears on a departmental file.  Those decisions were submitted for the observations of my advisers.  They were discussed with the Chairman of the Great Southern Railways, and arising out of all those discussions certain criticisms of portion of those decisions and certain suggestions for their improvement emerged.  During the whole of the six months' incubation period my original ideas were being developed, and, finally, a stage was reached at which I was able to make up my mind that I had devised the best possible plan, the plan that I was prepared to recommend to the Government&mdash;not to the Dáil, because the decision rested with the Government in the first instance.  In so far as those plans involved capital reorganisation of the Great Southern Railways I was of the opinion&mdash;an opinion born of the experience of 1933&mdash;that it was wiser, if possible, to effect that reorganisation with the consent of the shareholders of the company rather than by the methods which we adopted previously.</P>
    <P>It was in that connection that the question of the issue of a circular to the shareholders by the board of the Great Southern Railways first arose. The question which came to the Government in the first instance was whether they had any objection to the issue of that circular by the company, in so far as the issue of the circular pledged the Government to consider the proposals contained in it.  The Government's decision, which Deputy Mulcahy quoted, that they had no <Col N="1612" /> objection to the proposal related solely to the proposal to issue a circular to the shareholders of the Great Southern Railways, and did not commit the Government to the matters contained in the circular and certainly did not commit them to the whole scheme of organisation contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>At a subsequent stage, in accordance with normal Cabinet procedure, these proposals for legislation came to the Government and were fully considered. They were amended by the Government in certain important respects, and then the drafting of the Bill commenced. The Deputy knows that, because, as I have said, he has information concerning the processes by which conclusions are arrived at in the case of this Bill that he does not ordinarily possess.  If his point is to establish that these proposals emerged finally in a different form to that in which they started, I am prepared to concede it. If he wants to make the point that my original ideas were substantially modified as a result of conversations with departmental officers or the Chairman of the Great Southern Railways, I am prepared to concede that.  The proposals ultimately submitted to the Government represented my idea as to the best lines on which we should proceed, and that idea had been modified as a result of the discussions with the Government, so that the Bill which appeared would represent the considered proposals of the Government, and not of any individual Minister, for dealing with the transport problem in this country.  The Government passed to nobody responsibility for any section; the Government takes full responsibility for every section of the Bill.  It represents something which it has considered and decided in favour of.</P>
    <P>I have told the Dáil before that I intended to make no defence of the management of the Great Southern Railways in the past.  I do not know what figure the Deputy was quoting, or of what allowances he was making in arriving at his conclusions.  The Great Southern Railways, so far as I know, have never failed to earn their debenture interest.  It has never been the case that the revenue did not exceed <Col N="1613" /> the expenditure by more than enough to defray the debenture interest. It is quite true that for many years after the amalgamation of 1924, and in fact up to 1931, the payment of the dividend on the junior stocks was made possible only by the appropriation for that purpose of reserve funds, the principal of which was the fund created by the payment made to the railways by the British Government in respect of the period in the last war, when the British Government ran the railways here.  When the railways were handed back to their owners, they were handed back with a payment in respect of the claims of the companies for the period of control, and that fund was used over a number of years to pay dividends on the junior stocks. That explains why it is that the amount paid out in dividends exceeded the amount which the company earned in that period.  That fund dried up in, I think, 1931, and while there were some other reserve funds which were occasionally appropriated to dividend purposes, in fact the position has been that for a large number of years past there were no moneys available to pay dividends upon the ordinary stocks at all.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked me why we are adopting this proposal of having the directors elected by the ordinary stockholders.  It seems to me that the only difference between what is in his mind and the proposal in the Bill is that under one system we would have the directors nominated by the Government and under this system they would be elected by the stockholders. I am in favour of election by the stockholders. I think that in relation to this company it is the better system, and I speak out of the fullness of my experience over 12 years in the management of State companies of one kind and another involving, as it does, the nomination of persons to be directors of companies.  I think, in the long run, it is much more likely to produce an effective system if you can provide some other electoral machinery than a Minister of State in order to procure the directors of companies carrying on commercial enterprises.  I think we have to take powers to ensure that the company is operated in accordance <Col N="1614" /> with Government policy, that in no way does its day-to-day management conflict with what we consider the best interests of the country; but nevertheless I think it is possible to do that without at the same time taking on the obligation of appointing the directors.</P>
    <P>There are defects which that system has, and I pointed out those defects in the course of the Second Reading debate.  The directors who are appointed by the Government to the boards of companies operating commercial concerns have themselves no personal interest in the financial success of the enterprise.  They are dependent for appointment and reappointment on the good will of the Minister.  No matter who may be chosen for these posts, they cannot but fail to be influenced by those two considerations. I think it is much better to have a board of people who have got responsibility for the financial success of the enterprise.  These shareholders' directors will be responsible to those who elected them, namely, the shareholders, for the financial outcome of the company's operations.  If the company is not a financial success, there cannot be a dividend to the shareholders and, therefore, they have that responsibility clearly before them. They will not be in any sense beholden to the Government for their appointment or reappointment.  They can, therefore, in relation to the Government, adopt an attitude of independence, which might not be possible in other circumstances.  I think this is a better system than one which involves the appointment of directors by the Government.  I am not, therefore, apologising for the system; I am advocating it and I think it is better for the carrying on of an enterprise of this kind.  I would definitely resist any amendment proposed here which would involve that, instead of having these directors elected by the stockholders, they should be appointed by the Government or by any member of the Government.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister say how the directors of the company who are elected by the shareholders can be held responsible for the financial <Col N="1615" /> success of the company by the shareholders, if the chairman has the dictatorial powers that the Minister proposes to give him in the Bill?</P>

      <P>The Minister has a scheme under which no meeting is a meeting unless the chairman is present; the chairman can call a meeting without anybody else; and lest, between these two claws of the pincer, he has not covered every point, no decision is binding on the company unless the chairman approves of it.  In <Col N="1616" /> these circumstances, it is rather hard to see how the shareholders can feel that it is their representatives who will make or mar the financial success of the company.</P>
      <P>There are other things tending towards the financial success of the company that are appropriate to this point.  The Minister is proposing under this section that the substituted shareholders&mdash;that is, the debenture shareholders or common stock shareholders &mdash;will be paid certain sums of money, and he is going to have that ranking as being worth a certain amount. That is being done in connection with a certain concern whose capital he himself has said must be regarded as a dead loss.  He has said that the assets of the railway system were, if not obsolete, at least obsolescent, and would have to be completely renewed before the system could be made any good. Yet this company, where the Minister made a drastic cutting in what he called the dead capital some years ago, this company which has left what are usually called some physical assets, which are described by the Minister as either completely dead and wasted or on the high road to becoming so is now to have these wasted assets taken over by the new company, which will have to make three times the revenue of the old company in order to find it possible to make it a success.</P>

    <P>The impression left on the public by the evidence before the Stocks Inquiry was that the first thought of any reorganisation was of a £10,000,000 scheme, and the background of that £10,000,000 scheme was that somewhere or other the Government would find that money and would replace the existing shareholders.  Then suddenly a new scheme boils up, a £20,000,000 scheme; but what value is to be given to the countrywide transport is yet to be determined.  There is to be adequate transport of an exhaustive type, at a cheap rate, and yet operated on wasted physical assets, the purchase price for which is being paid as if the assets were good.  Under those circumstances, we have to consider this from the angle of the shareholders and their representatives first of all, and also from the angle of the country. <Col N="1617" /> The country needs cheap, efficient transport services&mdash;which it certainly never had.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that there was not a year in which the company failed to make enough money to pay the debenture interest, that is to say, it you take merely what are called the receipts and deduct from them what are called the working expenses.  From the working expenses, however, there is omitted anything real in the nature of repairs and renewals or depreciation. The tribunal which sat at the start of this war reported, through one of its members, that if any proper provision had been made for depreciation or proper renewals, the company would have found it impossible to pay the debenture interest in one year.  I think he says it is doubtful if it would have found it possible to pay it in one year.  Notwithstanding that background and the fact that, whatever burdens that company had, the Minister is certainly not decreasing them by this measure, and considering the fact that the Minister some years ago wrote down the capital of the railway by saying that whatever he was cutting out in the way of capital represented dead money because the assets that originally represented that were dead also, and now after a small number of years is again telling us that the physical property has wasted, notwithstanding all that, the Minister tells us we are going to have cheap and efficient transport.  The Minister adds insult to injury to the people who have to run this concern by saying the shareholders' directors, who cannot take a decision without the chairman being present but without whose presence the chairman can take any and every decision, are going to bear the responsibility of making this concern a financial success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me the Minister in replying to Deputy Mulcahy has missed what is probably the most important point.  That is, did the Minister change his mind or are the reorganisation proposals so far as the company is concerned the most efficient that can be evolved at the present time.  What is involved in the section <Col N="1618" /> now under discussion is who are to be the owners of the company.  That is the point about which I personally am still in the dark, although I have listened to the Minister on a number of occasions explaining his viewpoint and the Government's viewpoint.  A picture has been drawn, not only by Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy McGilligan, but by the Minister, of the gross and manifest inefficiency displayed in the administration of the railway company over a considerable period, of the gross selfishness displayed in the fact that moneys paid to the company for the specific purpose of helping it to overcome the wear and tear imposed upon it by the British Government were utilised to pay out dividends and interest to private owners, and that over a period it was manifestly impossible for it to pay its way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to that picture, if we are to have a new transport company with elaborate proposals to secure that the public interest will be represented on the board of directors in the person of the chairman, why is it that the basic ownership of the company must remain in the hands of those persons who have shown themselves incompetent as a collective body over a period of years?  The Minister, in explaining the functions of the directors to be elected by the shareholders and in defending his viewpoint in that matter, takes it for granted and <i>a priori</i> that the existence of shareholders is self-justified and that, therefore, because we have shareholders the directors they will elect to the board will be the most competent people to ensure the smooth financial running of the concern.  But if those common shareholders have shown themselves, as they have, incompetent to elect directors in the past how are they going to elect them in future or what guarantee have we?  Will there be individuals of different mentality and greater ability from whom to select in future?  Taking it for granted that these directors will be allowed to exercise certain functions by the chairman &mdash;and that is taking a lot for granted&mdash; even taking it for granted that they are able to do what the Minister envisages, namely, to give attention to the efficient and economic running of <Col N="1619" /> the system, in order to secure the payment of dividends on the common stock, in the interests of the common stockholders, if all that is possible within this framework of organisation and the constitution of the board in relation to the powers of the chairman, where are these men to be found among the common shareholders seeing that the shareholders have proved themselves incapable of finding such men in the past 15 or 20 years?  Why should we expect a change?  If this collective body that have been in essence the owners of this railway system have shown themselves incompetent over such a long period to manage their own affairs, even with continuous legislative assistance from different Governments, why do we expect this miraculous change now and, above all, why do we expect it seeing that we are going to place the shareholders' directors on a board where, so far as the Bill now stands, they will be completely helpless <i>vis-a-vis</i> the chairman?</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that if there is a conflict of views, if the shareholders' directors put forward certain proposals which in their view will make for economy and assist in earning dividends, and they are opposed by the chairman, the conflict can be resolved only by the chairman.  The alternative is a state of stalemate or the intervention of the Government. Therefore, where is the justification for all this elaborate structure except in one passing reference made by the Minister on the Second Reading, namely, that out of a deep sense of sympathy with these shareholders we should not take anything from them that has been left to them so far by legislation.  Our hearts are overflowing with concern for the poor common shareholders who, in 1933, had 90 per cent. of their property in this company wiped out and who have been patient over a long period and are now entitled to some return on their investments in this company and for the patience they have displayed.  That is a very nice sentiment.  That sentiment will be expressed first of all in the form of a guarantee in regard to debenture interest and, secondly, in the form of a guarantee to this collective <Col N="1620" /> body of a virtual monopoly of public transport&mdash;to the very people who by their incompetence have brought it to its present position.</P>
    <P>If the picture that has been drawn, not only by Deputies but by the Minister, is a correct picture of the position and if it is clear that this collective body has been incompetent, then we fall back on the final argument in favour of the present form of ownership, namely, a sense of sympathy and, as I think the Minister expressed it, of fair dealing for the common shareholders. I wonder why it is that that sense of sympathy and fair dealing seems to be exclusively confined to these particular shareholders.  One will not find the Government coming to the rescue of shareholders in any other private company.  Certainly in the replies to questions we received only to-day they do not seem to express consideration for other sections of the community who are finding it much harder to live than are railway shareholders.</P>
    <P>I suggest that if the structure of organisation the Minister has laid down is such as to give the possibility of a new lease of life to the transport system in this country, that system of organisation could operate on the basis of having the ownership constituted in the State or the citizens of this country rather than in this collective body that have lost all claim to a continuance of their ownership of this particular transport monopoly.  The only argument the Minister has made against that is that it involves subsidies. We have argued that point already on Second Reading and there is little purpose in pursuing it, because I think it is quite clear that the Minister has failed to convince anybody that there is any essential difference between his form of subsidy and the form of subsidy he envisages under a national form of ownership.  So far as the independence of the directors that would constitute such a board is concerned, and the scheme he has outlined in trying to secure their independence, surely his own argument against directors being appointed by Ministers of the Government is a complete argument against every form of Government <Col N="1621" /> direction and interference in ordinary commercial and industrial life.  It is even an argument against the matter that was being debated here a little while ago, namely, the appointment of county managers by the Minister.  If you cannot get men with sufficient independence and competency to run a borough and a unit of population of the size of the City and County of Dublin because, presumably, they are going to be appointed by a Minister, then naturally you will have the same difficulty on a railway board of management.  But, if the Government does find it possible to appoint men to very responsible positions in the State, not only in industry and commerce but in local and national government, and are able to place those men in such a position that they do exercise independence of view, there is no reason and no argument against the same thing being carried out in a railway undertaking.  Certainly, if the only argument for continuing ownership in this collective body of the elected directors of the common shareholders is to secure the independence of these persons from the intrusion of the Minister, then I personally feel that it would be better to have them dependent on that Minister so long as the Minister was carrying out a policy that we were clearly satisfied was in the interest of the citizens of this State as a whole, and not as I feel it is at the moment, in the interests mainly of this collective body of shareholders and the holders of debenture stock in the present company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only to say this arising out of the remarks that have been made, that it is quite true that the Government stressed the fact that the shareholders of the Great Southern Railways Company should get a fair deal, and we are concerned to see that they do get a fair deal.  Whatever Deputy Larkin may think about these shareholders as a class, I think we should be particularly careful to see that we should not be unfair to them, any more than to any other class of persons.  I am sure he will agree that we should be particularly careful not <Col N="1622" /> to be unfair to any particular class of people, but in the consideration of legislation of this kind, it has to be remembered that we must have reference to the legislation which preceded it.  We must recognise that these shareholders represent very substantial sums of money which were put into the development of the railways, a large amount of which money has been lost. Not all, however, has been lost, and in fact there are grounds for contending that the transport system, as now organised, is capable of earning a revenue sufficient to remunerate the capital liabilities attaching to that system.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan referred to that organisation as being obsolescent, and said, in effect, that the capital represented by these shareholders is being wasted.  He misrepresented the terms of the Bill as involving a proposal to pay these shareholders on a basis of the nominal value of their assets, even though we recognised that they were obsolescent.  That is not so.  We are not proposing to pay them anything. In so far as the shareholders of the Great Southern Railways Company have shares, we are proposing to give them, in proportion to the value of these shares, other shares. That is all. For every £100 of such shares they are getting £100 nominal value of new scrip, on which dividends cannot be paid unless the company earns more money in the future than it has earned in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have defended the system of transport organisation that we have proposed here.  We have proposed here, I think, a system preferable to the compromise system suggested by Deputy Mulcahy.  We did not establish this system previously, mainly because the opportunity for doing so previously did not exist.  I have already said that experience has shown that in connection with other companies established under statute, the directors of which were nominated by the Government, or by members of the Government because of statutory obligations, or because the majority of the shares were owned by the Minister for Finance, the appointment of directors has raised problems. <Col N="1623" /> In the case of transport, there is an opportunity because of existing circumstances of adopting a different system. I will admit that the directors of this transport organisation in the past did not avail of the opportunities that were available to them, and it is necessary, therefore, to superimpose on them a chairman to represent the public mind in regard to this matter of transport.  That is what is being set up here&mdash;a board of independent directors, set up by the shareholders, but subject to the overriding authority of the Government, exercised through a chairman who can be removed by the Government if he should cease to represent Government policy.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister might keep quiet for a moment, and let us try to tell the public how they are being &ldquo;spoofed&rdquo; under this Bill. He started off by saying that it is quite resonable to write down the assets from £100 of stock to £10, and to write down other stocks as well. Taking the stock exchange values on the 31st March last, the purchase price was approximately £10,600,000, or, if you take the average value on the stock exchange of these two companies, for the ten years from 1933 to 1943, you will find that the value of the shares of the company was approximately £8,100,000.</P>

      <P>Now we have the situation that the capital under this scheme will amount to £13,100,000.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the nominal value in the case of the £13,100,000 becomes the actual value so far as the redeemable debenture stock is concerned, to the extent of £9,800,000, on which interest is guaranteed at the rate of 3 per cent. per annum, whether the company makes a profit or not. Deputy McGilligan has pointed out that the members of the Transport Tribunal in their report presented in 1939 set about examining the assets of the company, and if you take note of the fact that the company made no provision for depreciation, made no adequate provision for repairs and renewals, and permitted instead the company's assets to depreciate until they merely amounted to what the Minister described later as dead timber, then you will find that this particular company whose assets are now stated to be worth approximately £13,500,000, was in the position in 1939 and for many years previously, whereby they could not pay any dividend even on debenture stock if they had made provision for depreciation and adequate provisions for renewals and repairs.  That is the basis of the finance envisaged by the Government in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember sitting in this House in 1933 listening to the Minister making the same promises about an efficient transport service, and a cheap transport service, and promising the public a much better service than they had previously had when the provisions of the 1933 Act were fully implemented. The Minister told us then that if that scheme envisaged in 1933 did not give the public a cheap and efficient transport service, then there was nothing for it but nationalisation. Eleven years afterwards we find the Minister still tinkering with a scheme of railway organisation based very largely on methods which, according to him, produced such dismal results in <Col N="1626" /> the past.  He must realise that the Great Southern Railways Company, operated by private enterprise, permitted the assets to waste to such a point as to earn from the Minister the description of dead timber.  Yet, that is the type of railway organisation which the Minister is endeavouring to buttress up to-day.  The Minister tells us he believes in a scheme under which the shareholders will elect directors and they are supposed to be responsible for the management of the company. If these directors are as bad as the Minister said they were, they should be hounded from every railway premises in the country, not allowed even to board a train, because the Minister has indicated that they are quite worthless people who have allowed such a valuable national asset to waste to such an extent that the Legislature has again to come in to help to maintain the system by guaranteeing a dividend of 3 per cent. on £16,000,000 worth of stock.</P>
    <P>The Minister is going to permit the shareholders to re-elect six of those people, to re-elect half a dozen of those who have been associated with the incompetent management of the railways during the past 20 years. These people will continue to operate the railway system, with this difference, that on this occasion they are going to have a chairman appointed by the Government, and the six directors, on whom the Minister is apparently going to rely in some mysterious way for the wise direction of the company's future, are going to have no power whatever against the decision of the Government-appointed chairman of the company.  You have, therefore, this kind of situation which is supposed to be an efficient railway organisation: six directors responsible to the shareholders but with no powers once the Government-appointed director says: &ldquo;You must do this or you must do that.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that the obvious thing he ought to have done in circumstances such as these confronting us in respect to the railway system was to recognise frankly that the railways under private management had failed hopelessly to give the community an efficient transport system <Col N="1627" /> and that it was therefore essential that the State should operate the railways in such a manner as to give the community an efficient and a cheap transport system.  At present the community is getting neither an efficient transport system nor a cheap transport system, and the Legislature is being confronted in cycles of five and ten years with the necessity of introducing fresh legislation to buttress up the entire railway system.  I think even now the Minister ought to recognise that the kind of directorate which he envisages and the type of finance which he is employing for the purpose of endeavouring to stimulate the railway organisation will be quite ineffective for the efficient management of the railway.</P>
    <P>The obvious remedy is that the State should buy out at a fair valuation whatever assets are left in this company of notoriously wasting assets, that the State should issue the necessary State credits to the shareholders who are so bought out, and that in future the State, with directors appointed by the State, should operate a railway system calculated to bring us in future a more efficient and cheaper railway service and transport service generally than we have had in the past.  There is no difficulty in operating a system of that kind.  The State's credit is pledged here for a most inefficient scheme of railway control.  It is pledged for a scheme of control which is probably likely to give us the same dismal results as we have had from the railways for the past 20 years.  Instead of buttressing up the railways in the manner contemplated in this Bill, the Minister should recognise that public ownership and public control of the railways are the only two factors by which we are likely to get a cheap transport system. Unless he does so, I prophesy here this evening that in ten years' time the Minister will be making the same kind of speech about railway management operated under this Bill as he made in 1933, and as he made before this Bill as the reason for the introduction of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first point I raised, the Minister has not met the <Col N="1628" /> House in any way.  Nobody objects to any responsible person reviewing a situation changing his mind, but when a person in a responsible position dealing with a matter of vital importance to the country changes his mind so fundamentally as the Minister did some little time before September, 1943, and shortly after September, 1943, then Parliament is entitled to some information as to the matters which made the Minister change his mind.  Before September, 1943, the Minister thought that the best course was to buy out the company in such a way that the debenture holders would get fully compensated, and that the holders of stock other than debenture holders would get approximately 67 per cent. of the nominal value of their holdings, an amount that was substantially generous when compared with the market quotations of the stock.  The market quotations of the 4 per cent. guaranteed stock in June, 1939, was 30; of the 4 per cent. preference, 13¼, and of the ordinary stock, 9¼.  That was the Minister's pre-September, 1943, idea, but he changed it definitely.  He was going to clear away the ownership of the railways and was going to compensate people in that particular way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as we can understand from the Minister, the ultimate virtue in his new proposals is that he will have a body to nominate directly.  Who are the body?  Deputy Larkin asked that question, and I tried to ask it.  I endeavoured to put down a question which the Ceann Comhairle considered was entirely out of order.  Therefore, it did not appear on the Order Paper. I asked for the names and addresses of the holders of common stock in the Great Southern Railways Company to-day, and for dates previous to that on which the Minister interfered with the company by wiping out the board and appointing a general manager.  I did not get the information because I was told that, from the point of view of the general order of this House, it was none of our business.  I appreciate that from the point of view of the Ceann Comhairle, but I do not appreciate it from the point of view of a Minister who puts a Bill of this importance before us, and gives us no information as to who these owners <Col N="1629" /> are.  As far as the past is concerned, I have given figures with regard to dividends paid although profits were not earned.  The profits were net profits after paying the debentures and such prior charges as the railway company was liable to meet.  Between 1925 and 1931 the sum of £3,013,000 was paid although the net profits during that period were only £1,141,000.  That sum was paid to the holders of other than debenture stock. Between 1932 and 1939 there was a net loss over these eight years of £1,100,000.  During that period certain stockholders got £582,000&mdash;stock-holders other than debenture holders. Those people have not changed in the meantime, and are practically the holders of the stock referred to in this Bill.  They got this money simply because, as the Minister indicated, up to 1931 there were certain wind-falls which came to the company in the way of back payments from the British Government.  The point is that since 1932 they got that money, while in the same period the losses mentioned occurred.  These losses led to a deterioration in the railway system, to the position indicated in the statement made by the present managing director before the Stocks Tribunal.  He is reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of the 22nd February, 1944, to have said that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... the reconstruction of the new company would not be able to earn enough to pay interest on its stock and that the Government should be prepared to guarantee interest for a number of years.</P>
    <P>What is the future of the people who are being made owners in this new company?  As far as the Great Southern holders are concerned, over £8,500,000 is to be repaid in one way or another by 1960, as well as interest. If one is to take the earnings of the company in the past and the outlook of the managing director, there will be nothing to provide that money for the debenture holders but this: to squeeze unnecessarily high costs out of those who use the railways or roads of the country, and out of those who travel by tram and by bus from Crumlin to Drumcondra or from Kimmage to the centre of the city.  Despite all the <Col N="1630" /> squeezing that can be done by the profit makers in that way it does not seem to me to offer any great prospect of income for the ordinary stockholders in this company for some years to come.  The Minister is basing his foundation to provide the ordinary directors for the new company on a group of people that simply in the past got things that they did not deserve, and are not going to get in the future except they squeeze them out of the users of transport throughout the country.  The common stock, except in so far as it cannot be held to be accountable, will be held only by people who are prepared to gamble on what is likely to be the position in 15 years' time, if and when the company lasts till then, and if, having paid off this stock by squeezing the transport users of to-day, they are able to make a bit on their income from the railway of to-morrow.  I do not see how the holders of the stock to-day could be so described as to make the Minister boast that they are the right kind or class upon which to base the directors that are going to be elected.  We have no information about the extent to which the common stock of the company is held by non-nationals or the extent to which it may fall into the hands of non-nationals in the future.  The main fact that we ought to have before us is why the Minister changed so fundamentally and radically in his outlook between, say, August, 1943, and October, 1943, on what should be done to finance the railways, what should be done to control them and what should be done in regard to the owners.</P>

      <P>The Minister wants to be fair to the stockholders.  In the future there will be two classes, those holding the substituted new debenture stock and the common stock-holders. In the course of the discussion on the Bill, the Minister said that people were misrepresenting the situation as between these two classes or, at least, were not distinguishing between them. The debenture interest, he said, was always earned.  We know how it was earned.  The minority report shows that.  The officials of the company will attended before the tribunal complained <Col N="1631" /> that the allocation of moneys for permanent way renewals and so on was completely insufficient: that they would require an annual expenditure of £600,000 a year.  A similar sum was said to be required for the renewal of rolling stock, so that both items give a total of £1,200,000.  The minority report shows that was a smaller provision than the Great Northern Company was making for rolling stock, permanent way, etc.  If provision had been made in the way in which the company's officials thought it should have been made for these purposes since 1931, would the balance be adequate to meet the debenture interest?  If it is said now that the debenture interest was earned, it was earned only at the expense of the permanent way and the rolling stock according to the contention of the company's own officials who gave evidence.  We are asked to put those people into a particular position.  What is the position?  The stock exchange quotation on the 30th June, 1939, as was pointed out by Deputy Mulcahy, was noted by this tribunal.  If a calculation is made of the value of the railway company, as evidenced by certain stock exchange quotations, it would emerge that the value would then be about £4,500,000.  The debentures do not represent all of that but they represent the best part of it.  We propose, in face of those stock exchange quotations, to make a payment of £8,000,000 odd in respect of those stocks.  We are going to pay that sum because the debenture interest has been earned by allowing the permanent way and the rolling stock to become completely obsolete.  Lest it should be thought that the report of the tribunal set up in 1939 is out of date, here is what the Minister said on the 2nd May of this year:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The provision of cheap and efficient transport facilities in our circumstances involves, so far as railway transport is concerned, at any rate, over the greater part of the State, an almost complete scrapping of existing transport equipment.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We are going to pay £8,000,000 for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1632" />&ldquo;The railway equipment which Coras Iompair Eireann&mdash;the corporation which it is proposed to establish under this Bill&mdash;will acquire from the Great Southern Railways Company is very largely obsolete. Not merely is it largely obsolete, but it is, to an entirely uneconomic extent, unstandardised.  It will be necessary, at the earliest moment, for whatever organisation we set up to take over the responsibility of transport operation, to replace the existing equipment with new equipment, designed to meet modern requirements, standardised to secure economy in maintenance and adequate to meet all demands upon it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is the picture&mdash;an almost complete scrapping of existing transport equipment over the greater part of the State, so far as the railways are concerned, equipment largely obsolete, and, to an entirely uneconomic extent, unstandardised, such equipment to be replaced by new equipment.  That is the position the railway company was brought to, because it did not provide for the maintenance of its permanent way, rolling stock or other fixed matters.</P>
    <P>These debenture stocks are not redeemable at the moment.  I suggest to the Minister that there is only one way of finding out their value.  That is to find out what people who were able to purchase them freely and openly would pay for them.  On the 30th June, 1939, their value was about £4,500,000, and the Minister thinks he ought to be fair to those people and pay them £8,000,000.  He says that they are in no better position than they were before. A value has been put upon their property which investors never put on it before.  Speculators put a higher price on it now, because they know that the shareholders never expected to get what is offered now.  The stock exchange quotation is one of the fairest ways of finding out what the value of the property is.  Why does the Minister propose to double the amount which people buying in the ordinary market were prepared to give?  That was in June, 1939&mdash;before the Minister told them that the whole <Col N="1633" /> equipment required to be scrapped. Why does the Minister propose to double the value of the property at that time?  He does more than that&mdash; because it is proposed to redeem inside some period of years about £16,000,000 worth of stock.</P>
    <P>We are, certainly, going to redeem £13,000,000 worth of stock by 1960 and, inside whatever period the redemption still proceeds, we are going to pay the guaranteed interest.  There is no such position for those people at the moment.  When all that is done, when the transport user, as Deputy Mulcahy has said, has had this sum squeezed out of him by excessive charges or the taxpayer is made to bleed so that the sum be paid&mdash;when all that is over, what is to happen the railway system? It goes back into the hands of the holders of the common stock&mdash; £3,500,000 worth.  They will get the railway system clear of all those prior charges.  They, according to the Minister and his predecessor, were the people responsible for not making their representatives on the board see that the railway did good railway business. There never was in this country before&mdash;I do not know if there ever was anywhere else&mdash;a case in which people held up to public odium and scorn for the way in which they ran their concern were put into the position in which they are being put here&mdash;debenture stockholders to be paid off and the owners of the common stock, to the amount of £3,500,000, to remain still proprietors of the railway.  In the meantime, not merely is there the guarantee of this 3 per cent., and redemption by half-yearly instalments of £13,000,000 or, possibly, £16,000,000 worth of debenure stock, but there is a provision that the railway company can pay 6 per cent. to the common stockholders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies should try to approach this matter in a more serious manner than their speeches would indicate they are doing.  I do not know if the speeches we have heard from Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Norton are to be taken seriously or whether they are to be regarded merely as debating speeches for the purpose of raising political points.  They did not <Col N="1634" /> seem to me to be speeches which would come from Deputies trying to contribute useful suggestions to the solution of our transport problems or towards the improvement of the Bill. What purpose does misrepresentation serve in this connection? I do not think that it can serve any purpose. When Deputies speak of the stock exchange value of the various stocks and shares of the Great Southern Railways and relate that to the whole of the shares issued by that company, they are obviously trying to mislead somebody.  A very small fraction of the debenture stock or of the ordinary shares of the Great Southern Railways Company comes on the market at all.</P>
      <P>There were periods in the past when people, anxious to get money in a hurry to meet some family need, had considerable difficulty in selling their shares in this company&mdash;particularly their ordinary shares&mdash;and they had to take any price offered for them.  To say that that price represented the price at which you could get all the shares is just nonsense.  If you are to determine the fair price for the shares of this company or any other company, you must proceed not only on the basis of a willing buyer but of a willing seller.  You must assume that all the shareholders of the Great Southern Railways are willing to sell at the current stock exchange quotation. That is nonsense and Deputies know it is nonsense.  If you are to proceed on the basis of stock market quotations at all, the actual price which you will have to pay to get into your hand all the stock issued by a company, or held by stockholders in a company, will be substantially higher at any particular time than the current market price.  We are not proposing to give stock market prices at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies are hypnotised by this idea of stock exchange prices.  Stock market prices have nothing to do with this Bill.  We are not proposing to give to Great Southern Railways shareholders, as Deputy McGilligan contended, double the value of their shares.  We are proposing to give debenture holders for every £100 4 per cent. debenture which they have now, £100 3 <Col N="1635" /> per cent. debenture.  That is to say, instead of the probability of 4 per cent., as in the past, they will have the certainly of 3 per cent. in the future.  That is the difference.  Whatever security there was for the payment of that dividend still exists but, in addition, we are giving them the security of a Government guarantee. In return for that Government guarantee, we are taking from them 25 per cent. of the revenue they formerly got from their investment.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the ordinary and preference shareholders.  Their prospect of getting dividends depended upon the earning powers of the company. They are going to get for every £100 of stock a new stock of similar nominal value, but the prospect of dividends still depends on earning power.  The stock market price has nothing whatever to do with it.  We are dealing with nominal value, not with stock market price.  Deputies who talked about one or the other are misleading themselves or trying to mislead others.  It is, of course, wrong to assume that, because the equipment of the Great Southern Railways is obsolescent or obsolete, it cannot earn revenue.  Of course, it can earn revenue.</P>
    <P>If we are to ascertain the value of that equipment and to compensate the shareholders of the company on the basis of our assumption of its value we are going to do something which is fundamentally unfair.  The Dublin Transport Company had obsolete equipment.  In 1935, the same statement could be made about that company as is now made about the Great Southern Railways.  It was inefficiently managed and it tried to maintain its position with obsolescent equipment. In that year, the company effected a reorganisation, and obsolete equipment is being replaced out of revenue. Is it seriously contended that we should acquire the Dublin Transport Company on the basis of its value in 1935 or on the stock market quotation of the shares in 1935?  Surely, if it is fair to do it in one case, it is fair to do it in the other.  Are we to take no account of the fact that the Dublin Transport Company, by more efficient <Col N="1636" /> management, succeeded in replacing obsolete equipment with fresh equipment, and, not merely repaid loans but reduced capital liability while, at the same time, giving cheaper fares to the public as well as substantially improving the conditions of employment of the workers?</P>
    <P>What was done in the case of the Dublin Transport Company can be done for transport as a whole in this country.  That is what we believe, and it is because we believe that that is possible, we are assuming that it would be unfair to determine the compensation to be given, if we propose to acquire the property or the shares of the Great Southern Railways, either on the basis of the stock market quotation for the shares at any particular date or on our idea of the value of the fixed assets.  I said before that a transport organisation has no assets as such, except goodwill, and that the value of its fixed assets is at no time an indication of its earning capacity. You cannot treat a transport organisation as other commercial enterprises, as Deputy McGilligan tried to do when he talked of depreciation.</P>
    <P>I agree that the finances of the Great Southern Railways should be recast into much the same form as the finances of any other commercial enterprise, that depreciation should be recognised as a working cost, that out of revenue every year a sum should be set aside against depreciation, and that depreciation should be recognised as a first charge on revenue.  But that has never been the practice in regard to railway finances in the past.  A railway company did not set aside sums for depreciation.  It did not pay taxation on that basis.  There was an arrangement by which such companies appropriated certain sums for renewals and maintenance.  It may be true that the Great Southern Railways did not appropriate sufficient for renewals and repairs in the past, but they had not got it, because, under their system of finance, the first charge on revenue was debenture interest.  It had to continue paying debenture interest or the debenture holders could exercise their rights.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1637" /> However, we propose to effect the reorganisation which we believe is possible here, not merely in relation to the equipment of the company, but also in relation to its system of working and finance.  We believe that, by an improved system of working, and by more efficient management, it will not merely be possible to effect the reequipment of the company with up-to-date equipment, but to do so, while at the same time providing cheaper transport, as well as providing for the amortisation of those capital liabilities with which the new company will start off.  It may be that we are trying to put too onerous a burden on the company. I do not think we are, but that is a matter we can discuss on the appropriate section.  In any event, my view is that we should leave the provisions of the Bill as they stand.  If, in ten or 12 years' time, we find that the company cannot live up to the very high standard we are setting for it, then the Dáil should have another opportunity of considering the matter.  I would rather set our standard too high than too low.  I believe this can be done and, if it can be done, it is going, not merely to ensure that we will have in the immediate future a better transport organisation, but there is the possibility of a very substantial improvement in the general transport position in the course of 15 years.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister making preparations already to tell the House five years hence that the Act of 1933 did not produce results, that the Act of 1944 did not produce results, and that at no far distant date&mdash;a historical phrase&mdash;other methods will have to be tried; and that we must give another trial&mdash;at the public expense, of course &mdash;to a reorganisation of the railways? The Minister told us what the Government is doing in this matter is a matter for the shareholders&mdash;£100 3 per cent. guaranteed stock for every £100 of 4 per cent. debenture stock, with this difference, that, at present, they have a probability of 4 per cent. dividend on £100 of debenture stock but that in the future they are going to have a definite guarantee of 3 per cent.  Does the Minister not know perfectly well that it is because of the unusual and <Col N="1638" /> highly unorthodox financial methods adopted by the company the shareholders have been able to get any benefit from their shares?  If the Minister reads the report of the tribunal set up in 1939, he will find that one member of that tribunal said that it was only possible to pay interest on debenture stock by making no provision, generally speaking, for renewals and repairs, even in normal years.</P>

      <P>I have every idea.  It has been demonstrated that the greater part of the increased profit last year was due to economies and not to increased charges.

The additional profits were the result of economies and efficient management.  Not merely did they pay interest on debentures but they paid a dividend on ordinary shares.</P>

      <P>The Minister tells us that the increased earnings of the company were due to economies and efficient management.  That happened at a time when the chairman of the company stated that the whole railway system was a complete wash-out as a financial enterprise.  He has, as a matter of fact, made the statement that over 50 per cent. of the railway lines were earning no revenue whatever.  Yet the Minister tells us that the year in which the chairman said that the rolling stock was obsolescent, that the railway lines were dangerous&mdash;and this was confirmed by the Minister in statements made in this House&mdash;that the rolling stock had not been renewed, and that 50 per cent. of the lines were earning no revenue whatever was the period which brought about phenomenal prosperity to the railway by efficient methods and management. <Col N="1639" /> There is nobody in the world believes it at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact of the matter is that all that efficiency was reflected in the fact that one could have bought ordinary stock on the stock exchange in March of last year at £9.  The chairman had then told the nation that the whole railway system was in a deplorable position&mdash;that they had no coal, no money to buy coal, and that the whole system had suffered from a serious want of attention.  In that circumstance, one could buy ordinary stock of the Great Southern Railways for £9.  Was it the painting of that pessimistic picture and the normal belief that there was a silver lining to the cloud which would rapidly show itself that induced the same ordinary stock to rise to £52 in March, 1944? Of course, it was not.  If the stock exchange had been left alone in March, 1943, the value of the stocks would have deteriorated still further.  What caused the stocks to jump between March, 1943, and March, 1944, was the fact that in the meantime certain folk were quite satisfied that there was to be a Government guarantee for these stocks which would give the stock a value which it never had before.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister tells us that all he is doing in this Bill is giving the debenture stockholders 3 per cent. guaranteed debenture stock in exchange for 4 per cent. debenture stock.  The 4 per cent. debenture stock of the Great Southern Railways has been able to earn dividends simply because the railway company utilised moneys, which it ought to have set aside for renewals and repairs, for the payment of dividends on the debenture stock.  In the future, that will not happen.  Apparently the company may be required to make adequate provision for renewals and repairs, and to that extent therefore there may be some doubt as to whether the company has money available to pay dividends on its debenture stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite clearly, the Minister realises that would be so, if not permanently, at least at the outset, because, in order to induce people to take up the debenture stock which may be issued in the future, the Minister is to give a Government guarantee of 3 per cent. on the stock.  That is to be the inducement to buy the stock, and it is that fact, the Government guarantee, and not the assets of the railway company or its earning capacity under orthodox methods of finance, which will induce people to take up the debenture stock issued by the company.  Does the <Col N="1641" /> Minister not know perfectly well that the railway company could not go on the market to-morrow and offer debenture stock at 4 per cent.?  Would it be taken up?  Does the Minister believe it would be taken up?  If it would be taken up, the railway company could finance itself by the issue of debenture stock at 4 per cent. or debenture stock at 3 per cent., but the company know perfectly well that they could not get, on their methods of finance, on the assertions of the company or on the Minister's view of the directors who have been managing the company, any substantial quantity of debenture stock taken up at 3 per cent. or 4 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is because these assets in the form of debenture stock are in fact being given a greater value by the Government's method of financing this Bill that there is complaint that so far as the value of the shares is concerned the community as a whole is paying a greater dividend on these shares than would normally be the case because of the value attaching to the shares under the Minister's methods of grading them for the purpose of ascertaining the debenture and common stock of the new company.  If the Minister attempts to tell us it is possible for the railway company, on what we know from the report of the Transport Tribunal, from the chairman's speech, and from the Minister's own view of the railway company, to be able to earn a dividend and pay its way on these substantially inflated assets, assets inflated by positive Government action, he is painting a future for the railways which will not be at all justified, and after a period the Minister will have again to confess, as he confessed in 1933 and this year, that other methods will have to be adopted in order to put the railways on a much better basis than that on which they were then or are now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's latest contribution is the most amazing of many amazing speeches delivered by the Minister on the transport problem of the country.  He has told us that he deprecates Deputy McGilligan, Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Norton, referring to the stock exchange value of the <Col N="1642" /> stock and shares of the Great Southern Railways.  These must be completely ignored as having nothing to do with the case.  He further told us that dividends can be earned irrespective of whether the rolling stock is obsolescent or otherwise.  Whether the stock is obsolescent or not does not matter.  All you want is good competent management, and you can make dividends, even with obsolete rolling stock.</P>
      <P>Why was this note not sounded by the Minister and by his echo, the chairman of the railway company, when they wrote down the value of the railway companies of the country in 1943 when we were told that the railways were completely obsolete and had no future, and when some of us who had given our lives to the railway service looked with despair on the future of the railways?  This gentleman who was brought in to manage the company gave a picture to the shareholders, with the concurrence, I am sure, of the Minister, which showed that there was no future for the railways and that the country could not afford a system of transport which had to employ 15,000 people with engines half the time hauling nothing.  Fifty per cent. of the mileage was being run for nothing, owing to the obsolete system of shunting. Sidings were out of place, stations wrongly built and plant complaint of the gentleman who is at the moment dictator and controller of the transport system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were told by the Minister at another time that he brought in this gentleman, who was skilled in running a fleet of city buses, to run the railway system because he thought it was better to bring in a man who had never been in railways.  He would have had to go across the Channel to get a railway expert or get one from the railway service here, but he thought it best to bring in a man who had never been in railways.  The moral of that is: if you want to make a success of any business, bring in a man who has never been in that business. We are told now that the success recently achieved by the company was due to expert management.  The Minister knows well that one could not <Col N="1643" /> avoid being a success on the railways recently.  There was too much traffic for the transport available and a porter from Kingsbridge could have run the railway system successfully in recent times.  That is no criterion of what will happen in the future.  The Minister knows enough about transport not to have to be told that.</P>
    <P>I wonder why the voice in which he speaks to-night is so distinct from the voice in which he spoke 12 months ago when the value of the railway stocks was written down to zero?  Both the Minister's voice and the chairman's voice were responsible for cutting the stocks and shares value down to the £9 spoken of by Deputy Norton.  Then a wonderful transformation took place.</P>
    <P>We are told we will get the report of the Great Southern Railways Stocks Tribunal within half-an-hour. That report is not so necessary.  Anybody who listened to the Minister's speech could not but mark the insincerity of his remarks on a former occasion and now.  I should like to hark back to the speech made by the Minister in 1933.  He then said he would give a last chance to private industry and, if it did not succeed under the legislation then being enacted, the question of nationalisation could not be ruled out of consideration.  We have advanced to the year 1944, but the Minister is still defending private control of the railways.  He is not prepared, evidently, to go the whole distance towards the nationalisation of such an important industry.  We are now going to have private control. Notwithstanding that we are guaranteeing public money for this company, it is still a private company, and the money that will be provided will not be under the control of this House. Every operation will be excluded from our control and Deputies will be unable to make inquiries here into how the whole organisation is being run.</P>
    <P>Every opportunity is being taken to prevent public representatives from inquiring how our £16,000,000 will be spent.  The Minister will probably tell us that a private concern should not be requested to disclose its affairs here, and we are told that there will <Col N="1644" /> be a safeguard by the establishment of a board.  The position will be that there will be one individual in control and there will be a few cyphers appointed to a board, but they will have no voice in the running of the company.</P>
    <P>The speech made by the Minister a few moments ago was one of the most amazing contributions on the transport problem to which I have listened during my period in this House.  It would seem to me that the Minister has learned nothing and forgotten nothing.  I do honestly wish that he would give expression to his own views on this matter.  I feel that if he were to give honest expression to his views on the subject, he would be quite a different man from the man we know as the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I am sure that inwardly he feels, as I feel, that he is doing a wrong thing and, if he were free to do it, I am sure he would do everything possible to rescue the transport of the country from the oblivion into which he is now going to sink it.</P>
    <P>He is putting into the hands of an absolutely unskilled man, a man who until now has had no interest in the railway business, the full control of this great organisation.  Irrespective of what may be in the report of the Great Southern Railways Stock Tribunal, which will be issued in half-an-hour, the public will have their own views with regard to the present proposal and they will realise what justification there is for the Minister placing the whole transport organisation of this country in the hands of one individual.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give us any information with regard to the value of the property?  There are certain tests, one being the Stock Exchange, but he discards that; the Stock Exchange quotations do not matter, whether they are low, as in June, 1939, and as representing the public view of whatever shares then came on the market, or what they are now, as representing the public view of the changed position brought about, not by what the Minister ascribes the position to be due to, but because of what Deputy Norton mentioned&mdash;that there is a Government guarantee and <Col N="1645" /> that the capital will be repaid, under the terms of this measure, before 1960.  Therefore, we will not have that test.</P>
      <P>Have we any other test?  Is the property in which people are investing, and to which we are asked to devote a considerable amount of public money, to be guaranteed?  Is that property earning money?  Did it earn any money in the past, and had it enough to pay debenture interest?  Are we paying for physical assets?  Have I to read again what the Minister once told us, when he said that the property had to be largely scrapped and that the new organisation will have to replace the existing equipment?  He said even more than that, and the chairman of the company told us that there was an Order which would substantially increase rates and fares.  He added this: &ldquo;This Order will enable us to do no more than make ends meet.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>A few months later the Minister said: &ldquo;The railways company is making a loss now and the anticipated revenue in the coming year will not meet its working costs.&rdquo;  Later on, about one month later, he said: &ldquo;The earnings on the Great Southern Railways were not sufficient to pay working expenses; even the increased rates will not cover the deficiency in full.&rdquo; In March, 1943, the chairman of the company said: &ldquo;There is no reason to think that the railways company, no matter what you ask for the services rendered, can pay dividends on its existing capital.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I should imagine it should have some effect on people who were inclined to buy.  &ldquo;... no matter what you ask for the services rendered.&rdquo; That was followed up by the Minister's statement that there was a substantial increase in rates and fares, but it would not enable the railways company to cover the deficiency in its working expenses.  The chairman of the company previously said he did not believe the Order would do more than enable them to make ends meet. <Col N="1646" /> That is the position of the property.</P>
      <P>Take it by the test of the Stock Exchange in June, 1939, before there was any question of reorganisation.  The value of the stock then was £4,500,000. We are paying £8,000,000 on it; people buy the new stocks because there is a certainty that the Government, the taxpayers, are going to back these stocks.  The Minister says that we may find a considerable part of the equipment of a transport undertaking is obsolete, or obsolescent, but you can get revenue out of it.  While it was becoming obsolete it did not earn the revenue that it is now required to earn.  How is it going to earn it?  The new organisation is going to start off with a capital of £13,500,000, and it can eventually have a capital of £20,000,000.  The additional £6,500,000 is going to replace the existing equipment. That equipment at one time was valued at £25,000,000.  The Minister reduced it by £12,000,000 or £13,000,000 and then, in 1944, he tells us that that will have to be regarded as obsolete and will have to be replaced.</P>
      <P>At a time when all costs are going up, this is going to be bought by a company which has only an extra £6,500,000 with which to buy the new assets.  What are we buying?  Are we buying physical assets really there, or the proved capacity to earn?  You are not buying either.  So far as proved capacity to earn is concerned, that has been disproved.  So far as the assets are concerned, the Minister gives us one picture, and the chairman of the company gives very nearly the same picture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not understand the Minister's quibble as regards the references in my speeches to depreciation.  I quoted from pages 147 and 148 of the report. There was a reference there to an annual expenditure of £600,000, as being essential for maintenance and renewals of the permanent way and works, and an equal sum for the maintenance and renewal of the rolling stock.  On page 148 it is indicated that, if these amounts were provided, in no year would the balance be adequate to meet debenture interest, much less to provide dividends on the <Col N="1647" /> various stocks.  In 1943 the chairman said: &ldquo;I doubt if it would ever have been possible to pay dividends.&rdquo;  We are going to put up pound for pound on these stocks and the State guarantees 3 per cent., and by 1960 the £13,000,000, and possibly £16,000,000 will be repaid; and when that is done the common stockholders will be the proprietors of a completely reorganised <Col N="1648" /> and modernised transport system. What is the justification for that?</P>

      <P>Information as to the number of persons in each county who were in receipt of old age pensions and pensions for the blind on the 31st August, 1944, would have to be obtained from the Department of Finance.  The supplementary allowances to which the Deputy refers are awarded to old age pensioners, blind pensioners and their dependent children, and recipients of disablement benefit and their dependent children, who are in necessitous circumstances and resident in areas, to which the Food Voucher Scheme Administered by the Department of Industry and Commerce does not extend and the grant allocated to each county is applicable to all these classes.  A tabular statement will be circulated with the <Col N="1536" /> Official Report showing the total number of old age pensioners, blind pensioners and recipients of disablement benefit in rural areas at the time of allocation of the grant in respect of supplementary allowances in February last; the amount of the grant allocated to each county in respect of all these classes and the number of old age and blind peusioners in receipt of supplementary allowances on the last Saturday of July, 1944.
