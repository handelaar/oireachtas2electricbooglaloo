    <Speaker pid="JohnJamesCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether, in view of a possible shortage of coal, he will ascertain the amount of it likely to be required for blacksmiths' forges and make provision whereby adequate supplies will be available for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither blacksmiths nor any other class of user can, in present circumstances, be promised adequate supplies, but the Deputy can be assured that every reasonable effort will be made to ensure that the coal requirements of blacksmiths' forges will be met to the maximum extent possible, having due regard to the supplies available for distribution from time to time.</P>

      <P>Will blacksmiths who were not previously registered get a supply?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to answer that question without notice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister consider taking over lots of coal in certain areas if they are brought to his notice, coal that is quite suitable for blacksmiths?  I am referring to coal that is lying there since the beginning of the war, principally in areas where there are factories.  Will the Minister consider that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that that is necessary.  I should like to have more particulars of the circumstances the Deputy has in mind.  A blacksmith gets a permit to purchase coal from any person who has a licence to sell coal. Any person who has not a licence to sell coal is not permitted to sell it, and a licensed person cannot sell except to those who hold permits.  I would like to get particulars of the circumstances the Deputy has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>A huge number of blacksmiths in my area have been brought to a standstill for want of coal, yet there are at least three dumps of coal containing something like 700 tons laid in by factories in my area. They got in supplies of coal but they do not want it.  I believe they have intimated to the Department that they are willing to sell it, or to allow the Department to take it over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy will be good enough to supply me with particulars.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he will state (1) the stocks of sulphate of copper on hands by wholesale merchants on March 1st, 1944; (2) the likely quantity to be imported before May 1st, 1944, and (3) how this position compares with that obtaining on May 1st, 1943.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The position regarding supplies of sulphate of copper is approximately the same as it was last year and it is estimated that they will be sufficient to meet requirements.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to give the information requested.  Only one firm is engaged in importing sulphate of copper and it would be contrary to practice to publish particulars relating to the business of any individual firm.  Furthermore, as the Deputy is aware, only the total value of imports is at present being published.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether the <Col N="1009" /> pension awarded to Mrs. J.H. Young, of Rosbrien Cottage, Rosbrien Road, Limerick, in respect of the presumed loss of her son, Hector Young, with the S.S. &ldquo;Irish Pine&rdquo; has been withdrawn; and, if so, what are the reasons for this withdrawal, and when may she expect to have it restored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The pension awarded under Emergency Powers (No. 263) Order, 1943, jointly to the parents of Hector Young who was serving on the missing S.S. &ldquo;Irish Pine&rdquo; ceased on the 19th January, 1944.  An investigation into the circumstances of the parents disclosed that pecuniary need, which under the terms of the Order is an essential condition of eligibility for pension, no longer existed at that time, and it therefore became necessary to discontinue payment of pension. The parents were informed that consideration would be given to the question of granting another pension if and when evidence of a material worsening in their circumstances was submitted.  Such evidence was received recently and the matter is now having attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that Mr. and Mrs. J.H. Young have not only lost this son, who was lost on board the ship mentioned in the question, but they have another son in the Army, a third in the Marine Service and a fourth who is a merchant sailor? In these circumstances, does the Minister propose to demand, before he makes them any allowance by way of pension for the loss of the boy who died on this merchant vessel, that they should be in penury, or does he propose to give them the pension so as to spare them the pangs of acute poverty as a result of the loss of the earnings of the boy who has died?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the terms of the Order, pecuniary need must be established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not interpret the Order to mean that, if people are reduced from a state of modest comfort to one of extreme poverty as a result of the loss of their boy, he would be entitled to give them <Col N="1010" /> such assistance as will mitigate their sufferings?  Surely that is the purpose the Dáil had in mind?  Will the Minister so interpret it, and give these people the miserable allowance of 12/6 which they were getting and which has now been taken away?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A pension is subject to periodical review.  It was reviewed in January last and pecuniary need was shown not to exist then.  Evidence that in the meantime the circumstances of the family have worsened has been received and the matter is again being examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not apply the test of destitution, if he is satisfied the people are poor as a result of the loss of the son, where they might have been comfortable had he not died?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of the fact that domestic consumers of electric light from the Electricity Supply Board have had their supplies reduced by 50 per cent., he will in the general public interest make a special recommendation to the board to have the weekly rental payable reduced by 50 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to do as the Deputy suggests.  The fixed charge or weekly rental is designed to cover the fixed costs, which are not affected by a reduction in consumption, and consequently a reduction in the fixed charge cannot be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1011" />
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not this the position, that the people who pay on the valuation basis will have to pay, no matter what supplies of electricity they consume, whereas the people who pay on a consumption basis, by unit only, are getting a proportionate reduction in cost?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so, but the fixed charge is related to the cost of providing a supply and it is payable whether a supply is taken or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister consider the suggestion that at least for the present period everybody should be put on a unit consumption basis?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that, in addition to the valuation basis, there is a fixed charge as well in some cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>For those who elect to take a supply on that basis, yes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The information which the Deputy requires is as follows:&mdash; (a) Twenty-nine barges have been constructed. (b) The average cost per barge was £1,042.  (c) The firms employed on construction of the barges were Messrs.  Ringsend Dockyard (Dublin) Ltd.; Messrs. Liffey Dockyard Ltd., Dublin; Messrs. Thomas Thompson and Son, Ltd., Carlow; and Messrs.

(e) Sixteen barges are at present in commission. (f) Thirteen barges are not at the moment in use. (g) Barges came into commission on varying dates, the last barge having been completed at the end of March, 1944.  During the year 1943 the barges were in commission for approximately 94 per cent. of their available time. (h) The rate of hirage per barge is as follows:&mdash;(1) Barge without ceiling; for low grade traffic, 20/- per week, and for high grade traffic, 40/- per week. (2) Barge with ceiling; for low grade traffic, 25/- per week and for high grade traffic, 45/- per week.

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that a member of Laoighis County Council requested the county manager for the county for certain information re persons in receipt of home assistance in the county in October, 1942; that the county manager refused to disclose the information; that as a result no investigation could be made by the councillor into allegations about the way the funds were administered; and, if so, whether he will state whether it is in the public interest that responsible councillors should be refused information regarding a matter of this nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The only representations in this matter which I received were from the Deputy, and the communication which I sent to him on the 4th May, 1943, dealt with the representations contained in the question.  The Laoighis County Council and the chairman of the council can obtain all the information they may require from the county manager regarding any business of the council.  As a member of the county council the normal course would be for the Deputy to move the council to require the manager to supply any information which the council desire.  In view of the facilities which exist for obtaining full information regarding any business of the <Col N="1015" /> council the last part of the question does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that when the old boards of health were in existence any member of a board of health was in a position to find out who was in receipt of moneys given by the county board of health?  Does the Minister consider that where a member of a council had the suspicion that certain irregularities are being carried on the county manager is within his rights in refusing such information as will throw light on the suspicion in the mind of any member of the council?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the best way to answer the question is to read for the Deputy, in order to refresh his memory, a letter I wrote him on the 4th May, 1943, in which I stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;... at every meeting of the county council the register in which copies of the manager's orders made since the preceding meeting are entered is produced for the inspection of members.  Any member can obtain a copy of any particular order which he specifies.  The county council and the chairman of the council can also obtain such information as they may require from the manager regarding any business of the council.  In this way the council can keep themselves fully conversant with the business transacted.  Except in the manner provided for in the Act, individual members of the council cannot demand as of right information and returns from the manager, and therefore the manager was not bound to supply you with particulars of the allowances to persons in receipt of home assistance which you asked for.  The manager has discretion in such a case to give or withhold information and the Minister has no power to issue any direction to him with regard to it.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in October, 1942, I requested this information as a member of the county council, and that for six months after I requested the information the irregularities were carried on and, if the information had been given by the <Col N="1016" /> county manager, the Gárda Síochána or the responsible authorities would be able to deal with the officials concerned, who were responsible for the misconduct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I must remind the Deputy that he did not call for information about any specific case.  My recollection is that what he wanted to do was to go to the county council offices and conduct a roving inquiry on his own behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I say that the Minister has been misinformed?  I asked the county manager for certain information in connection with certain individuals who were in receipt of home assistance, because I was informed by constituents that a certain number of people who were supposed to be receiving home assistance were dead.  I could not prove that without having a list from the county manager, which he refused to give.  I think that I was treated very unfairly and that the ratepayers whom I represent were allowed to be robbed, if I might use the expression.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Deputy could have verified the facts as to the decease of certain persons without having recourse to the county manager.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is such a thing in this country as legal proceedings being instituted against any individual who makes a charge that he cannot prove and that I could not prove this charge without securing information from the county manager?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he received a letter dated 5th March, 1943, from a member of Laoighis County Council requesting him to hold a sworn inquiry into the administration of the public assistance section of the county council, on the grounds of allegations that public funds were put to other purposes through neglect or mismanagement of officials concerned; and if he will state why the inquiry was not granted, and if he now proposes to review the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware of the public notice dated 30th March, 1943, issued by the acting secretary, Laoighis County Council, announcing an extraordinary audit of accounts of the former Laoighis Board of Health and Public Assistance to be held on 5th April, 1943, at 12 noon at Courthouse, Portlaoighise, by a Local Government auditor; if he will state the names of the persons who, on 5th and 6th April, 1943, appeared before the auditor, and made objections to certain matters contained in the accounts; and if he will also state what facts members of the county council placed before the auditor on the dates in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>The only request made to me by letter dated 5th March, 1943, in this matter was received from the Deputy. I am aware of the public notice dated 30th March, 1943, issued in connection with the extraordinary audit of the accounts of the former Laoighis Board of Health and Public Assistance to be held on 5th April, 1943, and I am informed that the Deputy is the only person who appeared before the auditor to make objections to matters contained in the accounts.  Court proceeding have been taken against a home assistance officer for alleged fraudulent conversion of moneys provided for distribution to home assistance cases, and the result of these proceedings must be awaited before it can be decided whether any public inquiry is necessary.  No irregularities in the administration of home assisttance in the districts of the other assistance officers in the county have been disclosed as a result of the audit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain vouchers vital to the audit have been impounded by the Gárda authorities in connection with the legal proceedings and until these proceedings have been determined the final report of the auditor on the extraordinary audit held in connection with the defalcations cannot be completed.  The Deputy was informed by my Department on the 27th <Col N="1018" /> October last that when the auditor's final report is received copies will be sent to the county manager for circulation among members of the county council.  I should say that the auditor has made two interim reports, copies of which were sent to the secretary of county council and should be available to the council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that at the Laoighis County Council yesterday I raised the question of the reports from the auditor and I was informed by the county manager that no such reports were available?  Will the Minister indicate if he proposes to hold an inquiry when the legal proceedings at present being instituted are concluded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already, in my reply, indicated to the Deputy that I cannot undertake to give any decision as to whether or not an inquiry will be held until I receive the final report of the auditor.  As to what transpired at the Laoighis County Council yesterday, the Deputy will understand that I have no information in that regard.  I can say this, that I know no reason why the interim report should not have been presented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Further to the Minister's reply, is he aware that numerous requests have been made by me from time to time to get information in connection with this matter, and it has been refused?  Am I to understand from the Minister's reply that if I go down to Portlaoighise I can demand the information that the auditor placed at the disposal of the county council?  I think as a councillor I have a right to it.  Will the Minister say if the inquiry conducted into the affairs of the Roscommon County Council quite recently&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Did I understand the Minister to lay down the general principle that county councillors are not entitled to demand as a right from the county manager lists of the names of persons in receipt of home assistance? Does he realise that, if that is to be the general rule, very grave abuses will inevitably manifest themselves, because the ordinary procedure of local administration is that it is the local councillor who advises the chief executive officer of the local authority as to whether or not that chief executive officer is conscientiously carrying out his duty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy has misunderstood me.  I have not laid it down as a general principle that a county manager should refuse this information. I merely said this, that the county manager is only obliged by law to give information to the chairman of the county council if the chairman requests it, or to the county council if the county council by resolution asks for it.  In that case, the county manager is bound to give all the information in his possession in relation to the particular matter in regard to which it has been requested.  So far as an individual member of the council is concerned, I think the county managers should, wherever they are requested to do so, as a matter of courtesy give such information as a member of the county council may request in relation <Col N="1020" /> to any business of the county council, but they are not compelled by law to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If it becomes manifest that councillors are asking for lists of those in receipt of outdoor assistance, and that the managers are in a considerable number of cases refusing that information, would the Minister consider making the necessary amendment of the law to define more clearly the rights of individual councillors to get information?</P>

      <P>I am afraid I could not give an affirmative answer, without many reservations, to that question. The Deputy will be well aware that public assistance is a matter about which there is a certain amount of delicacy.  Unless there is very flagrant abuse, one does not want to expose unnecessarily the circumstances of those who are in receipt of public assistance. In the particular case which has been under review I am not satisfied that the information was required solely for the purpose of exposing an abuse.</P>

      <P>Might I ask if it is the intention of the Taoiseach or of any member of the Government, before we adjourn this week, to make a statement to the Dáil with regard to the particularly critical position of transport in the country?  I made that request privately, and I was informed that it was not so intended.  I am putting up the request again to the Government now, and my reason for doing so is that there is a considerable amount of public uneasiness, and questions are being addressed to each one of us as Deputies.  It seems rather a belittling of Parliament that Deputies have to say to their constituents: &ldquo;We do not know anything about it; we have not heard anything about it.&rdquo;  It could justly be said that the conveyance of passengers, goods, stock, etc., is a national matter which should be considered by Parliament rather than by a transport company.  If there is anything embarrassing in the request I am perfectly prepared to postpone it, but I think a crisis of this kind&mdash;which is second only to an invasion&mdash;should receive some consideration in the national Parliament, and that some statement with regard to our proposals or plans for carrying on the feeding of the cities and the trade of the country should be made to Parliament at some point.  I repeat the request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not intended to make a statement.  I should make it clear, however, that any question relating to a specific aspect of the transport problem which had been tabled in the ordinary way would have been answered in so far as it was possible to give an answer.  If no such question was asked, the Government cannot be held responsible.  I doubt that it would be possible to make a statement which would be sufficiently informative to meet the wishes of the Dáil at the present time.  In fact, the <Col N="1023" /> Government could add little to the information already published in the newspapers as to the curtailment of transport which circumstances have forced upon us.  I do not think any more specific statement could be made at the present time.  The situation is so uncertain as to make it impossible to give anything like a definite forecast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But does the Minister realise that this kind of silence begets all sorts of odd rumours?  We get perfectly reasonable people coming up and asking whether everybody in a certain town is going to starve&mdash; whether any supplies will be brought in to them.  Those of us who are moderately informed, of course, know that, in so far as the resources of the State can prevent it, nobody is going to starve, but all that kind of uneasy talk could be stopped if the Minister made a considered statement, even though the burden of the statement was to the effect: &ldquo;All I can forecast at present is for a week, but there is no more coal coming in, and we shall have to do the best we can on the basis of no coal,&rdquo; and telling us how he proposes to use the output of the Kilkenny collieries and such other collieries as we have and what plans he has in mind.  Nobody expects him to forecast with accuracy what is going to happen.  Everybody appreciates the magnitude of his difficulties and the great difficulty of making any reliable forecast, but any statement is better than uncertainty, and the present situation is that nobody knows the full nature of the Minister's difficulties.  I urge strongly that, before the House adjourns, even if it be no more than a full <i>exposé</i> of the difficulties which confront him and the very limited resources he has at his disposal to meet them, he should make some authoritative pronouncement to which people could point in order to allay public <i>malaise,</i> in so far as it may be allayed.</P>

      <P>So far as the railway services are concerned, the Government was fully consulted as to the curtailments which would be necessitated by the diminution in coal deliveries to the railway company.  So far as priorities in respect of railway traffic are concerned, the company has for some years past been working under Government directions and it is not proposed to alter that position.  The company carries on under Government orders in respect of the classes of traffic to which it gives preference.  In reply to what Deputy Dillon has said, frankly, the position is so uncertain that a definite statement could not be made at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>Take this case.  The railway company&mdash;the railway company, mark you; not the Government &mdash;published an announcement in the papers that they proposed to close down certain branch lines.  Has the Government been consulted as to whether some of these branch lines might not be maintained with local supplies of fuel which are available at the railway and which can never be transported to the central pool in Dublin?  There are a variety of matters of that kind on which it would do no harm to permit discussion, even if at this stage no alteration were intended; but if everybody is required to sit silent, a great deal of unnecessary discontent and misunderstanding will be created.  If the Minister has nothing to say, at least let him provide an occasion on which those of us who have grievances or difficulties which we would like to bring to the attention of the Government in an orderly way may give expression to them.  Let the Minister then say whatever he wants to say about them, so that our differences may be settled reasonably, moderately and in a constitutional way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to call the attention of the Minister to one matter which appears to be of importance with regard to priorities for goods traffic.  The Minister says that the system has been in being for a considerable length of time.  We are now facing a situation in which there will be rail passenger traffic only on two days per week, and it would appear to me to be obvious that there must be one system of priorities with regard to passenger traffic.  In the public notice, the only condition laid down is that seven days' notice of intention to travel must be given. People engaged in work of national importance may happen to be just the very people left behind.  Surely pleasure travelling and all such travelling should be completely wiped out, unless and until there is spare accommodation to carry such people? Those engaged in trade, in professional work, in official work and in Parliamentary work should have priority.  These are the kinds of points which will arise in a sensible discussion of the situation by people's representatives rather than by a transport company.</P>
      <P>With regard to replacing the closed lines by bus or other forms of road transport, I saw that that replacement of train by bus transport was specifically mentioned in respect of certain lines, but, in respect of the Portlaoighise-Mountmellick line, there was no mention of an alternative bus transport system.  With regard to what Deputy Dillon has said about keeping trains going on local fuel, that particular train runs its five-mile journey through a turf bog and it should be possible to keep that line going.</P>

      <P>I think that it will be possible to have arrangements made to ensure that train accommodation will be available for Deputies attending meetings of the Dáil.  I think, however, that anybody who gives consideration to the matter will realise that the institution of any form of traffic priorities for passenger trains would involve an inquisition into the affairs of individual people by officials of the Government or the railway company which it would be almost impossible to make effective and which probably would be resented in many cases.  I assume that we could not base traffic priorities merely on the statement of individuals as to why it was necessary for them to travel and that their statements would have to be subjected to check.  In view of the difficulties of instituting any such check and of making it effective, it will be obvious that very careful consideration would have to be given before restrictions of that kind were imposed.</P>

      <P>I urge the Minister to give serious consideration to the suggestion made by Deputy O'Higgins, that is, that whenever the adjournment of this week's sitting takes place, he should consider the advisability of taking the House and the country into his confidence rather than that semi-official statements should be published by somebody without any signature to substantiate what is stated in them.  There is one thing which I thought peculiar, but for which there is probably an explanation, that is, why it has been decided &mdash;presumably, with the Minister's approval&mdash;to suspend the issue of return tickets.  Is it proposed under this arrangement to let 300 or 400 commercial travellers, cattle dealers and people with urgent work to do in the country to go away with single tickets in their pockets, without knowing when, if ever, they will get back by rail again?  That matter should get some serious consideration, and, for that reason, I was of the opinion that the decision might have been taken without due consideration.  I realise the Minister's difficulties as well as anybody in the House, but I think the House should not be allowed to adjourn over the week-end without some information from the Minister, instead of information being sent out broadcast from some kind of semi-official source which cannot be relied on and which perhaps will be changed in the next day's paper.</P>

      <P>Last evening, some very nice tributes to the Minister for Justice were paid.  Every member of the House will agree that the Minister makes himself the most approachable and accommodating Minister of all.  Certainly he is accommodating quite a big number: that description is very right.  Deputy Linehan alluded to the tramps and others known as gypsies who go round in caravans touring the country.  The Irish people generally, both rural and town folks, are very friendly disposed to them but they have become a bit of a nuisance.  As Deputy Linehan remarked, some 30 or 40 years ago they were quite useful citizens&mdash;tinsmiths and metal workers. I myself remember their being at that work.  I can tell of a particular case where five caravans came to a town and set up near it.  About eight or ten people then came along begging. The Irish people are very kind to poorer people but these beggars are <Col N="1031" /> a nuisance.  During the day when the men are in the fields the farmer's wife or daughter is at home and these beggars make a raid on the place. They ask for a grain of tea or sugar or a bit of bacon and are never satisfied. One would not mind that so much but they hold up the lady of the house in that way and, in the meantime, the hen roost and the hay loft are raided and any loose feeding round about the house is stolen.</P>
      <P>Deputy Linehan did not make any suggestion as to how those people should be dealt with.  I do not think I can make one either but I remember picking up a copy of the <i>Wide World</i> magazine which showed that President Roosevelt was faced with the same problem.  There were 2,000,000 people on wheels at that time apart from the hoboes or train jumpers.  The article was beautifully written by a university man who had been in jail and who had been later put in charge of one of the camps.  He called a halt by erecting little wooden huts at each town. Inside six months he had them all held up and interviewed them&mdash;they now had at least one friend left and he had 1,500,000 placed inside six months and the whole 2,000,000 placed inside nine months and they became very useful members of society.  The hoboes and train jumpers are just dying out.</P>
      <P>There was then the problem of the old Ford cars.  In Missouri there were 2,000 of them.  A man selling petrol there was very anxious to get rid of them and would give a quart of oil to get them on to the next town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those tramps on the roads here seem to have degenerated in the same way. They do not seem to bother very much about birth control.  I saw three generations of such children; they marry very young and breed like rabbits and consumption is unknown amongst them.  I remember a time when I had some five acres of potatoes to be picked and there was rain impending. I asked some of those men to come in but there was nothing doing. I heard one of the lads return from town later and his father said to him, as he had not had a successful day: &ldquo;I <Col N="1032" /> will make you go in there and pick spuds.&rdquo;  In the town of Cahir market day on a Friday is a gala day.  I was going in on the bus on a ten-mile journey one Saturday morning.  Seven of them got in and paid 9d. each to get into town. The return journey cost them 10/6. Their peregrinations around the town came to my notice.  I never saw a more drunken crowd leave it.  They created seenes and their language was terrible. I suggest to the Minister that the Roosevelt method might do something in the way of making such people useful citizens.  With regard to those people, their horses, mules and asses grazing on the road carry on their osculations with farmers' animals. Many diseases in animals may be traced to that.  Farmers consider it much better to give these people supplies of milk because otherwise they will go out at night and milk the cows.  The tinsmiths and the metal workers have practically ceased to exist.  These young boys and girls do not go to school and there is no earthly chance of doing anything with them.</P>
    <P>With regard to the birching system, Mr. Parnell got birching done away with in the British Army and gained great commendation for his efforts. It is a disgrace that birching should be permitted here.  I appeal to the Minister to take that power off the statute book.  If the youngsters cannot be chastised except by birching them then the world must be coming to an end.  It is extraordinary the number of bachelor Deputies who spoke on this Estimate.  We all know that married people with no families themselves are for ever giving advice to other people as to how they should rear their children.  I reared three boys myself&mdash;their mother died young &mdash;and I never laid a hand on one of them.  I do not agree with the saying &ldquo;spare the rod and spoil the child.&rdquo; When I was a youngster I got plenty of floggings from my parents, and I must say that they left a bitterness in me.  I think birching is a brutal thing.  The correct way to rear children is by precedent and example and birching should be done away with.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1033" /> There is another matter that I approach with some trepidation.  It is a matter in which I am deeply interested. I do not like being too personal, but I have a boyish memory of the Minister's father and mother.  I had the Minister in my arms when he was a youngster.  I would not like by word, deed or action to interfere with him.  Great compliments were paid to him last evening. He is certainly a gentleman&mdash;good hearted and good natured.</P>

      <P>I have a suggestion to make to him.  I have a friend in the glasshouse.  Owing to an attack of illness I was not able to travel to see him.  He is a glorious fellow.  His brothers and himself refused a pension. He is above price.  I do not say that pensions are a bribe, but he is a man of the highest ideals.  He has unhealed wounds on his body.  I know his brothers and sisters, and his aged father who is in a low state of health at the moment.  I know they would like to have this boy home, but they would not lower the flag.  I do not like to go too closely into the matter of the 345 who have been released or the 200 still to be released.  In the case of these men, would the Minister accept the will for the deed?  I suggest to him that a friendly Deputy or two from each area might interview them.  I do not think they should be asked to sign any bond.  I kneel down twice a day and say &ldquo;Peccavi&rdquo;.  I wonder do I mean it?</P>

      <P>Of course, I will. That goes without saying.  I am anxious to throw oil on troubled waters.  I think that a little heart of grace and consultation in the Cabinet might do wonders.  I think that these grand fellows are in the mood now, but there is no use in trying to get them to admit that they did wrong.  It would be just as well to give that a miss-in baulk, as we say in billiards.  We want <Col N="1034" /> those men out.  I believe that if they are let out they will be good citizens, and that the bulk of those who have been released have been fitting themselves in with the laws of the State. I think that the balance, if released, will do the same.  One of them, the son of a neighbour of mine, is out on parole at the moment in connection with the division of an estate.  As I have said, all those young fellows have fine ideals.  I think the Minister should approach the situation with a little boldness.  If he does, he will win out.</P>

      <P>As I said before, I am approaching this subject in fear and trepidation.  I am making suggestions that may help the Minister out. As a matter of fact all my folk are interested in those young fellows, and I believe they will be all right in the future if an amnesty is proclaimed. I remember as a youngster when Mr. Tom Clarke, Mr. James Egan and Mr. John Daly were released from jail.  It is the loss of liberty that is killing those men.  No matter how well treated a man may be in jail he feels the loss of his liberty.  An All-Ireland footballer, who spent a period in jail, as a result of an accidental occurrence following a football match, assured me of that, and he was one of the grandest characters I ever met.  I asked him what did he feel most&mdash;he was in Clonmel jail for 18 days&mdash;and he said he felt most the loss of liberty, the thought that he was there and could not get out.  These men have expiated any wrong they have done by the time they have spent in jail, and I think the time has come when the Minister should deal with them in a broad way.  I do not think he will have much cause to regret it.  May God guide him in arriving at a decision and I hope we will see those people out very soon.</P>

      <P>After all the very nice things that have been said about the Minister, I am rather hesitant to intervene in the debate, but I think it is <Col N="1035" /> only right and proper that from the Independent Benches there should come some tribute to the Minister's courage and sense of justice during his period of administration.  I understand a good many complimentary remarks were passed yesterday about the Minister's administration.  I want to add my quota.  The mamby-pamby stuff we have listened to about extending mercy to all those people who did not extend any mercy to the policemen they shot, or attempted to shoot, is the kind of stuff that has led up to the imprisonment of a lot of these young men.  We have a plea for clemency for them, but there was little or no sympathy expressed publicly in this House or outside it with the victims of those people.</P>
      <P>It is about time we began to think that, in this House, we should have some sense of responsibility.  We have not heard many people condemning the attacks on the instruments of law in this country, the armed attacks, the cowardly and brutal murders and assassinations, and there was no horror at all expressed in this House at these happenings.  There were no words of condemnation expressed here about the acts of these murder gangs. The Deputies on the benches over there know that as well as I do.  We have all this namby-pamby stuff, coaxing the Minister to let them out and trusting again to the leniency of the Minister.  It cannot be forgotten that the Minister, in his goodness and kindness, and soft-heartedness, if you like, did release a number of the prisoners.  What was the result? Some of them again conspired to undermine the institutions of the State and the result was the murder of one or two policemen here in Dublin.  There was not a word from people like the members of the Farmers' Party about the widows and orphans who were left behind as a result of these murders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to encourage the use of the birch, but I hope the Minister at some future date will look into the merits and the justice of administering the birch or the cat of nine tails to the garrotters and the robbers who attack undefended women at nighttime <Col N="1036" /> when they are on their way home, snatching their purses and bags and robbing them of whatever they possess. I feel that in cases of robbery with violence the only thing to strike terror into the heart of that class of ruffian would be to use the cat of nine tails or the birch.  That is the proper type of punishment to inflict upon those people.  I suggest that encouragement is being given to them by the type of speeches to which we have just listened.</P>
    <P>I was asked to deal with one case a few weeks ago.  The case is as follows: A young lad left Cork with the alleged intention of attending an All-Ireland Final.  He went across the Channel.  His people did not hear a word about it until six months afterwards, when they were informed by the British authorities that this boy had been sentenced to 20 years in jail. Subsequently the parents were informed that the boy was in a mental hospital.  The boy is still there and will remain in the mental hospital during His Majesty's pleasure, possibly for 18 or 20 years.  I asked the sister of that boy did she know the party or parties responsible for sending him across the Channel to throw bombs into railway stations, to put bombs into suitcases, to drop bombs into pillar boxes, thus bringing disgrace and discredit on this nation.  Those things were done in the name of the I.R.A.  I do not know if the I.R.A. were responsible, but those things were done in their name.  We have not heard a word of condemnation of these acts in the Dáil.  Instead, we have had a lot of namby-pamby stuff.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamFrancisODonne" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>We condemn them, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister's Department is doing its best and I know, because of the type of speech I have listened to, that there is a sort of terror abroad; people do not want to give the information necessary to put those persons in their proper place.  The people who sent that young boy to commit those crimes against society in England have a big responsibility.  That was not a national <Col N="1037" /> effort, although we had a paper in Dublin talking about &ldquo;our forces abroad&rdquo;.  We read about this alleged Irish army conducting the war against Britain, but we all know in our hearts and souls that that is so much tommyrot.</P>
      <P>Now we are told that the Minister should exercise clemency and let these people out of the jails.  I have very grave doubts if the authors of the outrages in England, the real people, the forces behind the throne, have been arrested in this country.  The Minister's Department should endeavour by every possible means to get at those people.  By &ldquo;every possible means&rdquo; I mean that, if necessary, they should go outside the various Acts of Parliament, <i>habeas corpus</i> and the rest of it, in order to put down this sort of ruffianism.  It can never be done if we have public men, and more especially members of the Dáil, telling the Minister to exercise further clemency and not treat these people as criminals&mdash; people who are exercising their brains and intellects to undermine the institutions of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take off my hat to the Minister for Justice.  He was in opposition at one time and, like his associates today, he then had little sense of responsibility. The Government in office then found it necessary to pass the Constitution (Amendment No. 17) Act, otherwise known as the Public Safety Act.  Later, when the present Government were first faced with responsibility, they began to realise the responsibilities of Government and they got to know the difficulty of government in this country.  Having realised that difficulty, they had to introduce even more penal legislation than the Constitution (Amendment No. 17) Act.  It takes a whole man to say: &ldquo;I was wrong once, but I am not going to be wrong a second time.&rdquo; That is why I salute the Minister for Justice.  He has shown determination and courage.  It takes a 100 per cent. man to say that he was wrong at one time when he opposed the Constitution (Amendment No. 17) Act and to admit that he did not know the extent of the ramifications of the organisations <Col N="1038" /> that were then, as well as now, trying to undermine the Government.</P>
    <P>I salute the Minister because of his method of administration.  I have the feeling that he is humane to the extent of 100 per cent.  In fact, his humanity in my view went too far.  I believe he has erred on the side of leniency and humanity 100 per cent. in the course of his administration.  I am very glad to notice that there is no question of referring this Vote back.  No matter what expense it may be, if you have not this Department administered in the one and only way you will never have peace or ordered government in this country.  If you want to cultivate the best sense of citizenship and to try to check that stampede from civic sense in the country, you will have, first of all, to support the Minister in his administration of justice, and it is the only way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is time that this House and the people generally should understand clearly the position in regard to the right of the Government to intern citizens without trial. This House has approved of the Emergency Powers Act which gives the Minister that power.  But it must be clearly understood, and I think the majority of Deputies understand, that men who are interned without trial are not being subjected to punishment for any offence which they have committed.  They are being kept in custody in order that the State may be safeguarded.  For that reason, the Minister should not be appealed to so much on the ground of clemency. He should be appealed to, if he is appealed to at all, to review carefully and at frequent intervals the position of each interned person, to find out whether or not that man can, with safety to the community, be released. That should be the first and most important consideration influencing the Minister's decision.  To allow himself to be swayed by appeals made by Deputies or by friends of internees or by anyone else on the ground that these men are suffering severely would be betraying the trust placed in him. These men are not being interned for the purpose of inflicting any punishment upon them.  They are being interned <Col N="1039" /> to safeguard the community, and the safety of the community should be the Minister's first consideration.</P>
      <P>Let there be no mistake about it, internment does inflict very considerable punishment upon these men, in spite of every effort which the Minister may make to prevent it, because the first objective of the Minister must be to ensure that these men will remain in custody, that they will not escape. In order to ensure that, he must restrict their liberty to a considerable extent.  He must also ensure that they cannot direct the operations of any organisation outside with which they are connected from within their prison walls and there again there must be a restriction on their means of communication with the outside world. Those things do imply a very severe hardship on the men interned and, for that reason, it is the duty of the Minister&mdash;and I think the Minister as a conscientious man realises it is his duty&mdash;to see that no man is retained in custody for one day longer than the safety of the community demands.</P>
      <P>It is very easy to make appeals to the Minister to put those men on trial. That point was raised by Deputy Connolly and other Deputies.  It is an appeal which would be popular.  But I think everyone who has considered this question realises fully the difficulty of securing an impartial trial in certain cases, particularly in the case of organised crime.  It was the experience of the United States when dealing with organised crime on a big scale that they could not secure convictions against the leaders in that campaign and, as a result, the State was almost brought into a condition of confusion and chaos.  If the Executive Government in the United States availed of the power of internment they would probably have broken the organised opposition to the law more speedily.  There is no alternative to giving the Executive Government the power to intern in certain cases, but we must ensure, as far as possible, that ample safeguards are provided to see that no real injustice is inflicted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be asked: what safeguards <Col N="1040" /> do we suggest.  I think that men who are interned are at least entitled to have their cases investigated by some form of visiting committee.  I do not know if the Minister has ever considered that question.  But I think there should be a committee appointed which would visit the internees, consult with these men, find out what is their attitude to life and to the law, find out whether their views in regard to the observance of the law and the duties of citizenship have changed in any way during the course of their internment. The Minister might ask how you would constitute such a committee, who would be the people to form such a committee.  First of all, as internment must have a certain serious effect upon the mental and physical health of such persons, such a committee should include a highly-qualified medical man.  Then, as a considerable number of the persons interned may be young and inexperienced, it is desirable that there should be also on the visiting committee some person who has been in the habit of dealing with the young, such as a teacher or a professor in one of our colleges or institutions; somebody who understands the mentality of young people and who could talk to them in language which they understand. Then, in order to ensure that there will not be political victimisation in the exercise of this power of internment, it would be desirable that on the visiting committee there should be some representatives of other political Parties besides the Government Party so as to safeguard the rights of the citizens and the rights of minority political Parties.  I have said that the right of internment, so far as I can ascertain, is justifiable, but I have also indicated to the Minister that he must see that that right is exercised judiciously.  He must see that it is not allowed to be prostituted into a tyranny which would seriously interfere with the rights of political minorities.  The Minister is a conscientious man, and I think he will take all aspects of this question into consideration.  I think he should set a headline to other Ministers who will come after him by providing certain safeguards for people who are interned. <Col N="1041" /> One of the safeguards which I have suggested, and which appeal very strongly to me, is a visiting committee to look into the case of each individual sympathetically and thoroughly.</P>
    <P>The Minister has under his control one of the most important forces under the authority of the State, that is our national police force.  He is charged with the duty of seeing that that force discharges its duties thoroughly and efficiently.  He is charged with the duty of seeing that its members are fairly treated.  I think that in the pre-war period, and particularly in the early stages of the life of our present police force, there was no very grave cause for complaint in regard to the remuneration of its members.  But since the emergency, since the abnormal increase in the cost of living, and since the natural increase in the expenses of members of the force with growing families, it is the duty of the Minister to re-examine the matter of their remuneration and see that it is adequate.  It is essential that members of a police force should be paid sufficient to ensure that they can maintain themselves and their families on a fairly decent standard without having to sink into debt, because nothing could be more undesirable than that members of the police force should have to seek credit from people with whom they have to deal in the enforcement of the law.  I am not satisfied that the present remuneration of the members of the Gárda is adequate during this emergency, and I think there is a case for reconsideration of the matter.</P>
    <P>Another question which arises at the present time, and which will become more important in the course of a few years, is the question of the recruitment to the Gárda.  Many compliments have been paid to the existing force.  Having regard to the circumstances under which the force was established, having regard to the fact that the force had to be started from scratch, and that practically the entire personnel were new men with no experience, it is extraordinary how efficiently and effectively they adjusted themselves to the maintaining <Col N="1042" /> of order in this country. There is no doubt that the present Gárda have set a fairly high standard for those who will come after them.  At the present time the number of vacancies in the force is extremely limited, and that situation will prevail for a few years to come.  After that, having regard to the fact that the entire force was recruited practically within the same year, there will be a large number of retirements.  I am putting it to the Minister that he should see that during the present year and the next few years the standard of qualifications for members of the force is raised to the highest degree.  If the number of vacancies is limited, and if, as I understand, the number of applicants for the force is large, it is the duty of the Minister to see that the best possible men are secured.</P>
    <P>I want to know what exactly is the position with regard to recruitment at the present time.  I understand that the Commissioner of the Gárda selects the candidates who are to sit for examination.  My information is that the Commissioner selects a very limited number of candidates.  If there are, say, 160 vacancies and the Commissioner selects, say, 180 or 190 candidates to sit for examination, we have the position that it is the Commissioner who is really making the selection of the members of the Gárda, and that they are not really selected by competitive examination, because the examination is confined to a very small number of candidates.  If that is the position, it is altogether wrong.  I hold that every candidate who fulfils the statutory qualifications for membership should be allowed to sit for examination. That is his right, and it is necessary in order to secure that the highest standard of qualifications, educational and physical, is obtained. To confine the number of candidates sitting for examination to a very small percentage of those who make application is preparing the way for favouritism on a very wide scale.  I am not suggesting political favouritism, but there may be favouritism of many other kinds which would be equally undesirable.  I am told that the number <Col N="1043" /> of candidates selected for examination is very little more than the number of vacancies.  Therefore, practically all who sit for examination can get through.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say what is the usual number of candidates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think in the beginning the number was about 2,000, but it has gone down very much lately. There were very few the last time, but the number was about 2,000 a few years ago.  There would be only about 100 vacancies at the time, and 2,000 applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that you might have 2,000 applicants for 100 vacancies I do not think the Commissioner would be justified in cutting down the number sitting for examination to barely twice the number of vacancies.  After the examination, I think there is a medical test, which might eliminate quite a considerable number, and it is hardly fair to cut down the number of candidates so drastically.  As a matter of fact, I think there should be very little restriction on the number who come forward for examination, because you have to get the best and I understand the educational test is not very stiff.</P>
      <P>I have a number of reasons for raising this matter.  First of all, there is, as I said, the danger of favouritism&mdash; the danger of the Commissioner being pulled or dragged by individuals seeking to advance the claims of particular candidates.  There is also a need during the next few years for the raising of the educational standard of members of the force.  It may not be possible to do so when the number of vacancies becomes great in the course of nine or ten years, but during the next five or six years I think a real effort should be made to get into the force men of the highest educational qualifications.  The Minister will realise that that is very desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter to which the Minister <Col N="1044" /> should give attention is the recruitment of a certain number of women police.  So far as I can gather from the Book of Estimates, there are only two or three women police in the force at present, and I think that number should be substantially increased so far as the large cities are concerned.  Women police would be more effective in dealing with various types of juvenile crime and in carrying out many of the other duties which devolve on members of the Gárda. Women, from their knowledge of their own sex and of children, would be best qualified to discharge these duties and the Minister ought to state the reason for the failure to increase the number of women police.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt whatever that the present position in regard to crime, both major and minor, is alarming. The fact that crime has not substantially increased this year as compared with last year is no reason for complacency on the part of members of the House, in view of the fact that crime was rampant in 1942 and was very substantially in excess of crime in the pre-war period.  While I consider that the position is sufficiently alarming to require the very earnest attention not only of the Minister and his Department but of members of the House, I am prepared to admit that there will always be a substantial increase in crime during war-time and allowance must be made for that fact. Nevertheless, while making due allowance for that fact, we must also take into consideration that, as emergency conditions become more difficult, there is always the danger that crime may become more rampant.  For that reason, it is the duty of the Minister not to allow himself to be lulled into a sense of complacency by the fact that the crime wave has been held, so to speak, during the past year, but to take ample and adequate precautions to see that, if emergency conditions become worse, the crime position will not also become much worse.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the main reasons for crime lie in the fact that people seek to obtain other people's property without going through the formality of earning it.  That is, and <Col N="1045" /> always has been, the main motive for crime, and, when supplies are short, it is inevitable that crime should increase. At the same time, adequate precautions must be taken to protect property and life, when necessary.  I have frequently suggested that the ordinary uniformed police cannot adequately deal with crimes against property, particularly at night, and that it is essential that all cities and large towns should be actively patrolled by plain-clothes men.  That would make the position of the would-be criminal much more difficult than it is when he has to deal only with the uniformed man on beat duty.  I have also suggested that these plain-clothes men should be provided with bicycles in order to enable them to do their patrols noiselessly and speedily and thus take would-be criminals off their guard.</P>
    <P>Another of the undesirable tendencies which are apparent to every Deputy is the growth of crime amongst juveniles, which has been dealt with by other Deputies.  There is, however, one aspect which has not been adequately stressed, that is, the growth of drinking amongst the younger generation.  It is a rather peculiar thing that, for a period pre-war, drinking amongst the young had very considerably declined.  It has, however, recurred on a large scale, and I believe that the facilities for drinking at dances have contributed in large measure to this undesirable increase.  It has often surprised me why more attention is not given to the enforcement of the law with regard to drinking by persons under the age of 18.  I know how difficult it is to enforce that law and, so far as I can gather from statistics in relation to one recent year, only one case of a person under age charged with drinking was brought into court.</P>
    <P>It is common knowledge that drinking by persons, both boys and girls, under 18 is extremely prevalent, and I want to know what steps the Minister is taking to deal with that evil. I am one of those who hold that the age of 18, in relation to this matter, is not sufficiently high, and I am one of those who tried to have the law in that respect amended, but, at least, <Col N="1046" /> the law as it stands should be rigidly enforced.  If the Minister takes the line that it is difficult to decide the age of persons engaged in drinking, I think it is his duty to find some means of surmounting that difficulty. I have often been inclined to think that the law in regard to drinking was somewhat lopsided.  It is the consumers and not the retailers of drink who should be licensed.  It is unjust to place the entire onus of finding a person's age and habitation entirely on the publican.  Sooner or later, regulations must be made to assist the members of the licensed trade in carrying out the law.  I would like to know if the Minister consulted the Gárdaí on that matter and if they had any suggestions to make.  It is certainly a criminal thing to have young boys and girls drinking excessively, particularly at dances and such amusements.</P>
    <P>In my constituency&mdash;Wicklow&mdash;an experiment is contemplated in regard to the attendance of young people at cinemas.  In Bray it is proposed to confine picture houses with the ordinary programmes to persons over a certain age.  That is a very desirable experiment and one to which the Minister should give very close attention. It is a reform which must inevitably be widely introduced.  Frequent attendance at cinema shows has a very deteriorating effect on the minds of young people, and it is absolutely impossible for them to attend picture houses night after night without having their entire mental outlook completely influenced.  In the majority of cases, these shows have a demoralising effect on them.  Certainly, they are not of a very edifying character for young people.  There is no reason why shows should not be provided at certain hours specially for young people.  In this respect, I would like to see steps taken to ensure that the programmes provided for young people are sufficiently attractive to leave no desire on the part of children to attend the adult shows.  I would also like to see their programmes sufficiently informative, attractive and amusing for adults.  Fathers, mothers, grown-up brothers and sisters often like to attend a matinee or other show <Col N="1047" /> in company with younger members of the family, so the programme should give a reasonable amount of entertainment to grown-up people.  That reform is long overdue and is one which should appeal to the Minister.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely necessary to ensure, in the post-war period, that the members of the Gárda Síochána will be adequately housed, under conditions which will not impose any extra cost on themselves or on the State.  In the housing schemes for Gárdaí, steps should be taken to see they are located convenient to the Gárda station, so that the men may be available always for the performance of their duty.  Owing to the shortage of houses at present, some Gárdaí have to reside at a great distance from the station and this seriously interferes with the efficiency of the police force.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night and to-day Deputies have been dealing with the administration of justice under the Minister.  I was very pleased to hear so many Deputies pay glowing tributes <Col N="1049" /> to the Minister for the manner in which he has conducted the administration of his Department since he took over office.  I even heard Deputy O'Donnell pay a tribute to the Minister such as I am sure no other Minister has ever received.  He said that when the Minister was a wee boy he nursed him in his arms.  It was very encouraging to hear all those nice fairy tales about the Minister in his youthful days.  This House, however, is not concerned with the activities of the Minister in his youthful days, but rather with his activities as Minister for Justice and with statements that he has made in this House since he was first elected a member of Dáil Eireann.  I am sorry that I cannot see my way to join with other members in throwing laurels at the Minister. Nevertheless, I will express my views on the manner in which, I think, the Minister has discharged his responsible duties.  As far as I am concerned, the Minister for Justice is the balance between the people and the State.  The Minister is supposed to exercise an honest independent discretion in all cases.  He is the balance between the people and the law.  As far as I know the Minister, he just signs on the line. I am going to give the House some information that I have been anxious to give it since I was first elected a member.  I want to ask the Minister to make a public denial of one serious accusation that I am going to make against him.  If he does not deny it, then let him admit it.  If he does, I will say that I have done a good day's work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the 23rd June last, when I was first elected to this House, I have been endeavouring to put down questions asking information on this same subject, but as fast as I put them down they were ruled out.  I was told that I could raise the matter on the Estimate for the Minister's Department. I hope that the Minister will have the courage of his convictions and either deny the serious allegation that I am going to make against him or admit it. While I cannot pay tribute to the Minister on certain issues, I must definitely say that he has a very good and efficient staff in his office.  I have <Col N="1050" /> had occasion, time and again, to approach the Minister, his private secretary and others under his control, and as far as the office is concerned I have no complaints to make.  I have, however, certain complaints to make as far as the administration of justice is concerned.  The first complaint I have to make is in connection with the political prisoners.  I cannot for the life of me see why this State should have unfortunate men behind prison bars without trial.  If the Minister cannot see his way to release them will he consider establishing a board which will deal with individual cases and report to him as to whether those people should be released or otherwise? I am told that such a board has been established in Northern Ireland and in England: that those who are interned in both places have the right of appeal to have their cases dealt with by an independent board.  We have no such appeal board here.  We have these poor, unfortunate men simply, I suppose, because of their political outlook, locked up behind prison bars.  I say that is a disgrace.</P>
    <P>I do not want the House to get the impression that I would be inclined to defend criminals because I would not.  I am quite well aware that we must have law and order.  Every country must have some law and order, but those men&mdash;I refer to the police&mdash;whom the Minister has under his charge for the carrying out of this law and order have, on very many occasions, abused the authority they have been given.  During the election campaign, and afterwards in this House, the Minister told us that those men have the key in their own hands: that if they want to go out they can. Some of them have been released.  I do not see all those political prisoners using the key.  As I have said, I can not see why they should be there without trial.  Many of them, I believe, are suffering from T.B. as a result of the conditions that exist in the camps in the Curragh and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Minister has even refused Deputies permission to see them. When I made representations to visit some of my own constituents that are on the Curragh I was refused.  I <Col N="1051" /> would like to see those people, to talk to them, to see what their state of health is and the conditions under which the Minister and his Department are forcing them to exist during their period of internment.  I have been told that a great number of the men released recently by the Minister are definitely carriers of T.B., which they contracted as a result of their term in prison.  I believe there are men that he has interned who are definitely suffering from a serious breakdown in health and from T.B.  I cannot see why the Minister will not give those individuals the right to have their cases heard in court, or the right to make an appeal to some board in order to secure justice.  I know from my own experience that there is any amount of law in this country; we have piles of law, heaps of it, but there is not an ounce of justice in any of that law.  There is a terrible difference between law and justice.</P>
    <P>Within the past few days I went over the Official Reports and I find that our present Minister for Justice, on the 18th November, 1927, intervened during a discussion on the trial of Edmund O'Reilly, who was charged with the murder of a Civic Guard&mdash;the case that Deputy Anthony referred to. We have been asked are we defending the murderers of Civic Guards&mdash;the people who appealed for the release of Republican prisoners.  I do not think anyone would dream of appealing for the release of any man who was proved to be a murderer, because we are for law and order, but we are appealing on behalf of men who have had no trial; we suggest that they should get a fair trial, the type of trial every citizen is entitled to.  On the occasion I have referred to, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think this treatment is intended to break this young man, who is one of the best that ever stood in this country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is what the Minister said about an individual who was being tried for murder in 1927.  I will go a little further with the quotations.  On the 14th March, 1928, the Minister asked <Col N="1052" /> for an independent investigation into prison conditions.  The Minister has complete control over the prisons now and we merely ask him to do what he wished for in 1928&mdash;have an independent investigation into prison conditions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connolly last night raised a very important point when he referred to Portlaoighise Prison.  There the prisoners are treated the very same as slaves are treated in darkest Africa.  I am quite satisfied they are not being fairly treated and the Minister will not allow myself, Deputy Davin, Deputy O'Higgins, Deputy Boland or Deputy Gorry to look into the conditions of the prisoners.  We are told that there are prisoners in Portlaoighise who did not hear Mass for the last three years. Who is responsible for that?  Is it the Minister's Department?  Why does not the Minister, when he is in a position to do it, implement what he demanded in this House on the 14th March, 1928&mdash; an investigation into prison conditions?</P>
    <P>On the 21st March, 1928, the Minister, dealing with a particular case, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;My friend, Ned O'Reilly&mdash;I would not like to hear the Minister call him a criminal, anyhow.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the statement the Minister made here.  I have known the Minister to refer to political prisoners as criminals. They were never tried and the crime was never proved.  They were never brought into court.  I will go further in giving quotations from our Minister for Justice.  On the 23rd March, 1928, referring probably to the I.R.A., he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am convinced that it is the continual hunting down of these men that has kept the organisation going and is still giving reason for carrying it on.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I would not be afraid of a general election in the morning. Those are the statements the Minister made and I put those statements that he made when he was on this side of the House against the statements he makes to-day.  On the 7th June, 1928, the Minister spoke about arrests, including the arrest of a lady who was in jail in 1943.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The right man is up to answer, a Castle hack.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He was referring to Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney. He described Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney as a Castle hack.  He is a greater Castle hack himself than Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney ever was, and Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney certainly was a Castle hack.  I say the Minister is twice as big a one.</P>

I wonder are those dangerous criminals still in the service of the Department; and, if not, will the Minister tell us when he got rid of the dangerous criminals?  If they are still in the Department the Minister will not have very much to say for his police force.  If there were dangerous criminals in the Department since he took over office, and if they have not been put out, then they must still be there.  Probably I have refreshed the Minister's memory with regard to statements made by him long ago.  I think it is only right for us to have this comparison in order that we may look back upon it.

      <P>I will not go back as far as I was going.  I shall only go back as far as 1941.  When going through some old papers, I discovered the report of a case in the <i>Evening Herald</i> of 2/10/41, in which an ex-British soldier or an ex-secretary of the British Legion in Cavan pleaded guilty to having aided and abetted soldiers to desert the Irish Defence Forces and enter another force.  The sentence imposed in this case was two months in <Col N="1056" /> prison.  Two months' imprisonment for using his influence with members of the Irish Army probably to get them sent to the British Army.  Side by side with that we have the case of a person charged before the Central Criminal Court with conspiracy to obstruct the Government, receiving ammunition, possession of firearms, etc.  This accused person stated in the court that at no time had he conspired against the Government.  He swore that he had never conspired against the Government and that he never had firearms to endanger any man's life or property.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The court could draw its own conclusion as to where the stuff was going and how it was being used. This person, although it was not proved against him, got ten years' penal servitude, as reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 22/8/40.  The gentleman who succeeded in getting members of the Irish Army into a foreign army only got two months in jail and an Irishman got ten years' penal servitude because he was supposed to have firearms.  I cannot see very much justice in that.  Probably the court drew its own conclusions. But, from reading the papers, the general public would be under the impression, when such cases are compared, that justice did not go as justice should go.  In the <i>Irish Press</i> of the 17th February, 1943, in a square in the front page there appeared the following: &ldquo;Nearly 13,000 Indian nationalists in jail&rdquo;.  They would want to put 65,000 in jail before the internees would be in the same proportion to the population as our internees here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to make any further reference to the political prisoners except to ask the Minister to consider the establishment of a board so that these men will get an opportunity of proving their innocence, because I am convinced that every man in this country has a right to see that the State gives him a fair and honest trial. I am convinced that these individuals have not got a fair and honest trial and that they have not been sentenced <Col N="1057" /> in accordance with justice.  I ask the Minister to establish what the British Government and the Ulster Government have established, a board for the purpose of having each internee's case investigated.</P>
    <P>I would be very glad if the Minister would indicate the reasons why members of the Gárda Síochána are following around a well-known citizen of this State in Cork&mdash;Mr. Joseph Kearney of Youghal.  This gentleman appears to be definitely victimised, because every place he goes members of the Gárda are after him.  Would the Minister give some information as to why the Guards are continually after this man?  What has the Minister up his sleeve, what have the Guards up their sleeve, and what are they following him for?  He wrote several times to the Department asking why the Guards were following him, but he does not seem to have got a satisfactory reply and I would be glad if the Minister could give us some information about his case.</P>
    <P>Dealing with the Gárda Síochána, I wonder has the Minister or his Department seen a statement published in <i>The Leader</i>, which I understand is edited by a former Minister.  <i>The Leader</i> states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is said that there is a black sheep in every flock.  There has never yet been a police force anywhere some odd members of which did not, sooner or later, appear in the dock to answer criminal charges. Therefore, it is not, in itself, alarming that an occasional member of the Civic Guard should leave the straight and narrow path and end up by being sentenced to a term of imprisonment.  Nevertheless, it is widely believed that our police force has, in recent years, come to have rather more than the unavoidable minimum number of members who are not quite all that they should be.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The article goes on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We could, moreover, point to areas in which, to judge merely by appearances, practically every Guard seems to take a good deal too much drink and in which it is common <Col N="1058" /> knowledge that in some favoured public houses Guards sit drinking long hours after closing hours.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder did the Minister see that? This paper is edited, I understand, by a former member of this House.  We were satisfied many years ago that the Civic Guards would run into a very difficult period when they had been some 15 or 20 years in existence.  I wonder has this paper been brought to the notice of the Minister and is he aware of the manner in which members of the Gárda Síochána abuse the authority that is vested in them.  I would like the Minister, or the Commissioner, or whoever is responsible for recruiting members of the Gárda Síochána, to give first preference to temperate men.  I would nearly go as far as compelling them to be sober men.</P>

      <P>I know very well that incidents have taken place, and I am sorry to say that in some areas the Gárdaí are standing around street corners waiting to see who will give them a drink.  I have that experience. I must admit that there are other men in the Gárda Síochána who are as satisfactory in the discharge of their duties as any man could meet anywhere. In the County of Laoighis there is a certain sergeant of the Guards who exposed one of the greatest crimes in the history of the county.  He was one man who did his duty and did it well.  He is a credit to the Gárda Síochána.  He discovered that in the County of Laoighis the poor were being badly treated; that they were being robbed, right, left and centre.  He did what any good officer of the law should do: he brought on the case, I am told, even against the wishes of the superintendent.  That sergeant of the Guards was up against a tough position in his district.  A certain prominent Fianna Fáil officer in County Laoighis came down to the village of Clonaslee and said&mdash;those are the exact words this gentleman used&mdash;&ldquo;I am after being in Athlone, at an L.D.F. meeting, and I saw Jerry there.&rdquo;  That is the way he described the Minister <Col N="1059" /> for Justice, he knew him so well.  He said he had made arrangements for the transfer of that sergeant of the Civic Guards.  That officer was a well-known member of Fianna Fáil in my own constituency.  I want the Minister to deny that that man made representations to him about the transfer of the sergeant of the Civic Guards, or else to admit it.  Political spite was used against that sergeant of the Guards because he exposed a crime against the poor of that constituency.  If I had my way I would give that sergeant promotion, but my information is that the Minister was approached by a member of his own organisation to get him shifted before he would expose anything else.  Will the Minister say that he met this gentleman in Athlone&mdash;the gentleman who is going around the county giving the impression that he knows &ldquo;Jerry&rdquo; so well that he can get the Guards shifted to any part of the country?</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister to say whether he met this gentleman, so that I may be in a position to go down to my constituents and say: &ldquo;That man is telling lies.  The Minister stated in the House that he does not know him.&rdquo;  I should also like to ask the Minister for Justice, through you, Sir, if the general public are likely to be inspired with confidence in the administration of justice in this State when they see the superintendent of the Gárda Síochána, the State solicitor, and the district justice, having &ldquo;a confab&rdquo; in the district pending a serious criminal charge?  The people are apt to be very suspicious when they see the justice who is going to try the case, the State solicitor and the superintendent of the Civic Guards having a big discussion in a certain Guard's barracks quite convenient to the district.  Did the Minister ever inquire as to what they were talking about?  He knows about the matter, because I think I have drawn his attention to it already.  I made it my business to find out what they were <Col N="1060" /> talking about.  They were discussing the very case I raised here to-day in connection with the Laoighis County Council.  That is what they were talking about.  Influence was being used with the district justice by a high officer of the Gárda Síochána.  I understand that, as a result of reports made to the Minister for Justice, when the trial came off it was not the judge whom the officer of the Gárda Síochána had tried to influence that was sent down; it was an independent judge.  I must give the Minister credit for that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I made them outside the House, too.  If an inquiry were held, and if those men were on oath, the statements which I am making here would be borne out.  Influence was used to try to cloak a criminal charge.  If the people are to have confidence in the administration of justice I think the Minister will have to carry out a good deal of tightening up in his Department.  I remember <Col N="1061" /> during the election campaign when I went into a certain town in County Laoighis, representations were made to the Minister by, I am told, a well known banker in this country.  I was one of the men who signed a communication sent to this banker, accusing bankers and other gentlemen of being responsible for unemployment, poverty, and emigration, by their corrupt banking system.  I am told that that banker wrote a letter to our illustrious Minister saying: &ldquo;Please give me protection against those gentlemen.&rdquo;  Immediately, the Minister took up the case with the Gárda Síochána in the district concerned and, just as I had attended the funeral of a neighbour in Mountmellick, I had the Guards down to me to make a statement.  The Minister for Justice had come along to give this banker protection.  What protection did the banker need in regard to hearing the truth?  Did the Minister see the communication which I addressed to the banker?  If he saw it, or if he read it, perhaps he will indicate to the House why he should issue instructions to the Gárda Síochána to take statements from the individuals who signed that document. The Minister and the banker knew quite well that the document was not of a very serious nature, that we only told the truth in it, but we see how quickly the Minister took up all the weapons of the Department of Justice to defend Sir John Keane.</P>
      <P>One other matter which I want to deal with is whether the Minister's Department have received any report as to a man with eight young children having lately been thrown out of his employment with Columbia Pictures Corporation, Ltd., Dublin; whether representations have been made from any quarter about the manner in which this gentleman was forced to become one of the unemployed; and whether he is aware that the gentleman who stepped into his shoes the following morning was none other than Mr. Jay, <i>alias</i> Jacobs?</P>

      <P>I have got my point in.  I want to refer now to a meeting which I addressed during the election campaign in the town of Mountrath. I went down to that part of my constituency as a candidate during the last election and the Gárda Síochána canvassed tooth and nail against me. Is the Minister aware of that?  The Minister then says that there are no politics in the Gárda Síochána.  I am told that a member of the Gárda sent an interrupter to break up my meeting.</P>

That Civic Guard never took his back away from the wall&mdash;he just laughed.  The sergeant of the Guards in Mountrath then came up, and as a man who knew his duty, immediately removed the interrupter, and I believe gave the Guard &ldquo;the works&rdquo; for not doing so.</P>

      <P>I placed these facts before the Minister and gave the Minister proof of strong political influence having been used against me by members of the Gárda Síochána, but the Minister did not seem to be worried about it, and no action whatever was taken.  The Minister said on one occasion in this House: &ldquo;We want to see that everybody gets freedom of speech,&rdquo; and I think that if Dáil Éireann is the democratic institution it should be, every person, no matter what his political outlook may be, should be allowed to express his views. The Minister once referred to the I.R.A. and asked why that organisation did not come out in public, place its cards on the table and put its views before the people.  I must admit that I had no connection with the I.R.A., and yet because I came out in public, and in a democratic manner put my views before the people, I was hounded around the country by the Minister's touts, the Gárda Síochána.  The Minister in reply to a Parliamentary Question recently said that he was not prepared to interfere with the action taken by the Guards.  Does the Minister know that the circular which was issued requesting members of the Gárda Síochána to attend my meetings was not issued by the chief superintendent, but that advantage was taken of the absence, through illness or otherwise, of the chief superintendent by a political adventurer, the superintendent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I bow to your ruling, Sir.  Is the Minister aware that the gentleman responsible for the issuing of that circular was a well-known supporter of the Government?  I understand that when this individual had complete control, in the absence of a decent man, the chief superintendent, he took a mean advantage of the position and sent his circular around.  The Minister has not taken any steps to withdraw that order, and, what is <Col N="1064" /> more, says that he will not do so.  He further said that there would be no need for the order if Deputy Flanagan used language which was suitable.  I want to know what language I used that was not suitable.  It may have been strong, but I am convinced that the Minister, in his day, used stronger language than any I ever used.  We had a member of this House who went so far as to advocate war for this country.  He was allowed to go scot free.  I wonder do any Guards or other members of the force attend Deputy Dillon's meetings in his constituency.</P>

How can the Minister say that Dáil Eireann is a democratic institution when he will not allow candidates to express their honest views in public?  I would be pleased if the Minister would see his way to withdraw the circular.  If he does not, I might as well be quite frank and say that I do not care, because my meetings will go on just the same.

      <P>The Minister is trying to back out of it now, but the taxpayers of Offaly will not stand for any more of this squandermania.  It is most unfair that a Deputy should be prohibited from expressing his views.</P>
      <P>Before concluding, I wish to make reference to the censorship of letters. Deputy Davin, my colleague from Laoighis-Offaly, made reference to that last night.  Certain documents are being censored at the present time and the information is being used for political purposes.  I am sure Deputy Davin could prove that.  I know cases of it in the city.  Communications are coming to me as a responsible Deputy &mdash;whether I am responsible or irresponsible, I am representing the constituency; that is a matter for the intelligence of the electorate&mdash;and, assuming that my correspondence is opened, is it not a nice thing that the information coming from my closest supporters will be put at the disposal of those who canvassed against me in the constituency?  How is that to react against me, if such is the case?</P>
      <P>The Minister is instructing these men, and I would like information as to the procedure in regard to the censorship of internal correspondence. Who is the principal censor dealing with such correspondence?  What is the procedure followed?  On whose instructions is correspondence opened? Of course, the Minister gives the instructions, but we would like to hear a little more about it.  These charges are of a very serious nature, and the Minister would be wise to clear the air when he is replying.  I join in the statement made by Deputy Davin last night, that the information is definitely used for political purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to see that members of the Gárda Síochána <Col N="1066" /> are provided with houses in the different areas.  In every town where we have a Gárda barracks with five or six members of the force, the State should provide suitable accommodation. They should not have those men looking for and getting houses from county managers which were intended for labouring men.  It is an appalling state of affairs to see Gárdaí living in houses erected by local authorities and see the labouring men entitled to them under the various Acts deprived of them.  It is the duty of the State to see that houses are provided for the Gárdaí.</P>
    <P>Deputies have referred to late dances and drinking at dances.  I must admit that I never danced a step in my life and do not intend to do so. I never go to dances, except perhaps an odd social function to which I get an invitation.  At the same time, I am satisfied that dances are ideal recreation for rural areas.  I am not opposed to the late hours, but I am definitely opposed to the drinking at dances.  I will be glad to see the Minister introduce legislation to prohibit the granting, at any district court, of a licence for a bar at any dance.  I have seen young men neglecting their work, and even neglecting their religious duties, because of dances the night before, when they were under the influence of drink.</P>
    <P>It is a shame that certain dance halls should be conducted in that way.  It is all right to go to a dance for amusement, but no such thing as drink should be allowed&mdash;I am one hundred per cent. opposed to it.  I am sure no one would object to a mineral bar, to teas or lemonade refreshments; but I strongly oppose the ordinary bars at all-night dances.  In regard to the long hours, I do not care if the dances go on all night, nor do I think the Minister should worry about that.  It would be much better to see the young people amuse themselves in a dance hall than that they should be out in the hedges afterwards.</P>
    <P>In regard to film censorship, I have seen some films shown here which are one hundred per cent. anti-national and make a laugh and a skit of the Irish people.  Many of these <Col N="1067" /> British productions to which we all flock, thinking we will hear <i>The Lakes of Killarney</i> or <i>Galway Bay</i>&mdash;which do not make a skit of the &ldquo;wild Irish&rdquo;&mdash;are very damaging to youth. There should be a different performance&mdash;something of an educational nature&mdash;for children, instead of showing them how to draw a gun.  Some special pictures should be provided for the young folk.</P>
    <P>I would like to know if the Minister has jurisdiction over courthouses.  I understand that, through the District Court clerk, the courthouses are looked after by the Minister's Department.  I would like to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that, at a meeting of Laoighis County Council, some time ago it was proposed, seconded and adopted unanimously that, on the day of each meeting of the council, the National Flag be flown from the County Courthouse, Port Laoighise. The resolution was sent to the Department of Justice and the secretary of the county council has since made representations on the matter, but no reply has been given.  We have been told that the letter was sent to the county registrar.  I have also been informed that the county registrar objected to the National Flag being flown from Laoighis County Council offices on the day of the council's meetings.  It is a strange state of affairs if we have our own native Irish Government prohibiting the display of the National Flag.  I would be glad if the Minister would look into that matter, to see if he got the resolution and if the reply the county registrar gave was as I have stated.  I must admit that I did not propose the resolution, but I have been asked by other members of the council to draw the Minister's attention to it.</P>
    <P>I received a letter this morning from Westmeath and I must pass it over to some of the Westmeath Deputies.  It says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am a Civic Guard's wife, and on behalf of the womenfolk I am making a special appeal to you.  I wonder would you ever raise the matter of the Guard's weekly pay at <Col N="1068" /> the first opportunity in the Dáil.  It is impossible to believe what the effect of the present monthly pay has on the married members of the force.  You see we have to wait 31 days for our pay, and then the last part of it goes into the grocer's book when we get it.  On every item he enters 3d. or 4d.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I will not continue to read it further. Probably there is a lot in the contents of that letter.  It comes from the wife of a Civic Guard in the County Westmeath. I do not propose to disclose the name.  I wonder would it be possible for the Minister to arrange weekly pay for the members of the Gárda Síochána?  Probably it would be a great inconvenience in the Department, but if it is practicable or possible, I wonder would he consider it?  We know that at the present time it is very inconvenient for the housewife to get groceries and the other provisions to keep the house going, and then when the month's cheque comes in to find that the greater part of it has to go to pay the grocer's bill.  I would be glad if the Minister could arrange, if not to make the payments weekly at least to make them fortnightly. During the emergency we all know that a man wants his week's pay at the end of his week's labour.  Could the Minister see his way to do something not for the sake of the Civic Guards themselves but for the sake of their wives and families?  On this occasion I do not propose to say anything further on the Estimate.</P>
    <P>I have made some very grave statements here in connection with the transfer of a sergeant at Clonaslee in the County Laoighis.  I hope to be in the House when the Minister is replying to see if he will deny speaking to this Fianna Fáil henchman who knows him so well that he calls him &ldquo;Jerry.&rdquo; Why, even Deputy O'Donnell who had the Minister in his arms when he was a little boy would not go that far.  I am anxious to hear what the Minister has to say about this gentleman in the Fianna Fáil organisation who was at the convention in Athlone where he said that he had met &ldquo;Jerry&rdquo; and would arrange for the transfer of the sergeant.  That makes a bad impression <Col N="1069" /> on the public.  I would be glad if the Minister would take the opportunity of dealing with that.</P>

      <P>We had some sensible speeches on this Estimate and some very sloppy ones also.  We cannot ignore the background of history in this country during the past 20 years and leave any loophole for gunmen who think they are going to have a good time here.  Thanks to the courage of the Minister for Justice, we have fairly decent peaceable conditions at the moment.  Some of those gentlemen have found that it is not a paying proposition to defy the law.  We had some &ldquo;molly coddle&rdquo; speeches about the poor unfortunate men who, we were told, are locked behind prison bars. We were not, however, told about the many lonely graves that there are all over the country, of superintendents and other members of the Gárda, as well as the many honest decent citizens who were foully done to death by members of this organisation.  I know very well that there are some innocent men behind prison bars.  The innocent suffer with the guilty.  If there is any man behind prison bars on the Curragh there is nothing to prevent him being released.  It rests with himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there is great room for constitutional republicanism in this country.  I have always held the opinion that things will never be right until we have a healthy constitutional republican party in the country.  This country will never be at peace until the Six Counties have been restored to the motherland.  In my opinion, we must have clean, healthy, constitutional republicanism.  The Minister's strong and firm attitude has forced those men away from the gun and has brought them on to the platform.  If they come on the platform as honest, decent men and put a proper programme <Col N="1070" /> before the people, I will be prepared to speak from the same platform with them myself.  But, when speaking about them, I would like to see fair play all round.</P>
    <P>I knew many grand young men who were in the Guards&mdash;superintendents and others&mdash;who were foully done to death.  I know the circumstances in which their widows and children or their mothers were left.  When an appeal is made to release men something ought to be said about the many lonely graves that there are all over the countryside.  It is my belief that it is not the I.R.A. who are a danger in this country but the flood of money that is coming in through Nazi-ism and Communism.  There is not the slightest doubt but that the kind of work that has gone on here during the last six or eight years has been fostered and fed by the flood of money that has been coming in from Russia and Germany.  Our young fellows fell for that money and did the dirty work for those nations.  At the present moment there is great need to find out what is the position with regard to Communism in this country. Is it a fact that there are live active cells ready and eager for the day when they can do the foul work that they have done in other countries?  I have it on fairly good authority that there is in this House an active member of the Communist Party.  I think that the Irish people, whatever their past, were false to the true traditions of Ireland when they elected an avowed Communist, an anti-God who was trained in Russia in all the dirty anti-God&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is the real danger that I see in this country.  In a debate last night a good many speakers referred to the harm done by the pictures and the dance halls. I think that Deputy Linehan struck <Col N="1071" /> the nail on the head when he said that there are two major problems before this country: one its economic condition and the other the lack of parental control.  It is perfectly true to say that you require sound economic conditions to provide houses and work for our people at constant wages.  I hold with Deputy Linehan that it is not the Guards or any other institution that is going to put our people on the right track.  You need parental control to do that.  There is far too much laxity in many homes. You have too many young people falling by the wayside, and the cause of that in many cases is that they did not get a good whipping in their early days.  If some young girls see others going around with blackened eyebrows and red on their lips and walking the streets late at night, they must follow their example.  Their parents should exercise more control over them.  If they got a good whipping when they did anything wrong it would help to correct many of the things that Deputies have complained of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Think of the way the teachers of the country are handicapped.  If a teacher, in the exercise of his rightful duty, spanks a schoolboy then, as Deputy Linehan said, the parents will be off to take out a summons against him and he is brought into court. The result of that is, teachers are inclined to take the line of least resistance and will not slap young fellows when they deserve it.  As regards the Civic Guards, I hold that we have a magnificent force in this country.  I am not going to say that it is as good a force as it was four or five years ago.  It is, however, the mainstay of peace in the country.  At the moment it may be a lackadaisical force.  I do not blame the members of it for that. They have many grievances and feel very sore over them.  At the moment the Guards have to play second fiddle to other organisations.  I hold that unless the Guards are regarded as the superior and over-all force in this country, we cannot expect law and order to be enforced as it should be. I do not believe in this thing of having <Col N="1072" /> military or semi-military organisations taking over control from the police.  At the present time the police would appear to have no duties.  They are more or less like messenger boys to other organisations and that is unfair.</P>
    <P>I know some good sergeants, men who suffered in prison camps, and they told me their grievances.  They were asked to go to a lecture hall and give lectures on detective duties and how to detect crime to men who they knew were criminals and robbers.  I am sorry to say that some of these men are members of the L.S.F.  I regard that force as a brilliant and patriotic force.  But to ask a sergeant or superintendent of the Gárda to give lectures to men who, to their knowledge, are potential criminals, is very unfair. Any men who are to be passed as super-detectives should be selected for their character and ability to go straight.  It is very unfair to ask the Guards to play second fiddle to any organisation.</P>
    <P>I hold that Gárda duties are not being carried out in the same manner as in other years.  I am aware that the Guards are willing to do their duty, to patrol the country and protect the property of the people and try to put down crime, but at the present time they are merely messenger boys.  I suggest that the L.S.F. be taken away from the duties of Civic Guards and allow the Guards to carry out their duties as of old.  That is a great cause of trouble among the Gárda to-day.</P>
    <P>Another important matter is the provision of suitable housing for married Gárda.  This matter has been delayed unnecessarily.  There is no question about it, the Gárdaí must be properly housed.  Some scheme should be devised so that suitable houses will be erected convenient to the barracks. I know many Guards who are obliged to live down old lanes and boreens in thatched houses, somewhat like wigwams, because they cannot get a decent house convenient to the barracks. It is about time we gave them proper housing facilities.  They should be within easy reach of the barracks in case they are needed during the night. The Minister cannot expect the police <Col N="1073" /> to be attentive to their duties if they are obliged to live in country lanes in houses little better than wigwams.</P>
    <P>We have heard a good deal about drunkenness.  There is a fair amount of drinking, but that has happened in every period of Irish history.  When money is plentiful, drink will be taken, perhaps, to excess, but I was horrified to hear Deputy Cafferky saying that it was something appalling to observe the drinking that is going on in Mayo.  He said that the people there were absolutely drunken and sodden, and that there was one case of a father, mother and youngsters of 14 and 15 years getting drunk.  That is a terrible accusation and, if it is a fact, what will become of my county, where hundreds of migrants from Mayo are arriving day after day?  I hold that the men who came from Mayo in the past were decent, hardworking, sober men, but if those who are left in Mayo are the drunken, sodden lot that Deputy Cafferky said, then God save us from them.  I hope that other Deputies from Mayo will take part in this debate and will either support or deny that statement.  It is a terrible accusation, and if Ireland is in the wretched, degrading position that a man cannot cross the road without staggering from drink, then God save us from ourselves.</P>
    <P>I agree there is a great deal of petty larceny.  There are many small thefts all over the country, and it is very hard to detect the criminals.  If the Guards were allowed to carry out their duties as in the past this type of crime would cease.  The Guards cannot carry out their duties because they are too much restricted.  We regard the Guards as the custodians of the people, and it is upon them we depend for freedom from crime.  You will always have a crime wave in every country when there is a war on and when money is plentiful.  The crime wave here will ease off when money is less plentiful.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy misquoted me.  What I said was that the only occasion I ever had to hang my head when outside this country was when I came in contact with a drunken <Col N="1074" /> Irishman.  By that statement I did not suggest that all Irishmen who leave this country are drunkards.  In making that statement I was asking the Minister to consider the question of allowing drink to be sold at dance halls, and I suggested that by doing so he is endangering the peace.  I am surprised at Deputy Giles trying to misinterpret my statement and suggest that I said that Irishmen as a whole are drunkards.  I said no such thing, and the Deputy knows that very well, but he has taken a rotten opportunity deliberately to try to misinterpret my statement, knowing that I had no intention of saying anything like that. The Deputy should look up the official report and see what I did say.</P>

He will go to the dances and he will not have the courtesy to ask a girl to dance; he will pull her out, or haul her away from another fellow. It is not the duty of the Guards to deal with that type of thing.  That is a case where civic responsibility comes in.  A decent, hardy Irishman would give that type of fellow a crack on the jaw.  I have seen it done.  That type of drunken lout will go 20 or 30 miles <Col N="1075" /> to a dance, and he will be there Sunday after Sunday, and as long as he is allowed to get away with it he will do the dirty on everybody, but I know of some cases where he ran up against stone walls&mdash;and he never forgot it.</P>
      <P>There is too much crawling and cringing and too much cowardice. There are men looking at criminals stealing bicycle tyres, stealing poultry out of farmers' yards, but they are too cowardly to go to the police court or give evidence.  If Irishmen and Irishwomen were prepared to give evidence all this wave of crime would come to an end.  After 700 years of toil and trouble we have a free country with free administration and justice.  What are we afraid of?  What are we crawling and cringing for?</P>
      <P>We have heard the cry here to-day: &ldquo;Let out the poor devils who are behind bars, the fellows who have done nothing.&rdquo;  All over the country there are hundreds of green graves containing the rotting bodies of young men who fought a good fight.  Let us remember what they sacrificed their lives for. Let us do our duty in a manly fashion, even if we have to die in the attempt. Let us have clean, healthy administration. Let us stand shoulder to shoulder in an Ireland free from shore to shore. Let us do our utmost to get out of the mess we find ourselves in to-day.</P>

      <P>I am more or less forced to my feet by the last speaker because of references he made to migrants from my county coming to County Meath in connection with references which were made to drunkenness in the County Mayo yesterday evening by Deputy Cafferky.  I think that in debates of this kind there should be some element of truth in statements made by Deputies who hold that they have some responsibility as Deputies.  I cannot see the wisdom of Deputies putting on the records of this House, which are there for all time, and which are there to be quoted in foreign newspapers against the Irish, statements that would give the impression all over the world that the <Col N="1076" /> man in the West of Ireland is the Playboy of the Western World, the usual typical drunkard that enemies of Ireland would like to think he is.  It is a recorded fact that there is less drunkenness in Aran than ever before. It is also a recorded fact that the consumption of drink has gone down considerably in recent years.  It is also a recorded fact that in our courts there are less prosecutions for drunkenness than there have been for quite a long time.  I think there is a lower record of prosecutions for drunkenness than ever before.  When that is the case, I regret very much that Deputy Cafferky gave the impression by his statements in this House that in Mayo, in particular, drunkenness has been the order of the day, or rather that drinking has been the order of the day.</P>

      <P>My recollection is that the Deputy said that the fathers and mothers were accompanied by these young people of 12 and 14 years, but that these children were not drinking and, unless it is a copy of the Official Report, I do not want the Deputy to misinterpret the statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mícheál Ó Cléirigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it in as an exact copy.  In case I might be accused of misconstruing it, I went to the trouble, which Deputies are entitled to do, to put myself right on the matter.  Even if the Deputy wanted to convey that boys only accompanied their parents while they were drinking, I say that it is not the practice in Mayo for fathers and mothers to drink at public bars.  It should not go on the records of this House that that is the practice, because the records of this House will be used by a certain organisation in this country that wants to create the impression that our social order here is bad, that we are not a decent people, and that the present Government or any Government that is not the Government of that particular international organisation is not a fit Government to rule in this country.  I want to protest strongly against Deputy Cafferky's being made the tool of any other Deputy or any organisation in this country to put abroad statements of that kind that <Col N="1078" /> are absolutely incorrect.  Mothers in Mayo do not drink at public bars. Boys of 14 in Mayo do not drink at public bars.  I will exclude that if you like.  But why should the Deputy say that boys of 16, 17 and 18 continue that practice, and that, because they see their parents drinking, they think it the wise thing to do?</P>
      <P>The Deputy also complained that publichouses are open on Sunday evenings and that groups of boys go from them to the dance halls.  The Guards do their duty in Mayo, as far as I can find out.  There have been very few prosecutions for brawls in dance halls.  The Deputy also stated that outside dance halls you are in danger of being hit with stones.  He said that you could not know who the culprit was.  Mayo is not a place for brawls.  Its record has been good. Many of the boys who attend dances there are in the Defence Forces and they know how to conduct themselves. I also want to say that when Mayo boys go abroad nobody need be ashamed to meet them.  They have got into very prominent posts in England and have carried themselves well.</P>
      <P>There are no more misfits amongst the young men and women of Mayo who go abroad and have to come back again than amongst the people of any other county or nation.  It is only because I did not want that statement to go on the records of this House without contradiction that I stood up to refer to it.  The Deputy in question should not make these statements, because they are untrue.  He should not be urged to make them by any other body for use elsewhere.  Deputy Giles was perfectly right in stating that, if that were the condition of things in Mayo, Mayo migrants should no longer be sent to the County Meath to carry on their brawls there.  In a previous debate, also, statements were made that the Mayo migrants were responsible for illegitimate children in homes in England, and that these had to be paid for out of the English Exchequer. I think that this slandering of Mayo men who go abroad should not be indulged in here, because these things are not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding the statements <Col N="1079" /> made that crime is on the increase, I think that, taking world conditions as they are and the disturbed minds of people, of youth in particular, we are a wonderfully peaceful country at present.  It has been stated here by men of experience that, because of the terrible situation throughout the world and the callousness that goes with war, crime is bound to enter into the minds of people to a greater extent than before. Any increase of crime is due to the restlessness in the world.  Taking that into consideration, I think we are wonderfully free from crime, especially petty crime that people hope to get away with.  The proceedings in our courts are proof of that.  I do not know what the police reports are, but I take it the police are doing their duty in trying to detect and prevent crime. Therefore, I think the Minister and the Department and the people are to be congratulated.  I think that any statements to the contrary should not be made here for the purpose, I may say, of having them used by a certain organisation elsewhere to try to smash the morale of the people who want law and order here, despite what was said by a Deputy a few moments ago when speaking against the Minister, the Department and the Government.</P>
    <P>In regard to recruitment to the Guards, Deputy Cogan thought that the standard should be raised.  I do not at all agree with that.  I suggest that the standard of education should be lowered, that is, as far as secondary and university education is concerned. To my mind, the pupil who has done five years in a secondary school, or the man who has done a year or two in a university or even qualified for a degree there, is not the best type of man to become an ordinary member of the Gárda Síochána.  Men have applied for those posts time and again because they could get no post that would suit them.  They applied to become members of the Gárda Síochána and passed the test on their educational qualifications. They are fine types of men, but in accepting that post they feel it is beneath them.  They never have their hearts and souls in police work.  Sometimes they run into debt.  In my experience, <Col N="1080" /> they become bad members of the Gárda Síochána, and bring lesser men from an educational point of view into disgrace.  The best type of Guard in this country is the small farmer's or labourer's son who has got a good primary education.</P>

      <P>A man with a good primary education has a good competent knowledge of Irish, and when he becomes a member of the Gárda Síochána he does not feel that the job is beneath him.  He has a pride in his work, and he is a very good limb of the law.  I think the Department would make a grave mistake in going in for the highly qualified men from an educational point of view without taking into consideration that the man who is highly qualified educationally feels that the job is beneath him.  He is there on sufferance, and for that reason does not give to his work the attention that he should give to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About the force as a whole, I believe there is more laxity now than there was heretofore.  I believe there is, but it is due to the duplication of forces if you like.  Duties of various kinds are divided up amongst the L.D.F. and other members of the forces.  I think that is a mistake.  I think the police should be the rigid enforcers of the law, and that only in a very extreme case should their duties be handed over to any other body.  I also believe that economy could be effected by reducing the number of barracks in certain backward parts of the country. The Minister could very well close down a number of small barracks. There is a greater public spirit now than heretofore.  There is not a backwood village in the country in which you have not members of the L.D.F. prepared to assist in seeing that the law is carried out.  They have become first-class trained citizens and are ready to enforce the law.  There is no need to have a Guards' barracks in those districts, and I think an economy could be effected in that direction. <Col N="1081" /> Therefore, if the Minister has any economies in mind, he might consider that some of those barracks might well be closed down, leaving it to the sensible people of the countryside not to give way to pressure from criminals or allow crime to be committed without giving any information in their possession to the proper authorities.</P>

      <P>There are one or two points which I should like to put to the Minister in connection with his Estimates.  Before going into those matters, there was one point raised by Deputy Flanagan at the end of his remarks to-day with which I would like to be associated.  That is where he quoted from a letter from the wife of a member of the Gárda Síochána requesting that payments to members of the force might be made at more frequent intervals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have got a note on that matter since.  I find that two payments monthly were tried out, and the Guards themselves were not satisfied and were prepared to go back to the monthly payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly any number of them have complained that they are driven more and more to living on credit, and I have always understood that those associated with the Department of Justice are definitely against anything that would drive members of the force to living on credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain people feel that by getting the Guards to run up bills in their establishments they get a certain amount of pressure and strength which they can exercise for their own purposes.  I would ask the Minister to relieve the members of the Guards, who must be very definitely feeling the pinch at the moment.  The cost of living has gone up for them, as well as for everyone else, by 70 per cent.  As far as the cost-of-living bonus is concerned it alleviates that 70 per cent. increase on their old wages by about 10 per cent.  They are still very badly handicapped when one remembers the old purchasing power of their money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1082" /> With regard to this matter which has been discussed by many speakers, the question of political internees, I have not troubled the Minister very much on that matter, and I hope never to have very much to do with him in that connection.  I did have one representation made to him in one case. That man was released, but there is one small matter which I have already mentioned&mdash;the Minister can get the details from his advisers&mdash;incidental to the release.  The person in question was not I think ever suspected of being active in the sense of doing any harm to any man with a weapon.  He was supposed to have been an inciter, but whatever was the strength of the case against him the Minister, on examination, apparently decided that he would be lenient with him.  He was let out.  But here is what I cannot understand about it: That man had no way of earning his living&mdash;he was physically disabled&mdash;except by some sort of hack journalism.  His typewriter was taken from him and has not been returned.  I think it is somewhat anomalous to have a man released as being fit to be let loose on the citizens of this country, but to retain from him his means of livelihood.  I expect there is some reason why that has been done, and the Minister might inquire into the matter.</P>
    <P>With regard to those people generally, I was amazed last night to hear that the Minister had released 300 of them in the last year.  I would urge the Minister that, in respect of those people more particularly than in the case of any one else, it is not only required that justice should be done but that there should be a definite appearance of the fullest justice being done to them.  This country has had bitter experiences, and there are very few people in the country at the moment who would back publicly those who decide that they can use physical force against the citizens of the State. Nobody is going to stand for that sort of thing at all, but there is an uneasy feeling in the minds of certain people&mdash;I have shared it myself from time to time&mdash;that the vast powers with which the Minister has been armed are very liable to abuse.  I am not saying that they are being abused, <Col N="1083" /> but there are people who have their suspicions about that matter, and the Minister would be well advised to take every possible opportunity not merely of explaining to the people his mind on the matter but explaining how the individual cases of those people who are still interned have been dealt with.  There is a lot of talk as to whether or not there are boards to look into the cases of those men.  If any of those men are detained under the Offences Against the State Act of course there is a board to which he can apply.  If they are detained under the Emergency Powers Act, that is a different matter.  I do not know whether the whole 209 are interned&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>They are interned under the Emergency Powers Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the situation is that they have not immediately at their disposal any statutory board to which they can appeal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, they are entirely dependent on what may be the opinion of the Minister in view of the information given to him by his advisers as to the changed mental attitude of those people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a board, but it was considered unsatisfactory. The matter was discussed at the Defence Conference, and it was decided to drop it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure there are good reasons for that, but I suggest that they might be explained.  I am sure the Minister has learned from his experience in the Department that all through the run of history men's minds have been exercised in trying to find some way of preventing the natural corruption that power tends to bring in the human fabric, and the way that is generally done is by all this system of checks and balances that the law has established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment, we are in that situation in which the Minister has been given extraordinary powers.  He said, <Col N="1084" /> last night, that he had been given them because of certain troubles in the country. I do not think that is so.  He was given them under the 1937 Constitution, I suggest, on arguments which have not stood the test of practical experience since the Constitution was passed.  Special courts may be set up. It was understood, when the matter was being discussed in connection with the Constitution, that if these special courts were to be set up, there would be a form of court, not a lay body, which would determine what were the circumstances in which these special courts should be established. In any event, the Minister got powers and got them for peace time&mdash;not for the emergency alone.  The Minister has power under the second edition of the Offences Against the State Act to put people in jail when he likes.  That, roughly, is the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>A state of emergency must be declared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but that is a simple matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Even in peace-time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Even in peace-time, but in peace-time, apart altogether from this war emergency we are in, the Minister, by getting an emergency declared by the Government, a political body, can thereafter simply sign a Schedule which is affixed to one of the Acts.  There is no going wrong about it, unless the Minister fills in his own name as the person to be interned, instead of as the signatory.  That is the only mistake that could be made in the warrant.  All the old cases we knew of about warrants being wrong and points of detail being picked out have gone.  The Minister has such a formula at the back of the Act, and all he has to do is to put his signature to it, and he can send people to jail indefinitely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is possibly a power which is required.  History has shown that the worst people in any country are those who make use of Constitutional matters to overthrow the Constitution, who prepare their plans for an armed rising against the Constitution under the guise of the Constitution.  The 1937 <Col N="1085" /> Constitution, undoubtedly, armed the Minister against that sort of nonsense. With regard to that, it is a pity that at this stage people can be found in this House still, even with reservations and some without reservations, to try to justify the use of armed force.  On account of the circumstances in which the State emerged, there was a pretty evil tradition established with regard to the use of physical force.  I have my views that that should have stopped on a certain date, and the Minister will hold that, after a particular date, no attempt at physical force could be justified.  Our dates may disagree.</P>
    <P>In any event, as a result of two political Parties having had experience of office, there is now a pretty healthy opinion in this country against the use of physical force, and it is a desperate thing that, even in this debate last night, people should be found to seek, even with some reservations, to pretend to justify force, and to justify it on the ground that, when force is used against people, they may be driven to the use of force themselves.  That argument reverses the truth.  The truth is that when people have attempted to use physical force, the force of the law comes down upon them, but I think a few words by the Minister would not be out of place in indicating that, even with regard to these 209 persons, opportunities are taken when they occur to have their cases reviewed, to have the files gone into and to have some association with people which will give them every chance of escaping from evil associations.  If these people are banded together in a particular internment camp, they are all going to be pretty much under the supervision of the others, and it may be hard for a man who wants to leave the association&mdash;I am not speaking of an organisation, but of associates&mdash; to get a chance of disclosing his mind.  I understand that the Minister gives these men every chance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Every chance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  The Minister said with regard to these people that they will stay there until the emergency is over and probably for some time after it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take that as meaning that they represent the hard core of the physical force system in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my opinion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will get all the support he wants from this side, so long as that is the situation and so long as he can make it clear to us that he is not being obtuse in regard to any appeal made in connection with a change of mind on the part of these people.</P>
      <P>The Minister last night&mdash;it may have been simply due to the heat of interjection of debate&mdash;objected rather vehemently to some remark as to whether he himself might not be prejudiced with regard to some of these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not quite hear what was said, but I thought the particular Deputy was accusing me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The remark was made, and I want to make a point on it.  The Minister immediately afterwards accepted with equanimity the suggestion that some of his advisers might have hostile associations or a background which might make them hostile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I admitted that it could happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister repudiates the idea that he is prejudiced, on the basis of having tried to clear his mind of any of the old-time associations with regard to these people, of having impartially considered their cases and now feels that he is not in any way prejudiced against them, I will accept it from him, but I did think it was rather odd of him so strongly to repudiate the suggestion that he might be prejudiced and to accept that some of his advisers, associates or someone down the line might have particular prejudices.  The Minister would admit that if prejudices were anywhere they probably were with these people, but I should imagine that when the Minister says <Col N="1087" /> he is not prejudiced, it means that he has gone through a particular phase, that he has judged these things impartially and has taken the most objective view that he can of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I trust so, and I have no reason at all to believe the contrary.  That is the situation with regard to these people, and in so far as there are 200, and only 200, under detention at the moment, I think it is a great situation.  In the height of this war, when people who were inclined to be antagonistic to the best interests of the country had such open opportunities for mischief and with all the tension surrounding a recent period, to have only a couple of hundred still detained is a matter upon which we can congratulate ourselves.</P>
      <P>It is also a matter for congratulation that 300 were released last year.  I gathered from the Minister's retorts to various people that he is not at all satisfied that the whole of the 300 have kept faith with him, but I understand that, numerically, there are not very many who have broken faith, although his interjection made me feel that he was a bit doubtful of the strength of the opposition of certain of the small number who have gone back, so to speak, on the faith which they had pledged.  That is all I want to say on that, except to urge that the Minister will take the opportunity of indicating to the House that cases get the fullest consideration, and that if any man shows that he has turned to a new path the Minister releases him and hopes for the best.  I hope that he does not neglect a little supervision at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the secondary part of this matter which causes me anxiety.  The courts are crammed with criminals at the moment.  Deputy Ó Cléirigh said that we ought to congratulate ourselves that crime is only at the point at which we have it.  I think we are in a shockingly bad condition.  The best the Minister could say in his opening statement was that we had stabilised crime at a very high point, at double <Col N="1088" /> what it was four years ago.  I think he said that the number of indictable offences had more or less doubled in four years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is lamentable that we should have that situation, and I am not sure that simply getting judges to sentence men to terms of imprisonment is the solitary means to be adopted against that particular set of circumstances.  I am worried rather more by this position: We have our ordinary courts presided over by judges appointed under the Constitution, with all the fortification there is to judges of being impartially appointed and put beyond the reach of any prejudice by the manner in which they are appointed, and in addition we have these special courts presided over by people who can be changed at any moment. They are not people who must be appointed under the Constitution, or subject to the restrictions in the Constitution.</P>
      <P>I find myself, in reading the accounts of cases in the newspapers, wondering what is the line of principle which determines whether a case goes before the special courts or the ordinary courts of the country.  At one time, I thought that what were called serious black-marketing cases went before the special courts, but then I saw, within the same month, cases in connection with petrol coupons going to the special courts and some going to the ordinary courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Attorney-General decides that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but surely there is matter for the administration of justice in connection with it.  I agree that the Attorney-General has a very big say in the whole matter, but I am quite certain that the Attorney-General can have representations made to him with regard to particular cases and with regard to, say, the abuse of the special courts; but the public, or the small fraction of the public whom I meet, are a little anxious about this overworking of the special courts.  There are any number of cases in which it seems to us people might <Col N="1089" /> have been paraded before the ordinary juries of the country and in respect of which we could have depended on the juries to give justice.  I can see one excuse, but I do not know that it is one which the Minister would like to give, that is, that the ordinary courts are so crammed that the special courts are taking part of the burden of this tremendous outbreak of crime in the country.  In any event, I do suggest that the use of the special courts has been overdone and there is no real line of principle in relation to the type of case which we see from time to time appearing before the special court, when the ordinary criminal courts under the Constitution are open for the trial of these people.  The ordinary criminal courts set up under the Constitution are open for the trial of those cases.  The Minister might help in that matter by stating what percentage of the prosecutions for indictable offences come before the special courts as opposed to the ordinary courts.  Is the percentage growing in recent years?  Is there a bigger percentage, so to speak? In any event, there must be a bigger number of these cases coming before the criminal courts, as the crime cases have doubled.  The statistics would show whether the courts are getting the increasing number.  I understood that the use of the special courts under the Act was to be confined to cases in which the ordinary administration of the law had broken down.  Applying that rule, there is really no case for the special courts at all.  I do not think the Minister in the last three or four years could say that the ordinary courts have broken down.  He gave one instance of an attempt at shooting and wounding one witness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I do not think the Minister can indicate a solitary example of a solitary district justice having been prevented from holding his court by any process of intimidation. If that is the case&mdash;and I suggest it is&mdash;the Minister has to justify the use of these special courts.  It must be remembered that the courts are composed of people not appointed under the Constitution and that all the fortification <Col N="1090" /> the citizen is supposed to get from the background of the courts is gone.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Without any disrespect to the personnel of those courts, I must say that cases are being taken in that way before people not accustomed to the rules of evidence, who do not know the strict application of the rules of evidence as it is known in the ordinary courts.  Therefore, people who go before a special court may be subjected to a much more severe type of control than those who go before the courts appointed under the Constitution.  There are certain other courts in which the rules of evidence may be set aside entirely&mdash; it depends on the court and on the special circumstances.</P>
      <P>There is one other matter which causes anxiety.  The Minister might answer by some statistics.  Statistics were asked for yesterday, but the Minister said it would take too much time and effort to get them.</P>

      <P>I feel very disturbed over this question of the outbreak of crime.  Deputy Cleary has, I suggest, a completely wrong view of the situation.  He said, first of all, that we are to be congratulated that, with all the turmoil in the world and with all the upsetting of standards, we have only got to the point we have <Col N="1092" /> reached.  The point we have gone to is that the indictable offences have doubled.  Here we are, in a bit of a backwater, as far as the ordinary currents of world thoughts are concerned. We pride ourselves on being a Christian country as well as an agricultural country&mdash;we use the two slogans&mdash; and we are supposed to be protected more by our religion than a great many other communities.  We adhere strongly to Christian tradition, yet at this particular period crime has doubled in four years.</P>
      <P>At the same time, there is an outbreak of a sort of kill-joy spirit, given expression to in this House.  Listening to some of the speeches, one would think that all the vice in the country can be traced back to either cinemas or dances.  Dances are a proper form of amusement and are, in the main, properly used.  There is a commercialised type of dance hall, to cope with which various efforts have been made, without any great success, unfortunately. There can be, and frequently has been, abuse of drinking.</P>
      <P>I have occasionally been&mdash;more often than I want to be&mdash;in a District Court, when I saw Guards solemnly sworn, in a sort of chorus, and then saw a lot of unfortunate youngsters being paraded for playing football in the streets.  The district justice's time and the time of a certain number of Guards was taken up and young people and their parents were all brought in to answer to the charges and to pay small fines, because the youngsters were kicking football in the streets.  I sometimes wish I may live to see the day when a decent healthy-minded district justice will adjourn his court and go out to see the places where those youngsters kick football and have a game with them.  I have known people fined for playing football in streets where there was no traffic at all likely to bring them into danger and where the street was so wide and the houses so definitely set back from the street that it was almost beyond the strength of the youngsters playing with the bit of a ball to do any damage whatever to property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other side of that picture must be shown.  I can only place this particular matter in a very small percentage <Col N="1093" /> of the cases I have heard talked of.  I have known people brought up from areas I know of and where the people in charge of the city playgrounds have made no provision for the young people to get any amusement anywhere in the neighbourhood. These youngsters are driven to the streets, those healthy young boys have some little bit of animal spirit and, God knows, they are innocent enough if all they do is to kick a ball about the streets.</P>

      <P>I know enough about the ordinary courts to know that that sort of thing occurs.  There are these other cases.  In any event that is one part of this problem of the juvenile delinquent.  What are you going to do with these lads?  Are they not going to be allowed to amuse themselves? If no playing fields are provided for them they must amuse themselves somehow.  Amongst the district justices dealing with those cases there is great humanity.  When boys are paraded before them in court a small fine is imposed.  If the lad does not appear a heavier fine is imposed.  Some of the lads that I have seen around the courts seemed rather glad to have the day from school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon, as is his habit on these occasions when dealing with this matter of the juvenile delinquent, was very eloquent and sincere.  The Minister has been asked to visit various <Col N="1094" /> places&mdash;the prisons, Civic Guards' barracks and so on.  I wonder if he has ever visited a District Court, particularly when young people are up and seen the sort of atmosphere that is there?  The atmosphere is such that one feels the boy has now got into a position in which there is really no saving him.  There used to be the old criminal test of subjecting people to ordeal by fire, and later the test of water.  In the case of certain crimes people were pitched into a lake.  If they escaped it was a sign that they had certain supernatural and magical powers, and then they were destroyed. If they sank it was a very clear proof that they were innocent.  That is how one feels about some of those children who come into the courts.  If they are put into prison one wonders what their associations there are going to be.  Unfortunately, it is very easy for a boy to take a wrong turning at a particular point.  It may be that he will be chastened by his experiences and will set himself right or that he may become a little bit of a gangster hero and will take the wrong turning.</P>
    <P>The part of the judiciary that comes in contact with those juvenile offenders have the feeling, I think, that they are not doing much good simply by listening to a sordid story and then imposing such punishment as seems to fit the offence.  I do not think they believe they are doing as much good as they do, say, with the hardened criminal.  If they cannot reform him at least they will try to preserve society from him. The juvenile offender is an entirely different matter.</P>
    <P>Most judicial people who come in contact with those juveniles are rather saddened and heartbroken by the fact that the only resources that this civilisation of ours can offer is to establish people who will rule according to certain rules on the cases that come before them.  None of them feel, I think, that any great good is being done.  Appeals have been made to the Minister for the appointment of more probation officers.  It is considered that a little more expenditure under that heading would produce better results. I know that the Minister may be advised that the people who speak <Col N="1095" /> about more probation officers are really first-class cranks in the community. Some of those at any rate are people of brains and capacity as far as social conditions are concerned.  They think that some other way than the brutal business of sending young people to jail might be adopted to effect reforms. I have heard some of these people say that if there is anything wrong about various matters you see the Government jumping in.  The appointment of warble fly inspectors is one example.  The Government can find money for warble fly inspectors, but it will not add to the six probation officers in the Dublin courts. That indicates the stingy outlook they have in the matter of reform.  The Department of Finance appears to block every effort made in the way of correction or prevention especially in this matter of juvenile crime.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connolly spoke with great feeling on this matter.  Many people have been thinking over this juvenile problem and looking out for a better solution of it, one that would regard the juvenile delinquent as more a matter for psychological observation and analysis, for the attachment to him of a doctor instead of a police officer.  People are thinking along the lines that if you could dig down into the mind of the juvenile delinquent you would get a response.  As Deputy Dillon said, there may be something crabbed in a fellow's nature which has made him an object of scorn amongst his fellows.  He reacts to that and becomes a bit of an enemy of the people around him.  Many people are thinking that if you could give those lads a healthier outlook you might make something out of them.  If the Minister ever had the experience&mdash;I do not wish to suggest for a moment that he ever had&mdash;of finding someone related to him who had fallen foul of the law as a juvenile and of being pushed off on a sentence, he would have a very much better appreciation of this problem than he will ever get from reading statistics with regard to crime.</P>
    <P>I feel that I am talking to a person who is sympathetically disposed but who, for the last 10 or 12 years, must have felt the overwhelming power of <Col N="1096" /> the Department of Finance.  He is probably tired of butting his head against the immovable people who control finance.  I suggest to him that he would get the approval of this House if he made a further attack on them&mdash; in this time of great extravagance in spending&mdash;for some additional expenditure on the part of the State in an attempt to save people from going wrong or to reform them instead of going on with this brutal business of pushing them into jail.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter that I want to refer to.  It did not arise last year but I can raise it hypothetically. I asked before, in connection with the officers of judicial institutions in this country, whether any thought had been given to that provision in the Constitution which says that judges are not eligible to hold any other office or position of emolument. I raised this before when a particular judicial person had got from the State a licence which certainly gave him profit and emolument.  I was told I think by the present Minister that the matter had been enquired into, and that the legal advice was that the licence given to him by the Minister's colleague could not be withheld. Some time or another somebody is going to have to make a decision on what the words &ldquo;any other office or position of emolument&rdquo; cover.  It is, of course, open to the Minister to put up regulations of his own in respect of people who are appointed to judicial office.  I stress these words because they will be repeated with regard to other people; we repeat them with regard to the President of the country and they are repeated with regard to the appointment of a new Comptroller and Auditor-General.</P>
    <P>When this matter was before the House on a previous occasion I raised the point whether it was not highly undesirable that a judicial person should be enabled to get a licence for a premises and have a licensed premises run in his name.  I gathered that it might not be desirable, but it was not prohibited by the Constitution. There is only one actual case in which that occurred.  The Minister is entitled <Col N="1097" /> to make his and the Government's point of view clear with regard to what profits other than judicial or other salaries people of this type will get.</P>
    <P>We made an appointment yesterday. That person is not a judicial person, but he is put on the footing of a judicial person as far as the Consituation is concerned.  I do not think it is desirable that any of these highly-placed officers should have any source of emolument other than their salaries.  There is a considerable difficulty in applying that rigidly.  If people invest their money, they are entitled to some return.  Supposing a person buys out a concern&mdash;I am not speaking of an actual case&mdash;he is entitled to draw the whole of the profits of that concern.</P>
    <P>I think what we are aiming at in the Constitution has been entirely broken or departed from.  I think what was back of that phrase when introducing the Constitution was that you wanted to put a person in a way that he would always be able to judge himself objectively and without partiality. The way you achieve that is to say that this person will have no touch with the outer world, as it were; he will have his money in one way only, so that in the event of cases coming before him nobody can say that he was prejudiced because of his association with a particular company or a particular type of emolument, or was in a special type of business whereby his judgment might be perverted.</P>
    <P>This matter will arise from time to time.  It has arisen in the case of a judge who is no longer a judge.  It will arise with regard to others, and it will arise with regard to other appointments. I suggest to the Minister that it is about time somebody gave an authoritative interpretation of what is in the Constitution.  The Government are entitled to put further restrictions than those set out in the Constitution on certain people and I think the Minister should make the point clear as to what his position will be with regard to people who hold any other office or position or any <Col N="1098" /> post from which they can get emoluments.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the emergency bonus.  It represents a 10 per cent. addition to the salaries of certain officials.  The cost of living has gone up to 70 per cent.  The Guards have got an alleviation to the extent of 10 per cent. and to that degree they are better off than others.  I do not know if it has occurred to people, when they are considering the increase in crime, to associate that with the economic conditions under which numbers of people are expected to live in the country.  There is an Article in the Constitution which deals with the family.  We regard the family as a natural, primary and fundamental group of society.</P>
    <P>It is rather noticeable that in this Constitution, having made that pious expression of our attitude, which is following out the Christian condition with regard to the antecedent rights of the family as a unit, we separate it from the Article dealing with private property.  The encyclical from which that particular paragraph is copied goes on to refer to the obligation to pay a family wage.  Can it be said that the majority of the Guards, even with the 10 per cent. emergency bonus, are getting a family wage?  That, of course, is one of the things that is contrary to the spirit if not of the special encyclical, certainly to the tenor of encyclicals generally, because the tenor is that the parents in charge of the family should be looked to, in the matter of the family wage and its provision, and not the benefaction of the State.  In any event, the Minister surely ought to face his responsibilities in connection with the people who are expected to set standards with regard to law and order.  We know from the Estimates what is given to the ordinary rank and file of the Guards.  The Minister ought to consider that matter seriously.</P>
    <P>He must have given hours of thought to the outbreak of crime.  I think that he associated the outbreak of crime with a number of articles that are in short supply.  He said the vast increase in crime in the country, the larceny and housebreaking, might be <Col N="1099" /> associated with articles in short supply. Is there not another factor to be considered?  The people who are getting small wages find that they have to count their pounds as worth so many 11 shillings, and yet they are expected to keep up the same standard of life.  That is more likely to be the cause of people breaking out into the larceny of goods than merely that certain articles are in short supply.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants some radical reform in this country, he will have to move outside his own Department.  He might depict for the Government the very sad situation the country is brought to through the failure of certain colleagues of his.  I imagine that if the Minister will get in touch with people on the judicial bench he will find corroboration of what I say, and that is, that it is the desperate straits to which people are driven by the fact that the pound has such a small purchasing power that is the greatest cause of the increased crime.  I doubt if the Minister will see any betterment of that situation, apart from the world movement of ideas outside.  The Minister will see that as long as this country is compelled to live in the shockingly degraded conditions under which the vast majority are obliged to live at the moment there cannot be any improvement.  I have asked and pleaded that the people with the small money should have their situation better regarded.</P>
    <P>I move to another group now.  Judges are, amongst the people in the country, a group specially singled out.  They are the people who have adopted this attitude&mdash;that they should be put beyond all reach of temptation in the carrying out of their independent office by having themselves put on a particular salary scale in which they will enjoy amenities of life.  Judicial salaries were fixed many years ago.  They are worth about half now what they were when fixed.  It was very often hard to get people who were in a good way of practice even to accept the old rate of judicial emolument.  It was not so much the rate of pay was the incentive, it was more the fact that when a man was retired from the judicial <Col N="1100" /> bench he had a very good pension. Both salary and bonus are to be weighed in the light of the present run of prices, and not merely in the light of the present run of prices but with some idea of what prices will fix themselves at in the post-war period.  I think that as a special group the judicial people should be singled out for better treatment.  Amongst other things, I think a judge is entitled to say that he has attained a particular office, that he has been picked out for that, and that he ought to have certain privileges amongst them the capacity to be able to provide better for his children in the way of education and everything else than other people who have not been picked out for the same attainments that he has.  Judicial people can say that they are in an exceptional position.  I think it would be part of the duty of the Minister if he wants to keep the courts in the position in which he found them&mdash;nobody will accuse me of saying that the judges have lapsed from their high standards because of the impact of prices on the particular salaries they receive&mdash;to give some consideration to that matter, and that the level of judicial salaries ought to be raised higher&mdash;at least it ought to be put at the point where what judges get is able to buy more or less what it used to buy.  That would mean a considerable increase in the actual monies they get.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephMeighan" hpid="Mr. Meighan Mr. Meighan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meighan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just three or four points which I should like to stress.  The first is with regard to those people of whom Deputy Dillon gave a pretty fair account yesterday. They have become a great nuisance in the West lately.  The Minister for Justice I think will get co-operation from the local Gárda in dealing with them.  On a recent occasion they created pandemonium in Ballaghaderreen. It took the Gárda and the Local Defence Force to rout them out of the town.  It is a common practice with them to let in their horses and asses into a farmer's field.  That would not be very serious at the present time, but it could be very serious in the autumn when the corn crops would be ripe.  On one occasion I saw 80 asses put into one field.  If you turn 80 asses <Col N="1101" /> into a cornfield for a night, you can imagine what the result will be.  The Department should take some steps to try to check these liberties which these people seem anxious to take.</P>
      <P>With regard to dances, about which a good deal has been said, I have not seen any abuses in my town, and we have a great many dances there.  That may be due to the fact that licences for bars have not been sought for these dances.  Generally, an energetic and representative committee runs these dances, and they are being carried out very creditably.  There have not been any disgraceful scenes that I am aware of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to take this opportunity of paying a compliment to the Gárda in Roscommon and in every other county that I happened to go through during the recent election.  I came across a great number of them in the various districts in Roscommon and in some of the adjoining counties, and I must say that they carried out their duties very impartially.  With regard to recruiting for the Gárda, I agree with a good deal of what Deputy Ó Cléirigh said.  Deputy Ó Cléirigh, however, seemed to think that Deputy Cogan had a different point of view.  I discussed the matter with Deputy Cogan, and his point of view and Deputy Ó Cléirigh's are somewhat similar.  Deputy Cogan suggested that the standard of education for recruits would want to be higher, but he informs me that what he meant by that was that in a couple of years there will be a large number of Guards retiring from the Force and that for a pretty large number of Guards to be eligible for the position of officer it will be necessary that a large percentage of them should have a pretty high standard of education.  Outside of that, I think it must be recognised that both the R.I.C. and the Gárda were recruited from the middle-class farming and labouring community, and that both forces proved to be satisfactory. As they are reared in the country and lead an open-air life they are the people who are the most suitable for recruits.  They are of a hardy nature and are generally of strong physique, and I think they are really the most <Col N="1102" /> suitable people for the position.  As I say, these two forces were recruited largely from that class of people and, as that has been so successful, I think it should be continued.  I know there has been a growing feeling in the country for some time that the ordinary farmer's son who has only received an ordinary national school education has no chance of getting into the Gárda.  A great many of them have not applied, because they felt they would have no chance against those who had a secondary education and who, as Deputy Ó Cléirigh said, applied to become members of the Gárda because they cannot get some other position.  I should like the Minister to give us his point of view on that matter, so that young boys in the country could know whether they were eligible or not.  If the ordinary national school education is not considered a sufficiently high standard, there is no use putting them to the expense and trouble of applying.</P>
    <P>There is just one other point with regard to the prisoners.  I never believed in physical force and I do not believe in it at present.  We should congratulate ourselves on the fact that comparative peace has been restored to us.  I think it was last June that there was prolonged discussion on those matters.  I was one of those who suggested at that time that it would be useful if a committee representative of every Party in the House were appointed to visit those prisoners.  At the time, if I remember rightly, various complaints were made by the prisoners that they were being treated badly. The Minister for Justice told us that they were not, and Deputies were not in a position to get first-hand information. If they had that first-hand information they could go down to their constituencies and point out that they had definite information that things were as good as could reasonably be expected.</P>
    <P>With great respect, I suggest to the Minister that he should consider that matter again.  He has told us something like 300 have been released, and no grave happenings have resulted.  If this committee were appointed, it <Col N="1103" /> would be able to assure the House, and Deputies in turn could assure their constituents, that everything possible was being done, and that those people, as the Minister said, have the key in their own pockets if they wish to avail of it.  Those are the only points I wish to raise.  The larger questions have been dealt with more efficiently than I could have hoped to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with other speakers that we have every reason to congratulate ourselves on the efficiency of the Civic Guards.  People are sometimes inclined to think that the Civic Guards are not sufficiently efficient; they forget that a certain amount of responsibility rests upon the ordinary citizen as far as giving assistance to the Guards is concerned.  I think it will be admitted by every decent-minded man in the country that our Civic Guard force is a credit to everybody concerned.  The Government and the country have reason to be proud of it.</P>
      <P>I would suggest to the Minister that something should be done about providing proper housing accommodation for members of the Force.  In many cases they find it very difficult to procure suitable accommodation.  That applies particularly to members with large families.  I think that the Department should ensure that suitable accommodation, adjacent to the barrack, will be made available for them. I would also suggest that, particularly in the case of married members of the Guards, it would be a good thing if the Minister could see his way to pay their salaries every two weeks.  It is difficult, especially in view of the great increases in prices, to budget over a four weeks' period, and it would be a very definite convenience to the household if payment of salary were made every two weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also suggest that, particularly in country areas, the Sunday closing regulations should not be strictly enforced.  After a very hard week's work, I think a man is entitled to a few pints on a Sunday, and the Civic Guards should be instructed by the Minister for Justice not to be too hard on those country men who like <Col N="1104" /> to get a drink after Mass on Sundays. They should get at least an hour or so to get a well earned refreshment after the week.  I would ask the Minister to instruct the Guards to close their eyes to small things that might happen during that period.</P>
    <P>I do not think licences should be allowed for bars in dance halls.  I do not object to dances, not even to all night dances, but I do object to having a bar on the premises. Parents throughout the country have a real objection to allowing their sons and daughters&mdash;particularly their daughters&mdash;to attend dance halls which have a bar attached.  Only too often we hear of deplorable incidents in such halls, and I think it is demoralising to the youth of the country that such state of affairs should exist.  As I said, I have no objection to dances. They are a great source of entertainment to boys and girls.  They cannot be expected to spend all their time at home.  They have a right to their legitimate amusements.  We are living in a modern world, and I think nobody will deny them that right.  I would ask the Minister to see to it that licences for bars in dance halls are not allowed in any circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to Deputies attacking dance halls, picture houses and travelling people on the roads.  Those travelling people buy donkeys from small farmers in the district, and in the course of their journeys at the present time they do very useful work making galvanised buckets, when buckets are not to be had in the hardware shops.  They are not as dangerous as certain speakers made them out to be.  They are human beings and they have to live.  They have their own way of living and I do not see why attacks should be made upon them from all sides.  They are living in their own way and they never interfere with others.  They may brawl amongst themselves, but they never interfere with anyone outside their own circles.  Every one of us must make a living&mdash;we are not all lucky&mdash;and I think it is very unfair that all Parties should be attacking these people.  They are horse dealers and many farmers buy horses from <Col N="1105" /> them.  They are very useful for the farmers.  They go down to Cork and buy donkeys which they sell to people around County Wexford, to cottage people and others who want donkeys. It is very hard to get them, and, but for these people, they would not be available.  They go to Connemara and buy ponies.  They are not all beggars &mdash;some of them are wealthy men.</P>
      <P>There is one matter which no Deputy dwelt on sufficiently, that is, the position of poor people who go out gathering firing in the form of a few bits of sticks.  These people are brought to the District Court and fined 40/-. Some of them are unemployed men, and that is an outrageous fine to impose on an unemployed man or a poor woman for gathering sticks to light a fire during the bad times through which we are passing.  The Minister should instruct district justices not to be too hard on these poor people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister could use his good offices all the same.  With regard to what has been said about dances, all parties run dances.  The Labour Party, the L.D.F. and various other people run dances, and I suggest that the hours of 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. are not suitable, because it often happens that people are put out at 4 o'clock in the morning and cannot get into the places where they work. It is a bad hour to turn out boys and girls when they cannot get into the places where they are employed.  It would be better if the dances went on until 7 a.m. and I say that as one who often goes to dances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had references to the prisoners, and I should like to see all the prisoners released.  I have here the name of a man arrested on 5th December, 1942, and released on 4th June, 1943&mdash;Séamus Ó Ceallaigh, 23 Laoighis Road, Cabra.  This poor young man has the use of only one hand and his typewriter, his only means of making a living, was taken from him and is at present held by the <Col N="1106" /> authorities.  I ask the Minister to restore it to this young man, who told me that it is his only means of livelihood.</P>
    <P>With regard to district justices and black-marketing cases, I remember the case of a woman in Wexford who was fined £5 in connection with the sale of a box of matches.  That was a very heavy penalty to impose in such a case because black-marketing is going on all over the country.  Deputies have spoken about pictures, but fewer people will go to the pictures now, owing to the electricity restrictions, and I do not think it is right for Deputies to condemn amusements, because these amusements provide revenue for the Government.  In attending picture-houses, dog-tracks and so on, we are paying a certain amount in taxation to the Government, and if we do away with the little sport going on in the country at present we will have very little amusement.</P>
    <P>There has also been reference to drinking in dance halls, but I never saw a bar in a dance hall in my own town of Enniscorthy.  I have been out at dances in the country and I saw no bars there either.  I do not know where these bars are used, but dancing is going on all over the City of Dublin, and, when one leaves this House, one meets ladies and gentlemen going to dance halls in the city and it is probably to these dance halls that Deputies were referring.  I see none of this wholesale drinking in County Wexford, and I was surprised to hear some of the West of Ireland Deputies giving their own constituencies such a bad name.  I would not like to do it for my constituency, because if they see that going on, they must take part in it themselves.  I have been at as many dances as Deputy Cafferky or other Deputies, and I see none of this drinking going on, in County Wexford, anyhow.</P>
    <P>Finally, I ask the Minister to restore to Seamus O Ceallaigh, of Cabra, the typewriter which is his only means of livelihood.  I do not think the Government need be afraid of a disabled man. I know some of the young men from my own town who were released.  What happened to them?  There was no work <Col N="1107" /> for them.  They could not get to England to work, and they had to join the Air Force.  That is where some of these poor young fellows who were put into internment camps without trial have ended up&mdash;in the British Army.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The first matter I want to raise is the matter of prison reform. We have operated as a separate political entity for the past 20 years, and, in the main, we simply administered a system of prison regulations which we inherited on the change of Government. It is perfectly true that certain minor administrative and executive reforms have been carried out in the meantime, but no really serious attempt has been made to study our methods of detention, our prison regulations, or the conditions under which prisoners are detained, or to endeavour to effect any kind of reformation from the standpoint of the prisoner, whether he be a veteran prisoner or just an occasional miscreant.  One of the most objectionable features of our present prison code is that we commit young persons&mdash;mere youths and adolescents &mdash;to mix in prison with incorrigible offenders who know every artifice of the prison, know every trick in the criminal code and who, in idle moments in prison, are quite capable of imparting to youthful and accidental offenders many of the tricks which they have learned in a long life of crime.</P>
      <P>I understand there are no regulations at present for segregating youthful offenders from the more hardened type of criminal.  I do not think it is calculated to induce reformation, so far as the young person is concerned, by permitting any association whatever between the relatively youthful prisoner and the person who, apparently, has decided to embark on a course of crime and in respect of whom no methods of reformation are likely to be effective. I think it is the experience of persons responsible for dealing with prisons that any association whatever between the youthful offender and the incorrigible criminal is likely to result in the youthful offender being taught new and very vicious methods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There should be an examination of <Col N="1108" /> the whole prison regulations, to ensure that youthful offenders&mdash;I do not mean mere boys of 17 and 18, but those up to 22 and 23 years of age&mdash;should not be permitted to have any intercourse with the more hardened type of criminal whose methods, habits and knowledge present one of the greatest possible problems to those charged with prison administration.  If prison is to act as a deterrent on youthful prisoners, or even on the adult prisoner who has fallen for the first time, it is essential that in our prison administration we should recognise by a different method of treatment and by a different code of regulations that the first offender or the youthful prisoner is viewed differently by the State to the manner in which the inveterate offender is viewed.</P>
    <P>In that connection, one of the blanks in our whole prison code is the fact, that at present it merely exists for the purpose of detaining persons who have broken the law, and no effort whatever is made to use the prison service or prison code to impart education or vocational training to those who, unfortunately, have lapsed and are compelled on that account to spend a long period of incarceration.  Many of the prisoners sentenced to long terms of imprisonment spend their time in the kitchen, or on the farm&mdash;if there is a farm attached&mdash;or in the laundry or garden, or doing the thousand and one routine things to be done in prison.  No attempt, however, is made to plumb the depths of mind of the prisoner, no real endeavour is made to point out to the prisoner the evil effects which inevitably follow any embarkation on a course of wrong-doing.  No serious attempt is made to woo a prisoner away from the criminal path.  The whole purpose of our prison regulations seems to be merely to detain people, to treat them there with all the rigour inseparably associated with prison life, and no effort whatever is made, so far as I can see, to wean them away from the path of crime and induce them to take a new, a healthier and a more idealistic view of citizenship.</P>
    <P>To be effective at all, our prison code must endeavour to make psychological examination of prisoners.  Many of the <Col N="1109" /> persons who break the law are persons who up to then have been excellent citizens and against whom no charge of want of rectitude could be levelled. Many of them have been guilty of isolated lapses, due often to environment, to personal association with other persons, to want of proper appreciation at the time the offence was committed, or to want of an accurate sense of wrong-doing.  It is important, if there is to be respect for the law, that efforts be made to effect some psychological reform in such persons.</P>
    <P>We have now had 22 years' experience of our present prison code. From statistics, nobody would pretend to believe that the existence of our prisons or of our criminal code is such as to induce people to avoid prisons.  Statistics show that, apart from political crime, the state of ordinary crime is alarming and something with which those interested in the welfare of the State cannot be in any way pleased.  For the past 22 years, prison has been, in the main, just a place of detention, with all that kind of brutalising and blighting influence which goes with rigorous prison life.  I recognise, of course, that prison life cannot be a kind of garden tea-party.  There must be restrictions and the wrongdoer must be punished.  I prefer to believe, however, that there is a much better dividend for the State, in the long run, if prisoners can be weaned away from the criminal path.</P>
    <P>The time has now arrived when the Minister or the Government might usefully set up a commission of inquiry into our prison service, methods and procedure and into our criminal code so far as detention is concerned. The commission might consist of persons who, while wanting to mark disapproval of wrongdoing, will also recognise that the main purpose of prison life should be to woo the evildoer back to the path of virtue.  Unless our prison service results in humanising people and teaches those incarcerated the benefits of being physically, morally and educationally elevated, the whole purpose of prisons will be defeated.  Instead of being merely a place of detention, the <Col N="1110" /> prison should be a place of correction. There is nothing in our present service to indicate that that matter is receiving the attention and consideration it should receive at the hands of those responsible.</P>
    <P>If prison is to be just a memory of rigorous treatment so far as the prisoner is concerned, and merely leaves an influence on the prisoner that his period in prison was accompanied by very rigorous hardship and often brutalising treatment, our detention of persons fails completely to achieve its real purpose, namely, to effect reform in the prisoner and induce him to go back to the path of virtue.</P>
    <P>I suggest, therefore, to the Minister that, having had experience of our prison administration during the past 22 years, some steps should now be taken to set up a commission of inquiry to investigate the operation of the whole prison service with a view to effecting such reforms as are likely to have a much better effect on prisoners than the present service has. As I have said, crime statistics do not show that prison is a deterrent so far as prisoners are concerned.  It is a noticeable feature of our prison administration that no real effort whatever is made to inculcate any love of high virtue on the part of prisoners or to look after a prisoner once he has been discharged from prison custody. I hope, therefore, that the present Minister who, I think, is sympathetically disposed in a matter of this kind, will be able to see his way to set up a commission of inquiry so that we may evolve a prison code something different from the code which we have inherited.  The prison code which we are administering to-day is simply the code which we inherited with this difference, that the code which we inherited in 1921 or 1922 has undergone many useful reforms so far as Britain is concerned.  We, however, cling to the worst aspects of that code.  In Britain a new type of prison is being erected.  It is a considerable advance on anything that we have got here. They have new and better methods for dealing with prisoners in Britain, and a much more serious effort is <Col N="1111" /> made to educate prisoners in Britain than there is here.  Our whole prison methods are confined to a mere detention of the prisoner.  No effort whatever is made to impart any education to the prisoner such as might be calculated to bring him back to the path of rectitude.</P>
    <P>On this Estimate I want to raise the question of the administration of the Gárda Compensation Act of 1941. When passed, its purpose in the main was to deal with a situation which had arisen out of the murder of Gárdaí throughout the country in 1940 and in earlier years.  When the 1941 Act was going through the House, I think the Minister gave an assurance that the claims of the next-of-kin of Gárdaí who had lost their lives prior to the 1st January, 1940, and who were not covered by the retrospective provisions of the 1941 Act, would be sympathetically reviewed.  I understand that efforts have since been made to secure a review of the cases of the next-of-kin of Gárdaí who lost their lives prior to the 1st January, 1940.  But although every possible effort has been made to induce the Minister to review these cases in accordance with what, I think, was an implied assurance in 1941, so far not a single one of them has been reviewed with any beneficial effects, so far as the next-of-kin of deceased Gárdaí are concerned.  The position prior to the 1st January, 1940&mdash;that is prior to the effective date of the 1941 Act&mdash;in the case of a Gárda who was murdered or lost his life because of the malicious intent of other persons, was that an action on the part of the next-of-kin could not succeed unless the next-of-kin were in a position to prove that there was personal malice against the Gárda who was murdered or against the Gárda who was maimed and seriously injured.  A number of cases were brought before the courts prior to the 1st January, 1940.  In these cases efforts were made to establish that the circumstances of the Gárda's death were such as to justify the substantiation of a claim for the payment of a certain scale of compensation, but, because of the difficulty of proving personal malice against the deceased Gárda, practically all these cases <Col N="1112" /> failed.  Certainly, large numbers of them were lost, and the next-of-kin were placed in the unfortunate position that not only did they get no compensation but they were privileged to pay the costs of an unsuccessful legal action.</P>
    <P>As I see it, the obvious purpose of the 1941 Act&mdash;I think the Minister indicated that it was so at the time&mdash;was to remedy a flaw in the legislation which was operative prior to the introduction of that measure, and to give the next-of-kin of members of the Gárda Síochána who lost their lives through malice or physical violence in the course of the execution of their duty the opportunity of going before the courts and claiming such compensation as the courts believed that they were entitled to.  The Gárdaí at that time believed that the Act would be generously interpreted by the courts and that in its interpretation what are described as Lord Campbell's scales of benefit would be made operative so far as scales of compensation were concerned.  Since the 1941 Act became law a number of claims for compensation have been brought before the courts, but the result of them has only served to disillusion the members of the Gárda force because they now see that the presentation of claims under the 1941 Act, which was intended, I think, to remedy the flaws in the pre-1941 legislation, has only served to place Guards in as bad, if not in a worse position, than they were in prior to 1941.</P>
    <P>Since the 1941 Act was passed, a number of claims for compensation have been brought by the next-of-kin of Gárdaí who were murdered or of those who were seriously injured in the course of their duties.  The maximum award in death cases has been the sum of £650.  I suggest to the Minister that an award of that sort is completely at variance with the spirit in which the 1941 Act was conceived and completely contrary to the spirit in which it was passed by the Dáil.  My recollection of the discussions on the 1941 Act convinces me that, so far as the House is concerned, it was genuinely anxious that the dependents of any Guard who lost his life in the <Col N="1113" /> execution of his duty on behalf of the whole community should be generously treated by the legislature and generously treated by the courts. The results of the cases which have so far come before the courts do not in any way indicate that there has been a generous interpretation of the legislation passed by this House.  Although the 1941 Act was introduced for the purpose of remedying flaws in the pre-1941 legislation and of providing fair compensation for the dependents of the Gárda Síochána who lost their lives in the execution of their duty, the Gárdaí are now in the position in which if they have the choice of being shot to pieces in the execution of their duty or of being knocked down by a motor car, it is much better for them to be knocked down by a motor car than to be shot to death in the execution of their duty.  Suppose a criminal sets out to raid a bank, holds up a Guard and says to him: &ldquo;I will shoot you to death or, if you like, you can fall under the motor car that is coming along and let me into the bank; if you do I will not shoot you.&rdquo; If the Guard were to enter into negotiations with the criminal and say: &ldquo;All right; you get into the bank and I will fall under the motor car,&rdquo; the Guard's family would be better off by his falling under the motor car than by attempting to disarm the person who was about to rob the bank.  I do not think our legislation ever contemplated a situation of that kind, but that is the fact and that is the result of the legislation which we have passed.</P>
    <P>The fixation of compensation in the vicinity of a sum of £650 by the High Courts in recent cases, and upheld by the Supreme Court, means that if a Guard feels he is going out on a very dangerous job which is likely to result in his death, it is better for him to be knocked down by a motor car than to attempt to defend the property of the State or the lives of the citizens. I suggest that is a situation which was never envisaged when the 1941 Act was introduced.  It is completely contrary to the spirit in which the Act was passed and it calls for immediate <Col N="1114" /> remedy if we are not to continue to inflict serious injury on those who are the custodians of law and order in this country.</P>
    <P>Bad and all as that situation is, it is really worse when you follow the interpretation of the law by the courts in a recent case.  It has been decided in a case in which a detective-sergeant lost his life that the awards made by the court are subject to this condition, that they must be governed by the value of the assets held by the deceased Guard.  A case occurred some time ago where a detective-sergeant was shot in the execution of his duty.  His widow brought a claim for compensation and, after hearing the evidence, the High Court awarded compensation.  The case was appealed and the judgment of the Supreme Court was that the next of kin should get £650 as compensation, less the assets of the deceased sergeant.  The sergeant who was shot dead in the execution of his duty had a house, valued approximately at £350, which he had willed to his wife.  Out of the £650 compensation awarded to the widow and dependents the value of the house was deducted.  The widow received the £650 compensation, less the value of the house, just as if the State had given the widow the house and not her husband, who had managed to gather together the cost of the house by prudence and thrift in the course of his service as a member of the Gárda Síochána.</P>
    <P>I think that is an outrageous conception of the law.  It is an outrageous situation that a member of the Gárda Síochána who loses his life in the execution of his duty and who leaves a widow and children, should be treated in that fashion.  The interpretation of the Act results in the next-of-kin getting a low scale of compensation, but the most vicious and incomprehensible aspect of the matter is that whatever assets a Guard had through his thrift and prudence are deducted from the compensation which the widow gets.</P>

      <P>Before you took the Chair I was calling attention to the fact that, when the Bill was going through the House, the Minister indicated the purpose behind it, the spirit of it, and I was adverting to the atmosphere in which the Bill passed through the House.  I am now endeavouring to direct the attention of the Minister to the fact that it was believed the Bill would remedy flaws in previous legislation. In its interpretation now it is doing anything but that.  I want to call the attention of the Minister to the manner in which what I then believed was his assurance is now being implemented. I do not intend to delay much further on that point and perhaps the Chair will allow me to finish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister, although this is a matter in which he ought to take the initiative, that where a member of the Gárda Síochána loses his life in the course of his duty we ought to provide a generous scale of compensation for his dependents.  A generous scale is not being provided and if the Minister wants to get the Guards at the highest possible pitch of efficiency he will say to every member of that body: &ldquo;If you serve the State and if, in the course of doing so, you lose your life and thereby deprive your wife and children of your company, assistance and the protection which you can give them, then the State will stand behind your widow and children and make sure they will not suffer hardship because of the loss of your income.&rdquo;  I was saying that under a recent judgment the courts decided, in the case of a member of the Guards who lost his life, to award £650 to his dependents, less the amount of his assets.  The value of the Guard's house was subtracted from the compensation awarded.  If you pursue that further and if the Guard had a house valued at £700 and not £350, then the widow who had lost her husband would get no compensation at all because under the recent court ruling the assets exceeded the compensation and, <Col N="1116" /> therefore, no compensation would be paid.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this debate, but there <Col N="1117" /> have been a number of Deputies who talked about juvenile delinquency and who made a very strong case in relation to the bad effect that the cinema has on children's minds.  I am prepared to admit that probably certain films are in no way suitable for children.  But I do not believe that the increase in juvenile crime has been in any way caused by films.  I can remember in my young days, when there were not quite as many picture houses as there are at present, when the Sexton Blake and Buffalo Bill books were supposed to be responsible. So far as I can remember, there was an exceedingly high moral tone in these little books.  Virtue was always triumphant and wrong was always found out in the end.  Anybody who took up these books would see that they could not have done any boy any harm.  It was often said to me that it was very bad to read these, that it would affect my knowledge of English and that I might get very bad ideas.  I do not know whether my knowledge of the English language was corrupted, but certainly my morals were not corrupted in any way by them.</P>
      <P>The question of juvenile crime is a very big one to enter into exhaustively. It arises from a number of things; but I believe that social conditions are at the root of most crimes, whether adult or juvenile.  If we improve our social conditions to the extent to which we would like to see them improved, juvenile crime will decrease and, of course, adult crime with it.  Crime, of course, comes from many things, but it is the bad child of social conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another question I should like to touch upon is the health of the Civic Guards.  Speaking from memory, I think that within the last year or two it was stated that the incidence of tuberculosis was pretty high among the Civic Guards.  I do not know what information the Minister has on that matter, but I would be very glad to get the explanations that his experts advance for that situation.  In a country such as ours it does seem wrong that amongst our Guards we should have a high tuberculosis rate, or at any rate <Col N="1118" /> a rate higher than the general rate of tuberculosis amongst police forces.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on the way in which he handles juvenile crime.  But I should like to say to him that, while a good measure of praise is due to him for the way in which he is beginning to tackle that problem, the country generally has not any reason to feel satisfied that we are really dealing with this matter in the very best possible fashion.  We are beginning to realise that children are not necessarily criminals.  While we are realising that, we do not seem to have the physical facilities for dealing with this matter&mdash; the proper remand homes and the properly segregated institutions, or at least enough of them.  Our minds are awake to the problem, but we have not yet put our hands in our pockets and spent the necessary money.  I am sure the Minister would be whole-heartedly in favour of such a policy and I would urge on him the necessity for that. Educated public opinion in this country will applaud any increased efforts that are made for dealing with this problem.  We are one of the small countries of the world, and if the small countries have any contribution to make&mdash;and I believe they have&mdash; their contribution must lie largely in the things of the mind and in social order and justice.  I personally will not feel satisfied until I see Ireland leading in this matter of dealing with juvenile and other crimes.  I would put that point of view to the Minister, and I am certain that he will get the enthusiastic support of the people in dealing with that matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>There are only a few points which I wish to put to the Minister.  The first is the question of the attendance at dance halls.  If I am not mistaken, the law as it stands provides that young people under 18 years of age should not be allowed into dance halls.  There is great abuse in connection with that matter which I think could be easily dealt with.  I understand that the onus is on the Civic Guards and the owners of dance halls to check the ages of those attending such dances.  I think the Civic Guards <Col N="1119" /> or the dance hall owners should not have any liability in regard to that matter further than to get the names of the young people concerned and that the parents should be made responsible. Young people do not carry their birth certificates with them to dances, and when a Guard goes into a dance hall it is not easy for him to say whether young people are under 18 years of age.  I think it should be made punishable for parents to allow their children under that age to go to dance halls, where it can be proved that they have given their consent, even tacit consent.</P>
      <P>A good deal has been said about the power of films for good or evil on young people.  Several Deputies suggested that special films should be provided for young people and I thoroughly agree with that.  I think there should be special films for young people, as I believe that the films usually provided for grown-ups are not suitable for those under 16 years, or perhaps a year or two older.  I think it would be a great step forward if something could be done along that line.  It should be easy to provide suitable films for young people which would be good for them.</P>
      <P>A good deal has been said on the matter of drink, and I think there should be some tightening up in that regard.  There is no doubt that there are abuses, particularly by young people.  Fortunately, it is only on a very small scale, but there is not a shadow of doubt that young people are indulging in drink.  There is a danger that that might spread and become a great evil.  There is no doubt too that young girls take drink, particularly at dances, and it is causing grave concern at the moment both to the parents and to the clergy.  It does not happen very often, but from my own experience I know that that habit is creeping into the country districts. I suppose it is being copied from the so-called upper classes.  It is only in its infancy at the moment, as most young girls have a natural abhorrence of drink, but the practice is definitely creeping in, and is causing great concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1120" /> Yesterday evening, we had the strangest occurrence in this House.  I think we must be the only Legislative Assembly in Europe that can claim to have a prophet amongst its members. Yesterday evening Deputy Dillon foretold that Deputy O Cléirigh would twist Deputy Cafferky's remarks on the subject of drink in County Mayo.  He said that Deputy O Cléirigh had just left the House to lubricate his throat&mdash; I think those were the words he used&mdash; before returning to the fray.  Strange to relate, that prophecy was fulfilled this evening.  I do not want to defend Deputy Cafferky; there is no need to do that.  But Deputy Cafferky is young; he may not be as cautious in the use of words as he will be when he has had more experience here in the House. Every Deputy is free to put whatever construction he likes on another Deputy's statements, but I was listening to Deputy Cafferky and I think he conveyed quite clearly that what he was referring to were the rare cases of abuse in connection with drink.  I took it from Deputy O Cléirigh's speech here this evening that he was actually condoning drink.  He said that the people of County Mayo were not by any means addicted to drink.  Of course, the vast majority are not, the same as in any other county in Ireland, but we must take the rare cases into account.  We would not condemn a whole flock of sheep because there is one black sheep amongst them, and neither do we condemn the whole countryside as drunkards simply because there are a few drunkards.  What Deputy Cafferky clearly condemned is the fact that parents on some occasions allow their children in to public houses while they themselves are taking drink.  Deputy Cafferky told nothing but the truth in that case, and I think it was a very unfair misrepresentation on Deputy O Cléirigh's part to construe his speech in that way.</P>
    <P>A few Deputies, both on the Fine Gael and the Fianna Fáil Benches, think they have done their duty to their country and made a great contribution to the debate if they open their speeches with a broadside attack on Clann na Talmhan.  We do not by any means apologise for our attendance <Col N="1121" /> here, and the Deputies who make those attacks seem to convey that they would like us to do so.  I do not think there were four speakers on any side of the House during the debate on the Agriculture Estimate who did not open their speeches by an attack on us.  I do not see what that contributes to the debate.  My idea of a contribution to the debates here is that every speaker, whether he is a solicitor or anything else, should put his own views before the Minister.  If he thinks the Minister and his Department have not done their duty, let them have it.  That is my idea of a contribution to the debate&mdash;perhaps I am all wrong.  I cannot see how far it gets this House or where it gets any Deputy to make an attack on any other Deputy.  Deputy Ó Cléirigh on two occasions has devoted practically his whole speech to painting Deputy Cafferky as being this, that or the other thing.  I cannot see how the House is interested in that kind of speech.  Deputy Cafferky, to my mind, made a very good case in pointing out certain abuses that exist in South Mayo, his own constituency, and he was perfectly right in doing so.  I take all this misrepresentation as a direct attempt at intimidation to prevent Deputy Cafferky and other members on the Clann na Talmhan Benches from speaking at all.  I am sorry to have to take up the time of the House in referring to these matters, because I do not believe in personal abuse, but it has occurred so often that it has become disgusting.</P>
    <P>I should like particularly to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that young girls are drinking.  I do not know whether it is possible for him to take action in that regard. There is no doubt that, especially in the case of dances in towns, girls under 20 years of age, particularly around holiday time and Christmas, can be seen drunk, as a direct result, I believe, of being in company with male companions who are no better than sharks in human form.  I think there should be more rigid supervision of the sale of drink on those occasions. The practice is only in its infancy yet, and now is the time to nip it in the bud.  If the Minister or his officials <Col N="1122" /> can devise any means of checking it I think it is their duty to do so.</P>

      <P>I think the debate here was very good and very informative.  It took longer than usual, but my opinion is that it was time well spent.  There were some very useful contributions.  I think the best line I can take is to go through the speeches of the different Deputies, and when I come to some point that I can raise generally I will spend some time on that.  I will deal with most of the minor points raised, and I hope with all the major ones.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, who was the first speaker, seemed to suggest that I very lightly brushed aside the crime position. I do not think I did any such thing.  I said it was an undoubted fact that crime had not increased since last year, but that still it was double what it was in normal times, and I deplored that.  I gave what I thought was one of the reasons for that&mdash;the shortage of supplies.  It is not confined to one section of the community.  I think it was suggested last year that the unemployed and the poorer sections of the community were responsible.  That is not so.  We are aware that in times like these, when money will not buy everything, even those who have plenty of money will steal things.  They might have money to buy them, but they cannot get them for money.  We had cases of men with enormous salaries being put in the dock for stealing things which they would buy if they could get them.  I think it is very largely the scarcity of commodities which people are not prepared to do without that is responsible for a lot of the increase in crime.  I hope that will not be taken as an excuse for it, but that is the fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the best speeches I heard during this debate was made by Deputy Linehan.  He really put the blame on the right shoulders.  Some people are inclined to say that the schools are to blame; others will say that the Church has not done its work properly; but very few got as near the mark as Deputy Linehan, who put the major responsibility&mdash;some of the Clann na Talmhan Deputies also did so&mdash;on the parents.  I think that is where the <Col N="1123" /> major blame belongs.  There certainly is a lessening of parental control, and when children get to a certain age, when they reach their teens, it is rather late to begin to exercise control.  I believe that is one of the most menacing situations we have to meet to-day with regard to juvenile crime&mdash;that parents do not exercise proper control over their children and that whatever efforts are made by clergy or teachers in schools are not backed up to the extent to which they should be by the parents.</P>
    <P>Deputy Linehan also drew attention to another big failing from which the whole of the Irish people&mdash;it may be, and probably is, due to our history&mdash;suffer, that is, the reluctance on the part of practically any of us to help those in authority, to help the Guards.  He instanced a case&mdash;I do not know whether it was an actual case or an example of what might happen &mdash;of 20 people watching a man stripping a bicycle, not one of whom would be prepared to give evidence.  I think that is largely true, and so long as we have that spirit, so long as people do not recognise that the Guards are there to protect them, and until the people are prepared to co-operate with them, I do not think we shall get very far in arresting crime. We could talk about the causes of juvenile delinquency for ages, and I would very much like to have an exhaustive inquiry into its causes, to see what remedies could be suggested.  I do not know whether I would be able to get any such commission going, but I shall look into it and see what can be done.  My belief is that one of the major causes of the whole problem is this lack of parental control.</P>
    <P>With regard to what is happening in relation to these offenders and the social position, so to to speak, of the children who have been dealt with, I got the police to compile certain information, which, I think, will be useful, relating to juveniles charged in 1942, which, I think, would be fairly representative of what happens in any year and setting out what these crimes are attributable to.  In that year there were 3,350 cases.  Of these the police <Col N="1124" /> held lack of parental control to be responsible for 1,348 cases; youthful gang influence, 354; criminal association, 109; ordinary mischief, 521; desire to get money for amusement, 832; and necessity, about 186. The occupations of the parents were: industrial workers, 266; agricultural workers, 299; casual labourers, 936; other occupations, 1,220; and no occupation, 629.</P>

      <P>I suppose people of no employment, but I really cannot say whether it means people who are unemployed or people who never worked at all.  With regard to the types of houses these offenders came from, in the case of 498, they were from tenement houses; 1,064 were from houses of three rooms or less; and 1,788 from houses of more than three rooms.  I think we can deduce from these figures that it is not the very poor who are responsible for most of these offences. The total number of boys between the ages of 12 and 18 in the Twenty-Six Counties in 1942 was in the neighbourhood of 200,000, and, of these, 2,340, or 15 per cent., were prosecuted during that year for indictable offences.  As to how they were dealt with in the courts, of the 3,350 charged in that year, in 284 cases the charges were not proved, were withdrawn, were dismissed or otherwise disposed of, leaving 3,066 cases.  The number of cases dismissed under the Probation of Offenders Act was 1,395; discharged on recognisances, 600; discharged under the supervision of a probation officer, 348; committed to care of relative or other fit person, 12; fined, 239; whipped, four; committed to industrial schools, 121; committed to reformatory schools, 130; sentenced to detention in a place of detention&mdash;like Summerhill, or the present place of detention, Marlboro House, for a very short time&mdash;19; sentenced to imprisonment, 119; and otherwise disposed of, 79.  I do not know what the effect of these sentences on these children is likely to be.</P>

      <P>No, indictable offences. A question which has been raised several times and particularly by Deputy Connolly&mdash;and Deputy McGilligan referred to it to-night&mdash;is this question of the necessity for appointing more probation officers.  Deputy McGilligan suggested that we had allowed Finance to stop us in this matter.  I can assure him that that is not the case at all.  I am not satisfied that extra probation officers will do the job, and I told Deputy Connolly, in answer to a question, that, after full consideration, my opinion was that societies of the type of the St. Vincent de Paul Society and others in different parts of the country can, on what is called application, become registered societies and grants may be made to help them in their work.  I recommended Deputy Connolly to try to get that done in Dundalk and I now strongly recommend him to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that the probation officers perform a useful function, but they simply cannot do this job.  I believe the whole community will have to lend a hand, and societies of this kind, composed of public-spirited people&mdash;and there are, thank God, numbers of them in this country&mdash;should be encouraged in every way to help in this work.  We have made a very good start in the city, as I have said several times.  His Grace the Archbishop got in touch a couple of years ago with the Legion of Mary, and in each area they got volunteers to co-operate with the whole-time probation officers in helping to look after these children. Special classes have been held for probationers in different parts of the city. They have not been quite as successful as we would wish, but I think a good beginning has been made, and on these lines far more will be done, I think, than by employing another 16 or 18 probation officers.  I have no objection to approaching Finance and would have no difficulty in getting the Minister for Finance to agree to give me any extra assistance of that kind which I want.  I do think the money would be much better spent in making grants to organisations of the kind I have mentioned, who will look upon it as a <Col N="1126" /> social duty and privilege to help those young people who require it and try to get them into useful ways of life and away from crime.</P>
    <P>I am well aware that a lot of this is due to the social conditions.  I appreciate what Deputy McGilligan has said.  I have not had the experience he has had in attending the court. I have never been in the Circuit Court. I realise the position and the difficulty. The Guards are told that football must not be allowed on the streets.  As a general rule, if the Guards see that it is not likely to lead to any accident, I think they turn a blind eye to it. There may be cases where young Guards may be over-officious and haul a lot of these young boys in.  I do not know to what extent that occurs. Deputy McGilligan seemed to think a lot of that is done.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also pointed out the need for more playgrounds.  I fully realise that, too.  Until we are able to improve social conditions generally, especially in the large towns, it will be very difficult to rectify this situation. There is no use in blaming the Guards or the Government.  It is a job in which we must all lend a hand.  A start&mdash;a modest start&mdash;has been made, and certainly it is on the right lines. I do not think that lack of funds will be responsible if there is any failure. I appeal to Deputies to help as much as they can, by getting societies of that kind into the different districts. The Department will give all the cooperation possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that is not a matter for me.  Certainly, I will do everything I can, as a member of the Government, in that matter.  There was one question about whipping.  I am going to take a chance of being put down as a brutal sort of person by my remarks.  Some Deputy did say that, for the recent type of crime of snatching women's handbags and striking people on the head and robbing them, we will have to resort to that punishment. That may not appeal to Deputy Connolly, but I certainly stand for <Col N="1127" /> that.  In the case of the district justice in Dundalk who sentenced boys to be birched, if it had not been for the flaw in the sentence, I would not have intervened.  A lot of the evil is due to the parents not doing what they should do, that is, give them a good hiding and knock a bit of obedience into them.  In the case of those particular boys, they had apparently got completely out of hand, and the parents had repudiated their responsibility. We cannot put them all into schools. If I were to make a suggestion to district justices, I would say that they should get more after the parents and fine the parents heavily.  That may bring home to them the duty they have to the children they brought into the world, and make them realise they should not throw the whole burden on the State.  So far, the number of sentences to birchings has been very small, but I am certainly not going to remove that from the Statute Book. It may be necessary, and if justices see fit to impose such sentences, I certainly am not going to interfere with their discretion.  I do not care what name I get for that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is.  As far as I understand it, birching is not the good hiding it ought to be.  There is that difference.  The Guards who have the job of administering these punishments are big, hefty men with soft hearts.  It may read ferocious and fierce, but if Deputy Connolly were present, he would have a different impression.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to see such young lads get a really good hiding from someone, if the justice thinks fit. If justices read my remarks, I suggest they consider punishing the parents, in order to bring home to them that it is their job.  In saying all that, I know there is a fundamental cause for all this delinquency, both adult and juvenile.  It is not to-day it arose: it <Col N="1128" /> is there, I suppose, from the beginning of time.  The growth of modern civilisation, this top-heavy city idea, has contributed very largely to it.  If there were some way we could devise, in our organisation of civilisation, to have smaller units rather than big cities, with their inevitable slums, there would be a better chance.  I hope that the planners of the future will make some effort to bear that in mind, in designing towns from now on.</P>
      <P>There is one healthy sign in the way that everyone is thinking of these things.  We seem to be at a crisis of history, where big changes are being made, which may last for quite a long time.  It is very hopeful and helpful to find in this House a concern for the way things are shaping, the way children are becoming delinquents and, particularly, the causes of that delinquency. When human beings set their minds to searching for causes, I believe they will succeed in finding the remedies.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon has been very keen on the Borstal system.  I do not know why it was given that name: I think it was from some house in England.  It is a system of not treating boys altogether as children, but of trying to educate them to better ways.  They are not prisoners with short sentences, they are a type of boys who show signs of becoming hardened young criminals. They have been before the courts and sentenced more than once.  Generally, the judge feels: &ldquo;If I send this boy to Mountjoy, in three or six months he will only be worse; I will send him to Borstal for three years and get the Department of Justice to try to make a good job of him.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I visited the Borstal Institute and, first of all, changed it from Clonmel to Cork Jail.  I must say that Cork Jail is a very poor institution for a work of that kind.  The trouble was that I had not Aladdin's lamp, and, in a time like the present, I could not produce a building, nor could the Office of Public Works produce one.</P>

      <P>Neither Davy Frame nor anyone else.  We searched for houses.  People glibly talk about that and say that houses can be obtained, but I found they would need such adaptation and reconstruction as would make the idea impossible.  I have visited several of them and have come to the conclusion that we must get a virgin site and build a proper institution, with plenty of ground.  That is my view.  I was speaking to Deputy Dillon to-day about it, but he does not seem to agree.  I have despaired of getting a building at the present time.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, I claim that we have done something towards making this system more like what it was intended to be.  The boys are not locked in cells as they used to be, but are left out until about 10 p.m.  The Cork Jail is not suitable.  We could not get a proper playground there.  After some time we got in touch with those in charge of Cork University and they were kind enough to put one of their playing fields at the disposal of those boys.  There is also a very useful institution in Cork City composed of public spirited citizens which is doing marvellous work of the Borstal kind. It is looking after those boys.  They are given lectures, they are brought out for walks and cycle runs and to play football.  They are taught shoe-making and carpentry.  Generally speaking, an attempt is being made to make them what normal boys ought to be.  I can say that from my own personal experience.  Recently, when returning from playing football three of those boys bolted and so far they have not been caught.  It was put up to me officially that, in consequence, I ought to stop this privilege which they have been enjoying.  I said that I was not going to victimise the boys who did not run away for those who did.  When the Guards catch those who ran away we will have to deal with them.</P>

      <P>I want the House to know that we are taking a practical interest in this question.  I do not hope to solve it, but I hope before I leave office that steps will have been taken in that direction.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney spoke about crimes of violence.  He said they were very much on the increase.  Statistics, as we know, will prove almost anything. I have here some figures with regard to crimes of that sort&mdash;robbery with violence and assault with intent to rob. The figures relate to the period between 1927 and 1943.  There was undoubtedly a big increase last year, but over the whole period there was not a big increase in that type of crime.  In 1927 the number was 66, in 1928, 62. In 1929 the number went down to 42. In 1937 the number was 15.  The figure started to rise again in 1940 and 1941.  In 1942 it went down to 42.  This year there has been a big increase as compared with last year.  The number is 77.  I know it is bad and I am not trying to make little of it or treating it complacently.  At the same time, there is no use in saying that there has been an enormous increase.  There has been an increase, I admit, in this very dangerous type of crime.  I think that the robbery with violence that is now taking place is largely made possible by the partial black-out that we have.</P>

Then there is a case which is <i>sub judice</i> at the moment where a man's body was found in the river.  It looks as if it were one of these cases: that they did not mean to kill him but actually did and then threw the body into the water.  The Guards are doing very good work in unearthing this class of crime.  I think it will be found that there is some sort of a gang operating. One gang has been laid by the heels, and I believe the Guards will get to the bottom of that particular crime.</P>

      <P>I think that is all I have to say about crime.  Deputy Fitgzerald-Kenney spoke about dance halls. Deputy Blowick said that we could not expect the Guards to be at every dance hall, or the dance hall people to get the birth certificates of all the young people coming to the dances.  Deputy Linehan and Deputy Blowick put the responsibility for these matters on parents and said that they should exercise more care.  It would be hard to expect the Guards to follow young people to find out whether they were 18 years of age or not and whether they were going to dances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of drink, since the Intoxicating Liquor Act of last year was passed the Guards are now in a position to deal with anybody who attempts to get drink after 12 o'clock at night.  I think they are trying to do that.  As country Deputies are aware, the position prior to the passing <Col N="1132" /> of that Act was that once 12 o'clock came on a Sunday night people who lived three miles away from a public-house were entitled to go in and get drink.  In fact, they could remain there until closing hour the next night.  That is not possible now.  I think that the Guards are enforcing this Act.  They will have no excuse, if they are not doing so, by saying that they did not know whether the people found on the premises were <i>bona fide</i> travellers or not.  Nobody is allowed to drink on licensed premises now after 12 o'clock at night except in cases where a special permit has been obtained from the district justice.  Before the 1943 Act was passed, if there was a dance hall in a village, and a public-house near it, there was nothing, as I have said, to prevent people going into the public-house after 12 o'clock at night and getting drink.  The Guards could not interfere with them.  They often had a great difficulty in knowing whether the young people who went in for drink lived over the prescribed distance or not.  That is no longer the case and, unless the courts give a special permission, the Guards will have no difficulty in bringing it home to the publican and to those on the premises.</P>
    <P>Deputy Linehan made a very useful speech and I think it was he who said that perhaps the district justice would consider fining the people who go in after hours more heavily than the owner of the public-house.  I think there is a lot of commonsense in that. It is rather hard to expect the person who owns the premises and who earns his living by it to turn out customers if they are there after hours.  If the district justices will take notice of that and consider it, it might lead to an improvement.  I think the position ought to be better as regards drinking at dances than it was last year.  If it is not, then the Guards must be slack in the areas where it is done, because they have not the excuse they had before.</P>

The whole community will have to take notice of this thing and the people will have to do their best to help.  If we do not arouse public support it will be no good.  It is not altogether a police job.  The police cannot attend to everything.</P>
      <P>As regards internment, when we were first interned in 1916 there is no question that that internment was one of the most foolish things the British Government ever did.  We certainly did organise the whole of Ireland.  But, after the Civil War, I was interned for a little over two years and it was quite a different situation.  We had time to cool our heels, to weigh up the situation and to study the <i>pros</i> and <i>cons.</i> A prisoner is not going to humiliate himself to anybody.  I would not do it, and we do not expect other men to do it.  Nevertheless, they had their minds made up that it was futile, seeing they had been beaten in the fight that took place over the Treaty, to continue.  The vast majority of the men interned felt like that.  That was my own opinion from the day I was captured, but nobody knew it, because I would not let anybody know it.  I was not prepared to eat my words.  All the same, that was my opinion and it was the opinion held by others that it was absolutely futile to continue. Therefore, the internment in that case had quite a different effect.</P>
      <P>I felt satisfied from a close examination of the people interned that I would be able to release so many.  They were able to weigh up the situation and they asked themselves whether they would go on and what would it lead to and, except for the hard core that we were likely to have for a good while, the internment had a very good effect, a salutary effect, and it made these people far more reasonable than when they were interned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to draw attention to the changed situation that we are in to-day <Col N="1134" /> as compared with the time when the internment was first undertaken.  We have a different House.  In the last Dáil, from the very beginning of the internment, every Party in the House knew about it.  We had our Defence Conference, and I could get the views of the main Opposition and the Labour Party, and any Independents I wished to consult, with the result that for the whole period of the internment there was not one question raised in the last Dáil.  That shows that the position was fairly satisfactory, and people must have been satisfied.  We had no fully organised L.D.F. then.  In every area in the country there was an element which was likely to be a very serious menace.  When the matter was raised last July, I drew attention to the circumstances in which we found ourselves when a certain document was captured, a document which planned, as far as we could see, for a projected invasion of this country, when that same organisation had actually carried out the operation that Deputy Anthony referred to to-day, the so-called war, and taken on themselves the right that only this House has.</P>
    <P>That organisation, not very numerous, was still rather widespread in that there was scarcely a parish in which it was not represented.  Consequently, to make sure of our position, it was felt by the whole House&mdash; otherwise the Government would not have got the powers&mdash;that it was absolutely necessary to take these people and prevent them doing what we were satisfied they were prepared to do if the opportunity arose.  All Parties in the State combined; we got our local defence forces together and now we are in the happy position that there is not a corner of the country in which they are not strong.  The result was that a lot of these people were released.  I have been asked how many of these people went back on their word.  I have not asked the majority of these people to give any undertaking whatever. I would not give very much for any undertaking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>You said here that the keys were in their own pockets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, if they wished to avail of them.  I think I know the case <Col N="1135" /> of every individual who is interned.  It is not a question of examining a case to-day and again in six months.  Almost every day I have gone into this matter, because I feel a personal responsibility, and I know how serious it is to take the liberty of a man even for one minute, not to mention a year.  There are some men in there for four years. Others have been let out.  I would not give tuppence for the word of most of them.  Talking of undertakings, some are offering to give any undertaking, and I would not, from the information at my disposal, be prepared to risk letting them out.  There are others with whom the Guards could easily deal if they got out of hand.  That was why I referred to the keys being in their own pockets.  As regards those who, up to this, claim that they have the right to involve us in war or, worse still, to take the life of any citizen here, as long as I have a say in the matter I certainly will not agree to let them out amongst the public.  I have no right to do it.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan asked me how this matter would be dealt with.  When the internment first started, there was a tribunal set up to review the cases of people interned.  We put a High Court judge there, and only one or two cases went before him.  I saw right away that it was going to be no good.  I explained the whole matter to the Defence Conference at the time.  I said that people who, I was perfectly certain, were aiding and abetting and very actively doing valuable work for this organisation, had been recommended for release by the tribunal, and things would not be easy if that system were to continue.  It would mean that I would have to get evidence to convince the tribunal that it was not advisable to have those releases. If I had that evidence I would put it before the court.  The organisation was of such a type that they worked in secret and conspired together and decided to take people's lives.  They were able to cover up those who committed those crimes, and we had to intern them without trial for the reason that we simply could not get proof.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know what the position of the last Government was.  I was told about <Col N="1136" /> my attitude here to the Constitutional Amendment.  I think I made my attitude clear in the speech that I made on that occasion.  I undoubtedly did not support it.  I may have been wrong, but I did think that, if a break were given at one particular time, things might be better.  We gave that break.  We did it more than once, but it was proved conclusively that the more leniency or softness we showed towards these people the worse they got.  We are certainly in this position, that we tried the other method but it did not succeed.  I am not saying that the other Government did not try it.  I admit that probably it would have the same result.  I thought genuinely at the time that if we did try that method we would have good results.  I am perfectly satisfied now that if a new Government had been elected last June, and if they did what we did in 1932 there would have been disastrous results if they let out all these people.  One of the reasons why we have so little of this violence now is because we have the most dangerous of these people under lock and key.  There are some of them we have not got.</P>
    <P>When one of the bravest men belonging to one of the best families of this country was murdered in Rathfarnham as a result of a cowardly ambush with machine-guns, we issued advertisements and published photographs of the people we wanted to interview, but we could not get any help.  We could not get them.  It is a fact that immediately after that gallant man was murdered these people actually cycled through a crowd who were standing at the gate over the dead body of that murdered man, and yet we could get no help from anybody. That is what we are up against.  Three of these people, as I said last July, gave a solemn undertaking that they were through with all this thing.  That is what we are up against.  When Deputy Connolly in his innocence, if it is innocence&mdash;I do not see how it could be; in view of what I said last July I am afraid it is a little more than that&mdash;suggested that we should bring the remainder of these people up for trial, he was simply trying to fool himself.  He certainly is not <Col N="1137" /> going to fool me or the country.  The fact is that we cannot get the evidence. We have knowledge that the most dangerous elements in that body are interned. There are some others whom we should like to get and hold, too.  So far as I can see, we will get no good of this organisation by any more soft work.  Even if the war were over, until we can make sure that these people are not going to take on themselves the right to take human life, it would be very dangerous to set them at liberty.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan asked what happens in these cases.  In every case, I do not wait until I am asked.  I have a periodical look through all the names.  If anybody asks me to review any case, any Deputy or any relation of any interned person, I immediately do it.  I have refused in one case; I have refused Deputy Connolly and will continue to do so.  The man concerned is prepared to sign any undertaking, but I would not give a snap of the fingers for it.  That is not because of what the Gárdaí tell me.  I am perfectly satisfied myself.  Deputy O'Donnell mentioned another man.  He may have high ideals and all that, but the man he is referring to, in my opinion, is a dangerous gunman who cannot be let out.  I am sorry to say that he is not in good health, but in my opinion he is a dangerous man and I would not take the responsibility at a time like this of ordering his release. There are people of that type there.  I cannot prove these things.  I have the information which enables me to take that decision and the last Dáil anyway unanimously gave me that power.  I think that is as satisfactory as it can be.  There is not a case that is not inquired into.  If I had not given satisfaction, I think I would be told so.  I am open to hear of any change of mind on the part of these people, but it must be genuine.  I must have regard to the fact that I believe anyway that three of these people had a hand in that murder.  One of them, whom we suspected of two other murders of Guards, gave a most solemn undertaking that he was through with all this thing, and persuaded the Guards to that effect; so much so, that <Col N="1138" /> I myself questioned the Guards and they stated they were perfectly satisfied and that is the result.</P>
    <P>As to the pay of the Guards, which was raised by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, and other Deputies, of course any Minister in charge of the Department would like to pay the Guards as much as he could.  I know that they are not in the same position as they were at the start of the emergency, but nobody else is either.  The value of everybody's money is gone down by the same amount.  We have all had to do without things we could have got before the war.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely £2 a week is not sufficient?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another matter which I shall deal with in a moment. I would certainly like to have the Guards in as strong a financial position as possible.  When I put that matter before the Minister for Finance, I tried to get better treatment for the Guards and I nearly got away with it. I thought I had got it, but I was caught out, because immediately I tried to get a bigger increase for the Guards every member of the Civil Service naturally expected the same and everybody had to be treated on the same basis.  The teachers and others had to get an increase; the Minister for Finance could not discriminate. The Gárdaí are undoubtedly going through a hard time, but is there anybody in the country who is not? Everybody has to do without something that he could get before; even people who have plenty of money. They cannot get the things they were able to get before.  There is only a limited amount of goods available and any increase in pay will not produce the goods.  We have to ration them and make them go round as far as we can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the £2 for recruits, Deputy Larkin was not a member of the House when that was discussed.  I was pressed very strongly as to why I agreed to that.  The position was that we had the usual fight with Finance. We were pressing every year for an increased rent allowance for Guards and <Col N="1139" /> it was taken off one section and given to another.  I had to accept that.  I insisted that, if we had to accept that, we should lower the age for recruits. I would not stand for an initial pay of £2 per week for a man of 27 years. We reduced the age for entrance to 22 at first and then it was raised to 23.  The position is that that £2 per week is paid to very young men when they are in training.  The training takes about six moths.  When they go out on beat duty they get an increment of 10/- and, in addition to that, they get a bonus of 10/-.  I admit that that is not a princely salary.  I understand that they are in the Depot for six months while training and they get £2 while they are there.  For young men it is tolerable enough.  I was prepared to accept it anyhow at the time, and I think the House accepted the compromise that we made on that occasion.  But, when they start out on duty, they get £3 per week.  We also got a steeper increase for them in the rate of increment than was at first suggested.</P>
    <P>As to the Rule-making Committee, Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney does not seem to realise that there has been a change in the matter.  During the discussion of the Courts of Justice Act of 1936 two leading Deputies on the other side, Mr. Lavery and Mr. Costello, insisted that a representative of the Minister for Justice should not be on that Rule making Committee and the Minister gave way, with the result that there is no representative of the Minister on the Rule-making Committee. It is a matter entirely for the legal profession. Some are nominated.  If the Deputy will look up the Courts of Justice Act, 1936, he will find that it is a matter entirely for the legal profession and the judges.  The Incorporated Law Society and the Bar Council appoint their representatives and the judges are also represented.  They have not been able to arrange matters. There is, probably, some force in the point made by the Deputy that we should reconsider the whole position and try to get away from that system. I cannot imagine any satisfactory amendment of the court rules being <Col N="1140" /> effected without the active help of some of the judges.  Deputy Davin raised a question regarding the film censor's increase of salary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">

      <P>During our own time, that was also the position.  I have taken this matter up with the Minister for Finance.  I do not know how far I shall succeed, but he will, probably, make some allowance towards barrack-cleaning. I told Deputy Norton that we are not satisfied with the Act governing compensation for Guards injured in the course of their duty and the dependents of Guards who are killed in the course of their duty.  We had to wait to get the exact judgment of the Supreme Court.  In due course, we shall introduce an amending Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Deputy Davin wanted to know why we increased the salary of the film censor by 50 per cent.  Everybody knows how efficient the outgoing film censor, Mr. Montgomery, was.  He was not entitled to a pension and his salary was £900.  I was asked by the Chairman of the Film Appeals Board to get some provision made for Mr. Montgomery on retirement. His successor, Dr. Hayes, very generously offered to forgo one-third of the salary for the post in order to make provision for Mr. Montgomery&mdash; a thing which we could not do under the law as it stood.  Mr. Montgomery was 70 years of age and had to retire. When he left, he had £300 a year and, when he died, Dr. Hayes got the salary which had been enjoyed by his predecessor. That is the explanation of the increase in the figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A very important and very damaging statement was made by Deputy Davin. He was quite definite in his suggestion <Col N="1141" /> that letters which the police got authority to open had been handed to political supporters of the Government and used for political ends.  He asked me to explain what happens about these letters and how it comes that letters are opened at all.  In certain cases, the police and, in other cases, the Intelligence Department of the Army ask the Minister for Justice to authorise the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to hand over correspondence addressed to certain people or to certain places.  That application comes to me.  I sign the warrant, which is sent to the Army authorities or to high police authorities.  That is done on the requisition of the police or the Army and the warrant is sent to the police or the military, as the case may be, to enable them to obtain and read this correspondence.  I was asked by Deputy Davin if those concerned were under an oath of secrecy.  They are bound by the Official Secrets Act, and if any member of the Gárda or Army were known to disclose any information obtained that way to any unauthorised person, not only would they be dismissed but they would be prosecuted.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin mentioned this particular case some time ago.  He asked me the same question then that he asked me openly last night.  I told him what I have said now&mdash;that these things do happen.  I am not prepared to tell him either the number of such warrants current or the names of the people on that list; but there is such a list. I told him that if he could give me any instance in which a public official had betrayed his trust in that way, I would investigate the matter to the very end and have him dealt with.  There were other persons present when he raised this matter, and I felt fairly sure that he would give me the particulars.  That is about six weeks ago, and I have not got the particulars yet.  I flatly deny his allegation.  I think I am entitled to do that in the absence of the detailed information which I expected to receive from him and which would enable me to prosecute my inquiries. The suggestion was made on the occasion on which the matter was raised that the information could have come <Col N="1142" /> from another quarter.  That is a possibility that cannot be ruled out&mdash;that the letter was handed out from the end to which it was addressed.  Since the Deputy did not give me the minimum details necessary to have the allegation inquired into, I think I am entitled to say that there is no foundation for it. I assure Deputies that correspondence dealt with in that way does not relate to politics, but to the detection of crime and the defence of the State. This course is only taken under warrant by the Minister for Justice authorising the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to hand over the correspondence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Any reasonable Deputy will appreciate the difficulty of carrying on a modern State if such an arrangement were not possible.  I think I have completely refuted Deputy Davin's charge.  Deputy MacEoin put some question about the Land Registry. I had dealt with that matter before he came in and I have dealt with it three or four times since.  Deputy O'Sullivan spoke about juvenile delinquency and the necessity for additional police.  He was probably not present when I was dealing with the matter.  I was surprised at his speech.  I had thought that the first citizen of Dublin would have made himself sure of his facts before making sweeping statements about conditions at Mountjoy Prison.  I do not think that I misrepresent him when I say that he alleged that prisoners were locked up for 18 hours at a stretch. There is no truth whatever in that allegation.  As a matter of fact, before I became Minister for Justice they were undoubtedly locked up for quite <Col N="1143" /> a long time, but never for as long as that.  At 4.30 in the evening they were locked up until about 7 o'clock in the morning.  Having been an old &ldquo;lag&rdquo; myself, I always thought that was too long.  Personally, I did not mind it, because my own company was generally good enough for me, and I could keep my mind occupied by reading, but I know there are other people who are not like that, and it has a very bad effect on them.  One of the first things I did was to change the hour from 4.30 to 7.30, so they are locked up now from 7.30 in the evening until about 7 o'clock in the morning. In addition to that, they get an extra meal.  The last meal they got used to be about 4 o'clock; they get an extra meal now.  I do not pretend that Mountjoy is a heaven on earth, and it was never intended to be. Surely to goodness, not alone must we try to reform those people but there must be some element of punishment. Surely we are not going to be so namby-pamby as to make Mountjoy and Portlaoighise so attractive that there would be a rush for accommodation there.  Mountjoy is not nearly as bad as Deputies have made it out to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>From what the Minister has said I think it must be heaven now compared with when I was in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it can compare with any prison anywhere.  Deputy Connolly asked me to visit the female prison in Mountjoy.  He almost made us all weep by his description of the female prisoners.  It is not so long since I visited Mountjoy, and I made inquiries this morning as to when Deputy Connolly did so.  The Governor has no record of his ever having been there.  I was there not later than last Christmas, and when I was passing through the place where the women prisoners were I thought for a moment that they were nurses they were so neatly dressed.  If any one doubts that, I have one of the costumes conveniently available, and perhaps Mrs. Reynolds or some other Deputy would like to have a look at it.  It is a very neat, bright piece of clothing.  As I <Col N="1144" /> say, when I saw those women there my first impression was that they were a group of nurses.  If Deputy Connolly or Deputy Larkin or any other Deputy in the House wishes to visit the female prison in Mountjoy he has only to let me know, and I will get him a permit to do so&mdash;the Governor will be only too delighted&mdash;and if he can find anything wrong from the point of view of the cleanliness or dress of the women prisoners there I certainly will be astonished.  I admit that the type of clothing of the male prisoners is very bad.  It is warm, but it is a drab kind of uniform; it makes me sick to look at it.  I did ask the Department to see if they could get some better style of dress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is nearly as bad as that of the postmen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not what I would like.  I certainly do agree that dress has an effect.  It can have a very depressing effect or the contrary effect on anybody.  I think we can all admit that.  I do admit that the clothing of the male prisoners is not what I would like it to be, but there would have to be some sort of uniform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now come to another aspect of the prisons raised by, I think, Deputy Connolly, that is the conduct of certain people in Portlaoighise and the alleged inhuman way in which they are treated.  Undoubtedly there is a group down there who will not conform to prison rules.  They say that they are better than the other prisoners.  They have murdered Guards and other people.  Some of them were sentenced to death and reprieved, but still they think they are better than other people and must not be treated as ordinary prisoners at all.  I cannot agree with that at all. I think if people go out and shoot a Guard, and if the Government, after taking all the circumstances into consideration, sees fit to reprieve them, I do not think they are entitled to any better treatment than any other reprieved murderer, and I do not propose to give it to them while I am Minister.  There are other people there who committed crimes of violence.  They robbed with guns; <Col N="1145" /> they terrorised the people; they held up banks and post-offices.  But they will not conform to the prison rules. Am I expected to let them rule the prison?  They are certainly not going to do it.  If they do not see their way to-do what men who are every bit as good as they are&mdash;that is the ordinary prisoners&mdash;have to do, that is their own look-out.  I am certainly not going to be persuaded by them or anybody in this House to change my attitude on that matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I frankly admit that it may have a detrimental effect on the health of those men.  I admit that I am disturbed about it.  It is not a thing I would brush aside lightly; I feel it very much because I have the same softness in me as most Irish people.  I feel it very much but I have to swallow my personal feelings, and until they change their attitude they will not get away with this attempt to wreck the system we have in Portlaoighise.  I said that the conditions in Portlaoighise are better than in Mountjoy because it is the prison to which people with long sentences go.  There is a big farm there and those people could go out on the farm if they wished, or do other useful work of some kind.  But they want to be treated as political prisoners.  They claim even still that they were right; that they had the right to take the lives of servants of this State, and to hold up post-offices and banks and rob them. I am not conceding that, and there is no use in any Deputy trying to appeal to me on any grounds of humanity.  Let them appeal to those who are guilty of those crimes, and who have to take their punishment like every other offender.  I think the net result of raising those matters here is to get those people to persevere in their efforts to break down our system.  I said last July that raising the matter of the hunger strikers had jeopardised the lives of some of those men, because I know myself&mdash;having been on hunger-strike for 40 days&mdash;that the slightest thing, even a letter to the newspapers, will give a man in that condition hope that the Government may give in. <Col N="1146" /> When we had this unfortunate hunger-strike here which resulted in the loss of two young lives, I warned some of those visitors when they persisted in going in that they would have a very grave responsibility indeed&mdash;that every visit was an encouragement to those unfortunate men to persevere in trying to beat the Government, which we could not allow to happen.  Unfortunately, my warning went unheeded, and two young men lost their lives.  It is the same in this case.  If Deputies can be got to raise the cases of people who have been guilty of those crimes, and to try to force the Government to give way, they are only encouraging those people to persevere in an attitude which will eventually, I believe, lead to their permanent loss of health, or may be their reason.  It is their own doing; it is not my doing; although I do admit that I worry about it, not on an occasional time but all the time.  I never forget it, but I cannot see that I would be doing my duty as Minister for Justice if I were in any way to encourage those people to hope that they are going to get their conditions improved by flouting the rules we have found necessary to enforce in our prisons.</P>
      <P>I was asked about technical education in Mountjoy.  The Lord Mayor mentioned that too.  Mountjoy is a short sentence prison&mdash;perhaps he does not know that&mdash;and there is not very much opportunity of giving technical training there.  There is a sort of a school there.  It is not what it might be, I admit, but as I have already explained, where these juveniles are likely to be in for a lengthy period, such as in Borstal, we do endeavour to create a proper atmosphere and to give them as much education as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I can assure the Deputy that, as soon as he made that statement, I had inquiries instituted in my Department.  I myself have always been very anxious about the matter of seeing that there would be segregation of the first offenders, and I am informed by my staff that there is that segregation and that the old, habitual &ldquo;lags&rdquo;, as they have been called, are not allowed to associate with the first offenders.  I shall have the matter looked into again, but I have no reason to doubt the information with which I have been supplied.</P>
      <P>The question was raised of the awards for bravery.  In that connection, the idea was to get the Red Cross to take up the matter.  That is really what we want, but I do not know whether it will be feasible or not. Deputy Donnellan seemed to want less strict supervision of public-houses.  As a matter of fact, I have asked the Commissioner to tighten up that matter as much as possible, and so the Deputy and I do not appear to agree upon that at all.  I know that it is a very difficult thing.  The whole matter was threshed out here on the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, and I have asked the Commissioner to tighten up this matter of the supervision of public-houses, and I know that he has taken special steps in that regard.  We had a long discussion on the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, and I know that we met most of the requests that were put forward by various Deputies.  Having gone so far, I think it is only reasonable to appeal to the Gárdaí to see that the regulations are strictly enforced and that the district justices should impose adequate sentences.  I do not think, in view of all the circumstances, that the Deputy should ask the Commissioner to slacken his efforts in that regard.</P>

      <P>Might I suggest a <Col N="1148" /> change in the <i>bona fide</i> hours, which are at present between 10.30 and 12?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, my hopes were fully justified in regard to the stopping of the <i>bona fide</i> traffic at 12 o'clock at night.  Deputy Larkin has suggested a change in the present hours, as between 10.30 and 12 o'clock at night. I was not so much inclined to object to the extra half hour in the city&mdash;it was 10 o'clock formerly for closing time&mdash;for the reason that I was most anxious to lessen the gap between the closing hour in the city and the closing hour outside, so that there would be no inducement for people to go out from the city.  As a matter of fact, some traders came to me asking to be compensated for the loss of trade.  They pointed out that a lot of their trade had been done during these hours, that that trade was now completely gone, and that they wanted me to compensate them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the big effect which I hoped for has been achieved, particularly with regard to the Sunday evening trade.  We all know that formerly it was impossible for decent people to travel on a bus in the outskirts of the city on a Sunday evening, because of the behaviour of people who used to drink in the public-houses outside the city in the then <i>bona fide</i> hours.  That also has been stopped. The question also has been raised of the licensing of bars at dance halls.  I did express the hope, at the time, that that evil would also disappear.  Perhaps, however, that is not so, but I have nothing to do with that.  It is a matter for the courts, and not for me. If the court gives a permit for a bar at a dance hall, I cannot interfere; and, of course, the Gárdaí are represented in the court and will object if there is any reason why the licence should not be given.  I think that any ordinary citizen can also object if he feels that the privilege is being abused.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, if the Deputy does not mind my saying it, I think that that is rather a small point, and I have not the information at my disposal now with regard to that matter, but I shall let him know later on.  I cannot give him the information now, because I have not got it.  The question of the L.S.F. was also raised. There, again, it is not so much a question of money as of supplies.  The Minister for Finance was prepared to give the money, but it was really a question of supplies.  I hope that there will be an improvement in the coming year but, so far, we have not been able to get all that we wanted. The question of the housing of the Gárdaí was also raised.  It appeared to me that every Deputy who was not present in the House when I was speaking mentioned the same thing. My Department has put before the Department of Industry and Commerce, which is dealing with the whole question of post-war planning, the matter of providing houses for the Gárdaí.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan raised that point also.  Now, that young man was certainly an inciter. He is a very delicate man, indeed, but as a result of his incitements he did very grave damage in this State.  He is a cripple, but I remember reading different accounts of revolutions that took place 100 years ago, in France, let us say, and there was one particular cripple in those days who did desperate damage as a result of his incitements.  This young man was of that type.  He incited a number of young boys and girls to carry arms and use them, and some of these young boys and girls are now suffering long terms of imprisonment as a result of heeding his incitements.  He used a typewriter for that purpose and, under the Forfeiture Act, I declared the typewriter forfeited.  He, or somebody on his behalf, appealed against that, but the court refused his application and the typewriter was disposed of.  I can assure the House that I have not got the typewriter.</P>

I was glad to get the opportunity of withdrawing what I said about Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, but I stand over everything else I said, although I admit that I was not as old then as I am now.

      <P>The Deputy asked me about somebody in Athlone.  I was in Athlone on the occasion of a convention of L.S.F. district officers and I met several people from Leix.  I think I have an idea as to who the person the Deputy referred to is.  He says he called me &ldquo;Gerry&rdquo;&mdash;he is a man I happened to know in the past.

      <P>He did, anyway, and I do not mind that, but he made no request whatever of the nature suggested by Deputy Flanagan.  With regard to the sergeant to whom the Deputy referred, I have had representations made about him.  The position is that that sergeant has one child who has now left the home and gone into some business.  The sergeant occupies a house which is suitable for a Guard with a rather large family, and the Commissioner, being unable to provide a proper house for the Guard with a large family, decided to move this sergeant, whose family has left him, to a small house and to put the Guard into this house.  That is the extent of the political interference with that sergeant.  I had nothing whatever to do with it, and no member of our organisation, so far as I know, had anything to do with it, If he had, it was certainly without my knowledge. Nobody approached me in Athlone or anywhere else about the matter and whoever told the Deputy that certainly did not tell him the truth.</P>

      <P>It took us a good while to get rid of him and we do not want him back.  The Deputy referred to some letter which he wrote and suggested that I had jumped to the defence of a banker.  I did get a complaint that he was, I think, one of four people who signed a letter addressed to the Bank of Ireland.  As he has raised the matter, I might as well deal with it.  Senator Sir John Keane came to me with this letter.  I smiled when I read it and Senator Sir John Keane said: &ldquo;You do not seem to take it very seriously.&rdquo; I replied: &ldquo;To tell you the truth, I do not and if you take my advice, you will agree that we should not do what we ordinarily would do, that is, to arrest this man.  I happen to know Mr. Flanagan.  He is a very pushful young man and I think he is anxious to get into the Dáil.  He would love to be arrested arising out of this matter and I think we ought not to do it.&rdquo;  Senator Sir John Keane agreed with me, but a fortnight later he came to me with another letter which referred him to the previous letter, told him that the people who had signed that letter meant what they said, that they were holding them responsible for everything that had happened since 1847 and that they had better look out for themselves, if they did not remedy things.  I thought it was then time, not to prosecute the Deputy&mdash;he was not a Deputy then&mdash;but to tell the Guards that they ought to go around and advise the people who were sending these rather menacing letters that they would need to be very careful as they were pursuing a very dangerous line.</P>

      <P>We had got rid of him long before that.  It was my job, not as Minister for Justice, but as secretary of the organisation, and I took good care that we shed him long before that.  That is the history of that matter.  As to recruitment for the Guards, I agree with Deputy Meighan and Deputy Ó Cléirigh that a farmer's son generally makes the best type of Guard.  There is a lot in what Deputy Ó Cléirigh said that, when a man gets a university or very high education, he does not feel quite content.  He thinks he should be a superintendent or some such officer, but it is necessary to put oneself in the Commissioner's position. He gets applications and finds that some people have done the leaving certificate and that they are fine athletic men.  Naturally, he will take the best he can get.  The standard was lowered recently because the Civil Service examination was of such a high standard that the required number did not qualify.  It is a qualifying and not a competitive examination&mdash; the competitive part has to do more with physical than educational qualities. The standard was lowered considerably recently, and I think it is now reasonably low.  It may be a little above the standard of the national school, though I am not sure. I think, however, that it is reasonably low and the ordinary fairly well educated young man ought to be able to pass it.  That was done in the realisation that the people who went up could not pass the examination set.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People have spoken about favouritism by the Commissioner, but the fact is that it is only lately that there has been any examination of this kind at <Col N="1155" /> all.  The Commissioner is the person who recruited for the Guards.  It was in his hands.  The way he manages is that he has a board of senior officers who examine all the applications.  He generally looks for people at least 5ft. 10ins. in height, and if he can get enough men 5ft 10ins. in height, or over, he will take nobody under that height.  He will not take a 5ft. 9ins. man.  In the case of drivers, some men under the standard height were accepted, but 5ft. 9ins. is the limit. If he can get enough 5ft. 10ins. men with the necessary educational qualifications and who are physically fit, he will take them first.  If he has a greater number than he has vacancies for, he tries to allocate them on the basis of a quota for each county.  He generally takes about twice the number he requires, which gets him about the number he is looking for, and I think it is a fair enough system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the special courts, as to whether a particular case would go to the special courts or the ordinary courts and whether there is congestion in the ordinary courts, the Attorney-General decides the point. The special courts are confined to dealing with black-marketing and cases of that kind and he decides whether the case is serious enough to go there or whether it can be dealt with by the ordinary courts.</P>

One may come across a black-marketing case with very wide ramifications&mdash;and there have been several such&mdash;where we might have been deprived of vital articles wanted for the life of the community.

    <P>That a sum, not exceeding £1,911,345, be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1945, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (45 and 46 Vict., c. 74; 8 Edw. <Col N="1163" /> 7, c. 48; 1 and 2 Geo. 5, c. 26; the Telegraph Acts, 1863 to 1928; No. 14 of 1940 (secs. 30 and 31); No. 14 of 1942 (sec. 23; etc.); and of certain other Services administered by that Office.</P>
    <P>The estimated Post Office expenditure for the year 1944-45 amounts to a total of £2,928,345 representing a net increase of £115,890 on the provision for 1943-44.  The gross increase amounts to £147,453, of which approximately £70,000 is due to additional emergency bonus.  The balance is made up chiefly as follows:&mdash;Sub-heads A (1) to A (4)&mdash;Salaries, etc.&mdash;Increase, £59,410. The increase is due to normal incremental increases; to the cost of new work which will fall on the Post Office in connection with the Children's Allowances Scheme and widows' and orphans' additional allowances; extra staff provision to meet general increase in telephone traffic, telegraph money order traffic, food and fuel voucher business, etc.; substitution of officers on loan and on military service; etc., etc.</P>
    <P>Sub-head E (5)&mdash;Conveyance of Mails by Air&mdash;Increase, £5,430.  This is to meet payments to other administrations of outstanding ordinary air mail accounts for previous years and in respect of the airgraph service, which was introduced in 1943.  Sub-head G (1)&mdash;Non-engineering Stores&mdash;Increase, £8,245.  This is due mainly to increased prices of mechanical transport stores and gas-producer plants and to greater provision in respect of the purchase of mail bags and cycles consequent on delay in deliveries by contractors during the current financial year.  Sub-head G (3)&mdash;Manufacture of Stamps, etc.&mdash; Increase, £2,050.  Mainly provision for cost of watermarked paper for children's allowance orders.</P>
    <P>Sub-head M&mdash;Telephone Capital Repayments&mdash;Increase, £3,798.  This represents repayments in respect of annuities created under the Telephone Capital Acts, which authorise the Minister for Finance to borrow moneys for the development of the telephone service.  The amount to be provided <Col N="1164" /> each year is advised by the Minister for Finance.  Sub-head N (1)&mdash;Superannuation Allowances&mdash;Increase, £2,615. Due to anticipated increase in the number of retirements.</P>
    <P>Sub-head N (3)&mdash;Agency Payments in respect of Compensation Allowances&mdash; Increase, £4,000.  The provision under this sub-head is in respect of payments made on behalf of the British Administration to officers who retired from the Post Office service prior to 1st March, 1929, under the Treaty of the 6th December, 1921.  The retiring allowances in these cases were fixed without an overriding maximum in regard to cost-of-living bonus, and the British Administration repays the difference between the bonus figure at the time of retirement and any higher figure which may subsequently become operative.  The amounts paid are recovered from the British Administration and brought to credit under Appropriation-in-Aid (T. 12) Sub-head Q (2)&mdash;Civil Aviation and Meteorological Services&mdash;Increase, £6,775.  This represents the cost of additional equipment for the Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>Against the gross increase of £147,453, there are off-setting savings, totalling approximately £31,563, due to reduction in the contract remuneration for the conveyance of letter mails; to increased relief from telephone capital funds; reduced provision for the purchase of engineering materials owing to supply difficulties and to abnormal provision in 1943-44 for replacement of plant, etc., destroyed in the factory fire; smaller provision for Savings Bank losses; and to increased receipts under Appropriations-in-Aid, etc., etc.&mdash;making the net increase in expenditure, as already stated, £115,890.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the general activities of the Department it is customary to give the Dáil some information as to the financial position&mdash;on a commercial basis&mdash;of the three main services&mdash;postal, telegraph and telephone. When, in November last, I presented the Estimate for the current financial year, I indicated that, at the end of 1941-42 (the last year for which commercial accounts were at the time available) there was a net surplus of £156,058 on the three services, i.e., a <Col N="1165" /> surplus of £91,466 on the postal service; a surplus of £180,165 on the telephones; and a deficit of £115,573 on the telegraphs. At the end of the financial year 1942-43, this net surplus had increased to £190,929, at which figure it approximately still stands.  The main profit comes from the telephone service, due to the remarkable growth of traffic, especially trunk traffic, the surplus of revenue over expenditure on the telephones being at present about £245,000.</P>
    <P>True revenue, that is, actual cash receipts for the financial year just ended, is estimated at £2,600,000, an increase of £158,000 on the actual revenue for the previous year.  The recent suspension of the cross-Channel telephone service and the serious restrictions of train and mail services which are about to become operative will, I fear, have markedly adverse effects upon revenue in the coming year if they continue for any material length of time.  No useful estimate of the reduction is, of course, possible at this stage.</P>
    <P>So far as internal mails are concerned, the further and extremely drastic restrictions of train services which, through the difficulties of the coal situation, are to be introduced on the Great Southern system on the 24th instant, will involve, I regret to say, a material deterioration.  Every effort will, of course, be made to minimise public inconvenience in relation to the transmission and delivery of correspondence as far as possible, but the situation is one over which the Post Office has little effective control owing to the difficulties of the transport services generally.</P>
    <P>The new mail arrangements are at present being worked out and I am unable, at the moment, to give precise information as to the services which will be operative at any particular office.  But, taking the principal sections of the Great Southern system, I understand that two services are likely to be available for mail purposes in each direction, each day, on the Dublin-Cork main line; one service a day, each way, on the Limerick-Waterford section; the same on the Mallow-Tralee section.  On the southern branch lines generally, and on the eastern and <Col N="1166" /> western sections, it is hoped to convey mails by goods trains on four days a week and by passenger trains on two days although, by reason of over-lapping, this may not necessarily mean a service on each of the six days.  The details of the services and the possibilities are still under discussion with the company and I am not yet in a position to say to what extent, if at all, it will be possible to have mails conveyed by road transport on days when no train services will be available.  The House may, however, rest assured that everything that can be possibly done will be done to give the public the utmost facilities that the situation permits and also to keep such staff reductions as may be involved within the narrowest possible limits.</P>
    <P>The cross-Channel services are also being seriously curtailed as from the 24th instant.  The morning service from Dun Laoghaire to Holyhead will run on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays only and the evening service from Holyhead to Dun Laoghaire on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays only. The precise mail arrangements which will be operative have not yet been arranged with the British Administration, but it is hoped that, by the employment both of the passenger services from and to Dun Laoghaire and the cargo services from and to the North Wall, a mail service in each direction every day may be practicable.</P>
    <P>The position as regards foreign mails remains substantially the same as last year, with the exception of the Vatican State and Northern Italy; communications with these are temporarily interrupted.  All foreign mails are, of course, liable to interruption and serious delay.</P>
    <P>The airgraph service, introduced 12 months ago for communication with Commonwealth countries, has proved extremely popular.  The number of airgraphs despatched now amounts to about 1,000 a day and the traffic is growing.  The facility has naturally had an effect on the volume of ordinary air mail traffic for Commonwealth destinations which shows a decrease.</P>
    <P>The inland cash-on-delivery service continues to be reasonably well supported. The traffic in 1943 amounted to 12,809 parcels on which trade <Col N="1167" /> charges amounting to £30,939 were collected.</P>
    <P>The expansion of the internal telephone service continues, influenced, no doubt, in material degree by emergency conditions.  As I have remarked on a previous occasion, every additional limitation of ordinary public facilities seems to react immediately on the telephones.  Local calls during 1943 numbered approximately 40,000,000, an increase of 1,725,000 on the figures for the previous year, while trunk calls numbered 5,940,000, an increase of 440,000.  In comparison with the figures for 1938, the year before the war, the present local and trunk traffic represents a growth of 30 per cent. and 70 per cent. respectively.</P>
    <P>Under normal conditions, a material growth in traffic, especially trunk traffic, would be catered for by ample provision of additional circuits. Owing, however, to the existing impossibility of procuring further supplies of line construction stores and exchange equipment, it is not practicable to make provision in full for current trunk requirements.  We have done our best, but there are many places throughout the country where we would be glad to provide extra circuit accommodation if the necessary plant were forthcoming&mdash;even though we might have doubts whether the traffic would continue at its present level when emergency conditions had come to an end.  Taking all factors into account, however, and considering the very difficult conditions under which telephone business is at present being transacted, I think I am entitled to claim that the service generally is reasonably good and that, except on long distance routes at peak traffic hours, delay is not excessive.</P>
    <P>So far as trunk calls from Dublin are concerned, the recent opening of the new trunk exchange in Exchequer Street has resulted in a considerable improvement in service.  The speed of answering from &ldquo;O&rdquo; (trunks) and &ldquo;31&rdquo; (inquiries) has dropped to an average of about four seconds.  Further, it is now generally practicable, except on the busiest routes at peak periods, to connect the caller to the number called without his having to <Col N="1168" /> leave his telephone.  Judging by the many expressions of appreciation we have received, I think that the great improvement which has resulted from the opening of the Exchequer Street exchange is generally recognised.  But it must, of course, be understood that, even with expeditious answering from &ldquo;O&rdquo;, delay on trunk calls from Dublin is, from time to time, unavoidable owing to heavy point-to-point traffic in various parts of the country.</P>
    <P>The telephone service between Ireland and Great Britain was, as Deputies are aware, suspended by the British Administration on and from the 6th instant.  The suspension is, no doubt, a very serious inconvenience to business people but the matter is one over which my Department has no control. I am, however, glad to say that by an adjustment of the leave and training arrangements it has been found possible to provide useful work for all existing telephonists in Dublin and, so far as can be seen at present, the number, if any, of temporary and part-time telephonists likely to be disemployed during the next few months will be very small.</P>
    <P>Practically the whole of the material used by the engineering branch in its activities is manufactured outside Ireland and, in normal times, was imported not only from Great Britain but also from other countries in Europe and from the United States.  The possibility of importing such materials no longer exists and considerable effort has been necessary to maintain satisfactorily the services for which the engineering branch is responsible and to provide such additional facilities as are absolutely essential while, at the same time, ensuring that the volume of work is kept up as far as possible so that disemployment of staff may be avoided.  These ends have been attained by getting the utmost possible life out of all spare and recovered materials, expending on their reconditioning money in excess of what would be justified if normal sources of supply were still available.  The difficulties in providing for growth of services are becoming more serious each year but, so far as the coming year is concerned, there is every hope of being able to carry on satisfactorily and to <Col N="1169" /> keep all our full time regular staff fully employed.</P>
    <P>I take the opportunity here of again referring to an allegation which is sometimes made against the Department of want of foresight in relation to the provision of reserve stocks.  This charge is wholly without foundation. The fact is that, as far back as 1938, when the European situation showed signs of disturbance, we purchased reserve stocks to the value of £100,000. At the outbreak of the emergency we had actually a reserve of three years supply&mdash;quite a reasonable provision at the time, as I think will readily be agreed.  But the emergency brought its immediate telephone problems and the huge network of communications that had to be arranged for the Defence services, on a scale that could not possibly have been anticipated by the Post Office, ate rapidly into the reserve.  Supplementary stocks, up to the limits obtainable, were subsequently secured, but they had to be drawn upon to meet the requirements of abnormal emergency traffic, with the result that stocks generally are now running out and there is at the moment no prospect of replenishment. The fact, however, that we have been able to keep going for over four and a half years under conditions or extreme difficulty, catering adequately both for Defence and for general public needs, disproves, I submit, that there was any remissness or want of foresight on the part of my Department in regard to the laying in of adequate supplies.  There is, of course, a financial limit to the possible amount of supplies that can be laid in against an indefinite contingency.</P>

      <P>Deputy Alfred Byrne gave notice of his intention to raise on the adjournment the question of the provision of coal for the Dublin gas works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not without sympathy for the Minister in the difficulties <Col N="1170" /> he is faced with and I fully realise the measure of success that he has achieved up to the present in connection with this matter.  Probably, I should have raised this matter by a written question, but to-day, when the question of transport difficulties due to the lack of fuel was raised, I thought it would be a suitable opportunity to remind the Minister of the many thousands of people in the city who use gas for cooking and lighting and those who, up to recently, had used it for industrial purposes.  I just wish to remind the Minister that in any programme for the distribution of fuel in the future the Dublin gas company should not be forgotten and that an adequate allocation of whatever coal for the making of gas is available should be given to the Dublin gas company.</P>
      <P>I wish to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that gas by the penny-in-the-slot method is being used considerably for cooking purposes in the houses of the very poor, in the tenement rooms, in the comfortable homes of the reasonably well-paid worker and, in many cases, in the homes of the well-to-do, and that any unnecessary curtailment of gas for that purpose would be deplorable.  It would inflict considerable hardship on the class of people that I have in mind particularly, namely, the tenement dwellers who are dependent on the incandescent gas burner and the penny-in-the-slot cooker.  What is known as the 2d. candle that used to be bought in the tenement quarters in Dublin now costs 7½d.  Paraffin oil for lighting purposes has now gone completely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether the Dublin gas company's boats will be used to the fullest capacity to carry coal for gas production or are they likely to be used for other purposes?  I heard a rumour to that effect and it alarmed me.  As I say, I have a full appreciation of the Minister's difficulties and of what he has done and I merely appeal to him, no matter what the clamour may be, to see that, out of whatever supplies of coal we may have, the Dublin gas company will be provided for.  We all had hoped that the Dublin gas supply <Col N="1171" /> might have been improved and that the hours might have been extended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely want to get an assurance from the Minister that he will not overlook the claim of the Dublin gas company which has for many years provided a good service of gas for the Dublin public.  They have been paid for it, of course; in the view of many people, they have been paid too high a price.  We all hope that they will be able to continue the supply and that the Minister and those associated with him will be successful in their efforts to provide coal for the purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I will experience very little difficulty in assuring the Deputy that in whatever arrangements are made for the distribution of available supplies of coal the Dublin gas company will not be forgotten.  I am surprised that the Deputy should regard such an assurance as necessary.  The problems of the Dublin gas company have existed for some time past.  They were not entirely due to the difficulty in obtaining supplies of coal because, as some Deputies are aware, there were difficulties created for the company by reason of the quality of the coal they succeeded in obtaining and by certain plant defects which made it very difficult for them to use the coal supplies which they got.  It is necessary to effect an all-round reduction in the use of coal.  The burden of the reduction will have to be borne by everybody, but, in so far as coal can be allocated for the <Col N="1172" /> manufacture of gas, it is obvious that certain other gas undertakings can bear a greater reduction in supplies than the Dublin gas company, gas undertakings which have been fortunately able to provide a more liberal supply of gas for their consumers than the Dublin gas company has been for some time past.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to forecast with any certainty what the future may bring.  Inevitably, the difficulties of gas production will increase, and that increase in the difficulties will be due not merely to the reduction of the quantity of coal that may be available for the purpose, but also, and perhaps even to a greater extent, to the difficulties which are being experienced and are likely to be experienced in the future in obtaining coal of a suitable quality.  The main problem of the Dublin gas company and other gas companies in keeping up production in recent months has been due to the quality of coal they obtained as well as to the reduction in the quantity.</P>
      <P>However, now that this matter has been raised, I should like to draw particular attention to one aspect of the gas supply in Dublin which is of public concern.  It would be possible not merely to improve the quality of the supply in the on-hours, but possible also to increase the number of hours in which the supply is available if the use of gas in the off-hours could be entirely eliminated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the time has now come when it is necessary to take far more drastic measures than have been taken heretofore to prevent the use of gas in the off-hours.  I contemplate, therefore, asking the Government to make an Order which will make the use of gas in the off-hours a criminal offence. Heretofore, those who worked on the glimmer have risked only the cutting off of their gas supply.  In future, they will risk imprisonment if the Order I contemplate is made and can be effectively enforced.  I think the public generally will appreciate the need for such restrictions at the present time. It is due to technical difficulties that the supply of gas cannot be entirely cut off in the off-hours.  Some people have been able to use gas at a time when <Col N="1173" /> others were not.  Those people, in using that gas, were not merely acting in a manner contrary to the public interest, but were in fact depriving the citizens generally of a better supply of gas than it has been possible to give them.</P>
    <P>The measures which will be taken now to prevent the use of gas in the off-hours will mean a better supply for the community as a whole.  Those measures, however, cannot be made entirely effective unless there is public goodwill behind them&mdash;a great deal of public goodwill.  I should like, therefore, to urge upon Deputies, and particularly Dublin Deputies, to avail of every opportunity they get to impress upon the public the need of ensuring that the use of gas in the off-hours will cease, and that those who for selfish reasons persist in using gas during those off-hours will be reported to the authorities so that an effective check can be put upon them.  In that way, it will be possible, I hope, to maintain at least the existing hours of supply in Dublin, and possibly to improve the supply in those hours.  If conditions should improve, and it should become possible for us to obtain more coal or coal of better gas-making qualities then, provided we can eliminate the use of the glimmer, it may be possible even to extend the hours of supply.</P>
    <P>I appreciate, and I am sure everybody familiar with the circumstances of Dublin appreciates also, the difficulties which are caused for a very large number of households by reason of the curtailment of the gas supply.  It means, during this time of the year, no lighting at all during the hours of night.  All the gas which is now supplied in Dublin is used for cooking. The hours at which it is supplied make it impossible to use it for any other purpose, and it is not possible for us to provide alternative facilities for the lighting of those households through a ration of paraffin oil.  At this time of the year it is necessary to conserve all the paraffin oil which we have for industrial and agricultural use.  Paraffin oil is a vital raw material in agricultural production. The sowing and gathering of the crops would be a matter of very great difficulty without it.  It is by confining <Col N="1174" /> the available supplies to those essential uses during the summer months and building up as we can a reserve against the winter months that a ration of paraffin oil in the winter becomes possible.  I hope it will be possible for us to accumulate such a reserve this year as in last year to provide a ration of paraffin oil next winter.  The problem in relation to candles is somewhat similar.  Candles are made from imported raw materials. The difficulty in obtaining those materials is increasing, and in so far as we can obtain them I think it is desirable also that we should limit distribution at the present time so as to make possible an increased distribution in the winter months when lighting facilities are more urgently required.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate that neither in respect of the gas supply nor of the paraffin and candle supply can anything like a firm assurance be given.  I hope it will be possible to maintain the Dublin hours unchanged, but that will depend upon so many factors outside our control that it cannot be more than a hope.  I hope also that it will be possible to accumulate some reserve of paraffin against the requirements of households that need lighting in that form next winter, but again Deputies will appreciate that there are so many factors operating to affect our supplies that there can be no certainty about it.  In so far, however, as Deputy Byrne requires an assurance that the special problems created by the curtailment of gas in Dublin will receive special attention, it will be given. Dublin, probably more than any other city in this country, depended upon the gas supply for cooking and lighting purposes. I think the figures show that 120,000 out of 140,000 households in the City of Dublin had a gas supply.  That high proportion of the households which were depending on gas for cooking or lighting or for both purposes is an indication of the hardship which has been caused by the necessary curtailment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister one question?  Has he any information as to whether there are any stocks of coal, purchased either pre-war or in the early days of the war, in private <Col N="1175" /> hands here or elsewhere, and has the Minister given any consideration to the question of asking such citizens voluntarily to surrender such stocks of coal to the State at a fair price, so that those stocks of coal, if they are available to any extent, might be utilised for national instead of for domestic purposes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>All the evidence is that any stocks of coal in the hands of private citizens are negligible.  The stocks of coal of any quantity existing in the country are known, and are under control.  I cannot say that no citizen has any coal in the cellar, but the indications are that there can be very little, if any at all, in private houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not delay the Minister more than a moment, but possibly he might be able to give us some information in regard to another aspect of this question.  Apart altogether from the coal factor, as the Minister has rightly said, serious trouble is arising in the gas company. as far as plant is concerned.  Would the Minister be in a position to indicate the nature and extent of the difficulties in regard to the plant in the gas works, and if they are of such character as to suggest a reasonable hope that in the near future that particular matter might be put right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it&mdash;the Deputy will appreciate that it is a technical matter upon which I as a layman cannot speak with authority&mdash; there are certain repairs which can be carried out and which have been arranged for to the extent of the importation of the necessary material, but the repairs will take some months to complete.  The more important plant alterations which the company consider essential could not be completed within a period of a year or two, but the main work is of such dimension that it would take a very long time to do even if the materials could be procured.  I think I am correct in saying <Col N="1176" /> that the company have been granted by the British authorities the export licences for the equipment and plant they require, but, assuming that they can get delivery of it, it will still take many months at the best before it could be put into use or would affect the supply of gas.</P>

In practice, for a long time past, I think the priority list has never been filled.</P>
