      <P>There is one thing that has not been mentioned here, so far, and that is, that a lot of time, to my mind, since this Dáil was formed, has been wasted in discussing the salaries of Deputies, and I was surprised when I heard people say that the allowances were not enough.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, Sir.  Take the case of widows' pensions.  There are many widows in this country whose husbands, before they passed away, had been out of work for a considerable time because they could not find work and, as a result, their insurances lapsed.  These widows get a pension of <Col N="2306" /> 5/-, home assistance amounting to 1/-, and a voucher to the value of 1/6. These people, to my mind, have been forgotten altogether by the Government and by the Minister concerned.</P>
      <P>In the rural areas old age pensioners, up to the present, have only got a pension of 10/- a week, which is now going to be increased by 2/6.  I suggest to the Minister and the Government that the voucher system in this case should be done away with altogether. Let the person concerned get £1 a week or 30/-, as the case may be, and do not be wasting time on vouchers and making paupers out of honest people after giving 70 years of service to this country.  They have to go with the voucher to this shop and to that shop, and sometimes they do not get what they want.  I suggest to the Minister that it would be better in that case to give the cash directly to the people concerned, whether it amounts to 20/- or 30/-, according to the value of the £1, because the expenditure would not be so great since the cost of paper, the employment of clerks, and so on, involved in the voucher system, is eating up the funds that these old people should be getting after 70 years of service to the nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard two Deputies mentioning the black market.  One said that you could get all the sugar you wanted for 1/- a lb., and another said that you could get all the tea you wanted for £1 per lb.  I say that these Deputies are not doing their duty to the people who elected them if they know that that is happening and are not prepared to give the particulars to the Minister for Supplies.  The working-class person cannot afford to pay £1 for a lb. of tea, and any Deputy who knows of such a case should report it to the Minister for Supplies and have it stopped immediately.  Another thing has occurred since the local elections. Heretofore, the business of the country, generally, was carried on by the members of the local councils, who got no allowances except expenses at the rate of 6d. a mile. To-day county managers are being paid £20 a, week and it is not in the interests of the ratepayers that these <Col N="2307" /> jobs should have been engineered for friends of the Government in some cases.  These men have been appointed at £20 a week to carry out the duties which should be left to the elected representatives of the people who are in touch with the people.  There is no man in any county who understands the needs of a county better than the man who lives amongst the people there and who meets them every day. County managers have been appointed and grants have been given to urban areas, but we find that the local people must put up £300 in respect of any grant they get.</P>
    <P>That is a matter which should be looked into because the majority of the ratepayers to-day, through inability to get necessary supplies, are unable to meet the demands made upon them. There are some people making money hand over fist, but many of the small business people cannot get supplies and they have to provide this amount of £300.  The Government should not continue that system, because, if it is continued, the rates will be increased every year.  Then the Government introduces a scheme under which men will not be allowed to work more than so many days, and if this arrangement by which the local people are to be asked to put up £300 every day in respect of grants in order to give a few days' employment to the unemployed is continued, I do not know where it will end.  I am one of the ordinary rank and file.  I have lined up at the labour exchange during short-time in the flour milling industry and I have been sick at different periods.  National health insurance is another matter which I understand the Government controls, and we are told&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government does not control national health insurance.  It is the administration of the fund the Deputy is discussing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  It is administered by a society established by statute.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but, if my recollection is correct, when the Minister was asked to increase national health insurance, he said he had no mandate from the workers or their associations to do so, and when asked to increase old age pensions, he said the public purse would not allow it.  I understand the Government controls the national health insurance fund and to-day the amount given is 15/-.  If a man with a fairly decent job falls sick, he gets 15/-, after the first nine days, to keep his family.  This position will have to be remedied in the interest of the class I represent, the working class, which is the only class which suffers in this respect.  It is a matter which needs attention in view of the fact that the cost-of-living bonus laid down by the Government amounts to 12/- per week.  Hundreds of our people get 7/6 after six months and referee doctors are sent around to see if a man is out getting a little fresh air, and if he looks healthy about the face, he is certified fit for work.  The Government has a lot to do with these things, according to the information I have, and I say to the Minister that it was the working class put this Government into power.  The people who are benefiting to-day are the people who were opposed to them, while the workers are the sufferers.</P>
      <P>We have heard a lot about subsidisation and I heard Deputy Cogan say that all Parties voted against his motion in respect of subsidies.  I believe subsidies are necessary to enable the small farmer to carry on, and when the Farmers' Party voted against them they voted against their own interest, as the majority of them represent small farmers in the West of Ireland.  That is why I voted for subsidies for farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During my time in this House, I have had on a couple of occasions to bring to the attention of the Ceann Comhairle the fact that, out of 138 people elected to come here and listen to the views put forward, it was not possible to get 20 people to devote their time to the business of the House.  It is not possible for Deputies to remain here all the time, but they should spend the best part of their <Col N="2309" /> time listening to the views of different Deputies and not merely come in when the division bell rings and ask: &ldquo;What is wrong now?&rdquo;  They do not even know what is going on.  When they go before the people, they tell them they are going to do everything, but they cannot afford the time to listen to the debates.  New blood has come into the Dáil and these Deputies should be prepared to come in and listen to the views put forward.  The view of every Deputy is to be respected, and this is one matter on which I will insist for the future.  I am a member of a county council on which the different Parties are represented, and the various members go there and listen to the discussions, but here that is not the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>He is dealing with the cost of living of Deputies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard a lot about fuel, and I heard some people say that we will never go back to <Col N="2310" /> coal, while others ask how we are to carry on if we do not get coal.  If we do not get coal for our industries which depend on power, turf will not give the speed we want in those industries.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies dealt with the position of lowly-paid civil servants.  One Deputy referred to the price of flour. It is evident that he was not acquainted with the facts of the case. In my constituency flour costs 4/- a stone.  The price of flour in rural areas is higher than in cities, where the workers are more highly paid.  I understand that the difference in price is supposed to be caused by the cost of freight.  In connection with supplies of fuel, people who in the past sold timber in a small way are now compelled to sell it by weight.  Hitherto they could sell timber blocks by the bag.  As a result, a monopoly in the sale of timber has been given practically to certain people.  Those who can afford to buy five tons of timber, and who can put down £10, can get it. At the present time timber is being sent in large quantities from Wexford to Dublin while people in rural districts find it hard to get one cwt.  Why is that allowed?  Farmers are not now allowed to cut down timber without a permit.  People are told that they can get turf.  The majority of them are not burning turf if they can use gas, electric power or anthracite coal. When the war ends the women of this country will never forget the time they had trying to light turf fires.  A bellows costs 10/- or 11/- Turf may be suitable in farmhouses with big chimneys, but when poor people have to pay 3/2 per cwt. for it, they find it deficient for heating purposes.  Turf is no substitute for coal and never will be.  Ranges have been put into all the new houses.  It was the foundries advocated the installation of ranges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputies who say that there is a scarcity of labour. How could there be, when we have 71,000 people signing the unemployment register?  There are plenty of men willing and able to work if they get a living wage.  The farmers, of course, are looking after their own interests.  They want higher prices for <Col N="2311" /> their produce, and they get all the help they require from the Government, but they expect their workers to live on £2 a week.  I direct attention to the rents charged for the cottages which have been built recently by local bodies. The rents are 2/6 weekly, compared with 1/- for cottages built under previous schemes.  I suggest to the Minister that instead of building sanatoria, county homes and mental hospitals, houses should be provided for the people and let at reasonable rents.  If we had decent houses, with sanitary arrangements, and if the people had good nourishing food that would prevent the spread of tuberculosis.  If one walks down O'Connell Street or Grafton Street one would imagine there was no poverty here.  However, on the way to Leinster House one meets people who ask for a copper.  I saw poor people in O'Connell Street last night asking for alms in a land in which one would imagine there was full and plenty.  Some time ago this country sent £100,000 to help the people of another country.  At a meeting of the Labour Party I was opposed to sending money to India at a time when our own people were in want.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It would be very good if we had it back.  As one who moves amongst the plain people, I want to point out that in the past on Fridays I had to certify to relieving officers that people who want home assistance are in need.  A new system has been introduced now, by which <Col N="2312" /> such applications must be submitted to the county manager before home assistance is granted.  I want to call attention also to the position of workers who have returned from Britain but whose insurance cards are retained there.  In some cases these men must pay £2 6s. before these cards are released.  A man after coming out of a sanatorium should get back the stamps for the six months previous.  Such a man's national health benefits are a very important matter.  The Government should contact those on the far side and arrange that these stamps will be to such a man's credit.  At present the money is lying dead and the home assistance officer has to help these people, although they have that credit on the other side.  I hope the Minister, when replying, will deal with the points which I have raised and give his ideas on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>This sum of almost £15,000,000 which the House is being asked to vote on account represents almost one-third of the total sum, £44,982,644, estimated to be required for the public services for the coming year.  I am sure the House and the Minister know full well that we will be asked, at a later stage, to vote further supplementary sums.  Some time ago, the Minister commented on that unsatisfactory method of providing moneys in this House and undertook to do something about it.  That system of bringing in Supplementary Estimates has been growing up here for some years past.  The House should know at this time of the year the total bill required to provide the public services for the next financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we add the amount required for central fund services and bring in the Appropriations-in-Aid, mainly out of taxation, we find the striking fact that the Bill represents, for the taxpayer, approximately a sum of £1,000,000 per week and roughly 6/- or 7/- per individual per week.  That is a very substantial sum for a poor country. What strikes one is the magnitude of the bill, the ever-growing burden of taxation, which constitutes, in this particular instance, a new level in the <Col N="2313" /> Fianna Fáil record of squandermania. There is an increase in the present year of over £4,000,000.</P>
    <P>Whatever danger may be attached to the recent international events, whatever fear may exist in the public mind about the possibility of economic pressure from outside, the one thing that has constituted, and is constituting a real danger and menace to the stability and future economic security of this country is the unhealthy and unsound economic condition, which is steadily growing under the control of an inept Government.  I am not by any means an alarmist regarding the amount of money spent by a Government, provided that the taxpayer and the country generally get value for the money spent and provided that there is some relation between the productive capacity of the State and the tax the people are asked to provide for the purposes of government.  We find, however, that the volume of production has altered in inverse ratio to our taxation: the curve of taxation has shown a steady upward trend all the time, while the curve of production has shown a steady downward trend. That constitutes an obviously grave danger to the economic structure of the State, which is the fundamental point about which this House should concern itself.  We must consider what effect there is likely to be caused on our economic position in the future, by the bill that this country has to face at the present time, which is a new high level in the extravagance of the present Government.</P>
    <P>When we turn to the other side, to see the results of that huge expenditure, we take up the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i> of December last, page 150, Table 2.  We are told that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The total volume of agricultural output declined by 7.7 per cent. in 1942-43, as compared with 1941-42.  Live stock and live-stock products showed a decline of 7.8 per cent. and crops and turf a decline of 7.4 per cent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Statistical Abstract shows a decline of approximately 5.5 per cent. in the previous year; so that, in two years, there was a decline of 5.5 and <Col N="2314" /> 7.7 in the total agricultural output. That includes turf production, which is thrown in to try to improve the figure to some extent, since turf production has increased.</P>
    <P>I would like to call the attention of the House to this particular aspect of the figures.  Taking the year 1930 as 100, our production in live stock and live-stock products was only 78.7 per cent. or a reduction of 21 per cent.  If we take industrial production we find there is a substantial decline also. Taking the year 1936 at 100, we find that for last year the figure stands at 80.7.  In the case of industrial employment, the number of persons employed, taking the September, 1939, figure at 100, was standing at 84.1 in September, 1943.  Taking the wages at 100 in September, 1939, the average for all industrial work in a variety of industries here was standing at 118.1 in September last.</P>
    <P>Turning to the cost of living at mid-November, 1943, there is a note on page 172 of the journal:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As regards comparison with pre-war, the index figure for all items at mid-August, 1932, is 121 points or 70 per cent. above that for mid-August, 1939, and the increases in the indexes for the various groups are as follows: Food, 103 points, or 65 per cent.; clothing, 214 points, or 95 per cent.; fuel and light, 158 points, or 88 per cent.; and sundries, 133 points, or 69 per cent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>All the various essential items there in the cost of living have increased. Food shows the lowest increase of the lot.  Side by side with that figure we find that our exports have shown a substantial decline.  The various items that we exported in considerable quantities some years ago have now disappeared as exportable goods.  Bacon, eggs and butter have disappeared as exports; to-day this country is relying, so far as agricultural exports are concerned at all events, almost exclusively on live stock, and we are exporting very little outside the agricultural group.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Supplies, speaking recently at University College, mentioned the fact that at present we are exporting £2 worth of goods for every <Col N="2315" /> £1 worth we are importing.  That is true.  He went on to point out how desirable it was to be building up sterling assets at the present time and anticipated a post-war situation when we can make use of these sterling assets to buy essential requirements, capital goods, industrial machinery, transport vehicles, and machinery for agriculture and for the restocking of the larder of industry.  I think nothing short of a blind optimist, an orthodox economist, would venture at present to prophesy that sterling assets that have been built up in the past and that are being built up at present will be available in an unlimited way for use by us in the post-war period.  No matter how willing Great Britain may be to permit us the free use of these assets, I do not think that economically she will be in a position to liquidate her debts in goods.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to international problems of this character at Hot Springs in America over a year ago. It was agreed that international trade would have to be more and more on a goods basis.  I believe we will find ourselves in the position that Great Britain will not be able post-war to give us our requirements in capital goods and permit us to pay for these by sterling assets.  I have taken occasion in the past to stress the importance from our point of view of preserving the present reasonable standards of prosperity in this country, the necessity for building up our export trade at least to the level of some years ago.  I believe that we will find a situation arising when we will have to pay for whatever goods we require to import with goods.  We may be allowed, to some limited extent, to use our sterling assets, but I think it would be very foolish, that we would be living in a fool's paradise, if we build on the hope and the possibility that we will be permitted the free use of whatever sterling assets we have at present.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, one of the major economic considerations for this House <Col N="2316" /> and the country is how we can expand our production.  Nothing has been done about that.  Even what we have tried to achieve during the present emergency regarding the provision of essential food for our people appears to me as an ignominious failure.  No organised or systematic effort has been made to harness our people to the work of production.  That is the reason why, to a great extent, we have failed.  It appears a strange anomaly that, during what ought to be a most profitable period for a food-producing country, a war period, in an almost exclusively food-producing country, we have a situation where our output is declining.  Surely there is something fundamentally wrong when you find a decline in agricultural output at a time that ought to be most attractive for food-producing countries and when all other countries, even belligerent countries that have to build up a mighty army to engage in a war, had the capacity to expand substantially their agricultural output.</P>
    <P>Great Britain did that.  We are well aware that Great Britain neglected her agriculture for years, that she had no interest in agriculture. She was mainly concerned with manufacturing goods and exchanging them in every market in the world for the cheapest food available and a sound, prosperous agricultural economy could not be fitted into that picture.  When thrown back almost on her own resources during this war, however, she has expanded her production by 70 per cent., while in two years our production has gone down first by 5 per cent. and last year by 7.7 per cent. In a situation like that, with our industrial production going down &mdash; you could understand the industrial production going down owing to the impossibility of securing raw materials&mdash; is there any possible explanation for the fact that our agricultural production has fallen, when it should be the other way and when everybody has a right to expect an expansion in agricultural production?</P>
    <P>It is in these circumstances that we have a steady rise in the burden of taxation and that the Government are <Col N="2317" /> complacent about it and complacent about a situation that is progressively growing, where our exports are disappearing, and where that idea that has been aimed at for a good many years by the Taoiseach, a self-sufficient Éire, an isolated Éire, may come to pass. Let us hope that, if our exports disappear to that extent, we will not live to regret it.  I think the writing is on the wall.  There is a warning there for the Government that, if the situation develops, we will be economically in a horrible position post-war.  At present we know very well that industrially we are marking time; in fact we are not even marking time, we are drifting downwards.  There will be a huge capital expenditure required in the immediate post-war period when foreign exchange can only be provided in goods.  The only way we have of providing foreign exchange is by agricultural production, by the surpluses which we do not require ourselves.  It is of paramount importance that the problem should be attended to in a systematic and constructive way and not by the muddling methods that have been operated here for some years.</P>
    <P>Bound up with this whole problem of the cost of living which we have given notice of our intention to discuss and which Deputy McGilligan has handled in great detail, is the situation illustrated here in regard to the profits made in certain branches of industry and the failure of the Government to control profits and prevent profiteering. Industries that were scarcely able to pay a dividend before the war are now earning up to 27 and 34 per cent.  They are allowed to pay only a certain dividend it is true, but they are putting away huge sums to reserve. That situation, in my opinion, is definitely reacting on the cost of raw materials for the agricultural industry. Take one item alone.  This Dáil provides a subsidy of £500,000 for artificial manures, but the output of that industry is about one-tenth of what it was pre-war.  Yet, when we look up the profits or balance sheets of firms engaged in the industry, we see that the profits are higher than ever they were.  If the output on any farm in this country were only one-tenth <Col N="2318" /> of its pre-war volume, would any Government stand over the proposal that that farmer should get higher profits than ever he made before the war?  That is a situation that we complacently allow to continue and are actually nursing in this country at the present time.  We are allowing certain industries to pack away huge profits without any regard to the effect that it is having on our economic position generally.  That is happening in the case of many industries producing raw materials essential for agriculture and it is throwing an almost impossible burden on the agricultural community. It is certainly retarding the productive capacity of the agricultural industry.  I do not want to go into the matter in too great detail, but it is obvious from the various balance sheets to which Deputy McGilligan referred that that situation is imposing great burdens on the classes to which he referred&mdash;people with fixed incomes, old people living on incomes from small investments and other people of that kind.  These people are bearing silently great hardships at the present time while other sections of the community are permitted to get away with huge profits.</P>
    <P>It is true too that the present level of our currency is a definite menace to the country.  Our currency pre-war amounted, only to £16,000,000.  The last account I saw from the Central Bank showed that it had reached £32,000,000 and I suppose it would be in the region of £34,000,000 at the present time.  There is a spirit of extravagance abroad.  One thing I feel should be done by the Government is to encourage saving by our people.  If you can get a number of people to save money or to invest it, at least you will be taking them out of the market as potential buyers of goods that other people may require or are badly in need of.  People who are in a more opulent way, who are not struck by the necessity for saving or of putting by for the rainy day are now competing in a limited market for these goods. Surely it is time for the Government to encourage a greater spirit of saving.</P>
    <P>I think the time is opportune for the Government to look for money by way <Col N="2319" /> of loan so as to have the spending of that money controlled and to ensure that it will be expended advantageously for the country as a whole.  The problem is now one that is very difficult. I do not want to minimise in any way the difficulties that have arisen because of the substantial sums of money coming into this country from workers who have been forced to go abroad to seek employment.  I believe that something like £80,000 per week is coming in at the present time. We have to honour that money in goods.  It cannot be stopped, of course, because people who have gone abroad have a perfect right to send it back to their families.  You might as well say that you should try to prevent people who send out cattle from bringing back money for these cattle.  The whole situation is brimful of difficulties. The only way it could have been prevented was by providing national schemes of work that would create assets and productive employment here.  I regret that the Drainage Bill that is now before the House was not introduced three or four years ago and tackled in a big way.  It would have eventually proved a national asset.  It would have promoted the productivity of a substantial acreage of land that is almost worthless at the present time.</P>
    <P>I can never account for the extraordinary discrepancy in prices of a number of essential commodities. Take, for instance, the prices of woollens as compared with the price for wool paid to the farmer.  Surely the price of the finished article bears no relation at all to the cost of the raw material?  There is obviously a form of profiteering carried on in that industry. The Government in our opinion have absolutely failed to control such industries.  The Emergency Order which prevents an industry from paying more than a certain amount by way of dividend is not sufficient to control the profits that are being made by these industries.</P>
    <P>So far as the cost of living generally is concerned, it is substantially lower in Great Britain.  I admit, of course, <Col N="2320" /> that Great Britain is providing huge subsidies to keep the cost of living stable.  She is providing well over £200,000,000 by way of subsidies and I fear further subsidies will have to be provided here.  The whole position should be further examined and certain classes in this country, the middle classes particularly, should be further helped by way of subsidy because their position is a difficult one.  Their income has remained more or less static, and the financial burdens thrown on them as a result of the emergency have lowered their standard of living and have denied them opportunities of educating their families.  I agree with Deputy McGilligan and other Deputies that the increase in the incidence of disease, particularly of tuberculosis, is a direct result of that situation, of the high and uncontrolled cost of living.</P>
    <P>I direct the Minister's attention to that situation.  So far as the high burden of taxation is concerned, the Minister may suggest that I cannot have it both ways, that we cannot provide further subsidies and children's allowances without increasing the burden of taxation.  That is true.  But take one Department &mdash; the Department of Supplies.  That Department is to cost over £4,000,000 during the coming financial year.  It appears to me that we are not getting value for that amount.  And that is not the full cost of the Department.  The bulk of the personnel of the Department of Supplies has been seconded from other Departments and the salaries of those officers are charged against the Departments to which they are permanently attached, so that the Department of Supplies is costing substantially more than £4,250,000.  It is on items of that sort that we should expect savings to be effected rather than on social services which are beneficial to certain sections of the community which at present require assistance.  I should not be alarmed at expenditure if the country were getting value for it and if our taxation were related in any way to our production or productive capacity.  But surely the Government, Parliament and the Minister ought to be alarmed at a situation in which <Col N="2321" /> taxation is steadily rising and our production is steadily falling.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Hughes, I am not satisfied that the taxpayers are getting sufficient return for the money that is being spent.  I notice that there are substantial increases in a large number of the 73 heads of expenditure now before us since last year's figures were considered by the House.  There is one item to which I should like specially to refer &mdash; the expenditure in connection with the Irish Tourist Board.  A very large increase in that expenditure is proposed for the coming year.  I think that the members of the House should be given some information as to how those moneys are to be spent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was not able to be here yesterday, I was not aware of that arrangement.  Every member of the House must admit, as was pointed out so ably by Deputy O'Leary, that we have a great deal of poverty.  A large number of our workers were forced to emigrate and those who have been left at home are required to labour under circumstances which should not exist in any Christian State.  The majority of our workers are mere slaves and very little is being done by the Government to effect any appreciable improvement in their condition. We know very well that, for the past ten years, social services have improved considerably but they have not improved unknown to the taxpayer. During the early years of the Fianna Fáil Administration, we had the Minister for Finance, who was then Minister for Local Government <Col N="2322" /> and Public Health, going around the country cutting tapes, turning keys and opening big housing schemes. Speeches were made about the improvement in the social services and, particularly, in respect of housing. After 12 months, we saw the Guards and bailiffs throwing the furniture of the tenants of those houses out on the streets because they could not pay the rent.  We, who live in rural parts of the country, know that many local authorities are charging for their houses 8/11, 7/6 and 6/10 per week. No agricultural labourer or ordinary labourer could afford to pay such a rent out of his wages.  I suppose that, in a good many cases, it is the local authority which is to blame for not having houses erected which could be let at 2/6, 3/- or 3/6 per week.</P>
      <P>We have 12,000,000 acres of arable land.  We read in various magazines and books statements by great economists that one acre of land can produce sufficient food to keep one man alive for a year.  I suppose we have now only about 2,500,000 of a population and, while we have 12,000,000 acres of arable land, we are unable to produce sufficient to keep away the spectre of starvation.  Something must be radically wrong somewhere.  Any Deputy here can stand up and tell the Minister the grievances under which the people of his constituency labour. After 20 years of native administration, we have unemployment, poverty, emigration, debt, low wages, and starvation.  Deputy Hughes tells us that the Government should advise the people to save.  What result is likely to come from an appeal to an agricultural labourer to save money out of his £2 a week?  If he presented his balance sheet, it would be found that, to secure the necessaries of life, he would have to expend about £3 15s. or £4 a week.  We should talk in a commonsense way.  People are not sufficiently paid to save.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great deal of talk took place here during the past 20 years and where has it led us?  After all the talk in this House, 100,000 workers had to leave Dun Laoghaire or Rosslare for England, where they are in receipt of £7 or £12 per week.  In England, <Col N="2323" /> before the present war broke out, there were marches of unemployed in all the big cities, including London, Liverpool and Manchester.  The unemployed carried banners with the inscriptions: &ldquo;We want food; we want work; we are starving.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Some years ago the unemployed in England carried a coffin as a protest into No. 10, Downing Street.  Nothing could be done then to satisfy the hunger that existed among those unfortunate people or to put them into work, but when war broke out England could find enough money to spend £15,000,000 a day on the destruction of mankind, and on the destruction of the gifts that God gives to man.  We have the very same position in this country to-day.  We have the work, and we had the men.  I am not inclined to agree with Deputy O'Leary that there is no shortage of labour here.  I see a shortage of labour in my part of the country.</P>

      <P>According to communications that I received from the Board of Works they say they are sorry that they cannot see their way to give us a grant as there are not enough unemployed registered in the district electoral division.  That is the foundation I have for making my statement. I take it that the Board of Works must have the correct information. We cannot have any progress here while we are working on borrowed money.  I have already referred to the conditions that prevailed in various parts of England before the war broke out.  When war did break out, every man was put into productive employment.  Even the women were put to work.  Those of them who could not work were paid for looking at those who were working.  Agents were sent over here to recruit people to take employment in England.  We know of the numbers that have gone over.  They are earning from £7 to £10 a week and are able to send home £3 or £4 a week.  As I have said, we have the work here that requires to be <Col N="2324" /> done but the strange thing is that we cannot get it done.  We have schemes of great national importance, such as bog development, road making and afforestation, that need to be carried out, and every time that representations are made to the Minister for Finance in connection with these schemes we are told that he is giving them sympathetic consideration but regrets that there are no funds at his disposal to carry out such schemes.</P>

      <P>I say that the Minister and the Government are responsible for such a state of affairs.  If they wanted to have money at their disposal they could have it.  Every Party in this House, with the exception of the Party that moved the motion and a few other Deputies, voted against the motion recently brought forward by the Clann na Talmhan Party which proposed to give a bounty of £3 per acre on land.  Many Deputies seemed to look on the motion as a piece of great nonsense.  They laughed at the foolish idea of the Farmers' Party putting it forward. Money costs nothing to create, and I fail to see why a proposal of that kind was not brought forward by the Government and implemented without leaving it to the intelligence of the Farmers' Party to introduce it.</P>

      <P>That is not my fault. The point that I want to stress is that, in the present state of affairs, I can see no hope of an improvement for workers or farmers.  Deputy O'Leary last night said that the agricultural labourer is not getting enough and urged that he should be paid more. That is quite right, but Deputy O'Leary did not say anything about giving the farmer an increased price for what he produces so as to enable him to pay a higher wage.  If we compel the farmer to pay a wage that he is not able to pay, then we will have to do something about increasing the price of what he produces.</P>

Under the present system you cannot increase wages unless you increase the price of what the farmer produces.  I am quite satisfied that political freedom, such as we have, is not worth one straw unless we have financial and economic freedom.

The good would be taken out of them if I had not the Minister here to deal with them.  I will leave that matter over until this afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite satisfied that no results can be achieved until such time as the Government take over control of the currency.  The issue of currency should be in the hands of the Government. When it is, they will be in a position to issue the amount of money that they see there is need for.  I do not wonder that the Minister for Finance is sighing and yawning when he hears anyone talking about currency. He was at it himself before he got into power and so was the Taoiseach.  They said that as soon as they were elected one of the first things to be tackled would be the currency problem: that they would see that the banks would no longer be the masters.  They have been in power now for more than ten years, and during that period they have taken no steps to see that we had our own currency <Col N="2327" /> in operation.  I want to warn the Minister and the Government that, until they control the currency, they will have to go on taxing the people to a greater extent than the people can bear.  As it is, they are only whipping a dead horse.</P>
    <P>Take the scheme in the Children's Allowances Act.  I agree that it is a good one, but it is the taxpayer who will have to bear the cost of it.  I would much prefer if there was no such scheme in operation, but instead that the heads of families were paid a living wage and were able to live a Christian life in accordance with the principles laid down by Pope Leo for the workers.  What is the good of all the talk that we have from a number of Labour Deputies about the poverty and destitution that exist?  One ounce of action is worth a ton of talk.  What are they doing to try to wreck the present system by political action? Talk will not do it.  On the train last evening I met a number of Cork men who were coming to work on the bog at Newbridge.  The conditions that those men will have to face there are not going to be very pleasant for them. I would not be surprised if I met them on the train to-morrow going back to Cork.  Deputy Larkin is familiar with the conditions on the bogs.</P>
    <P>He has been on the bogs in my constituency in the interests of the workers, and is as familiar with the conditions there as I am myself.  I and every Deputy interested in labour must know that at the present time the labouring people are just mere slaves.  Very little is being done to take them out of that slavery.  It does not make any odds what Government is in power so long as we have the present system.  It is the system that is wrong.  You may change the men in power 20 times, but if you do not change the system as well you will get nowhere.  Things will never be right until we have a Government that will be able to issue money at the desire of the people who elected them, and a Government that will be able to control it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Sir John Esmonde Sir John Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is <Col N="2328" /> generally agreed that the cost of living is very high.  I should like to preface my remarks by saying that I do not attribute to the Government the entire responsibility for the high cost of living here at the present time.  No matter what Government was in power the cost of living, as a result of the general situation in the world, must inevitably have increased to some extent.  My complaint is that, in relation to other countries as favourably placed as ours &mdash; perhaps not as well placed &mdash; the cost of living here is far too high.  Some Deputies have already given figures relating to other countries that are not in as advantageous a position as this country is in which the cost of living is only a fraction of what it is here.</P>
      <P>I attribute the present high cost of living here to three main factors which arise out of Government policy during this crisis and during the period in which the cost of living has risen.  The first and most important is the Government's general approach to agriculture; the second is the entire failure to provide shipping for the country; and the third is the bad organisation of our internal trade with special reference to traffic.  With the permission of the House, I intend to deal with those three main heads, to relate them to the cost of living and to the absence of essential foodstuffs at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking, first of all, the question of agriculture, the Fianna Fáil Party in the forefront of their programme have always been very emphatic on the question of growing wheat here.  I have never been opposed to that.  I have been growing wheat myself for some years.  I think that we grow very excellent wheat.  I do not think, however, we get the proper returns as a result of that growing.  I do say, as regards the wheat that we grow here, that it compares favourably with the wheat grown in any other part of the world.  The Government, however, in their emphasis on wheat have entirely overlooked other essential foodstuffs. I questioned the Minister for Agriculture some years ago in this House on the point as to whether he regarded the pig population of this country as <Col N="2329" /> competitors with human beings for the grain grown here.  Although I questioned him several times about that, I did not get from him what I would consider to be a full answer on the point.  It is a point, I think, that goes to the root of the Government's agricultural policy.  They were obsessed with the necessity of growing grain for human consumption and entirely overlooked the other foods that are necessary to keep human beings alive.  It was too late, perhaps, when they saw the fallacy of their policy and abolished, to a certain extent, the activities of the Pigs and Bacon Commission by allowing pigs to go out into a free market.</P>
    <P>I say it was too late when they realised that.  Bacon is as essential to the man who does a hard day's work on the farm as grain is.  The same thing applies to poultry.  In regard to the poultry trade, I presume every Deputy has received a circular within the last week from an anonymous source regarding poultry.  There is a move on foot now to restore the poultry trade. The point is this: that agriculture must be run in this country, particularly at the present time, not for the purpose of providing one class of food but for the purpose of providing all the different classes of food that can be grown here which are necessary for human consumption.  I was one of the few persons who voted in the debate here with the Farmers' Party on the motion which they sponsored to subsidise not wheaten tillage land but all tillage land.  I did so because I believe in the principle of making subsidies do work at one end and not subsidising at the other end.  When one sorts out the wealth of criticism that is delivered here in debate after debate on the cost of living and food supplies it always comes back to this, that the only practical remedy that people put forward is this: &ldquo;We must subsidise foodstuffs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>My theory is, and always has been, that the real factory in this country is the land that is tilled.  That is the factory here.  Put your £1 note in below <Col N="2330" /> and let it work its way up, giving employment and, if necessary, do not have as big prices at the top.  That is the proper way to subsidise foodstuffs. First of all, we will assume that the particular acre that is subsidised grows food such as grain or oatmeal which is directly consumed by the human being.  That subsidy has the effect of reducing the price of that particular article.  But, take it a step further: supposing another acre is subsidised for the purpose of producing food which in turn is supplied to the animal, which in turn is produced into human food, it comes back again to this, whether it is a pig, fowl, beef, or anything else, that that £1 has done its work: it has given employment, it has been an incentive to the farmer to put his last acre under tillage and it has produced essential foodstuffs for the population.  There must be some wisdom behind that theory because it has been adopted to a certain extent in bigger, more powerful countries than our own.  I believe the time will yet arrive when, having got away from theorising in these matters, any Government must come back to that basis, namely, to keep the wheels of that particular factory working to supply cheap food for the people.  As agriculture is carried on in this country at the present time, and as it is carried on as an emergency measure, you must have high prices for agricultural products. Otherwise, the operation of a farm does not pay.  I am not binding myself to £3 per acre, but if you adopt the principle of subsidising all tillage land, you are one step on the road to reducing the price of essential foodstuffs in this country, if only by reason of the fact that you increase the quantity produced.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the question of the Government's approach to agriculture, I should like to say that, at any time that I advance the cause of the man who works his land, the man who is known as the farmer in this country, whether he is a small or a big farmer, I do not do it for the purpose of appealing on behalf of one particular section only, namely, the farming community; I do it because I believe it <Col N="2331" /> is in the general interest of the whole country.</P>
    <P>My arguments in this debate and my arguments in favour of a subsidy on tillage are not directed to benefiting the farming community, but are directed to benefiting the community as a whole, by providing foodstuffs at cheaper rates.  The next point I shall deal with is, I think, just as important, namely, the absence of shipping facilities in this country at the present time.  In that regard we ought to be downright ashamed of ourselves.  I have here a book called <i>The Shipping World Year Book</i>, which gives the tonnage of different ships owned by different countries in the crucial year of our time, 1939.  I think if we could say that this country at the present time owned, say, three tankers, about 200 tramps and about 18 liners &mdash; because these are the categories into which shipping is divided &mdash; we could feel that we were a long way towards solving many of our problems.  I do not believe we had a single tanker.  We had some coasting vessels.  We had no liners.  We would seem to have practically nothing now.  It might surprise the House to know the position in regard to shipping in other countries. Most countries are different in different ways, but I think a fair test for comparison with our country would be Denmark.  What was the position in Denmark in 1939?  If we had only one fraction of Denmark's tonnage, where would we be to-day? In 1939, Denmark had 47 liners with a total tonnage of 297,000; 33 tramp steamers with a tonnage of 141,000, and I come to the most important item of the lot: Denmark had 13 tankers with a tonnage of 105,000.  If in 1939 we had only a small percentage of what Denmark owned we could practically snap our fingers in the face of everybody to-day.  It is to the entire failure of the Government to foresee the shipping situation that we owe most of our economic ills at the present time and, in view of those figures, I do not think there can be any contradiction of that statement.</P>
    <P>The answer might be, possibly would have been at the time, that the procurement <Col N="2332" /> of a tonnage of this kind would involve an enormous expenditure of money which this country could not afford.  Denmark is not the only country.  Let us take another country &mdash; Norway.  I think the population of Norway is roughly the same as the population of this country.  There may be a couple of hundred thousand one way or the other.  Norway believed so much in the use of petrol with her rural occupations that she could afford to have 260 tankers in 1939, presumably in full use.  It is right to say, of course, that Norway's shipping trade was not entirely domestic; she did a big international shipping trade.  She had 218 tramps and 82 liners.  The latter would be the ocean-going ships that go to America, etc.  I want to know did the Government at any time foresee this situation?  Did they ever make any arrangements abroad, in view of the impending crisis in 1939, so as to be in a position to claim some contractual right in connection with some ship in some part of the world?  No preparations whatsoever were made and that is a second largely contributing factor to the situation to-day.</P>
    <P>The third is the position in regard to internal organisation.  There have been glaring examples of trains meeting each other on the lines, a cargo of timber for fuel going in one direction and a cargo of turf going in the other direction, passing each other on the lines.  The whole country is unorganised at the moment.  I am not in favour of an immense amount of Government organisation because I think Government organisation usually leads to interference with private enterprise but there is not adequate or proper organisation.  None of the schemes which are brought out from time to time are correlated and we are going to have worse confusion after the war in the period of reconstruction by reason of the absence of a Department presided over by a Minister for Reconstruction. We had the example recently in the Drainage Bill.  The Drainage Bill, as introduced in this House, is introduced in the air and is not correlated with any other scheme. That is what is wrong with all our emergency schemes here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2333" /> One Department issues one Emergency Order, another Department issues a second Emergency Order, but these Orders are not correlated, with the result that the utmost confusion prevails and there is a great loss of time and energy.  I do not want to go into any great detail in connection with these matters.  There must be many examples that will strike any thinking person immediately.</P>
    <P>A reference has been made to the effect on the cost of living of the standstill Order.  Do Deputies realise the real object of the standstill Order? I believe the real object of the Order was to produce revenue, the idea being that the employer would not be allowed to increase the wages of his employees and, as a result, he would show a greater profit which would be subject to taxation which, in turn, would be collected by the State.  That is what the standstill Order was introduced for.  Where the justice, the wisdom or the good statesmanship lies in this matter of increased profits and taxation, I do not know, but I think we should be frank about these things. We should recognise the real object of that Order.  I do not think the Minister will deny that revenue-collecting was the primary consideration.</P>

      <P>I heard Deputy McGilligan mention some figures with regard to the writing down of premises, but I suggest that the Minister has got considerably increased taxation in cases where firms were not allowed to increase the wages of their employees.  That would be one way of disposing of their increased profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think a discussion on this subject would be complete without some passing reference to a very serious factor which does affect the economic life of the country.  I have in mind what might be referred to as the international situation, for the want of a better expression.  I do not think we should try to hide our heads with regard to that.  I think we should face the situation frankly.  If the statement of the British Prime Minister <Col N="2334" /> yesterday is to be taken literally, we may assume that there will be considerable economic pressure exerted on this country.  We may have our own views on that statement &mdash; that it may only be a threat, not intended to be carried out.</P>
    <P>At all events, if you take the British Prime Minister's statement literally, I think this country is facing the greatest of the crises it has ever faced. The word &ldquo;isolation&rdquo; occurs; we are to be isolated and there will be an absence of shipping and essential commodities. Isolation to us means economic disaster, unless we try to whittle down that economic disaster as much as we can.  There is one way and that I shall refer to in a moment. Speaking as an individual, and not as a member of a Party, I would like to compliment the Head of the Government upon the dignified reply he made the other day when he was replying to a most unreasonable request.  I should also like to say that I have read some of the poison-pen articles as they appeared in otherwise reputable papers in other countries &mdash; not all of them, thank goodness, but in some of them. I would like to say as an ordinary Irishman that the writers of those articles have done more harm to the allied nations' cause than they realise or can ever realise.</P>

I do not believe, and I have never believed, that economic warfare is as hard or severe as bomb and bullet warfare, but it is severe.  I do not believe that the full measure of governmental wisdom resides in any one political Party.  I believe the time has arrived when, in the interests of this country, and as a gesture to those who threaten us from outside in deliberate calculated language, all Parties should have a say in the government of this country.  I say that, realising the gravity, the seriousness of the situation.</P>

      <Col N="2335" /> Our race does not live only in this country.  It lives in other countries, and it can exert great influence there. We are approaching a day which means more to our compatriots abroad, and among these I include those fighting in the British forces, than it does to some of us at home.  I refer to March 17th, the day which is the common link of all Irishmen, and I think the best gesture, the best note of encouragement we could sound to the Irish race at home and abroad, with these threats to our security and our economy, would be an announcement in the Press on the morning of St. Patrick's Day that the Irish people at home had come together and had agreed to govern this country as a whole, with every Party having a say in same.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate seems to have become more or less confined to one channel, the cost of living, and probably there is a number of reasons to explain this concentration on the part of the members of all Parties who have participated in the debate.  Possibly the major reason is that now, after four years of manifest ineptitude on the part of the Government, after four years in which we have clearly proved what was charged against them at the beginning of the war, we realise that we have arrived at the crisis of the country's problem.  The burden we have allowed to be placed on the backs of the common people has become not only intolerable, in the sense of being objectionable, but unbearable, from the aspect of the people not being any longer able to bear it.  Apart from external crisis, we are still faced with the possibility, manifested in the words of our Ministers, that this growing burden of the cost of living will become more severe.  No relief is afforded to our people, nor does there seem to be any realisation or appreciation on the part of the Government that they must call a halt to their stupidity and reconsider their refusal to listen to the suggestion made to them four years ago.  The other reason is possibly one that Deputy Cosgrave charged the Labour Party <Col N="2336" /> with, namely, that speaking on the cost of living now may be a very good vote-catching subject.  I would not like to dwell on that aspect.</P>
      <P>I welcome the speech Deputy McGilligan made.  It was a very fine factual statement, with which anybody who has studied the position and who has tried to keep close to the problem will not disagree.  It struck me, knowing Deputy McGilligan's ability to make a forcible presentation of a case, that he seemed somewhat lacking towards the end of his contribution.  The Deputy is well able to present a picture. He indicated the weakness and the failure of the Government and the cupidity in certain elements of the social structure in this country, but yet he seemed to hesitate to go further and to indicate what should be done to deal with the situation.  I do not want to accuse Deputy McGilligan of speaking merely for the sake of attracting attention, either to himself or to his Party &mdash; he was dealing with a problem that is in everybody's mind &mdash; but I do suggest, not only to the Fine Gael Party, but also to the members of the Farmers' Party, that speeches of that kind, although valuable in presenting to us a picture of the situation that we face to-day and that may become worse to-morrow, are nevertheless platitudes unless the speakers put forward some suggestions as to the remedies that could be provided, and unless they are prepared not only to consider remedies, but to understand the implications and accept the consequences. That has not been manifested by the speakers representing those Parties so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While a debate of this kind may, in many ways, seem to be merely an opportunity for many of us to get up here on our feet and make a speech and, possibly, get a few lines in the newspapers, and while it may be said that it would really be only traversing many of the grounds that have already been covered by other speakers &mdash; of course, as we all know, a Deputy can get up and say: &ldquo;I have not very much to say because the Deputy who has just spoken has already covered the ground&rdquo;&mdash; nevertheless, I think that even the most inept contribution <Col N="2337" /> that has been made to this debate &mdash; and, God knows, there have been many &mdash; is a very valuable contribution; particularly from the point of view that, during the last year or two, continuous pressure has been brought on this Government with a view to getting them to understand the problem that exists and the terrible burden that has been placed on the people in this country who are dependent, for their sole income, on the various payments that are made by the State, whether through outdoor relief, widows' and orphans' pensions, old age pensions, unemployment assistance, and so on.</P>
    <P>Week after week, questions have been asked in this House, and agitations have taken place outside the House, with a view to bringing pressure on the Government to give some relief to that section of our people, who are the hardest hit of any section of our community, but we were told that nothing could be done, that the Government could not give in because they had not the money; that they were doing much more than the Labour Party, with all its exaggerated claims on behalf of these people, could do, and that there was actually no real problem.  Week after week, we had that reply from the Government, but then they changed their minds and gave some concessions to these people.  Of course, we realise now that certain rows were going on between the Leaders of the Government Party and the rank and file of that Party, on account of these conditions, and the result was that, finally, some concessions had to be made by the Leaders of the Party, and they had to release the safety valve.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I say that a debate of this character is of value to the extent that, even if crocodile tears are being shed in the House over the conditions of agricultural labourers and industrial workers, they may at least have the effect of water dropping on a stone, and perhaps these drops of water, even if they are in the form of crocodile tears, may have some effect by continually falling on the stony hearts of the members of the Government. Unfortunately, however, those drops of water, in the circumstances <Col N="2338" /> in which our country is, can become changed very easily into drops of blood, and it must be remembered that it is the blood of our own people that is concerned.  That is the real difficulty with which we are faced in connection with such a subject as we are dealing with in to-day's debate.</P>
    <P>When we are speaking of the cost of living, I think it would be just as well to keep things in their proper proportion.  Let us recall what has happened in the past few years, and let us also admit that some of the mistakes or failures made by the Government have been made as a result of certain powers that were given to them by this House, under the Emergency Powers Act, since the beginning of the war.  Now, nobody will quarrel with the fact that a Government in a time of emergency must have power to act quickly and decisively, but I should like to point out that, of all the Parties in this House, only those who spoke from this bench fought the Government and warned them that, if they tried to control wages, they should also try to keep down prices.</P>
    <P>As a result of that warning, the Government have had to mend their hand and to make available even the meagre bonuses that it is now possible to obtain through the Wages Tribunal that has been set up.  We also warned the Government of the mistake they were making in controlling only one factor in the total sum of all the factors that were concerned: that they were keeping down wages while allowing the prices of commodities to run wild.  In other words, as we pointed out, they started at the wrong end. Before they started to deal with the question of giving bonuses to workers, they had already allowed the cost of living to increase by 54 points.  They have never succeeded in catching up on that in their efforts to remedy the situation, and every time a bonus is awarded, it will be found that the cost of living has, by that time, risen by another five or six points.</P>
    <P>Apart from the fact that they have been forced to extend their sense of generosity to those who have already <Col N="2339" /> given them support by amending the first Order, it must be remembered that even if an advance of a shilling or two may be given in wages, that is counteracted by the fact that in the meantime the cost of living has risen by five or six points, and I think it must be admitted that this is the only Party which looked ahead and realised that we were coming to this situation.  We gave sufficient warnings time after time.  The only difficulty is that our people are too patient, and I may say, quite frankly, that they have been deceived and misled by the fact that embodied in the personality of the present Leader of the Government are certain qualities and characteristics that attract their support and, as a result, they fail to see the sinister influences that are behind him and that take cover under the shadow of his personality.</P>
    <P>It is only now that the people are starting to wake up, but if there had been any awakening or any reaction in the minds of the people of our country in the first year, or the first two or three years, of the present war, many of the errors and mistakes of the Government could have been avoided.  Unfortunately, so many mistakes have been made now that they cannot be overtaken, and, frankly, we have to face up to the fact that we cannot rectify those mistakes now or bring the Government back into a state of grace. We cannot bring the cost of living back now to the pre-war level, nor can we bring wages up to the level of the cost of living to-day.  The whole thing has got out of hand as a result of the mistakes of the Government, and all we can do is to save what we can for the people of our country, and especially for the women and children, from the shipwreck that we have allowed to come upon us.</P>
    <P>In the course of Deputy McGilligan's speech, which, more or less, has set the tone for this debate, he did refer to a number of factors that are only now being considered &mdash; not in an abstract way, but in relation to the definite problems of prices, wages, profiteering, subsidies, and general taxation by the Government.  These <Col N="2340" /> factors are concerned with the high profits that are being earned by certain sections of the community and the reserves that are being salted away, and the Deputy did indicate in a general way the lines along which his thoughts were running.  However, as I said before, there seems to be a reluctance, both on the part of the members of the Fine Gael Party and the Farmers' Party, to face up to the implications involved.  I am far from being an expert with regard to agricultural matters.  In fact, I suppose I might be described as being almost an ignorant man so far as agriculture is concerned, but I have listened continually, with interest, to the contributions that have been made from all benches here to debates in this House by Deputies who come from agricultural areas, and, frankly, I have been amazed, not only at their ability to disagree with one another even on the most simple technical questions in regard to the industry, but also at the facility with which they seem to think that the whole problem of agriculture is one that can be solved by way of subsidies: that once those subsidies are granted, they do not seem to be concerned as to where the money is to be obtained, and that it is simply a question for somebody else to solve.</P>
    <P>Now, I have no objection to subsidies being given for agricultural products. I believe that the farmers are entitled to a fair price for their products, but there are other factors to be taken into consideration.  If the prices of agricultural products are to be subsidised, we have to ask ourselves: where will we obtain the money?  I think it is quite true to say that there will be quite a slowing down on the part of the farming community in their demands when they see the bill that has been presented by the Minister, which amounts to almost £50,000,000.  If that bill is to be increased by another £10,000,000, in order to subsidise agricultural products further, where are we to get that money?  I do not suppose it is possible to increase subsidies on agricultural products without increasing prices to the consumer.  Now, those of us who have to pay for those products <Col N="2341" /> have paid up to the limit.  We cannot pay more money for milk, for butter, for flour or for vegetables, and yet these are the basic products upon which agriculture is dependent, and, at the same time, the basic foods which the urban communities require in order to exist.  Have they found any solution for this problem?  I cannot see it and I have listened very attentively to the debate.</P>
    <P>If subsidies are provided and we do find a way of providing the money on which we can all agree, what are you going to do with it when you get it?  We hear day after day question after question, not only from the Labour Benches but even from the Farmers' Benches, as to the position of the farm labourer existing on £2 per week.  I wonder would the Farmers' Party and the Farmer Deputies of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael give the agricultural labourers a guarantee that if they get an adequate subsidy in order to enable them to increase production and provide food, they would pass on a fair proportion of it to the agricultural labourers, without any coercion or compulsion but purely out of the goodness of their hearts?  I wonder would they and I wonder would the farming community be prepared to give such a guarantee.</P>
    <P>Secondly, suppose we provide subsidies and agree on the way in which the money is to be provided, is the subsidy to be provided to every farmer, irrespective of who or what he is?  Is it to be provided irrespective of the size of his farm, his capacity to make that farm a paying proposition, his financial reserves, his ability to exploit and extract profit out of his farm labourers?  Is there no differentiation as between farmers?  Is every farmer in the same position? Have we not got farmers living on a standard below that of the urban worker and a little above that of the farm labourer, while next door is a fairly well-to-do farmer and also what we might call the ordinary capitalist farmer working his farm as a factory and making a damn good job of it, the same as any other industrialist in the city?  Are they all to be subsidised on the same basis?  Do we propose to require the ordinary working man, the <Col N="2342" /> person of low income to whom Deputy McGilligan referred, the small farmer or the agricultural labourer, to pay increased taxation in order to increase the profits already being earned by many of the farming community?</P>
    <P>Surely there must be some more realistic approach to this question than the approach of merely asking that money should be poured out without any thought as to where it is to come from or to whom it is to go.  Everybody seems to forget that we have social strata in this country, that we are not all in the same position, that if there are men and women hungry, there are other men and women who have not only a sufficiency but a superfluity and that the approach of the man who has too little and the man who has too much to the same problem is entirely different.  They come at the problem from different angles.  It has been suggested in this House before, as the basis on which we have to tackle this problem, that we have been living, and possibly will be living to a greater extent in a very short while, in a beleaguered fortress, that we are one family and that the first claim of any member of that family to consideration should be the claim of the weakest and of those less able to defend and protect themselves.  That is not what we have been doing.  We have been giving to those who are strongest, those who are able to enforce their demands and get their price and we have spurned and in many ways spat upon those who are weakest and who have first claim to our consideration, whether it be from the ethical, the social or the Christian viewpoint.</P>
    <P>In presenting this question to the Farmers and to Fine Gael I do not do so with any desire to score points, but there is a problem to be faced, and they are definitely not facing it. Whether we on the Labour Benches are facing it or not is a question also to be considered, but at least we should try to understand the implications in asking that the rising cost of living be controlled, that the wages of the very lowly paid, of the unorganised, of the very low income groups be improved, that this piling up of profits and <Col N="2343" /> reserves in the banks and this ability to hide them under depreciation and under the cleaning up of the fronts of business houses in Dame Street be stopped.  We must try to understand that we are dealing with something more than the mere presenting of a political programme, that we are dealing with something which is in actual fact a question of flesh and blood, the flesh and blood of our own people.  We have to try to find amongst ourselves a common denominator, a basis on which we can all agree, and on that basis to tackle these problems which are eating into the vitals of our people.</P>
    <P>One of the points which interested me in listening to this debate is that at the moment we are discussing only the amount of money to be spent and, as I said, we have all turned our minds to the question of the cost of living.  In a little while, we shall have to face the problem of how we propose to provide the money which we are discussing to-day.  There will be an interval between the two debates and I think it will be very valuable if all of us who are trying to apply our minds to this problem of the cost of living would apply our minds equally to certain of the questions which will be raised when the Budget comes up for debate, such as the problem of the ratio of direct to indirect taxation.  I tried by means of a question to get the figures from the Minister, but he very wisely discovered that he could not answer the question.  I should like to give him an answer by telling him that, at the start of this war, indirect taxation amounted to probably 70 per cent. of the total taxation levied by the Government and that to-day, after all the measures he has taken in the form of extra excess profits taxation and limitation of dividends, that ratio has not been altered to the extent of 5 per cent. and that we are still in the position in which the whole burden of this emergency is being borne by the bulk of the people, by, I should say, 90 per cent., who between them own less than 20 per cent. of the wealth of the country, and that the other secure, safe and very well-satisfied 10 per cent. <Col N="2344" /> who control probably 80 to 90 per cent. of the wealth of the country are still getting away with it, as they got away with it before the emergency came upon us.</P>
    <P>I ask if, when we come to deal with the Budget &mdash; and it is relevant to what we are discussing now because we are discussing the question of how to provide moneys and how these moneys should be expended &mdash; those who are dealing with these problems of taxation, the cost of Government services, will consider what was mentioned during the course of the debate on the Children's Allowances Bill, that is, how the money should be raised and who should provide it, and see whether they can still find it possible to be consistent not only in to-day's debate, but, more important, when it comes to a question as to whose pocket is to be emptied to provide these social services.  I think we will find that the tone of the discussion will have greatly altered as between this debate and the Budget debate.</P>
    <P>I referred in passing to direct and indirect taxation.  It seems to me that, when this emergency came upon us, one of the basic problems which faced the Minister was the taking of immediate steps to alter so far as possible the ratio between direct and indirect taxation in such a way as to ease the burden on the mass of the people by reducing the ratio of indirect taxation, which has always been the refuge of the reactionary and non-progressive government.  One would imagine that the present Government, with its fine progressive outlook, which always remains an outlook and never becomes a practical proposition, would have been one of the first to devise ways and means of altering that wholly reprehensible and objectionable practice of placing the main burden of taxation in such indirect forms that the bulk of the people pay the money without ever realising what the amount of the bill is.</P>
    <P>That was never done by them, even though the Minister for Industry and Commerce tried to indicate that in the Children's Allowances Bill they had that object in mind.  Somehow he very quickly retreated when he found that the position was becoming a little too <Col N="2345" /> warm.  From that particular angle we have got to try to appreciate the steps taken by the Government to deal with the cost of living and the ratio of wages to prices.  When the war commenced the Government took certain steps that they considered to be appropriate. They took power to control prices and to control wages.  The control of prices largely failed, except in so far as it was merely a record of the height to which certain people in various enterprises forced up the price of particular articles.  The control of dividends is largely a joke, because it merely means that certain sums are not paid out, but are put into reserve, and that there will be all the larger amounts to be distributed when this particular emergency legislation is no longer in existence.</P>
    <P>There were, of course, subsidies and, as far as many of these subsidies are concerned, they are an outrage, because we were already subsidising, and these people have already garnered their share of the loot in transactions of various kinds.  I need only refer to the subsidy on bread paid to master bakers in the City of Dublin.  We know from the published accounts of these companies that they are in a healthy position and able to pay 7 per cent. and 8 per cent. without any difficulty. That may be the position with other concerns about which we cannot get figures, because that is purely the privilege of the prices control section of the Department of Supplies.  We have control of wages.  That seems to have been the one field of endeavour in which the Government has been, to any extent, successful, but not completely successful, because certain sections of workers objected to what the Minister indicated in his original statement. Finally we have inflation.</P>
    <P>The one thing the Government set out to avoid they have succeeded in bringing into our midst.  I am not going to go into details, but we have a 70 per cent.  increase in the cost of living while the average increase in wages is 18 per cent.  That increase in wages does not apply to all wages, but only to wages in certain industries in which the figures have been calculated by the Department of Industry and Commerce.  These happen to be <Col N="2346" /> industries in which the workers are strongly organised, where they were able to take advantage of and to utilise the machinery provided by Emergency Powers Order 260 in applications for bonus increases.  Outside of these groups there are thousands of lowly-paid workers unorganised, who have not had a single increase in wage since the start of the war.  Even where these workers had knowledge that machinery exists, they had no organisation to speak for them or to take advantage of the machinery. Above all they had no organisation to protect them against employers.  As a result we get periodical cases of married men with five children in this fourth year of the war existing on £2 a week in the City of Dublin.  These are not isolated cases.</P>
    <P>Time after time we have managed to take advantage to the fullest extent of the Emergency Powers Order, and of the machinery available, in so far as organised workers are concerned, in cases where they were able to defend themselves within the conditions of the present system.  The other workers in sweat-shops and in dens run by mushroom capitalists, fostered by the Government under its industrial policy, are outcasts, and the Government denies all knowledge of them. Trade organisations have no knowledge of them either because there is no contact.  Yet, these men and women are entitled to live the same as organised employers and farmers. Under the form of machinery set up they are condemned to live on wages that have lost 50 per cent. of their purchasing power because of ineptitude and the failure of the Government to protect them.  We have to consider first the question of prices and, secondly, the effect of low prices on income.</P>
    <P>Very often when we go to a tribunal to consider wage negotiations we are reminded of the position of shareholders in industries who are dependent on small incomes.  We know that in the bulk of the industries the controlling shares are owned by a small group that is trying to establish a monopoly over the transport system. The unfortunate men or women who <Col N="2347" /> have £10, £20 or £100 invested get no more consideration than the workers or, even less, because they have no organisation.  Undoubtedly they feel the burden even in a more intensified form than organised workers.  If they are to get anybody to speak for them it will not be in the Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael Parties.  It will be on the workers' party that, very often, they despise that they have to depend for some protection in times like these. These are persons with low incomes. We speak for them just as we speak for workers in organised trades and for the common mass of humanity.</P>
    <P>The question of prices is one that has gone to such a pitch that possibly the archangel Gabriel could not solve it satisfactorily.  It is quite clear that the cost of living should be tackled from one or two directions.  We have got to have a compromise and, to try, if we can find by an encircling movement &mdash; which seems to be a popular form of military strategy &mdash; ways and means of dealing with the continuous rise in the cost of living and, if possible, to bring it down below the present level.</P>
    <P>I wish to pause here to remark on a very peculiar thing.  The November cost-of-living figure was 294 points. Everybody expected that the figure for mid-February would prove to be well over 300, on account of the increase in the prices of bread, butter, sugar and milk, and on account of the seasonal increase of three or four points which always takes place during the winter months.  Lo and behold, when the figure did emerge, it had gone up only two points.  I would like to congratulate the Minister for Finance on his civil servants: they have done an excellent job this time in arranging the cost-of-living figure.  To any man with ordinary commonsense, it is quite clear that 296 is not an accurate statistical reflection of the cost of living to-day, but is a political figure deliberately manufactured to suit the political purposes of the Government.  It is a figure which, sooner or later, must be subject to inquiry and checking, not by those subject to the Ministers of the Government, but by men who are <Col N="2348" /> free to exercise their own judgement in that checking and re-checking and to report according to their own conscience. I am not prepared to accept 296 as the figure, as I know that, as early as October last, the members of the Government themselves were expecting a radical increase in the cost of living and were almost accepting the position that they could not control it.  Yet they have succeeded in keeping it down to two points increase over a period when there was always an increase of two or three points and when we know ourselves that the increase in two of the commodities alone accounted for 2½ points, without taking into consideration any other factors that may have arisen in the case of essential foodstuffs and clothes.</P>
    <P>On the question of prices, it seems to me that we have to agree to confine the problem within certain narrow limits &mdash; limits most important to the mass of the people, namely, the prices of essential foods.  If we concentrated on the question of bread, potatoes, milk and butter, we might gain certain success in at least holding to the present prices or driving them down a little; and if that occurred, we would have attained a success of value and comfort to the mass of our people.  Let us take the price of bread &mdash; the price fixed after inquiry and consultation with the Price Control section of the Department of Supplies.  It is peculiar that the price of bread is controlled and determined by the price of flour, yet there never has been a public inquiry into the price of flour, in spite of repeated demands.  I know definitely that, on private inquiries, the figures produced by the representatives of the milling associations have been challenged and rejected as not being correct.  It is easy to understand that when we realise that, in the calculation of the price of flour, all other factors going to make up the costings of the industry are taken into account.  The millers say that flour machinery has to be replaced every six years, so that in the case of a machine valued at £60,000 they have to put in £10,000 for depreciation every year.  I do not think that would be accepted by any <Col N="2349" /> reasonable man anywhere, especially in a period of emergency.  The Prices Commission, however, are compelled to accept that, as the Revenue Commissioners have accepted it as a basis for levying income-tax and corporation profits tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>They could not question the Revenue Commissioners' attitude in the matter.  That is the position in the flour-milling industry, where a certain capital sum is put down for the capital value of machinery and fixed assets, which fixes the earnings, and they are fixed around 6 per cent.  You have a peculiar position, in which you may actually close down a firm and still get 6 per cent. on your capital.  We have tried time after time, at certain public inquiries in the City of Dublin, to obtain a proper and impartial investigation into the price of flour.  Maybe, if we had it, we would not have to subsidise the price of bread in Dublin.</P>
      <P>The same problem arises in the case of vegetables.  Reference has been made here to the position of the middle man.  I often wonder why the agricultural community, like ourselves in the towns, are prepared to be so generous to the gentleman who steps in between us.  I do not want to compare in detail the figures paid in the Dublin markets for produce and the prices paid in the shops; but I suggest that by the proper control of prices for vegetables in Dublin and other cities and towns, we would without any difficulty achieve a 25 per cent. reduction immediately, without taking a penny from the farmers and, possibly, giving them a little more than they are getting now. That would do away with some of the leeches who are living on the work of the farmers and on the needs of the urban communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All these factors are well known to those who are interested in them but they seem continually to escape the attention of those charged with the actual control of prices.  In regard to milk and butter, I would remind the <Col N="2350" /> House of a very reasonable suggestion made inside and outside the House. There are two sections of the people who want to buy butter &mdash; those who have to buy it as an essential food, especially for children, and those who, in addition to their ordinary ration, are willing and prepared and do buy butter as a means of cooking and for the making of sauces and those variegated dishes in which they indulge. For that additional butter they are prepared to pay a considerably higher price.  The suggestion was made that there should be a supply of butter, based on the ration, at a reduced price, to which everybody would be entitled, and that that ration should be smaller than the present ration and should be guaranteed.</P>
    <P>The suggestion continued that there should be an additional or surplus amount of butter, which could be purchased at a largely increased price, and which would be available to those with the money to pay for it.  That would ensure, as we do not do now, that practically every family would get a minimum supply of butter.  There are many families in the country to-day who, although entitled to six ounces per head, never buy that amount, as they cannot afford it.  Secondly, the higher price for the surplus butter would possibly result in an increased price to the farmers, or would cover the cost of selling the larger portion at a reduced price.  The same could be achieved in regard to milk.  All these suggestions are made time after time, and are put forward to the Government in various forms, but they are never considered.  When they are taken up by the Government and made effective, however, the Government is always very careful to obtain the credit for them.  They want all the credit for the good deeds and no blame for the bad ones.</P>
    <P>One of the basic factors affecting the cost of living is the question of wages and low incomes.  There is need for a radical revision of the whole approach to the question of wages. We have certain machinery in existence, set up by the Government, under which certain forms of application <Col N="2351" /> are prescribed.  We have applications for standard rate orders and bonus orders, hearings by tribunals, etc.  We have found out that an employer who wants to be difficult or recalcitrant can cause intolerable delay in the hearing of applications.  With the rising figure in the index of the cost of living, we have a complete repetition of the applications time after time.  In certain cases, we have had three or four applications for certain sections of workers, in order to get a maximum increase of 11/-.  Surely, there could be an easier and more businesslike approach to this problem? If the Government, in their wisdom, say that rising wages are the cause of inflation &mdash; and that is childish enough for the Government to stand over &mdash; surely, they could agree to have it dealt with in the form of some general Order?  Such an Order might provide that a certain increase in the cost of living would result in a certain percentage being allowed on the wages rates.  That could be done in large sections of industry by a general Order permitting increases to be made, without the multiplicity of applications, the repetition and the involved machinery operating to-day.</P>
    <P>I was somewhat surprised yesterday when the Minister for Industry and Commerce informed us that the cost of the advisory tribunals was something less than £7,000.  If he added up all the time wasted by the tribunal officials trying to hunt up the material and the information they require as well as attending the tribunals, and also by officials not engaged on the work of the tribunals &mdash; because last December 12 months every factory inspector in the Department was running round like a messenger boy in the City of Dublin trying to contact employers in order to get applications dealt with before the Christmas holidays &mdash; he would find that the cost of the tribunals is considerably more than he set down.</P>
    <P>Further, whether we like it or not, there must be some alteration in this machinery which will look after and cater for the peculiar position of the very lowly-paid worker and the unorganised <Col N="2352" /> worker.  We have many cases of sectional workers who were unorganised before and even during the war, some of them, by the way, in Government-subsidised industries, with wages of £2 and £2 10s. per week for married men.  Under the existing machinery, it is not possible to increase that standard or basic wage. A man who had £2 on 8th April, 1942, must continue to receive £2 as a standard wage and he is confined to an increase on that £2 at present of 11/- per week, which means that at the present cost-of-living figure he has to maintain himself and his family on a sum of 51/- per week.  There is no solution of that particular problem. The only assistance and relief that can come to him is that, when the cost of living increases, the amount of the bonus presumably increases.  But, as I pointed out, with the increase in the cost of living as it is to-day, workers only get 1/- for every ten points.  They actually lose seven points out of that ten points, for which they get no return at all.</P>
    <P>So that the more the cost of living increases, even though these lowly-paid workers do receive an additional bonus, the position of these workers relative to the cost of living as a whole is gradually becoming worse. Therefore, I suggest that, apart altogether from the pressure that may be exercised on the Government in this debate in relation to the cost of living as a whole, there is a problem there which should be given consideration so as to find out how and in what way the existing machinery could be amended to deal with the difficult position of lowly-paid and unorganised workers.  In the same way, the unorganised workers who are given certain facilities by this Emergency Powers Order, No. 260, as they belong to no organisation are ignorant of these facilities and are unable to take advantage of them.  Accordingly, they have not got the relief afforded them to the small measure of the bonus allowed.</P>
    <P>These are two basic factors that we have to consider &mdash; prices and wages.  I say that we should try to achieve some form of combined operation which will <Col N="2353" /> bring them into close relationship.  I think that, on the basis of the public balance sheets of the main industrial companies, we can without any difficulty and without any danger of inflation decide that in certain groups of industries wages could be adjusted from time to time over the whole range of an industry without any special investigation. I challenge the Minister to produce figures, or to give any concrete case showing that, since the advisory tribunals started to operate and bonuses were given as a result of hearings before these tribunals, the increases in wages or bonuses granted by these tribunals have had any appreciable effect in bringing about an increase in prices.  The very factor on which he based his whole case for the control of wages, namely, the danger of inflation, has not been apparent at all during this whole period when wages have been increased by 11/-.</P>
    <P>I sat in on tribunal after tribunal and listened to employers from different industries and trades and I have not heard one of them take up the position that, if they granted even the maximum bonus of 11/-, they would have to increase prices because of that single factor alone.  Anyone who has studied the ordinary costings of industries knows very well that the effect of an increase of 5/- or 10/- in wages on the ultimate cost of an article is very often so negligible that you cannot account for it.  It is our experience on the tribunals and the trade boards, which also deal with wages, that in many cases, while the employers could not produce figures to show that an increase in wages would lead to an increase in price, they were always very cautious to say that it would not lead to any appreciable increase in price. We had to correct them and point out that we would not commit ourselves to that very mild statement unless they were prepared to bring in accounts to prove definitely and conclusively that even that small, negligible increase in price was a result definitely of the increase in wages given.  The remarkable thing is that, when you ask an employer to produce his accounts and balance sheet in order to prevent an increase in wages, he always finds that <Col N="2354" /> it is cheaper to give the increase in wages rather than to provide the figures, if you are wrong.</P>
    <P>On the question of prices, I think that prices have become a problem that would dismay not only the Fianna Fáil Government but any Government with ten times their ability and a 1,000 times their energy.  If we sit still and let the thing come upon us like a tide on the beach, we will be overwhelmed, because day after day the problem will become more uncontrollable by the Minister who is supposed to be controlling it.  If we are to tackle the problem of the cost of living, the first thing to be done is to realise that our present machinery for controlling prices is largely a joke.  First of all, it does not enjoy public confidence.</P>
    <P>Any machinery that is in operation under the semi-secrecy of a Government Department over which there is no direct control by public representatives, except through the unsatisfactory form of questions and statements and debates, and with which there is not associated any representative of the various interests of the community or of the various industries and trades, cannot inspire confidence.  When, on top of that, you have the stupidities represented by the various Orders issued day after day, it is no wonder that the ordinary member of the public feels that, so far as they are concerned, the only duty of the prices section of the Department of Supplies in order to control prices is to record the highest point reached by a particular article and embody that in their control of it.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the first step to be taken is to associate with the control of prices all the important interests in a particular trade or industry that may be the subject of investigation. If you are investigating the price of bread, then the operatives, both skilled and unskilled, should be called into consultation.  The consumer should be represented because it is a definite fact that if employers or business men submit a statement of figures to an ordinary civil servant and if those figures are not checked by a man who has got practical experience of the <Col N="2355" /> actual manufacture of the article, and by the housewife or the man who has got to purchase the article in a shop, it is very easy to make mistakes on the part of the civil servants and easy for the industrialist or the business man to get away with a very swollen price.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in any measure of control provision should be made, not for a form of bureaucratic procedure, but to give legal determination and expression to the people's will that they are going to stop this wholesale racketeering. In every village and town throughout the country there should be local representation of the community on the prices control section, in the form of citizens control committees, to whom an appeal could be made by any consumer who had been overcharged or who had been denied his civil right to be supplied with certain commodities.  These local committees would have power to inform the local Gárda, who would then take immediate action.  That would be an improvement on the present procedure, where you must first wait for a report of the Guards and afterwards have a long delay of perhaps months before the matter is brought before the courts.  Under the system which I suggest the Guards would have a right to go into the shop where any overcharge was made, insist that the money should be refunded immediately and prosecute the offenders afterwards.  That is the system which is followed in England, and we have to admit that the cost of living there has been kept within reasonable bounds.  The average man and woman there also enjoys a higher standard of living than before the war started.  We are not in the war, yet our standard of living has gone very much below that which obtained here before the holocaust came upon us.  I think it is essential that whenever the price of any article has to be investigated, those who have a practical knowledge of the manufacture of the article and those who have got to buy the article in the shop, should be consulted.</P>
    <P>I need not go into detail to show the stupidity of trying to fix the price <Col N="2356" /> of an article without taking the simple precaution of ascertaining the views of the workers engaged in the manufacture of that article.  Take, for example, the last Order in regard to control of prices issued by the Minister, the Order controlling the price of clothing.  A certain figure is arrived at as being the cost of manufacture. That, I presume, is worked out between the manufacturer and the Department of Supplies.  Then a percentage of profit is allowed on that which the wholesaler may charge.  A further percentage is allowed to the retailer.  Here in the year 1944, in an emergency that has now lasted for four years, we have got the position that the Department of Supplies calmly and with the authority of the House allows a gross profit on an article, be tween the point of manufacture and the sale of the article over the counter to the ordinary consumer, of 70 per cent.  That, in itself, would not be so bad except that the lower percentages &mdash; in certain cases the percentage is below 70 per cent. &mdash; are confined to the lower-paid articles.  Unhappily, if you go to buy the lower-paid articles you find that they just do not exist; you have only one choice and that is to pay the big price.</P>
    <P>When it comes to a question of purchasing an article it is not a question of 75 per cent. over the pre-war price. The increase in prices as shown in the <i>Trade Journal</i> is as high as 171 per cent., in some cases.  Woollen and art silk garments are shown to have increased in price by 194 per cent., and other woollen garments by 102 per cent., 110 per cent., etc.  These are all within the scope of the Order made by the Minister.  It seems to me that that is one of the instances in which we must have some revision of the machinery to control prices.  I am convinced that there can be no effective control, no control in which the public will have confidence, so long as that control is centred within a small group of officials of the Civil Service, consulting with those who are directly interested, not in the control of prices, but in getting the highest price they can get away with under Government control.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2357" /> These are briefly the lines along which my thoughts have been running and I just want to conclude by mentioning the remedies as they appear to me.  I notice that even on the Fine Gael Benches &mdash; and I have very little love for Fine Gael &mdash; there seems to be an approach to a more human understanding of some of these problems. Deputy McGilligan, for instance, mentioned the necessity of controlling the profits of private firms and he seemed very friendly towards that tendency. He has gone very much in advance of members of the Government because they seem determined to maintain private control of industry in this country for the next generation.</P>
    <P>If we could get agreement amongst the Opposition Parties in this House on the means to be adopted to deal with this problem we need not ask for Government favours any longer. This problem of the cost of living is sufficiently grave, sufficiently terrifying and sufficiently urgent to justify whatever action may be necessary to compel them to come to their senses. Until we, on the other benches, agree on common measures, then we are at the mercy of the Government and they can continue to play ducks and drakes, not alone with any schemes we may put up but with the welfare of the people of the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan mentioned a fact which is quite well known, the very large increase in bank deposits.  In this country the banks are very generous people.  They pay 1 per cent., or a ½ per cent., on the money deposited with them and on the profits which they make on that money they distribute 12 per cent. amongst their shareholders.  I suggest that, if we are in an emergency, if the main consideration is to carry the people through that emergency until we get into calm waters, all measures and means are justified if they are proved to be essential to the needs of the community.  If there is a very large sum of money lying in the banks which is earning only 1 per cent. for depositors, money utilised by their banks in their own peculiar way, it would not be difficult, we think, to require the banks to provide the State with <Col N="2358" /> a loan either free of interest or at the rate of interest which the banks pay their depositors on deposits.  I think it would not be impossible to obtain from the banks a loan of £10,000,000 or £20,000,000 in that way.  If we pay them 1 per cent. on that money we shall have to pay only £100,000 or £200,000 per annum by way of interest. The actual repayment of the capital sum can be delayed until after the emergency.  If we had a sum of £20,000,000 available it would mean that we could subsidise the prices of essential foodstuffs and subsidise essential agricultural production to the tune of £6,000,000 a year at a cost of £200,000 in the actual Budget.</P>
    <P>In addition we have the problem that is shown by this high earning capacity exhibited in the balance sheets of the leading industrial concerns in the country.  The Minister, unlike his counterparts in other countries, is collecting only 75 per cent. of the excess profits made out of the emergency by these firms.  That tax could be increased to 100 per cent.  In addition the reserves that are set aside under various peculiar headings in companies' balance sheets could be called upon as an emergency measure because the piling up of reserves by these industrial concerns, in order to meet the post-war years, will be of little value if, by the time the war is over, we have destroyed the very people these industries should serve. Finally, the small and privileged section of our people to whom I have already referred &mdash; the number is small, less than 3,000 &mdash; who have an income equal to that enjoyed by 80,000 or 90,000 industrial workers should be called upon to pay a little more.  A man or woman with an income of £60 a week can afford to carry much more of the burden than he or she is carrying at present in comparison with the industrial worker, the agricultural labourer or the farmer, whose income does not exceed £5 or £6 a week. When we speak of prices, food production and wages, we must come back to the question of subsidies, but there I can see certain difficulties in the case of members of other Parties in this House.  That is why I suggest that it <Col N="2359" /> is not sufficient to give a factual picture of the situation without indicating, in a general way, the remedies to be applied.  When they speak of subsidies, they have to understand the social and economic repercussions.  It is not enough to refer to the increased taxation on certain sections of the community, to swollen profits and the growth of bank deposits.  When we come to these remedies, we must be determined to deal with any opposition or any attempt to evade them, no matter from what quarter it may come.</P>
    <P>These are the three standpoints from which we must try to approach this matter.  I am content to leave it at that to-day because I think that the testing time will come a little later when we are faced with the problem of how to obtain this money and how to provide subsidies to ease the burden on the family.  I suggest to the Farmers' Party and other Parties, including our own Party, that it is no use, in the fourth year of the war, confining ourselves to criticism of the Government and to recognising what is quite apparent.  Their position may, in the immediate future, become even more difficult.  We have got to be able to put forward certain remedies of our own and to be prepared not only to take the responsibility on our own shoulders for those remedies but to take responsibility for forcing those remedies on the Government if they fail to do what is manifestly required in the present situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. L. Cosgrave Mr. L. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has ranged over a fairly wide field.  That is particularly so in connection with the question of the cost of living.  The last speaker, Deputy Larkin, referred to the fact that Deputy McGilligan and members of other Parties were now solicitous for the rights of the workers. Any Party or any Deputy who desires to serve the people responsible for its, or his, election should represent all sections.  This debate has continued for almost 24 hours and it has had one singular feature.  That is, that almost every Deputy who rose to speak on the Farmers' and Labour Benches advocated the interests of the particular <Col N="2360" /> section to which he belonged.  There is a real danger of sectionalism here&mdash;of one section of the community being pitted against another.  Farmer Deputies rose to speak for the farmers, almost to the exclusion of every other section.  Labour Deputies spoke for the interests of industrial labour, to the exclusion of practically every other interest. In this country, as in every other country, all sections are complementary. We could hardly do without one section for any length of time.  It is quite possible that, by process of elimination, we could come down to one or two sections which are of more importance or more use than others but, by and large, no section of the community should be exterminated or exploited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admit that the Labour Party and the Farmers' Party were not the first to believe in sectionalism.  I am inclined to think that Fianna Fáil, when in opposition, more or less blew the trumpet for a particular section or sections. Having become a Government, they are inclined to realise that other sections are also important.  In fact, there is a danger that Fianna Fáil are now inclined to take only the view of the section which has principally benefited by their administration &mdash; the industrialists. We have to realise that all sections are absolutely vital, that farmers and labour, whether agricultural or industrial, are complementary and vital to each other.  So far as the general good of this State is concerned, we should not try to exterminate any section or abuse any section &mdash; because that is what it amounts to.  There is no action, merely abuse. We have heard recently of threatened action by one section.  A short time ago there was threatened action by another section.  All these sections serve a need, collectively and individually. They also receive benefits from the State and it should be their duty and function to endeavour to serve the best interests of the State. We should realise that if we attempt to exterminate, or extract an undue penalty from, any section, we shall be really damaging the whole fabric of the nation.  With few exceptions, Deputies in this debate spoke on behalf <Col N="2361" /> of a particular section.  The farmers are looking for increased prices and for subsidies or bounties.  No mention whatever is made of the fact that, with small exceptions, our production here has remained virtually static.  In fact, last year, as against 1941-2, our total production was down by 7 per cent.  Live-stock production was down by 7.8 per cent. and crops and turf by 7.4 per cent.</P>
    <P>If we are to meet the present situation in any kind of constructive way, if we are to attempt with any degree of determination to solve our own difficulties independently, we should increase our production or, at any rate, prevent it from decreasing. In face of that reduction in production, the farmers want £3 per acre if they grow anything.  I should be in favour of giving £3 an acre if we could get value in return &mdash; if we could get production of wheat or other cereals comparable with the need or if we could get increased yields of milk.  What is the position?  We have a fairly substantial decline in production and we have no indication that this year the decline may not be even worse than it was last year even though we have an increased area compulsorily under tillage.</P>
    <P>Turning to Labour, Deputy Larkin said he had not much love for Fine Gael.  I welcome his frankness because I am sure he appreciates that we have no love for Labour.  Deputy Larkin said that the Government had not faced up to the situation.  The Labour Party had an opportunity of putting the Government out, but the Labour Party did not vote.  I think that the true state of affairs is that the Labour Party is the left wing of Fianna Fáil. Deputy Larkin mentioned that the Government got away with it under the cloak of the Leader.  Whatever the effect &mdash; in my opinion an evil effect &mdash; of the Fianna Fáil Leader's mantle, it is inclined to throw itself over the Labour Party as well.  The Labour Party goes down the country and says: &ldquo;We disagree with the Government and we disagree with this, that and the other,&rdquo; but, in actual fact, when it comes to taking action, they will always vote with the Government.</P>
    <P>The present situation, in my opinion, <Col N="2362" /> is one of which the Government should take stock.  Deputy McGilligan dealt fairly extensively yesterday with the cost of living, and other Deputies have reviewed the situation in that regard. Deputy Hughes to-day dealt with it in detail.  There is not much advantage to be derived from criticising the Government for what they did not do up to the present time, but I agree with Deputy Larkin in this respect, that the time has come when the Government should endeavour to ascertain accurately what the relative costs of particular commodities are.  Take flour, for instance.  Nobody can estimate, even on a rough calculation, the cost of the production of flour in this country at the present time.  I do not wish to exaggerate the profits of the millers or what they are getting out of it.</P>
    <P>I do not want to dwell at any length on the international situation. At the moment I think reticence on international affairs is of paramount importance to this country, not only reticence in speech but in thought.  I deprecate references to articles or speeches emanating from other countries on the situation here.  It may be very difficult to keep an open mind on the position, but I think that, in the long run, at any rate, until the situation develops a bit further, we should keep an open mind and refrain from making observations.  We have adopted a certain attitude and, beyond that, I think we should say no more but await the further development of events.  But, I should like to say that, in the event of a situation, which is quite likely to arise, the Government should endeavour to take stock of what may be required to deal with the situation, and not wait until it is upon us and until we may be overwhelmed by the evil effects of it.  If certain events should take place and if we are unable to carry on transport in the manner in which we are operating at the present time, we may be faced in this country with a shortage in the cities and towns, particularly in the larger cities.  In fact, in that event, we are certain to be faced with shortages of foodstuffs of one kind or another.  I <Col N="2363" /> am quite confident that we could meet the situation and would be able to bring supplies into the cities and towns, but the Government should take the necessary steps now to provide for a situation which may arise.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the necessity of investigating the costs of various articles.  The Government recently advised the building trade to take stock of their requirements and to co-operate in a scheme to meet the post-war position in regard to building. In my opinion that is a welcome and highly desirable step not alone in relation to the building trade, but in connection with other trades and other industries.  I think the Federation of Irish Manufacturers, if necessary by Government direction or order, but more desirably by voluntary action, should take stock and ascertain their minimum requirements of raw materials in order to carry on during the remainder of the emergency and post-war.  Certain industries have been operating here for the last 12 years.  Some of them, since the emergency, have fallen by the wayside.  In many respects it is probably useful that the emergency came upon us because we were bolstering up a number of &ldquo;cod&rdquo; industries.</P>

      <P>There were numerous industries that were bolstered up year after year.  I think we should aim at keeping in operation only those industries which are able to exist independently or at any rate under the operation of a moderate tariff.  Most of the industries that had to be kept going contributed to the cost-of-living increase.  Even at the present time &mdash; and Deputy McGilligan referred to it yesterday &mdash; there are certain industries here that have made <Col N="2364" /> fabulous profits since the emergency. I know that on paper they are able to show that the money was used in extending or modernising their premises, or that a certain portion was put to depreciation, but in actual fact some industries here paid dividends not only last year and the previous year but over a number of years.  That is not confined to transport industries.  I welcome every industry that is able to prosper and to do better one year after another but how many of these industries have contributed to increasing the cost of living?  How many of them, making profits under emergency conditions, have contributed to increasing the cost of necessary articles?  If the position is examined, I think it will be seen that certain industries, under the cloak of the emergency conditions, under the cloak of putting certain sums to reserve and to depreciation and under the various cloaks for avoiding a plain statement of profits, have contributed to increasing the cost of necessary articles and the cost of living.</P>
      <P>Last night, Deputy Corry referred to the situation in this country when farm labourers had less than they had to-day, but he conveniently omitted to refer to the prices that the farm labourer had at that time to pay for foodstuffs.  He said that the farmers here were allowed to produce bacon provided they produced it as cheaply as the Egyptians produce it, that the poultry producers could produce eggs provided they could compete with the Chinese.  Surely Deputy Corry does not want anyone to believe that, provided they produced at the same low price as the Egyptians or the Chinese, they were not satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position now is, and has been for a number of years, that we have practically no eggs; we have lost our export trade in eggs and the cost of eggs in the cities and towns is prohibitive. We cannot get bacon except at a prohibitive price.  What was the result when the bacon commission were carrying on their various activities to assist pig producers and to help in the distribution of bacon?  The pig population has dropped to a figure lower than what it was in 1850, the first occasion on which a census of <Col N="2365" /> population was taken.  We could not get American bacon at 4d. per lb. The farmers went out of production, although they were offered any price, and it was not merely because they had not the feeding stuffs.  They were going out of production before feeding stuffs ever became short.</P>

      <P>It is not nonsense; they were going out of production in 1940 and 1941, before the effects of this war were ever felt.  These are facts; the figures are there.  They were going out of production at that time under a Government that promised to assist pig production. What was the measure of assistance? They set up a committee that, by its activities, reduced the pig population.</P>

I do not want to say anything more on that aspect.  I would not even be satisfied with the 1928 or the 1929 position, though I will say that we have not been able to improve on it.  What did the League of Nations say with regard to the 1928-1929 position?  They said that, at a time when there was a world slump, with unparalleled results, with an unparalleled number of crises and collapses, of the few countries that weathered that situation the Twenty-Six Counties, or whatever we may like to call it, weathered it better than <Col N="2366" /> any other.

      <P>I did not want to refer to executions, because that would be wholly irrelevant in this debate, but as long as a State exists, and as long as people break the law or contribute to a chaotic state of affairs, you will have to have executions.  The Fianna Fáil Government, who deplore it, are equally vehement in that respect, and I suppose they were more vehement at the time that Deputy Donnellan was supporting them, but they had to do it. I regret executions, but the security and the integrity of the State and of the people must be preserved and, if it is necessary that a regrettable thing such as an execution should take place, then that must be; but the paramount consideration is all the people, not a section of the people, and not an individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Larkin referred to taxation. There is one peculiar feature about taxation and that is that the invisible <Col N="2367" /> taxation is probably greater than the visible.  That may be a shrewd thing from a political point of view, and it may have its uses, but in my opinion its effect on industry and agriculture, on the general trade and prosperity of the country, is bad.  For a number of years, but particularly since the outbreak of war, the trend has been, on the one hand, a rising of prices and wages and, on the other hand, an increase in the cost of necessary and unnecessary articles.  There is practically nothing that has not increased in price.  What the Government should endeavour to prevent is invisible taxation which is, in my opinion, contributed to in many respects by in-between, or what are commonly known as middlemen.  Increases of all kinds are contributed to by lack of determination to prevent certain sections of in-between or middlemen making profit to the detriment of the people as a whole.</P>
    <P>If we are to tackle the cost-of-living question, we must ensure that a satisfactory margin of profit is left to the producer&mdash;the farmer or the industrialist. Between the farmer and the industrialist, as producers, and the consumer, there are individuals who benefit and who make it almost impossible for the consumer to exist.  The result is that many consumers have to have their wages raised, but the point may be reached when there will be no possibility of granting any further increases. Merely granting increases to meet the situation, thus piling up a debt which will have to be met at some time, is wholly unsound.</P>
    <P>One is struck by the enormity of this Vote.  It is practically £1,000,000 a week, and that is a huge sum.  A couple of years ago we were £10,000,000 less. In the last couple of years we have increased by practically £10,000,000.  That certainly gives food for thought.  The cost of living, the cost of commodities, has increased so rapidly in the last couple of years that we require £10,000,000 more now than we did two years ago.</P>
    <P>There has been reference&mdash;timely reference&mdash;to the growth of the Civil Service.  I am inclined to think that <Col N="2368" /> the Civil Service has outgrown the requirements of this country.  From my contact with civil servants, I could not speak too highly of them and of the courtesy and assistance they give to any Deputy or other person who approaches them&mdash;and that goes for every Department.  If we continue adding to our administrative machine and if, on the other hand, we do not increase production, we will find ourselves with a bill greater than £50,000,000, with a Civil Service that has outgrown itself, with a declining production and with emigration proceeding at a faster rate.</P>
    <P>I do not want to detain the House much further.  I only wish to refer to one or two matters.  We are all, in this community, dependent, one on another, and I think that the Government, even at this stage, ought to realise that a wholesale reorganisation and re-orientation of our approach is necessary in order to meet the situation which may arise.  The Government should endeavour to relate their approach to conditions to the facts that exist, and to relate our present circumstances to the factual conditions that may obtain in the post-war period.  They should examine the whole position of agriculture with a view to seeing what can be done to put it upon a sounder basis than that upon which it is at the present.  It will take more than talk here to realise what can be done in the post-war period, and if we do not realise the salient defects that exist here, we will be in no position to deal with the difficulties that will confront us in the post-war period.</P>
    <P>In practically every country in the world, a great deal of what one might call stocktaking is taking place with regard to facing the post-war world.  I have no great faith in commissions, and so on, that may be set up to deal with such a situation.  I think that we should endeavour to approach, with open minds, the needs with which we may be faced, so that we can contribute in some way to the needs of both agriculture and industry in the post-war period.  Let us see what is desirable and what is necessary in order to meet the situation.  Let us see in what <Col N="2369" /> way we can develop properly, so as to reduce the cost of living, and I suggest that the best way to reduce the cost of living would be to have better production and increased foodstuffs.  On the other hand, we should relate our industries to agriculture in so far as it is possible to do so.</P>
    <P>I have got the impression that the Government are living in a perpetual hope that something will save them from a chaotic avalanche. I have gathered that they are tired, and I think it would be well if they searched amongst the members of their own Party for fresher minds.  I have not much faith in that Party, generally, but I think that they might be able to find amongst their own back benchers some fresher minds.  I am sure that it would be better than having the redundancy of incompetence that we have had on the Government Front Bench for the last few years.</P>
    <P>In closing, I should like to say that it is up to every Party and every Deputy in this House to realise that however the situation may develop it will require the most enlightened opinion and judgment that every Party in this House, and every Deputy, can bring to bear on the problems with which we shall be confronted, and I would again impress on the Government the desirability of giving us some further indication than we have had up to the present as to the business with which we are to be faced in the Dáil.  Deputy O'Higgins referred to that matter yesterday, and I think it would be a very good thing if we were to get a little further indication of the business with which we are likely to be faced when meeting here. Unfortunately, the information with regard to this huge sum, for which we are now asked to vote, only came into our hands on Saturday morning. Now, it takes a good deal of time to look up all the facts in connection with such a matter, and ordinary Deputies have not the same facilities as Ministers to look up the returns.  Accordingly, I would appreciate it if the Government would give us, at any rate, a week's notice because, usually, we do not know, from one day to another, what business will be transacted, <Col N="2370" /> and I think it would be well to give us more notice of the business that is to be taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to delay the House very long in speaking on this Vote, but in reading back on the reports of meetings of this House, one thing strikes me very much. Years ago, one read of Deputies, who now form members of the present Government, despising the Government of that day, condemning them for the huge expenditure, and saying that the country could not afford it. Now, however, we have, roughly, a sum of almost £50,000,000 presented to us, and the trouble is that if we look back over the last few years it will be found that the national income has not increased at all&mdash;certainly, not in comparison with the huge expenditure. Of course, there are other things to be considered.  There is not one of us in this House who could point a finger to any way in which that expenditure could or should be reduced. Take, for instance, social services. There is not one of us who believes that too much is being spent on those social services.  As a matter of fact, some of us think that still more should be spent on them.  Of course, the emergency also is responsible for a large amount of this demand, and the fact is that, at the moment, that cannot be helped.  Naturally, we are all anxious to spend what we can to ameliorate the conditions of our people.  Since I came into this House &mdash;and I know that this is true of other Parties also&mdash;we wanted to increase expenditure on such services.  I admit that I did so myself, but after all we must realise that a day of reckoning comes, and I say that the time to protest against expenditure is when the bills are being presented to this House.  There is no use in voicing protests to-day against that expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, I am afraid that the trouble here for the past ten years has been that the various Parties in this House, although they were anxious to spend, did not give sufficient attention to where the money was to come from, or to the real asset that existed in <Col N="2371" /> this country, which is the land and the workers on the land, because it is they, and they alone, who produce any new money in this country.  Now, however, there is no doubt that something must be done, and, in my opinion, the only way to solve that problem is to increase the wealth from the land and to help the people who are producing from the land.  After all, you must realise that many other sections of the community could sit down for the next three months or so&mdash;let us say, the Judiciary, or other sections of the community&mdash;and still the work of the country would continue; but if the workers and producers, the sweaters of the nation, were to sit down for three months we would be faced with starvation.  Yet the workers on the land and the producers &mdash; the &ldquo;sweaters&rdquo;, as I have called them&mdash; are the worst paid of all sections in this community.  I think that these are the people who should be paid the most, or that at least they should be paid something better than the wages they are being paid at the moment, because, with the wages they receive to-day and the conditions under which they work, it amounts to slave labour. I agree, of course, that this is not the time for debating the subject to which Deputy Liam Cosgrave referred a moment ago.  He talked about &ldquo;cod&rdquo; industries, and so on.  Well, of course, Governments, just the same as ordinary people, do the best thing that they can.  Sometimes, their efforts do not turn out to be as good as they expected, but sometimes they do turn out to be fairly good.  Some of our industries were successful and a great advantage to this country.  With regard to those of them which were not successful, it can be said that it was a matter of trial and perhaps the people who started them were not to be blamed for the fact that they were not successful.</P>
    <P>At present, this country, as we read in the newspapers, is passing through a period of anxiety, a period of anxiety for the Government and the people.  We do not know what situation may arise, but there is one thing sure: we can overcome any situation which will <Col N="2372" /> arise.  We have a long, varied and bitter experience to guide us in time of crisis.  The one common basis for all that was national unity, and I believe that we have got that unity to-day as solid as ever we had it in our lifetime.  If we use that unity properly, I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that our country can overcome any crisis that may be brought upon it.  I want to bring home to the Government this fact, that there are certain resources in this country which should be pooled at present to help in every way the people who produce from the land.</P>
    <P>Our urgent need at the moment is food.  We have to get it, and we can get it from the land.  Even though taunts may be thrown across the House about what is called the new Farmers' Party&mdash;I regret that you, Sir, were not here when the last speaker was speaking; you would not look at me for referring to it if you had been &mdash;I can say, speaking for the farmers of this country, that there is now more than ever cast upon us the necessity to produce the food for this nation. I want to tell the House that we fully realise it, and it is my opinion that we will not fail in that effort.  Let us send from this House a message of hope to the farmers and the workers on the land, to the people who produce the food; let us tell them that we will have no cheeseparing or hairsplitting about it; let us tell these people, the backbone of this nation, that on them and on them alone this nation depends.  Speaking as I do on their behalf, I have no doubt that they will rise to the occasion.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that with the unity amongst our people at the moment, we shall well get over this crisis.  There is yet time&mdash;it is not yet too late&mdash;to do all the work which is needed, but I again appeal to the Government, to the food producers, to the people who are the backbone of the nation to get away from this cheeseparing and this hair-splitting and to get down to it. I appeal to the Government to pay these producers as people in the front line.  They were often in the front line before and they came out victoriously. <Col N="2373" /> I have no doubt that they will come out with victory again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I echo Deputy Donnellan's hope that the splendid unity of our people will bring us safely through the crisis through which the country is passing at the moment.  The Deputy has given his benediction to this huge bill for Supply Services which we shall soon be asked to meet, although I thought it was one of the primary objects of the Farmers' Party to bring down taxation.  I am rather surprised by Deputy Donnellan's attitude, because I thought when he got up to speak that he would be more critical of the Estimates which have been circulated in the last few days.</P>
      <P>Deputy Larkin, in the course of his speech, beseeched Deputies to approach the discussion of this Vote in a realistic fashion, and I agree that if we are to get anywhere in our discussions we should at least try to be realistic and constructive.  He made one suggestion with regard to the cost of living which I thought very sensible and sound.  He suggested that, before price Orders are issued, the Minister for Supplies should get in touch with the people primarily concerned in the production of the commodity for which prices are about to be fixed.  That should be a <i>sine qua non</i> of any price-fixing Order, that the people engaged in the production of the commodity&mdash; not only the people in control but the people engaged in the process of manufacture&mdash;should be consulted before a price Order is issued, because the feeling prevails very generally in the country that when these matters are left to civil servants, invariably too big a margin is allowed to the manufacturer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a common subject of complaint amongst all sections, and it is necessary, as a matter of fact, to put this whole matter of price-fixing on a more scientific basis.  There is a terrible disparity between the prices of the different commodities as revealed by the figures published in the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i>, and it is difficult for the ordinary person to understand why there should be such a disparity. Even in the case of goods produced under approximately similar conditions, <Col N="2374" /> prices will be found to vary considerably, and I suggest to the Minister that some steps should be taken in order to regularise the whole situation and to put this question of price-fixing on some more orthodox and scientific basis.</P>
    <P>In discussing the question of the cost of living, one could range over a big number of subjects, but I intend to confine myself to just two, one of which was mentioned by Deputy Davin, that is, the high price of fuel especially in the cities and towns and non-turf areas.  It seems inexplicable to me why fuel should cost such a very high price in view of the low cost of production in the turf-producing areas. The costs are relatively very low, but I understand that the chief reason for the high cost which consumers have to pay is the transport, the loading and unloading charges.  Why these should be so high I cannot understand. I suggest to the Minister that the question should be re-examined, and that, to assist him in that re-examination, he should bring in some competent business man with experience of organisation, who would probably be able to devise a scheme of turf production, under which it would be possible for the Government to sell it at a lower price than now prevails.  Some weeks ago, when the matter was being discussed in the Dáil, I suggested that it should be possible for those in charge of the collection of fuel supplies in Dublin to organise private producers in different parts of the country, as in that way I imagine turf would be got much cheaper than it is got from county councils.  In any event the present cost of turf is exorbitant as it is one of the big items in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>The next question is the impact of taxation on the living standards of our people.  Taxation affects every section of the community, and it is difficult to justify, certainly on any rigidly economic ground, an expenditure of £45,000,000 on Supply Services. In 1931 these services cost £21,000,000 but the figures have now jumped to £45,000,000.  Even allowing for the emergency, and the expenditure that it entailed, it is difficult to understand <Col N="2375" /> why there should be such a huge increase in the cost of Supply Services I frankly admit that social services are costing a good deal of money.  It is another question whether they warrant the amount of money being spent on them.  Personally I consider there is a great deal of money wasted on social services.  Notwithstanding all the money we spend in that way we do not seem to achieve any results.  For instance, the money spent on preventive diseases seems, to a large extent, to be wasted.  I do not know the reason for that.  I feel that we have failed to get rid of the cause of disease, and that until we do so the money spent is to a large extent wasted.  England is waging a war on an income-tax of 10/- in the £.  Here people have to pay income-tax at the rate of 7/- in the £.  Taking income-tax and surtax, it means that business men are working 50 per cent. of their time for the service of the State.  A professional man who has not to pay surtax is contributing roughly 40 per cent. of his time in the service of the State.  Not merely is national expenditure increasing at an abnormal rate, but local expenditure is keeping pace with it.  The impact of these two demands on the cost of living is undoubtedly very serious.</P>
    <P>I realise that in the emergency we are obliged to provide additional services regardless of cost, and that invariably we forget all about the ordinary laws of economy.  We get careless and go on spending and spending without trying to retain any grip on it.  That is what is happening here.  We are spending regardless of our resources.  We are not trying seriously to relate expenditure to income. From figures published in the <i>Trade Journal,</i> and in other official publications, it has been revealed that our income is going down.  It must be going down when production is going down.  Notwithstanding that fact our expenditure is mounting steadily.  If that continues for the next few years and if we have to face a Budget of £60,000,000 or £65,000,000, what position will we find ourselves in at the end of the war?  If the war <Col N="2376" /> terminated next year we would be faced with a system of government involving an expenditure of £50,000,000 yearly.  Following the cessation of hostilities there may be a slump in prices.  It might happen that there would be a boom for a few years, but following that there would be depression and falling prices.  How the Minister is going to maintain the expensive machinery of government on the reduced earning capacity of our people is a problem for some finance wizard to solve.</P>
    <P>Local bodies and other statutory bodies have been asked to submit schemes for post-war expenditure. Some of these schemes are very costly. I do not know what the total cost is, but I am certain that it will run into millions of pounds.  I realise that we will be confronted with a very serious problem when the war is over as large numbers of our people will have to be provided for.  We must try to provide for them to the best of our ability by finding employment for them.  Has the Minister seriously considered the high cost of government, or where he is to find the money required to provide employment in the big post-war schemes that are envisaged?  In his speech Deputy Larkin suggested that the banks should be obliged&mdash;I suppose he meant forced&mdash;to lend money to the Government at 1 per cent. interest. The Deputy mentioned £20,000,000 or £30,000,000.  Even if the banks lent the money somebody would have to pay it back.  If we are to raise money for post-war development, and also maintain the expensive machinery of government, it means that we will have to mortgage the future.  I assume that we will have to pass on the expenditure to future generations.  Perhaps that is the Minister's view of the situation.  Some of the money may be found by loan, but I doubt if he will raise a loan to cover the cost of the post-war schemes he has in mind. When the war is over we will not be richer.  The possibility is that we will be very much poorer.  In the altered circumstances how will we meet the bill?  That is a problem for some very able Finance Minister.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin also referred to the <Col N="2377" /> question of agricultural production, and discountenanced the idea of a subsidy for agricultural production.  Deputy Cogan made a case for a tillage subsidy some time ago, but it was not acceptable to the Dáil.  Personally I did not agree with the case made by Deputy Cogan or by the members of the Farmers' Party who supported him.  However, there may be a case for a subsidy for agriculture for the purpose of supplying our internal needs.  I do not think there is any necessity for a subsidy for agricultural exports.  I made a case in the Dáil that in the post-war period the best contribution the Government could make to farmers' difficulties would be to remove all restrictions on imports of the raw materials they require.  If all restrictions on raw materials of the farmers' industry are removed, then there is no justification whatever for subsidising exports.  The subsidisation of exports would merely mean putting extra taxation on consumers.  I do not think that would be justified. There is no doubt whatever that if we want to bring the country back to a sound and stable position, we will have to set about increasing production in many different directions.  As is disclosed by the official figures production has fallen.  If we want to get back to a stable position, agricultural production will have to be increased.</P>
    <P>The Government will have to take suitable steps to see that the production of various commodities now in short supply is brought to the high standard at which they were some years ago.  There will be a widespread demand for all sorts of agricultural production when the war is over.  We can exploit that demand to our advantage but, in order to do so, we must set about increasing agricultural production. Not merely must we increase the stocks of cattle: we must also increase the stocks of pigs, poultry, butter and other produce.  If the Government is fully conscious of its responsibilities, it should set about the investigation of the problem of increasing agricultural production right away.  Now is the time to make a beginning, so that we may be prepared to take advantage of whatever favourable <Col N="2378" /> situation may arise when the war is over.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I wish to call the attention of the House, although it is somewhat out side the scope of the four matters with which the Parties agreed to deal.  It is in regard to the action of some of the inspectors of the Department of Supplies, who have been sent out to the country to exercise vigilance over the fortunate&mdash;or unfortunate&mdash;shopkeepers. About five weeks ago, a report was published in the daily papers&mdash;in the <i>Irish Independent</i>, I think&mdash;of a shopkeeper in Omeath who was anxious to find out the occupation or professional life of one inspector. The inspector hedged for a good while and finally said he was on the staff of the National Bank in some Northern town.  It so happened that the shopkeeper knew there was no branch of the National Bank in that town and knew, as a consequence, that the inspector's statement was not accurate. Are inspectors of the Department of Supplies obliged to answer truthfully, when they are asked directly by a shopkeeper, if they are so and so, or are they specially instructed by the Minister or by the higher officials of the Department not to divulge their positions under any circumstances?</P>

      <P>I realise the difficulties under which the inspectors carry out their duties, but this is rather an unusual type of case.  It appears to me that it places a Government official in a very false light, when he has to act in the same way as this unfortunate inspector, who was caught out by the shopkeeper in Omeath.  These inspectors should be told to exercise more discretion when they are visiting shopkeepers.  After all, they should have some regard to the Civil Service tradition, which still holds good in this country, I hope, as it does in most other countries in the world.</P>

      <P>The manner in which this Vote on Account has been <Col N="2379" /> debated here by Deputies of all Parties who have already spoken, is a pleasant surprise to me and I am sure it must be a pleasant surprise to the Minister, who is asking the country to foot a very big bill.  The pleasant feature is that there has not yet been a statement from any Party in the House, and particularly from those who claim to represent the farming community or the labour community, to the effect that the bill is an exorbitant one which the country is not able to meet. I think that is a declaration from every section of the House that the country is in an extremely sound financial position.  It must be so, when those representing different sections here have not said that the country cannot meet this bill or is unable to bear it.  In previous years, it has been alleged on Votes on Account that the country is overtaxed and that it is being driven on the rocks of bankruptcy. We are now asked to meet a much bigger bill than heretofore and no such allegation is made by any Deputy.  Therefore, it must be recognised that our State is in a very strong financial position.</P>
      <P>I have been particularly impressed by the attitude adopted by Deputies elected specifically to represent the farming community&mdash;the members of Clann na Talmhan or the Farmers' Party.  Prior to this, they claimed that the country was very highly overtaxed; but now they have the wisdom to accept the facts and make no such claim here.  Neither is there a demand from that Party for any reduction whatever in the amount of taxation that it is necessary to impose in the coming year to extract practically £50,000,000 out of the people's pockets to finance the State.  On the contrary, we had even to-day demand from the Leader of that Party for more spending. That is a healthy sign, and shows they have improved their outlook in the last six months and have recognised that the present Minister for Finance is a capable and competent Minister in charge of the financial destinies of this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Previous speakers have mentioned the proposal some time ago for a tillage subsidy as part of Government <Col N="2380" /> policy.  If the proposal made by certain members of the Farmers' Party&mdash; not all of them&mdash;were adopted, the present Minister for Finance would be asking for £57,500,000 this year, instead of £50,000,000&mdash;as a further £7,500,000 would be required to finance the proposed subsidy on tillage.  At that time, I must say that&mdash;because of the speeches made by two members of the Party which made the proposal&mdash; I misunderstood the proposal; but I understand to-day, having listened to one of those who voted for it at that time, that the proposal was an attempt to reduce the cost of living.  Deputy Esmonde, who voted for the proposal, said that was his reason for supporting such a proposal.  Representing the farmers of Mayo, I would strongly oppose an attempt to reduce the cost of living by imposing a tillage subsidy, instead of tackling that question in other ways.  If you attempt to reduce the cost of living by giving a tillage subsidy, no matter what the figure may be&mdash;oven £3 per acre&mdash;you must clamp down on the producers on the land rigid price control&mdash;very rigid price control.</P>
    <P>I am not prepared to go to the farmers of Mayo and tell them that the price of their produce is to be rigidly controlled either now or in the future in order to reduce the cost of living and that they are to be compensated by a subsidy on tillage because, in the West of Ireland particularly, tillage has always been the policy of the farmers. They have to till in order to live.  I would not like to see the Government induced, at this stage or in the immediate future, to change their policy as regards tillage and to give direct subsidies for tillage of all classes and kinds in all counties.  It has, I think, been brought home to the people more than ever before since this emergency arose that the economic unit in this country is the small holding.  The real sturdy economic unit will bear the brunt of any crisis and, if it will not bring the owner and his family unscathed through the crisis, at least it will bring them through the crisis better than any other section of the community if the land is properly husbanded and industrial <Col N="2381" /> work in the cities, the distribution of goods, the control of prices, and rationing are properly carried out.</P>
    <P>It is now well recognised by all sections that mixed farming, during the period of the crisis particularly, is the safest proposal.  Where the farmer on the small economic holding produces for his requirements to the full extent of his capacity, he at least will weather the storm.  He may not make money, but he will weather the storm better than those people with wide acres of ranch land who are faced with labour difficulties, difficulties of getting machinery and fertilisers and other difficulties.  I hope the Government will recognise the value of the small economic holding and pay more attention in the coming year to seeing that the post-war policy, if not the immediate policy, will be directed towards providing more economic small holdings.  It may not be good economics at the moment, because of the fluctuation in land values and prices, to take over and divide land at the present market price.  But the immediate post-war policy of any Government should be directed towards placing the maximum number of economic landholders on the land.  In the west we have still many vacant semi-derelict farms, the owners of which have left the country and will never come back, and the fertility of which is being reduced by neglect.  In the post-war period the policy of the Government should be to place the maximum number of economic holders on such lands.</P>
    <P>I was amazed to find at this stage adverse criticism directed towards the Department of Supplies.  It may be that the Department of Supplies has too many officials for the work done. But the House should recognise that, if there is any Department in the State with which the public has refused to co-operate, it is the much-abused Department of Supplies.  Time and again I have heard certain Deputies attack and abuse the Minister for Supplies, both in this House and in the country, because he has not succeeded in preventing black marketing and disgraceful charges being imposed on people for commodities that are scarce <Col N="2382" /> in the market.  What have the public, or even complaining Deputies, done to place before the Minister the necessary facts to enable that problem to be tackled?  There are certain cases, I think, in the City of Dublin where the Department of Supplies may have been lax.</P>
    <P>My knowledge of their operations is confined to two or three counties.  I know that when certain public-spirited individuals reported glaring cases of overcharging and were asked to do so by people who were imposed upon, when the Minister and inspectors came to these people to try to have justice done them, they refused to budge or they told the other story and allowed the people who were robbing them to go scot free.  But, where the Department of Supplies did get the necessary information and where some individuals came forward to support the information, the people were brought to book and penalties were imposed which shocked Deputies on all the benches in this House.  I am glad to say that the Department's activities, which have not been supported by the public except so far as complaining is concerned, have succeeded in giving a fair measure of justice to the public with regard to the rationing of commodities. Rationing has righted itself. It was very difficult in the early stages when it was new, but for the last year or so, as the system has developed, rationing has worked fairly well where commodities are available.</P>
    <P>In that regard, attempts have been made at times to cast general reflections on the business community.  The number of business people who have been guilty of overcharging and trying to &ldquo;diddle&rdquo; the public is very limited. Speaking generally, the business community have met the public fairly and decently.  The number of black sheep amongst them is limited.  I think the public realise that, and it is time that general recognition should be given to that fact, because certain Deputies and certain sections are trying to cast general reflections on the business community.  The task that business men have to perform nowadays, with the hundred and one things they have to do with regard to returns, rations. <Col N="2383" /> reports, requests and licences is immense, and it is a big tax on the capacity of men who are not practised in working out such matters.</P>
    <P>The Government have been attacked for fixing wages.  I think it will be admitted that, if something were not done in that regard, more virulent attacks would be made on the Government. It has not worked out fairly. There is no good in saying it has.  It is impossible, I think, to work it out fairly but I should like to impress upon the Government that it may be possible that they have not gone sufficiently thoroughly into the question of wages. There are many people who have not got any bonuses.  For instance, there are public officials who retired prior to the emergency.  Their pensions were fixed prior to the emergency on the basis of the then cost of living.  Again, lower-paid servants of the State who had arranged for a big future in education for their families have not been fairly dealt with in discussions as to whether certain increases should be given in bonuses.</P>
    <P>We must realise, however, that all sections of the community are suffering. There may be an occasional professional man or an occasional business man who is living more comfortably than before the war, but they are the exceptions.  People generally are suffering considerably.  The small salaried man living in a town has to buy everything in the way of farm produce at black market prices on his pre-war salary.  He is in a bad way. Again, many small business people in towns whose quotas are limited cannot get bonuses from anybody.  How they live at present is a mystery to me.  I know that the Government cannot do very much to relieve the sufferings of sections of that kind, but it should be generally recognised that these hardships do exist and Government policy in imposing taxation should be directed towards giving these people the full advantage of any remissions that may be found possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate Deputy O Cléirigh on the <Col N="2384" /> viewpoint he has expressed in connection with the Standstill Order on wages.  I wonder is the Minister aware that there are several sections of workers who have got no bonus at all?  It will be admitted that the cost of living has increased as much for these people as for everybody else. Take the section to which I belong myself&mdash;insurance workers.  They have received not one penny of an increase; their salaries are identical with those they received in 1939.  If one of these men has to buy a pair of boots for his child he finds that a pair of boots which cost 7/- in 1939 now costs 20/- or 21/-.  The suit of clothes that cost only £4 in 1939 now costs £10, and then it is a very inferior article.  As regards the price of fresh meat, I say without hesitation that there is no justification for the prices charged for fresh meat in this country at present.  Meat which was sold for less than 1/- per lb. pre-war now costs 2/- per lb.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there is something very much wrong with the manner in which the price of meat is regulated.  Everybody will have to admit that the price of cattle is not double what it was in 1939, yet the price of fresh meat has practically doubled.  If the increase in price were going directly to the farmer I would not make any bones about it.  I should like to see the farmers getting good prices because otherwise they will not be in a position to pay their workers decent wages.  I agree 100 per cent., therefore, that the farmers should get the highest possible price for the produce but when you have fat cattle sold in the Dublin market to-day, and all during the winter, at an average price of 60/- per cwt., while the workers of the city have to pay as high as 2/- per lb. for certain cuts of the meat, I say that there is someone in the community getting an unjust profit.  Making all allowances for wastage I think that it is criminal that the average price of beef is nearly 2/- per lb.  For some portions I believe the price is as high as 3/-, though the farmer who has to feed his cattle and put the stuff on the market is not paid sufficiently at all. As I say, I would be quite pleased to see the workers paying 2/- or 3/- per <Col N="2385" /> lb. if they were able to do it and if the profit went to the man who produces the meat and not to the middlemen.</P>
    <P>The present is not a time, having regard to recent events, in which we can speak as freely as we otherwise would but I do say that the Irish people should get together and stand behind the Government on the national question.  Similarly, I think that there is a duty imposed on all of us to stand together in the effort to protect the nation economically.  If this nation is to survive at all, we must get together on the economic question and try to devise some means to enable our people successfully to surmount the economic crisis.  Everybody should know that our people cannot exist on the miserable doles that are being paid out at the moment.  Why should the people receiving these miserable doles not be put to work at a living wage on some form of productive employment, if it were only to go out digging with the spade?  After all, our ancestors, had no implements but spades and they tilled many thousands of acres of land successfully.  They tilled with spades in days gone by and maintained a much larger population than there is in the country to-day.  I do not think any able-bodied man should have to exist on a dole at the present time because if we are to continue along these lines the country will undoubtedly go bankrupt.  Who is going to pay these doles?  Our only source of wealth is the land and the bog; the land is the only real wealth we have. We may not understand the mentality of people who come from agricultural districts, looking for work, to the city where there are people already unemployed but why do they leave these agricultural districts?  Because the wages they are offered are insufficient to keep body and soul together.  Those dependent on them are starving and you cannot blame these people for trying to get away to benefit themselves.</P>
    <P>The whole economic system in this country is altogether wrong and the sooner we realise that the better.  We have 12,000,000 acres of arable land and thousands of acres of bog and yet there is a scarcity of farm produce. Last year people were forced to queue up for potatoes, while the system <Col N="2386" /> under which turf is distributed is worse than queueing.  Still we have thousands of able-bodied men drawing the dole.  I am not saying that those who are genuinely unemployed should not receive the dole, miserable as it is, but I do say that there is no justification for unemployment in this country at the present time.  Every individual in the community must take his or her share of the responsibility of tiding the nation over the present crisis.  I am afraid that our people have become greatly demoralised in the last 12 years since the payment of doles became so widespread.  While people complain that they have to queue up for potatoes, you will find that many of them are not too anxious to till a plot to grow potatoes.  I repeat that I am afraid that we have become greatly demoralised in recent years and that we do not possess the same spirit our ancestors had.  I do believe that, if we are to succeed, we shall have to get back to the old mentality. There should be no complaint as regards the cost of social services. If you have social services, you must pay for them.  I think that the greatest measure ever introduced by any Government here was that dealing with family allowances.  There is a duty on whatever Government is in power to help those least able to help themselves&mdash;the aged, the blind, the widow and the large family.  I congratulate the Minister on the introduction of the scheme of family allowances. I am voicing only my own opinion when I say that I would be in favour of a means test.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say then that I am glad to be associated with a Vote which includes an Estimate for family allowances?  As regards subsidies for the farmers, something will have to be done.  I am not a believer in subsidies; I believe more in prices.  But I should like the prices to be such that the people would be able to pay them. I am in favour of some sort of guaranteed price to the farmer over a period.  Everybody here will admit that something must be done for the <Col N="2387" /> farmers if they are to be put in a position in which they will be able to pay their employees a living wage.  Why should the farm labourer and the farmer, who are the backbone of the nation, because they work in the dirt, be treated as dirt?  Without them, the nation will not survive.  With all due respect to civil servants, why should any civil servant have £10 a week for a great part of his life, with payment during sickness and a guarantee of a pension towards the end of his days, while he eats food produced under slave conditions?  The ordinary farm labourer who produces the food on which that man exists is paid only for the day he works.  When sick, he has no allowance, because I do not think that the 15/- per week paid by the National Health Insurance Society could in these times be described as an allowance.  He has no guarantee in any shape or form.  Neither has the small farmer nor the industrious farmer, whether small or big, who tills his land.  They may go out some morning to find a cow dead.  They can only hope for good weather for their crops. Perhaps, when their corn is ripe, the thresher does not come along the day he is wanted and the corn gets heated and useless.  Every day in the year the farmer is subject to losses.  That is why he cannot, of his own, give the farm labourer that to which he is entitled. We have those other classes guaranteed big salaries.  They have a month's holidays, big pay and they work only a few hours.  Let there be no misunderstanding.  I am in favour of good wages and reasonable conditions of service but I have always held that the division between the civil servant and the farm labourer is too great in a little country like this.  We could do without the civil servants even if all of them went on holidays for a few months.  But if the farmer or farm labourer took a holiday for the next few months, I wonder where we would be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the question of milk, there is something wrong.  Not alone is it wrong now but it has been wrong for years.  Although this country is an agricultural country and we have been sending out thousands of pounds of <Col N="2388" /> butter, there are children in it who never had a drink of milk.  I am prepared to give credit where credit is due and I congratulate the Government on their free milk scheme.  That is a step in the right direction.  But what about the worker who is not in receipt of any of these allowances&mdash;the man who has a small wage and a large family?  The price of milk puts it out of his reach, with the result that thousands of the children of these people never drank a pint of milk in their lives.  Their mothers could not afford to buy it.  Some people criticise the farmers for looking for 1/- a gallon for milk.  With cósts as they are, I think that they are entitled to 1/- a gallon.  To produce it even at that price, they must work very economically. But milk is not supplied at 1/- a gallon to the poor of this city.  The price is very much higher and I doubt that the cost of carriage would account for the difference.  The milk yield is also declining and that is no wonder, seeing that every day we are allowing the pick of our cows to leave the country.  It is only the good type of cow that is bought for export.  We are allowing them to go out at the North Wall while our children are without milk.  Dairymen and others interested in milk production must rear three cows to give the supply of milk which two good cows would give.  I think that the Government should tackle that question of the difference in the price which farmers are receiving for milk and the price which the poor and the workers of this city have to pay for it.</P>
    <P>On the question of clothing, everybody will admit that there must be something terribly wrong, considering that the wool producers got no increase until last year.  I do not know that many members are aware of the price charge for ordinary woollen thread. The same thing applies to clothing.  I should like to know how the difference is accounted for.  There is only a difference of about 3/- a week in the wages of those who work on the manufacture of clothing and those who work in factories, and yet, as I have said, the price of the average suit for a working man has increased from about £4 to £12.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether he will have further consideration given to the possibility of reducing the present maximum prices for the more essential articles of clothing as fixed by Emergency Powers (Cloth and Clothing) (Maximum Prices) Order, 1943.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Emergency Powers (Cloth and Clothing, (Maximum Prices) Order, 1943, was framed, regard was had to the necessity of having prices of essential articles of clothing for the poorer sections of the community as low as possible and reduced wholesale and retail margins on certain essential articles within a given price range were provided for in that Order.  In the Amending Order which came into force on the 22nd October, 1943, the price ranges on which reduced traders' margins were operative were increased.</P>
      <P>The question of the price of clothing generally is receiving constant attention in my Department and every effort is being made to keep prices of essential articles of clothing at a reasonable level.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that published reports of the companies in the trade appeared recently, and that the earnings of the <Col N="2392" /> companies were summarised in the daily Press?  In the light of these reports, would he not consider it essential to make a further reduction in the price of the more essential articles of clothing, especially in view of the fact that there is still a profit margin of from 53 per cent. to 70 per cent. allowed on manufacturers' prices?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy misunderstands the margin allowed.  I would point out, however, that the reports of the operations of the companies now being published relate to a period of time in which price control was not in operation, and that most of those companies, if not all of them, engage in many other forms of trade besides the sale of clothing which is subject to price control regulations.  The maximum margin allowed on retail sale for any article covered by the regulations is 50 per cent. and I think that, in relation to most of the cheaper classes of articles, the maximum margin allowed is 33? per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether, in view of the possibility, already indicated by him, of having to reduce the tea ration during the summer months, he will consider as an alternative drastically reducing supplies of tea to hotels, restaurants, cafés, and other public catering concerns, in order to make possible the maintenance of the tea ration to individual consumers at the present level.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Tea supplies for catering establishments have been reduced by reference to normal consumption in approximately the same proportion as the ration for householders has been reduced.  The total quantity now being made available for catering would not be sufficient, even if it were entirely withdrawn, to make possible the maintenance of the present <Col N="2393" /> household ration and in view of this, and having regard to the effect on employment in catering trades, I consider the course suggested in the Deputy's question not desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister draw the attention of his officials to the fact that when the regulations in regard to tea first came into operation, in the case of public restaurants and caterers of that type the allowance was based on their consumption at a certain period in 1941?  How is it that people who were not in the restaurant business at that time are now able to get supplies of tea&mdash;people, some of whom left their own country for their country's good?  How are they able to get large supplies based on consumption previous to their advent to this country?  How does the gentleman who runs that official hotel in Talbot Street get supplies in view of the fact that he was not in the country at the time that the regulations were made?  I have already drawn the Minister's attention to a place in O'Connell Street that has been in business for only a year and a half that is now getting large supplies of tea and sugar.  It never sold tea&mdash;it was an ice-cream bar.</P>

      <P>There was no prohibition on the export of wine until the 15th November, 1941.  Between that date and the 10th January, 1942, licences for the export of relatively small quantities of imported wine were granted to 27 firms whose names I am not prepared to disclose.  Since the 11th January, 1942, all applications for the export of wine have been refused except in a few cases where licences for the export of quantities of altar wine have been granted.  The applications have been refused so as to conserve stocks for the present and future needs of the home trade.</P>

Licences for the export of &ldquo;Prune Wine&rdquo; to Northern Ireland and Great Britain have been, and are being, granted to the manufacturers only.  This commodity has been produced mainly for export for a very substantial number of years and it is in accordance with the general policy to facilitate the continuance of any such export trade.

      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is in the negative.  The Shops (Conditions of Employment) Act, 1938, makes provision for the establishment of a shops wages board with power to fix minimum wages in any case in which a member of the staff of a shop claims that his wages are unduly low.  Owing to existing circumstances this provision has not been put into operation.  No new legislative provision is necessary, however, and consideration will be given to the operation of the section if there is any evidence of substantial demand for it.</P>

      <P>The amount of juvenile crime has doubled since 1939, but I am glad to be able to say that there was no increase during the year 1943 as compared with the year 1942.  The number of juveniles charged with indictable offences in the years 1939, 1942 and 1943 were 1,605, 3,350 and 3,345, respectively. The returns of crimes by adults show a similar trend.  It seems reasonable to believe that circumstances arising from the emergency are the main cause of the increase in crime and that, with the return of normal conditions, both juvenile and adult crime will decrease.</P>

      <Col N="2405" /> In regard to the appointment of probation officers, I would refer the Deputy to the reply to a similar question asked by Deputy Connolly on the 4th of November last.  I should like to repeat, however, that I am doubtful about the policy of appointing full-time probation officers outside the Dublin Metropolitan Area.  The conditions in Dublin are unique: nearly one-third of all the juvenile indictable offences arise in the Dublin area, and there is a justice who is engaged whole-time in looking after this class of offender.  I doubt whether there would be sufficient work for a full-time probation officer in any other area.  In my opinion, the best solution of the problem outside Dublin would be, that voluntary organisations which are interested in the welfare of juveniles should undertake the supervision of juvenile probationers.  Section 7 of the Criminal Justice Administration Act, 1914, provides for the recognition of such organisations and provides that recognised organisations may receive financial assistance from the State towards their expenses.  I feel that it is very desirable that there should be local interest and initiative in this kind of work.</P>
    <P>In Cork City the local Council of the St. Vincent de Paul Society was declared a recognised society in April last.  It is doing very good work and I should like to see similar schemes adopted in other areas.</P>

      <P>Everybody will agree that the Minister and the Government are deeply concerned about juvenile delinquency, but in face of the facts that confront us every night and day, even in the immediate vicinity of this House, does the Minister not think that somebody should be there to advise these boys and girls around the cinema queues to get off the streets? They go away from home and neither their parents nor anyone else know anything about what they are doing. They are singing in front of the cinema queues appealing to the charity of the public, and are building up a semi-criminal class.  I think the Minister should consider the possibility of appointing a few men and women to look after them.  These voluntary <Col N="2406" /> organisations cannot do the work themselves.</P>

      <P>There is a certain number of probation officers in Dublin, and with the help of His Grace the Archbishop about two years ago, one of these societies, the Legion of Mary, has been able to do very good work and is continuing to do it.  The reason I gave such a lengthy reply is that I do not want people to be unduly alarmed about the situation.  There has been no increase since last year.  I quite admit that it is still very bad, but I do not want people to run away with the idea that it is still increasing, and I hope as a result of the efforts now being made that there will be a decrease.</P>

      <P>All I have to say in conclusion is that, on the question of milk, there is something wrong which surely could be remedied by understanding between both Parties, whether it be by subsidy or otherwise.  I hope that the Government will take notice of that and that the price of milk will be brought within reach of the workers. On the question of the cost of living generally, I am sure that the Minister and every other member of this House, will agree with me when I say that commodities like clothing and boots are at present outside the reach of the ordinary worker.  The organised industrial worker was regarded as fairly well treated, but to-day, out of the wages that comes into his home, he is not able to get the price of a suit of clothes or a pair of boots.  I do not see where the money will come from for these commodities because his wages are only barely sufficient to buy very plain food. The price of a pair of boots for a child has gone from 5/11 to 21/-.  I would be quite pleased, and I am sure all workers would be pleased, to pay 21/- if we were convinced that those engaged in the production of the boots got a proportionate increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the produce of farms in County Dublin.  I am sure that many Deputies are aware that a load of cabbage sent to the market is sold very often for as little as 12/-, but I am sure that the ordinary purchaser will not get it at a proportionate price.  The price usually charged on the retail market puts things like cabbage <Col N="2411" /> beyond the reach of the people.  Owing to the low price which the farmer gets for his crop, it is not worth his while to buy feeding for his horse or to pay a man to take it to the market.  We know that some people are making huge profits while they are employing their staffs under very bad conditions. I have one practical suggestion to remedy the position which is being criticised by the Deputies who have been talking about increased taxation. If we have social services, we must pay for them, and I would like those who criticise them to tell us which services, in their opinion, should be withdrawn. I think there is general agreement that certain sections are not looked after at all, and I would like those who have been criticising the Estimates to come forward and tell us what services should be cut out and what should not.  Before I close, I would like to say that I am satisfied that the farmers are not getting exorbitant prices, nor even sufficient prices, for some of the food they produce. Every person in the nation is looking to the farmers and their workers, and will continue to look to them until this crisis is over, to save the nation.  It is no exaggeration to say that the nation is dependent on them to-day, and I appeal to the Government to give the farmer every help they possibly can, and every consideration he is entitled to so that he may be put in a position to produce the nation's food and to pay his workers a wage that would attract them to stay on the land, a wage that would enable the worker to maintain his dependents in a reasonable amount of comfort.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious that turf production is becoming more important every day.  I consider that the Government should do everything in its power to produce the maximum quantity of turf this year.  I am under the impression that we are not producing as much turf as we should when one considers the resources at our disposal. It is necessary for turf production that we should spend large sums of money in draining our bogs and in the construction of bog roads.  If the bogs <Col N="2412" /> are not properly drained, it is obvious that we cannot produce good quality turf, because the best of the turf is in the lower layers of the turf banks.  If these banks are not drained we cannot get this good quality of heavy turf. Unless you construct good bog roads it is clear to everyone that it is only a waste of time for the farmers to cut turf when they cannot move the turf from the bog.  In June last year we had a very wet summer, and as a result, the farmers were unable to remove their turf.  The bog roads were water logged and we find that even to-day there are thousands of tons of good turf lying in the bogs&mdash; turf badly wanted at present&mdash;and I think the first step the Government should take is to see that proper roads are constructed.  I admit that the Board of Works have done excellent work in this matter, but they appear to decide the question whether a bog should be repaired or a bog drained on the basis whether it is a benefit to unemployment locally rather than to turf production.  I think the Board of Works should decide the question that these roads should be constructed if we are to increase the production of turf.  They should not take into account only the number of unemployed men in the locality.</P>
      <P>I have heard a number of city Deputies complaining of the large quantity of wet turf sold in Dublin.  I am sure that Deputies will be surprised to know that in country towns we were all compelled to use inferior turf this year because of the fact that the summer was exceptionally wet. Even the farmers themselves had to use inferior turf.</P>
      <P>I have looked into this matter and I find that the rainfall in South Kerry was ten times greater in June, 1943, than in June, 1942.  Everyone knows that turf production depends on the fine weather.  One could not expect that we would get as good quality turf in 1943 as we did in 1942.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like now to refer to turf mould.  City Deputies have complained very much about that, and they are quite justified in doing so.  Turf mould is generally caused through negligence. <Col N="2413" /> If turf is not properly saved and ricked at suitable times, there will be large quantities of turf mould.  Turf cut in wet weather or during periods of frost is liable to break.  Unless the turf can be saved in periods of fine weather there will undoubtedly be large quantities of turf mould.  Just consider to what extent turf is handled at the present time.  It is carted from the bog to the roadside, it is then put into lorries and brought to the railway station.  It is thrown from the lorries into the railway waggons, carried long distances, again loaded into lorries and finally ricked in the vicinity of towns or cities.  Everyone knows the characteristics of turf.  It cannot be abused and, if there is turf mould in these ricks, I do not think the Government can be held responsible.</P>
    <P>I have considered this matter of turf production very carefully.  I realise that there is undoubtedly wet turf being sold in the city.  I have asked myself how this position could be remedied, and the only solution I can find is that it is essential that the Government should have inspectors or foremen to see what quality turf is being loaded into the waggons.  It takes a considerable time for a lorry to be unloaded and any man familiar with turf can see at a glance whether it is inferior or otherwise.  If it is inferior the lorry driver should be made take it back to the owner.</P>
    <P>I think it is a ridiculous policy for the Government to allow inferior turf to be conveyed to Dublin before it is condemned.  Consider the valuable space that is taken up in railway waggons conveying this type of turf. It appears to me to be absurd that the Turf Board should condemn or reject turf at its destination rather than at its source.  That is a matter the Government should carefully consider. It would not cost very much to appoint foremen.  They would be quite prepared to do the work for £3 or £4 a week.  I do not suggest we should send down inspectors from Dublin but I do suggest that if anyone is appointed, he should be a man familiar with turf production; that is the only type of person who should be employed in that work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2414" /> With regard to the attitude adopted by Fuel Importers, I believe the procedure is that when they enter into contracts with the producers there are conditions set out that if the turf is not up to a certain standard Fuel Importers can make certain deductions. I am not complaining, because if people send wet turf to Dublin or other places it is quite proper that deductions should be made.  But I do object to the procedure adopted by Fuel Importers.  For instance, if a man sends turf from Kerry, a month later he gets his cheque and possibly there is a statement to the effect that so much of his turf was wet and they were obliged to make certain deductions. Would it not be better if Fuel Importers, immediately the turf was inspected at Dublin, notified the person concerned that the turf was wet and then that person would have an opportunity of sending an agent to inspect the turf.  If the agent is satisfied that the turf is of good quality, the owner should be entitled to sell his turf elsewhere.  That matter is causing some dissatisfaction in South Kerry and, as a result, very few persons there send turf to Fuel Importers.</P>
    <P>Another point is that I believe the merchants in Dublin can enter a waggon, select the good turf, and leave what they consider the inferior turf there.  That is a most unfair procedure. It might be fair enough if the turf were mixed.  In our own areas in Kerry we can get only mixed turf. I consider it is a wrong policy to allow any merchant to enter a waggon and leave it to him exclusively to decide whether that turf is inferior or otherwise. I was glad to hear the Minister stating that it was intended in South Kerry that the county council should cut turf this year.  The council did not cut turf last year or the year before. I do not know the reason why, but it is certainly amazing to learn that the council did not cut turf during 1942 and 1943.  In 1941 over 15,000 tons of turf were railed by the county council from Cahirciveen station.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin stated that it is intended that the county councils should pay their employees at the rate of 10½d.  an hour.  I think that amount <Col N="2415" /> is entirely too low.  The work is hard and the men should get a decent wage. I do not suggest that 10½d.  is a proper wage to pay any man engaged in turf production.  The Minister should see that the slean man is paid a higher rate than the pike man.  If there are good slean men and if they are paid a good wage they will work hard and you will find the production of turf will be increased. It is the slean men who give the output and sometimes they can cut so much that the pike men will be compelled to work.</P>
    <P>I know that, for years prior to the emergency, in the turf production areas in South Kerry, the farmers, when employing labour, generally paid the slean man at a higher rate than the pike man.  If the farmers, who have been engaged in turf production all their lives, have found it profitable to do that, the Government should follow their example.  I have heard it stated that the cost of turf is too high and, on the other hand, the producers declare that they are not paid a sufficiently high price.  I think there is too much of a difference between what is paid to the producer and what is paid by the consumer.  I cannot understand where the difference goes, but probably the loading and handling expenses are high.  At the same time, I think the price to the consumer is entirely too high.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise principally because of the speech made by the Deputy who has just spoken.  I think it was a very reasoned speech.  The Deputy applied himself in a reasonable way to the fuel problem.  I only wish the Minister concerned with fuel was in attendance, but of course Ministers have other duties.  Possibly the Minister for Finance will convey to his colleague at a later stage the points that were raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Healy shed some light on fuel production and he dealt with aspects that until now were touched upon only by Deputies from the City of Dublin.  We are usually told, when we approach agricultural and turf subjects, that we approach them with a Dublin mentality.  We pay for that <Col N="2416" /> Dublin mentality; we pay very bitterly for ineptitude, incompetence and unbusinesslike methods.  When you get a man from the extreme end of Ireland admitting that there is, on the part of the Government of which he is a supporter, ineptitude and incompetence, there are, I think, times when, if we seem to be critical of the Government's lack of understanding and lack of business methods, we are somewhat justified.</P>
    <P>All the Deputy said in connection with turf is true.  He gives a reasonable excuse why the county council did not produce turf last year in Kerry&mdash; he referred to the exceptional weather. The fact is, however, that we did get turf from Kerry last year.  What kind of turf did we get?  He said that some of it was rejected, and he rightly objects to the merchant being the deciding factor as to whether that turf is consumable or not.  In ordinary business no one would allow the buyer to be the deciding factor.</P>
    <P>You must get to the root of this lack of business ability.  Who appointed Fuel Importers or the Turf Development Board?  What about the public, the turf consumers or the turf workers?  This industry is one of the most valuable we have, coming next in importance to agriculture.  It will be our last line of defence as regards keeping industries going in this country and keeping warm the homes of the workers and other people.  We are not concerned about these other people, despite what my friend Deputy Liam Cosgrave may say.  He is very concerned, apparently, about the 3,000 who have all the wealth and all the money in this country, but I am more concerned about the 3,000,000 who are the workers and producers of this country.  Why do not we approach this question in a reasonable way?  Take the case of those merchants who have been dealing with coal for all those years&mdash;men who, naturally, are not concerned with the production of turf and who do not like it.  Naturally, if these people could get coal imported to-morrow, they would not handle your turf.</P>
    <P>I remember that during the 1929 strike here in Dublin a certain paper <Col N="2417" /> the <i>Irish Times</i>, got up a fund for the relief of distressed Irish Protestants, to supply them with fuel.  A certain firm here advertised that it had a large quantity of old railway ties and certain other types of fuel for distribution during that period of emergency, and that they were prepared to handle it.  They did so until the first load of coal came in when the strike was over, and then they did not care whether the distressed people concerned were Protestants, Catholics or Mahometans&mdash; they just chucked them there, and proceeded to import the coal.  Accordingly, I say that if, to-morrow, coal could be easily imported on the quays of Dublin, there is not one of those merchants who would handle even one ton of turf.</P>
    <P>All we are asking is that the Minister for Supplies should approach this matter in the right way.  He has proved himself to be inept, and has made so many mistakes that I think we are entitled to point out his mistakes to him, but it would seem, from his speeches, that we have got no right at all to speak on this subject. He was approached both publicly and privately by people who wished to enlighten him about certain things of which he does not know the alphabet. For instance, take the case of the turf that is clamped up here in the Phoenix Park.  They bring up the turf from Kerry.  It is loaded at the station there, and nobody cares whether it is good-quality turf or not.  It has to come up that long drag from Kerry to Dublin, and I think that the freightage is 17/11 per ton.</P>
    <P>Now, we all know how many tons of turf you can get on a three-ton or even a six-ton wagon.  As a railway expert, Deputy Davin told us yesterday, you may be only able to get three tons of turf on a six-ton wagon, and, as Deputy Lynch has pointed out, the merchant who is going to retail that turf is the man who decides whether it is good turf or not.  What he considers is good turf he puts aside for his own customers, and what he thinks is not presentable he throws aside and it lies there until it turns into mould. May I also put it to the House that more is lost by repeated handling of <Col N="2418" /> turf, because turf will not stand repeated handling.  A certain amount of handling is necessary.  There is, of course, the removal of the turf from the bog, the loading of it in wagons, and the clamping of it when it arrives in Dublin.  That, however, is only three handlings, but in some cases there are anything from 20 to 30 handlings of the turf by the time it is clamped here in Dublin.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out, about three years ago certain prominent people here, including the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of this City, approached the Government with a view to securing approval of a scheme for distribution of turf in and around the suburbs of Dublin.  It was pointed out at the time that that scheme would save the cost of carriage and petrol consumption, and would enable the thing to be done in a business-like way; but we were stopped, and we are still stopped so far as that scheme is concerned.  Now they have clamped something like 100,000 tons of turf in the Phoenix Park.  I wonder how many handlings go to the transfer of that turf from Kerry to the Phoenix Park, and what is the economic value of the turf?  They take it and ship it to James's Street harbour, and the mould is shipped down to Carlow for pressing into briquettes.  I proved that it took 11/- a ton for the carriage of the mould from Dublin to Carlow, where it is used to make pressed briquettes.  However, I intend to deal with that matter in a few days in order to show you the gross political nepotism that has occurred in connection with this matter, and I have got documentary proof of it.</P>
    <P>At the time that this emergency arose we had something like 80,000 men unemployed, and many of these men had been engaged in unloading and sacking coal all their lives.  These men who were out of work could have been employed in connection with the turf scheme, but what happened?  Men were brought up from Kerry, Mayo, Donegal, Kildare, and so on, and put to work in Dublin.  Why?  It was evidently because there was a certain amount of political &ldquo;pull.&rdquo;  They had been offered 35/- a week in their own areas, but they were put on to work in the Dublin area <Col N="2419" /> at 60/- a week.  Is it not ordinary human weakness that if you can get 60/- a week in Dublin, with, possibly, better conditions, you will accept that rather than work in Donegal, Mayo, or other districts for 35/- a week?  The result was that when these people got here they sent for their cousins and even their 42nd cousins, which meant that the men who had been engaged all their lives in sacking coal here were put out of work.  The men who should have been kept on the bog were brought up here to do ordinary labouring work, such as shovelling the turf into bags.  That could have been done by our workers here, but instead of that these people were brought up to Dublin, and the excuse was that the Government wanted a few men who had experience in the clamping of turf. How long would it take any man of average intelligence to learn how to clamp turf?  Apart from that, I suggest that there might have been not so much need for the clamping of turf in open areas, since there was a number of places available in which the turf could have been stored, such as the Chapelizod Brewery, in which thousands of tons of turf could have been stored.  But, oh, no!  That could not be done: they had to put the turf in the open in the Phoenix Park; and then they had to put it down at the East Wall, where the salt spray and the easterly winds could get at it, wetting the turf and making it practically unfit for use.  They would not listen to reason, however; they knew all about it.  When Mr. Grey was appointed as a member of the board we asked that a representative of the consumers should be appointed, but we are still asking the Minister to appoint a representative of the consumers, or a representative of the farmers and a representative of the people who buy more, such as county councils and other large institutions, to be appointed, but nothing has been done.</P>
    <P>No, that could not be done, because then there would have been somebody in the camp who would have known the game which was going on.  They appointed a coal importer as chairman <Col N="2420" /> and the rest of the board&mdash;I am not saying a word in disparagement of them&mdash;consists of civil servants and others who know nothing about turf or the distribution of turf.  The men who were appointed to inspect the business were undoubtedly appointed for political reasons.  There was no reason for bringing these men into the city.  There were numbers of men who know what turf is and who were born and trained in Kildare and other counties, but they had to be brought in and these men in Dublin were left to sign on at the labour exchange.  It was not a question of 500 or 600 men coming in, because when these men got their feet after a month or two, they got permits to leave and another 600 came up.</P>
    <P>Surely the commonsense thing to have done was to have said to these men: &ldquo;Instead of insulting you by offering you 35/- or £2 a week, we will give you the same wages as you would get in Dublin.  Stop here where you are wanted.  Cut the turf, dispatch it and leave the people in Dublin to handle it.&rdquo;  That, however, was a stupid policy from the Government point of view, so they sent the turf up here and 25 per cent. of it is waste. The first contractor for the carting of this mould, dust and dirt&mdash;because all kinds of gravel as well as the top of the ordinary grass is mixed up with it&mdash;was getting 3/6 a ton for carting it to James's Street harbour.  Another contractor got the contract at an increase of 2/- per ton.  The barges then had to be loaded and the stuff sent on to Carbury, and we are here to-day to vote thousands of pounds for this lack of business capacity.</P>
    <P>What is the charge for the turf we get?  It is 64/- per ton.  Some Deputy yesterday suggested a costings committee for agriculture.  Why do we not get half a dozen men with business sense to do as is done in other businesses&mdash;in the building and other trades&mdash;to form a costings committee, composed, if you like, of civil servants and lay members of the House, to ascertain the cost from the point of production to the point of distribution? I suggest that they will find out something. I do not think Deputy Healy <Col N="2421" /> will say that I am speaking without the book when I say that if they get 22/- per ton on the roadside in Kerry, they are being paid fairly well.  I do not think there is a farmer or any man winning turf in Kerry who would not be glad to get 22/- per ton, but between 22/- and 64/- per ton there is a big margin.  How is it to be explained? Suppose it costs 16/- per ton by rail from Kerry and handling charges here in Dublin amount to 3/6 per ton, in what way is the figure of 64/- per ton arrived at?  The bags have to be paid for, naturally&mdash;it is a capital charge&mdash; but a bag will last at least three years with care.  The clerks have to be paid, and there are inspection, delivery note and other charges to be paid, but I have sat down night after night to try to work out how that involves so great a differential as that between 22/- per ton at the point of production and 64/- per ton at the point of consumption.</P>
    <P>I have the figures with regard to Carbury pressed turf and I know what it costs.  In 1937, it cost 29/- per ton to deliver a ton of pressed briquettes from County Kildare to Portrane. They were brought up by barge, handled by men who were paid the union wage of 65/- per week, taken by rail or road to Portrane and sold at 29/- per ton.  That stuff is not now on the market.  It is reserved&mdash;so the Minister says.  Yet I have here a book issued by a club, with which are connected some very active units of Fianna Fáil, which one can join for 2/-, and get bags of these pressed briquettes.  But it is only to that club, presumably under a certain charitable organisation, and I want to know where the Minister gets power to give away the property of the Government without any order of this House.  By what means is the Minister for Supplies in possession of power to dispatch vast quantities of these pressed briquettes, which are in reserve, to any organisation?  If it is a matter of charity, it is the Minister for Local Government who has the right to do these things, and then we ought at least to get some knowledge of the amount.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The authority in relation to these matters is the Minister for Finance&mdash;I was about to say Minister for Defence, but possibly he will be Minister for Defence before many days pass&mdash;and on this question of turf, he has the last word as to whether money shall be advanced or not.  Does he think it wise that in a crisis money should be advanced to any Department if that money is not carefully conserved and if the commodities or materials bought are not distributed in an expeditious and business-like way?  I submit that that is a matter for the Minister to answer. It has been proved conclusively out of the mouths of their own prophets that they are not doing the job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been proved on this side that <Col N="2423" /> they lack capacity and they have been called on to answer before the country as to what is their business aptitude, their ability to take over the responsibilities which they will assume in a few days.  We say that they lack that business aptitude, that they lack sagacity and a sense of responsibility.  We say that they lack vision and that there has to be some common denominator to govern every man, woman and child in the near future and particularly those men and women who are elected to this legislative body and the administrative bodies in the country, because we are confronted with a crisis and now is the time for every good man to come to the rescue of his people.</P>
    <P>I want to turn now to the question of food and the cost of living.  I do not propose to labour the point, but I live with this subject every hour of the day. I have heard people talking in a critical way about members of the House who drew the attention of the House, and, I hope, the country, to the mischievous way in which the national income is distributed.  After all, what is this question of economics? It is purely a matter of housekeeping. It is only a question of doing what we would do in our own homes on a weekly or monthly income, or if living on investments.  How is that money spent?  Is it spent wisely or by wasting one's substance on riotous living, as many people do?  When a Deputy with reasoning power and with the ability to do so applies himself to a review of the situation that confronts us or lack of aptitude on the part of the Government, he is told that he is taking a class view of things.  It is that class dominates this country.  I never heard working-class people taking that narrow view.  There is no one so gracious and so generous in their approach to economic questions as the working-class.  If they were only as conservative, and as rigidly reactionary as those who exploit and live on their labour, this might be a country where they could have a full measure of life.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Tunney spoke I saw one or two Deputies evincing a certain amount of hilarity when he suggested giving value to the farmer.  By the <Col N="2424" /> way, the farmer is only the licensed holder of land, and if he does not use it I would not hesitate to tell him that somebody else would use it for him.  In that statement I think I have the full support of this House, because many of the questions are inquiries when this or that estate is going to be divided. No Deputy would defend the non-use of land.  If a man is using land lawfully, and in the best interests of the nation, surely he has a right, whether he is a large farmer or a small farmer, to be paid for his ability and for his labour, even if that labour be only of a supervisory character.  If the farmer has that right, and if 90 per cent. of the time of this House is monopolised by claims that he should get better prices, I do not think that anybody on the Labour benches would object when he is producing wealth.  The farmer should get a full and a generous measure of living, but the same rights should be given to the man who works beside him, the hired worker, so that he might get just the same measure of life, and none less.  We remember the Biblical story about the labourer who went to the vineyard at the eleventh hour, and got the same reward as the man who went in at the beginning. Some Deputy said that that did not apply in view of the present needs.  Surely it ought to apply. Out of the supplies that are available every man, woman and child is entitled to the same measure of life. If Deputies want authority for that statement I can give it.  It is admitted that all men are equal, but when it comes to measuring out the supplies that is not the case.  Lines are then drawn between the 3,000 who hold 90 per cent.  of the wealth of the country and the remainder who get a share under sufferance or under tremendous pressure organised or otherwise.  Relying upon ourselves as we will be, I think we are able to defend ourselves from any infringement externally.  The only danger to this community is the danger that we have always been confronted with, internal danger, disunity, lack of common honesty between one another and lack of recognition of the wants of one another.  Otherwise we can defy the whole world even if a wall was built around this nation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2425" /> As a community we can sustain ourselves in all difficulties, but we have to realise that in accepting that responsibility we must be organised. When we appealed for organisation and for a planning campaign we were laughed at.  Some people with their omnipotent power&mdash;I do not say brains &mdash;think they are very intelligent, and having the power they are bankrupt in the use of it.  Then men who boast about the old days no longer live in those days.  They live in a world of bankruptcy of ideas, of profits, of selfishness or of black-marketing. Deputy O Cléirigh said that black-marketing was the order of the day in everything.  What brought about black-marketing?  It was not the Labour Party.  If we know that there is black-marketing in operation, surely it is an easy thing to check it and to see that people who are known to be in the black-market are prosecuted. For example it would be easy to control the meat trade.  Everybody knows how many bullocks and breeding cows there are in the country. The average increase in the price of cattle has varied from £2 to £9 per head.  The cost of meat is gone up by a few shillings per cwt.  When I asked the Minister for Agriculture if it was true that cattle with embryo calves were being killed he told me that was not so.  Yet it was found that 22 per cent. of the cattle slaughtered for canning purposes were in young.  In some of the British markets recently it was found that 15 per cent. of the finest fat cattle were in calf.  Is there a greater crime than that?  That is nearly as great a crime as killing the calves and selling their tails to prove that they were killed.</P>
    <P>Workers engaged in the meat trade had an application recently before the Wages Tribunal for the balance of a bonus of 11/-.  The employers were represented there legally because they were not fit to do their own work.  They had hired spokesmen and after spasmodic hearings the question was asked: supposing the butchers and messengers got all they asked for, what would be the increased cost of beef in Dublin?  One man stated that it would be a ¼d. per lb.  When I asked <Col N="2426" /> him to prove that statement he could not do so.  I believe that the increase would be less than ¼d. per lb. if the men got the whole of the 11/- that they claimed.</P>
    <P>Yet Deputy Tunney has quoted here &mdash;and I will prove it if necessary&mdash; that the price of beef joints, all kinds of joints, all measures of cattle, has gone up at least 87 per cent.  Some of those portions in certain shops have gone up 120 per cent.  The rents have not increased.  The rates have increased by 1/10 or a little more.  Then where does this margin come in, and how is it explained?</P>
    <P>The same thing applies in the case of swine.  It was so bad in the market for pork, that I had to go as a member of a deputation to the Minister and ask him to free the market, so that men in the pork trade would at least get a measure of supplies.  The price of the hide has gone up&mdash;not very much&mdash;and the peculiar thing is that the profit lies in the hide, in the fat or in the entrails.  The price of casein, the coverings for sausages, has gone up 127 per cent. and you cannot get them.  They were being shipped until we demanded that the export be stopped.  You can take any commodity in the City of Dublin and though you get here the figures for the increase, I say that those figures are incorrect and are always behind time. The figures, as we think, should be checked up by some statistical inquiry and will be found to be radically wrong.  Take any woman, give her the wages and send her out with a basket, to buy the things that are set down in this document, and how far will she get?  We are told that milk is a primary food.  Of course it is.  My friend Deputy Tunney said something I would hardly credit&mdash;that there are children in this country who have never tasted milk.  Possibly, he meant that they would get it only in the form of tea.  When we gave those children natural milk recently in the schools, they resented it; they did not want it, they wanted tea.</P>
    <P>They never saw milk before in its fluid or natural state until it was given to them under the school meals <Col N="2427" /> scheme.  But what has happened within the last two days?  We, in our wisdom or otherwise, decided to give a larger measure of supply to a larger number of children.  Deputy O'Sullivan, the Lord Mayor of Dublin, has gone out, but my colleagues are here on both sides of the House, Deputy Dockrell and Deputy Breathnach, to bear me out.  The Minister put his foot down and said&mdash;though we were willing to spend the money and to pay for it out of the rates&mdash;that we were spending too much and must stop giving the children milk.  We must stop giving the hungry children milk!  That was not the first time he did that.  It was the second and third time.  You remember, previous to the general election when he said that we would make the children all good Communists if we gave them full bellies. Is that not an extraordinary thing in a Christian country?  There was our natural willingness to give our children food, paying for it out of the rates; but the Minister comes along and says the children are well fed&mdash; and he himself is well fed&mdash;and, ergo, &ldquo;Stop there, you are spending too much money&rdquo;.  Is not that kind of blackguardism enough to create disorder and trouble in any country?</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that men do not want to go outside their own areas to seek work?  I was surprised to hear a Deputy talking at some great length, and suggesting that some people do not want work.  Surely there are some such people, but they are not amongst the working class.  Go down Grafton Street now and you will see the large number of ill-disciplined men, with weak bodies, who do not mean to work if they can avoid it.  But you will not find such persons amongst the common people in Ireland.  You will not tell me that the ordinary men, women and girls who go to the labour exchange and walk from factory to factory, morning after morning, do not want work.  The most dangerous menace in the city is the unoccupied young woman, going from factory to factory, seeking work, although we have organisations for the protection of such women.</P>
    <P>I quoted the other day in the House <Col N="2428" /> the case of a factory started on the North side of the city a few months ago, to make starches and custards out of potatoes.  What were the wages offered to young girls of 14, and possibly to some who were over 20? They were 7/6 a week; and even then they were not getting a full week's work&mdash;only casual or broken time.  I wonder what kind of Christian country it is that permits that.  No factory inspector has ever been in that factory.  No Minister for Supplies ever knew about it.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce never heard of it until the ordinary Ishmaels we are always talking about, as being enemies of our own people, had to go out and apply the cure.  Surely that was our task and the task of this Government.</P>
    <P>Could we not get some common denominator, some common line of action, to bring men from different Parties together&mdash;I am not concerned who they are&mdash;pledged to work together, in the words of Deputy Esmonde, &ldquo;as brothers in a common bond&rdquo;?  Could we not be determined to use these Four Fields of Kathleen Ní Houilhán for the benefit and sustenance of every man, woman and child in this territory, against all enemies outside and against all those traitorous enemies who, at the present moment, are inarticulate but who will soon, when the opportunity is presented, make themselves articulate, as they did in the many years of our purgatorial history?  Deputies should drop all feelings of bitterness and lack of understanding and should appreciate each other's good points; points of irritation should be smoothed over and points of acceptance and good comradeship should be worked out, in order to find a fulfilment of the dream of those who have gone before us, so that we in our lifetime may see it brought to fruition.</P>
    <P>It is in that spirit that I approach this question this afternoon.  I sat here all day yesterday, to the closing of this business in the Chamber last night, and to-day from early morning.  I would be sorry to go home to-night&mdash; when this nation is confronted as we know no other nation under God ever was confronted&mdash;without the knowledge that something has been done of <Col N="2429" /> dynamic value, in the last two days. I came in with a feeling of upsurge in mind and heart, knowing that the right course had been taken by the spokesman of the race, and feeling that we were going to implement his wisdom and good sense.  Yet nothing has been said so far of any value, to-day or yesterday.  We have been arguing about these material matters&mdash;matters of no moment&mdash;as to how to live for to-day.</P>
    <P>The spiritual matters that should animate our people are being forgotten. It may be that they are held in abeyance.  There was a question here yesterday about a righteous protest against the violation of the centre of Christendom by the belligerent powers.  The spokesman of the Government said that was a matter about which he was deeply concerned, but that the line of thought would not be followed up by action until the right moment.  That was a correct policy.  In our own case, what is the message given to our citizens, who are anxious but self-controlled?  No race in the world could have stood the last few days as our race did, with not one person getting worried.  Everybody was phlegmatic, knowing they could rely on the inner powers if the test came.  Yet we are getting no lead.  I think we should have stayed up here, even up to the very eve of the Patron Saint's Feast, and continued to deal with this problem and to devise ways and means to combat it.  I suggest, even at this late hour, that it is not too late to decide that.</P>
    <P>I think that the Minister ought to decide that this is a case of an emergency; and I believe the present Minister is the best man to do that.  He could declare this to be an emergency &mdash;not a panic, but a question of emergency, in which everyone should be concerned.  I came through the city to-day and saw three private cars.  I saw one gentleman driving in to his office and using petrol, and I saw other people running around in hired cars. Though we should conserve every pint, every ounce, of petrol, they were wasting gallons of it day after day. Surely, no one should have the right to <Col N="2430" /> use any more petrol, except to deal with matters of great urgency?</P>
    <P>Surely, driving from joy centre to joy centre, from public house to public house, or to and from race-meetings is not an urgent matter.  The farmers want the petrol, the men in the industrial areas want the petrol, and I would not allow one ounce of petrol to be given to anybody else.  As to the setting up of an economic council, I have heard the Leader of the Labour Party appeal for the setting up of such a council.  You will be forced to set up such a council in the immediate future. It has been suggested that you have carried the burden yourselves.  You say so.  But the fact is that you have thrust the burden on to other people to bear.  You are up against it now and the embattled forces of the nation will have to get together.  We know that this matter will not be put to a division, that you will get your Vote on Account.  If it were in our power to give £50,000,000, you would get it. As to the suggestion put forward by a Labour Deputy this morning, I think you ought to do the right thing, the correct thing, the wise thing, and take over the reserves in the banks, giving the banks the same return that they give to the people who deposit money with them.  If you put £1,000 in the bank you get 1 per cent., certainly not more than 1½ per cent., on it.  Give the banks that, or even say to them: &ldquo;We will give you 2 per cent., but we will take over all your liquid assets.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We should give to the farmer whatever he thinks is his right, on the basis that he will give to his labourer what we think is right.  There should be in every county a wage of not less than £3 per week for every farm labourer and every man working on the bogs. If men working on the bogs cannot get to their homes, we should provide proper shelter and food for them and allow any member of any political Party to inspect the living conditions of these men, because we must get fuel, and at once.</P>
    <P>Every farm labourer should be assured of continuity of employment, and get not less than the industrial labourers in the cities and towns.  Why should a man working on a farm not <Col N="2431" /> get a wage equal to the man working in the building trade in Dublin?  In the County Dublin the wage of a farm labourer is £2 6s. per week.  He is living under exactly the same conditions as I am.  Some of them are living in the County Borough of Dublin, and their cost of living is just the same as mine, or perhaps higher, because they wear out more boots.  As I say, the farm labourer in County Dublin gets £2 6s. per week.  By whom is that wage fixed?  By a hand-picked group of farmers and a hand-picked group of political supporters of Fianna Fáil. They decide what the wages will be for agricultural workers in County Dublin.  Surely these workers have a right to speak for themselves without the Government interfering and saying what their rights are.  In other counties in Ireland the wage for farm labourers is £2 per week&mdash;not 10½d. an hour as was stated, but 9d. an hour. If any man in any clerical or industrial capacity works on Sunday he gets double pay for his work.  But a farm labourer who works 54 hours per week, while other labourers only work 48 hours, gets £2 per week and, when he works on Sunday, he gets the same rate of wages as on any other day of the week.  Surely the farm labourer is entitled to a 48-hour week, for every hour over that, time and a half, and for Sunday work double time, the same as any other human being.  The farm labourer should be given a reasonable wage, at least a wage fixed according to the lowest minimum standard for any worker.  We in the towns have fought for him for the last 30 years and demanded justice for him.  Even if we do not get any higher standard for ourselves, we will be prepared to suffer that if the men who produce get a proper standard of living.  They are the only men we should be concerned about now&mdash;the men who produce food, clothing and shelter.  In conclusion, I ask the Minister in all earnestness to make a gesture to the House and, after consulting with his colleagues, to see if we cannot have this round-table conference of representatives of every section of the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Larkin, Senior, overlooked one important point when relating the question of farm labourers' wages to that of industrial workers.  In fact, it was mentioned by Deputy Larkin, Junior, this morning when he asked whether, if the doles and subsidies that are being demanded by those who claim to represent the agricultural community were granted, would the people on the Farmers' benches be prepared to say that the agricultural labourer will get his share of that. When those who claim to represent the farmers spoke for the first-time in this House last year.  I asked the Leader of their Party that question. If they did get a subsidy of £3 per acre for tillage and other concessions, I put it to them that, naturally, something should be done to relate the wages that were being paid to the farm labourers to what the farmers were getting.  I failed to get an answer from these people, and I am sure that Deputy Larkin, Junior, will fail to get an answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real difficulty that I see, and I put it to Deputy Larkin, Senior, is not so much the question of the wages of the farm labourer, as that can be settled, but the question of fixed hours.  Every farmer and every farm labourer knows that the great difficulty about employment on the land at present is the question of fixed hours.  The question of fixed hours has done a considerable amount of damage in the dairying industry. Everybody knows that it is very hard to fix definite weekly hours for any kind of farm labourer, even the person working in the yard, as distinct from the person working on the land, because there are considerable periods during which labourers are not actually working at all.  I suggest that at the present time the wage of £2 6s. 0d. per week in County Dublin and £2 per week in other parts of the country has very little bearing on the question.  So far as my own district is concerned, the agricultural labourer's wage exceeds the rate fixed by the wages board.  Anybody who has any knowledge of the rural areas must admit that the actual cash wage, <Col N="2433" /> even for men who have a yearly contract, is far higher than the rate fixed by the wages board on the weekly basis, because there is a considerable demand for good agricultural labourers and the people who want them are prepared to pay them.</P>
    <P>The thing to be decided is: how far can the agricultural community afford to go in paying agricultural labourers at the moment?  I have always felt, and nobody can deny it, that where there is a gradual improvement in prices and in the general position of the farming community, the position of the farm labourer should also improve.</P>
    <P>I would say to the people who seem to be very doleful, even at the present time, about the position of the agricultural industry, the people who seem to feel that it will not exist unless they get these subsidies, that they will find it very hard to explain to me that if the farming community of this country are in such a depressed condition why land sold now is making prices even in excess of what were paid during the last war.  Within my own immediate neighbourhood in the last week, accommodation land near a country village went for £100 an acre.  There was a farm of 90 odd acres of not particularly good land, a farm that was not worked for a good number of years, because it was part of an old estate and the price of it was £3,150. It was not paid by a speculator or by any of these mysterious gentlemen we hear of buying land in Dublin.  The price was paid by next-door neighbours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, ready money.  I know what I am talking about, and I do not think there is any great encouragement now by the banks so far as the ordinary farmer is concerned. Those people are of some value to the community, men who have made money out of their own land and who are prepared to put it back again into the land.  They are the farmers who are <Col N="2434" /> of value to the community, and not the type of people who are looking for doles and subsidies.  To my mind the best way to resettle the Irish people is to see that those prepared to work hard and to make money out of their holdings should be encouraged to extend their activities and to put their families into farms of their own. Those are the people who will preserve the agricultural future of this country, the people who have faith in themselves. They are not fools and we know perfectly well that unless they have the greatest confidence in the agricultural future of this country they will not put their money into land.</P>
      <P>They are the type of people who always treat their agricultural labourers best, because they work side by side with them, and feel themselves no better than agricultural labourers.  Whatever Deputy Larkin (Junior) thinks, there is no class barrier between the farmers and the agricultural labourers in districts like mine.  It is the commonest thing in the world to see the son of a farmer of 30 or 40 acres working with a farmer of 60 or 80 acres.  There is no social distinction, but there is the natural inclination to treat agricultural labourers like themselves.  These people are in a position to get labourers to work for them.  I am quite satisfied that a farmer who believes in working hard has never begrudged proper payment to his labourers, so long as he feels any security in his own future, and so long as he feels that he has been justly treated by the State.  There are times when the farmers have not felt that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very hard to compare the position of an agricultural worker with that of an agricultural labourer.  A worker in the country has a cottage for perhaps 1/- a week, and he has an opportunity of keeping a cow and growing a few ridges of potatoes.  If he does not keep the cow, he may get milk at a cheap rate.  He has an opportunity of getting fuel, and of getting assistance to get fuel during the summer months, and he is in a much happier position than the worker in the City of Dublin or, indeed, the worker in a small country town who may be earning 35/- to £2 a week and <Col N="2435" /> paying 6/- or 7/- a week for a couple of rooms and having only the bare cost of living.  The man in the country is much more resilient.</P>
    <P>In many respects, the man in the country town is every bit as badly off as the man in the city, but often the man in the country town has a better possibility of providing for himself. There is no comparison between the city worker and the rural worker, and I think the lack of agricultural labour in a number of districts, at any rate, is not accounted for by the fact that they do not want to work on the land or are dissatisfied with the wages paid, but by the fact that there is an attraction to young people to move somewhere. Nobody could explain why young men will leave a farmer they were working for for four or five years under good conditions and reasonably good wages.</P>
    <P>Why, for example, should they go away to live in a hut in Kildare on the bogs, under conditions which may be all right, instead of remaining behind in their own home with their families? In the County Kildare camp they receive a wage which is not very much in excess of what they earn at home. I think the same argument would apply to those young people who leave continuous employment in the country to go to England to earn higher wages. They are not supposed to be allowed to go to England if they are employed, but there is no means of testing that accurately.</P>
    <P>The local employment office writes to the person described as the last employer. They ask him if he has any work and, of course, he says he has not.  If he says he has, the man concerned will not get his passport, but he will walk out.  For some unknown reason, in the rural areas it is not so much dissatisfaction with the work as the fact that there seems to be an attraction in moving somewhere else, away from home.  Boys have gone up to Kildare notwithstanding keen competition for farm labour.  I cannot explain it, and I doubt if anyone can, but I am afraid that there is a definite tradition in this country, perhaps on account of the forced emigration for a <Col N="2436" /> number of years, to move abroad from one's own particular area and to seek work somewhere else.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney delivered rather a lecture to the Fine Gael Party at the end of his speech.  He said that some of our people had criticised the amount of the Vote on Account, and the amount asked for in the Estimates without suggesting what social services should be abolished.  Why should we? I put it to the Deputy that the entire amount of the Estimates could be criticised by an intelligent Deputy without any question of social services. Apart entirely from the emigration situation, there must, in the post-war period anyway, be a time when those emergency payments will no longer be necessary, and we must have an examination of the gross national expenditure of this country with a view to seeing that our national taxation is kept within the limits of our national income.</P>
    <P>At the present time, for various reasons, the impact of increased taxation and expenditure is affecting a far greater portion of the community than it ever did before.  I hope that Deputy Tunney does not represent the Labour Party point of view.  He criticised us for not wanting to remove social services.  Nobody did. When he repeated it the third time I took a careful note of it and I found that he said it five times after that, always ending up by saying that something must be done.  He ended every sixth sentence with that phrase, &ldquo;something must be done,&rdquo; but he never told anyone what should be done.  My submission is that it is not within the right of any Deputy to criticise any other Deputy or any other Party for their lack of suggestions, if he is not prepared to suggest something himself.  I know that the Deputy is a very humane man and that he has a great interest in the various sections of the community who are not as well off as others, but beyond a slight criticism of the difference between the price producers receive for commodities such as meat, and the price paid by consumers, and a suggestion that there should be some examination of <Col N="2437" /> how that difference is disposed of, he did not suggest anything.</P>
    <P>There are a great many people in this country at the moment who are hit every time there is an increase in the cost of living or an increase in taxation who possibly were never touched before.  Everybody realises that there is a certain proportion of our people who have always been badly off, who have never been in regular employment and whose families always suffer from malnutrition.  That is one section who are always affected by economic pressure, but at the present time there are thousands of other people suffering who were never seriously affected before.  Take tradesmen. Take for instance the country blacksmith who has to keep a wife and family.  He is now able to obtain only sufficient iron for a week to carry him over a month.  Or take the country carpenter who gets only sufficient timber in the month to do him for a week.  These people have no possible means of increasing their incomes to meet the rise in the cost of living. Again, take people carrying on small shops who are not in the position of those big firms who have been able to increase their profits by 100 per cent. The curtailment of their normal supplies has reduced their income in some cases by 75 per cent.  These people have no means of expanding their incomes to help them to withstand the increase in the cost of living or increases in taxation.</P>
    <P>In every district in the country, there are people who would normally be considered fairly well off, who would never in normal times be classed as poor, but who are now in as destitute circumstances as the people whom we would classify as poor in pre-emergency days for the simple reason that they find it as hard to buy clothes, milk, vegetables, boots and shoes for their families as people who were considered really badly off in pre-emergency days.  These people have no possible chance of doing anything to preserve themselves against the shock of increases of any kind.  They are not in the happy position of people who have a little bit of land, no matter <Col N="2438" /> how small the area.  No matter how small the acreage, if a man has a little bit of land, it will enable him to withstand the greatest shock of all, the shock of starvation.  People who have not that advantage and who are living on fixed incomes must at the present time be suffering to a considerable extent.  People in receipt of reasonably good wages, good artisans who in ordinary times earned good wages, having regard to the price they must now pay for essential commodities, must be feeling the pinch acutely.</P>
    <P>I am honestly afraid that there are a number of people whose families are suffering from malnutrition and in whose case the danger of malnutrition is more serious simply because up to recently they had always enjoyed a certain standard of living.  They were not considered poor people and they are not people who will get anything from the various social services to meet the rise in the cost of living.  I am quite satisfied that there are hundreds of homes in this country in which the adults of the families are starving in order to buy milk for their children.  If they are not starving, the parents are not eating sufficient food to maintain them in ordinary conditions of health.</P>
    <P>It is really alarming to think that any increase in the cost of living or in taxation has such a serious effect on a great proportion of the people.  My suggestion is that, whether during the emergency or during the immediate post-war situation, the House should ask the Government seriously to examine, and examine very closely, the position of every family in this country from the very poorest and the most destitute up, to find out what is really necessary to enable a man to marry, have a home and rear a family, to use the words of the Taoiseach, in frugal comfort.  That is a problem that will have to be examined, because the work of the nation cannot possibly be carried on if young children are reared under a system whereby it is not possible for their parents to provide food or clothing.</P>
    <P>Everyone will appreciate the reference made by Deputy O Cleirigh to the black market, but there is something worse than the black market and <Col N="2439" /> that is, dealing in articles that are not controlled.  One of the reasons for the lack of public confidence of which Deputy O Cleirigh complained is to be found in the fact that, in every daily paper, one sees articles and commodities that are very scarce advertised for sale under box numbers&mdash;articles like horse-shoe nails, shoe tips, etc.  These things are not controlled but they should be controlled.  I know shoemakers in my own constituency who saw advertisements in the paper from parties as far away as Donegal offering supplies of tips, nails and tacks.  These tradesmen in order to keep their business going would pay any price for these articles.  One of the reasons why there is such a great lack of public support in the matter of controlled prices is that people feel that while the prices of certain articles are controlled the prices of a hundred and one other commodities that may not be exactly vital but that are nevertheless important for the life of the commodity, things such as horse-shoe nails, tips and tacks, are not subject to any control. People believe that they should be controlled and that, if there are stocks of these articles in the hands of individuals, or of groups, the Government should take steps to find out exactly where they are.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that it is very galling for any shoe-maker down the country to see articles which he cannot get being advertised under a box number in a paper.  That is one of the reasons why the Department of Supplies do not get the support they should.  I may mention another reason. Two years ago a number of people in County Cork who wanted barley were prosecuted for paying an excess price. One of the reasons why there is a lack of confidence is that nobody is ever prosecuted now for paying more than the controlled price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One sees that a great many people were prosecuted and fined for selling articles at more than the controlled <Col N="2440" /> price.  It would be of great assistance, and it would tend to strengthen the public mind in its desire to support the Department of Supplies, if the people who paid more than the fixed price, and who were known by the inspectors to have done so, were prosecuted and heavily fined.  It is the purchaser and not the vendor who makes the black market.  The sooner some of those people who can afford to go into the black market and make purchases are dealt with, the better for everybody.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin said that the Government had done nothing to control inflation. Inflation, even in the sense of the money coming in from Britain, has had a very peculiar effect on black market activities.  There are many people who are getting more money than they really need for their families, if one may put it that way.  When they have that loose money, they are in the market for any commodity they can pick up.  With that money coming from England and with the increase in agricultural prices, there is a certain amount of money lying dormant because there is nothing to buy with it.  The person who has that money is a potential black market customer, if he or she hears that there is a commodity going which they want.  I believe the Government should have gone much further than they did when they commenced rationing and control of prices.  They should have gone down the list the same as the customs people do when one is coming into the country to see what articles are dutiable. In the case of every article necessary to the life of the people; there should be either rationing or price control.  Piecemeal rationing and piecemeal price-fixing have had a great deal to do with the black market.  When one article was rationed, or when a price was fixed in respect of it, one did not need to be an astute business man to guess what article would be next on the list. Everybody remembers the incident connected with the drapery business. Ninety per cent. of the real damage as regards the black market is done between the time the rumour starts that the price of some article is to be <Col N="2441" /> controlled and the time that the Order is made.  Unfortunately, that has happened on more than one occasion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin, junior, seemed to take a line which I did not expect from him.  Deputy Larkin, senior, I think, disagreed with him.  Deputy Larkin, senior, said that references to social classes and social strata do not come from the workers, that they are not the people who are sensitive in this connection.  Deputy Larkin, junior, suggested that one of the great evils was the extreme difference in social strata which we have.  I think that the less talk which we have from the Labour Party or any other Party about that, the better.  We, in the rural areas, are fortunate in the fact that there are no social strata there. To the extent of 90 per cent. in some of the rural areas and to the extent of 100 per cent. in others&mdash;Deputies from the south-western counties will bear out what I say&mdash;whether the people pursue professional activities, business activities, farming activities or farm-labour activities, there are no such things as social strata.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy did that, he would find out that what I am saying is correct.  I am sure that Deputy Looney and other Deputies from Cork will confirm what I say and that Deputy Spring, who represents North Kerry, will say the same of that part of the country.  We cannot help it if the Dublin mentality tends to that kind of thing.  I can understand Deputy Larkin's contempt for the parasite walking down Grafton Street. These people, probably, regard Deputy Larkin, senior, as equally objectionable. That is, probably, the Dublin mentality.  When we speak of the <Col N="2442" /> Dublin mentality, I do not think we mean it in the hurtful sense that Deputy Larkin imagines.  We take a different view.  Dublin people have built up a legend that the people in control of government, in control of the civil service and of business are people who came in from the country and were too clever for the Dublin people.  That is, possibly, true but the Dublin mentality is such&mdash;and everybody knows it&mdash;that it likes to assimilate those people.</P>
      <P>When they become heads of the State or are in control of Departments or in charge of businesses, they are assimilated and get the Dublin mentality. The rest of Ireland may be all right, in the opinion of Dublin; the people living there may be decent people who work hard to supply them with food and fuel.  But, whether Deputy Larkin likes it or not, I am afraid there is a Dublin mentality which feels that it is paying us a compliment by asking us to produce its food, fuel, and so on.  The sooner the people of Dublin get that idea out of their heads the better.  I met persons during the past couple of days whose real concern was not the danger arising out of the emergency but whether the Government would be strong enough to make those country fellows do the necessary work.  Everybody knows that that is a nonsensical idea.  Before and during this emergency, when economic conditions permitted, the farmers worked their lands in a proper manner and were always prepared to supply city and country with their needs, so far as they could.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not the fault of the farmer or the agricultural labourer if the people of the cities and towns are paying too much for milk, butter and meat.  The whole fault lies in bad control of distribution and bad control of profits. If the distribution of milk and those other things were handled in a proper manner, the cost would go down.  You have a creamery in a country village handling 7,000 or 8,000 gallons of milk at 1/- a gallon.  Deputy Mahony will bear me out when I say that there is not a village where people are not paying proportionately higher for their milk than they are paying here, <Col N="2443" /> although there is milk going in practically next-door at 1/- a gallon.  I suggested before that something on the lines of the free milk scheme should be done in connection with the ordinary distribution of milk&mdash;that a certain amount should be taken at every creamery in a village and distributed in that way.  I was told that it was not feasible, that the cost would be too much and that there was really no necessity to do it because one group of creameries could practically supply the whole of this country with its fresh milk demands at the moment. I entirely discredit that statement.  It might be accurate.  There is quite a possibility that a couple of creameries might soon supply the people with all the milk they can purchase because they cannot afford to buy very much of it in the towns and cities.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that, before and during the emergency, our consumption of milk was shockingly low.  It is perfectly obvious that if the distribution of milk&mdash;wholesale and retail&mdash; was efficiently dealt with by any Government, the people paying 5/- or 6/-, or 10/- or 12/- per week for milk would still pay the same amount, even if they got double the amount of milk for it.  They would not cut down that expenditure.  The main thing that the heads of a family are anxious to provide is fresh milk.  I was amazed to hear Deputy Tunney say that some children never knew the taste of milk. Deputy Larkin said that some children who were getting the free milk desired to be supplied with tea.  It is hard for a nation to exist if large numbers of its citizens are being reared in that way.  I entirely agree with Deputy Larkin.  I want to make clear to Deputy Larkin, junior, that it is not right or just for any member of this House, whether belonging to the Labour Party or any other Party, to suggest that there is not on every side of the House as good a conception of the ills and woes of the destitute and of the poor and as much anxiety to assist them as there is in his own Party.</P>
    <P>There is no good in saying that <Col N="2444" /> Fianna Fáil failed to do this or that Cumann na nGaedheal, when it was in power, failed to do that: that it failed to deal with the unemployment question. As far as I am concerned, what I would wish after the emergency has passed, and when we have to face the post-war period, is that we could by some means or other stop men's minds from going back for ever on the history of the last 20 years, thereby making it possible for all of us to look forward and see how we can best help in the future.  Deputies, however much they may dislike the politics and ideals of other members, should at least remember that every Deputy sent here represents a cross-section of the community.  There is no Deputy who represents the rich only or the poor only.  Each Deputy represents a cross-section of the community in his particular area, and if he is worth his salt he has as much interest in the poorest of the poor as he has in the richest of the rich.</P>
    <P>I, and the members of this Party, naturally feel that the amount that is being demanded by the Government is extremely high.  I put it to the Government that it will be necessary for it to stock-take very severely once the emergency is over.  When taxation rises to great heights we often hear it said, as people will say when the local rates reach a high figure, that after a period certain things will not be necessary and that, therefore, expenditure can be brought down.  That seldom happens.  When this emergency ends, it is true that several items which appear in the Estimate to-day will no longer be necessary, to the same extent at any rate.  Army expenditure, for example, will not be as heavy as it is now.  During this period of emergency we have found it possible to raise a certain amount of money through taxation. We are doing that in a period of stress.  It may be necessary for us to continue to do so in the post-war period, but to utilise the money so raised in a different way from that in which it is being utilised to-day. People are beginning to realise that the scourge of tuberculosis, with which we have been tinkering for the last 20 years, will have to be seriously <Col N="2445" /> tackled.  It is a tragedy that of all civilised countries in the world, it should be more widespread here than in any other country.  It may be that it will be worse after the emergency, due to malnutrition.</P>
    <P>Since we have been quite prepared to spend money in raising and maintaining an army on the present scale, I am sure there is no member of the House who would not be prepared cheerfully to spend money in getting an army together whose work would be to save the nation and the race against the scourge of tuberculosis. There is no use in thinking that you are going to deal with it by the expenditure of a few thousand pounds or by the erection of a small hospital or a sanatorium here or there.</P>
    <P>Nobody would object to increased taxation to deal with a problem such as that any more than they would on the things that were found necessary to be done during the emergency, or to give Deputy Cogan the things that he would like.  There are some things that we cannot afford to give the Deputy.  I am sure he will admit that we will have to cut taxation because it is too high.  I would remind Deputies on all sides of the House that sectional demands, whether they come from the Farmers' benches, the Labour benches or from our benches, which tend to increase taxation and the price to the consumer, without a fair proportion of the latter going back to the producer, only means that we are robbing Peter to pay Paul.  Such demands merely mean that we are increasing taxation which will fall heaviest on that section of the community which, as Deputy Larkin (Junior) says, is hit most severely by indirect taxation.  It hits the poor man with a large family far more severely than it does the comparatively well-off man who has the same size of family.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin suggested that an economic council should be set up. That suggestion was made before.  I want to say that any help that this Party can give the Government to carry the country through the emergency will be given.  In our view, <Col N="2446" /> apart altogether from the present emergency, it is necessary that the Government should start now to plan for the post-war situation.  It is not sufficient just to talk about big arterial roads or plans for arterial drainage&mdash;we must start to plan to meet the situation that will face the country post-war.  In that situation you will have hundreds of thousands of people coming back to the country. Preparations will need to be made for their reception and to give them employment. The situation that will face us then will be as serious as any that arose during the war period.</P>
    <P>This Vote on Account is a very large one.  In my submission it should not be as big as it is.  Our capital debt has been increasing year by year; taxation has been increasing year by year.  No matter how much taxation is increased, the Government are still not able to present a balanced Budget. Something should be done to reduce taxation for otherwise a dangerous position may be reached.  Our credit may be impaired if we have too big a capital debt.</P>
    <P>Taxation itself might be impaired by the fact that our national income had gone down and ultimately the only way of meeting the situation might be by reducing our social services.  With Deputy Larkin, I believe that all Parties in the House would be willing, if asked, to co-operate with the Government, but it is the Government's duty to plan for the post-war emer gency.  If that planning is not done now to make preparations to deal with such questions as unemployment, the social services, the housing of the people and the situation created by the thousands returning to the country after the war, I do not think that I would care to be a member of the Government that will have to handle that situation, one in which, for example, you had one adult in every five unemployed. That is a situation that the Government ought to have in mind at the present time.  In conclusion, I think that the best motto for the House and for the people of the country to adopt in dealing with the present situation is: &ldquo;Business as usual.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>This Vote on Account is an intimation to the House and to the country that the nation must prepare itself for raising £50,000,000 in taxation this year.  When we consider that the State's demand for £50,000,000 will be accompanied by a demand from the local authorities for approximately £7,000,000 to be raised out of the rates, we are face to face with the position that the nation, out of its income, will have to provide £57,000,000 this year.  For about 20 years the national income of the State has been static at about £150,000,000.  Possibly, arising from inflationary tendencies, the national income might now be said to be £170,000,000 or £180,000,000.  No recent figures are available to enable calculations to be made, but the fact is that out of a national income of approximately £170,000,000 we will have to provide £57,000,000 for national and local services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the Minister will attempt to deny that that is a very heavy charge on such a relatively small national income.  It seems that roughly 30 per cent. of the national income is raked off for services of the kind I have indicated, and I think that rake-off in our circumstances is something that is unusual, something that is unparalleled in countries whose circumstances are approximately similar to those which obtain here.  In my view the significance of these figures cannot be gainsaid and the dangers which they indicate cannot be overlooked.  To raise a sum of £57,000,000 in taxation out of a national income of £170,000,000 is to impose upon the people a very heavy burden.  I do not, of course, attempt to deny that the raising of the £57,000,000 is necessary in our circumstances, but I think the point must not be overlooked, because it is at the root of our economic life, that if we are to make that burden tolerable for our people, it can be done only in one way, that is, by increasing national productivity and thereby making it possible for our people to bear the burden under more endurable circumstances. In New Zealand, a country with a population of approximately 1,600,000, the national income represents £180 per head of the population.  Applying the New Zealand national income of <Col N="2448" /> £180 per head to our circumstances, our total national income would be in the vicinity of £540,000,000 and our financial and economic relationship with New Zealand may be gauged by a comparison of our national income, £170,000,000, with their national income, £340,000,000.  That might give us some indication of the extent by which we must multiply our productivity here in order to be able to provide better standards of social legislation for our people.</P>
    <P>The most significant feature and the most dangerous symptom of the Estimates is that in this relatively small country we find it necessary to make provision to the extent of £6,000,000 for services which are related to the relief of poverty and distress.  If ever there was an indictment of our statesmanship it is surely to be found in the fact that, out of our national expenditure of £50,000,000 we must necessarily spend approximately £6,000,000 for services definitely related to the relief of poverty and distress. That is a dangerous situation. It is an undesirable situation.  It is a situation which can only be remedied by removing the causes of poverty and of want.</P>
    <P>For this situation there is only one remedy.  It is now possible to find it in operation in most countries which have been compelled to mobilise their manhood in time of war.  That remedy is the provision of full employment for each and every citizen able and willing to work.  Are we doing that to-day? Quite clearly we are not.  There has been no attempt whatever to utilise to the full the available manpower of the nation in all spheres of national activity.  What we are doing to-day is simply relying on the worn-out, peace-time economic policy, which gave us deplorable results in peace-time and which are giving us still more deplorable results in the emergency.  We are now in the fifth year of the war.  If we failed in the first year of the war to make the provision that one finds it necessary to make in time of war, it might be said in justification of our inertia that we were caught on the wrong foot when the war broke out, that we had not time to make the <Col N="2449" /> necessary preparations.  But to-day we are in the fifth year of the war and we have not yet realised the necessity for mobilising the nation's resources and for mobilising the available man-power and material that are dormant in the country to-day.</P>
    <P>In other countries, notably those at war, the urge of war and the necessities of war have brought about economic and financial revolutions. Old economic structures have been ruthlessly torn up and replaced by others better calculated to ensure the success of the war effort in these countries.  Old financial systems that stood for generations have been uprooted.  What were thought to be orthodox methods of finance are no longer permitted to operate in these countries because, under stress of war, the various nations realised that the necessities of the time demanded that there should be an abandonment of methods that were not calculated to ensure the best possible equipment for the pursuit of war being available for the nations concerned.</P>
    <P>While that has happened over most of the entire world and to a very large extent, even in neutral countries, we in this portion of Ireland are content to bask in the twilight of an economic and financial age which the world has long since left behind.  We still cling to financial and economic policies which the world has long since abandoned, and we continue to tolerate the deplorable results which adherence to out-worn financial and economic systems inevitably brings.  Nations engaged in war to-day are not merely taxing their people severely, but are mortgaging future generations.  In many of these countries generations of their citizens will bear very heavy burdens inevitably associated with the prosecution of war.  Many of these burdens will not be liquidated until many generations have passed. Indeed, he would be a very wise man who would attempt to say when the financial burdens which have been imposed on the principal Powers of Europe or other parts of the world are likely to be liquidated.  Here, with a resolution and determination worthy of a better cause, we struggle on to <Col N="2450" /> maintain economic and financial systems which the world has long since abandoned.  Possibly, there is no other nation in the world to-day that has such a conception of the purpose and the use of money as we have.  We fail completely to realise that the main source of life here and elsewhere is the production and distribution of food, goods and services, that these are the vital factors of life and that money is merely the mechanism which promotes the production and exchange of goods and services.</P>
    <P>We, however, prefer, against the better judgment of the rest of the world, to regard money as the supreme authority, as something which determines what will be produced, the quantities in which it will be produced, the manner in which it will be distributed, and the areas over which it will be spread.  We overlook the fact, the incontrovertible fact, one that is realised to-day in Europe and the world generally more clearly than ever, and that is, that a nation can only live on what it produces, that there is nothing else on which it can live.</P>
    <P>What we have to recognise as an essential part of any agricultural or economic regeneration here is that we must intensify production of goods and services, and the mechanism of money must be utilised for the purpose of serving rather than delimiting that objective. But we, of course, would not be content to do things even in a half-radical way.  In the matter of money mechanism, we have probably the most conservative system in the world.  Our money mechanism operates so that we provide currency and credit on the basis of an anchorage not associated with Irish goods or assets.  We are content here with a monetary system under which we permit our banks to issue money on the basis, not of the assets of this country but on the basis of what another country owes.</P>
    <P>Under the unfortunate Central Bank Act and the Currency Act before it, special steps were taken to ensure and make permanent our anchorage to the British pound.  Before our banks can issue new money for any purpose they must get a British pound note, deposit <Col N="2451" /> that note with the Central Bank here, so that they may get permission to issue an Irish pound note.  In other words, before you can get an Irish pound note into your hand, you must get a piece of paper representing what Britain owes&mdash;British Defence Bonds, British Victory Bonds, any type of British security&mdash;and deposit it with the Central Bank.  Then, and only then, will an Irish citizen get permission to hold an Irish pound note.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Republican separatist members of the Fianna Fáil Party think of that; whatever their ambitions used to be about breaking the connection, there is no question of breaking the connection there.  The Irish £ can now look the British £ in the face, but the British £ will decide on what conditions it can be looked in the face.  When you get what represents British debts, and deposit them with the Irish bank, then you will have the privilege of looking at the Irish colleen on the Irish pound note.</P>
    <P>That was the position of the last Government brought about by the Currency Act and that is the situation the Fianna Fáil Party are perpetuating in this country, and they are perpetuating it in the most dangerous set of circumstances that could possibly be visualised in this country.  We are anchoring our currency to-day to that of a nation which is engaged in a great war and which is spending probably £15,000,000 a day.  Britain has long ceased to have had any gold backing for her currency.  Britain has ceased even to have any metallic backing for her currency.  She is issuing notes on the character and the credit of the British people.  She is issuing money on a colossal scale and we get it because we give the British goods for it.  We plank these notes in the Central Bank and are then permitted to look at what is described as an Irish £ note.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether the Minister is happy with that set of circumstances? The last Government, in 1927, took power to put into the Currency Act, in less dangerous circumstances, a provision which would enable them to <Col N="2452" /> break the anchorage with sterling and get an entirely new anchorage, probably related to Irish production or Irish assets.  But here, in the face of the biggest crisis with which the nation has been menaced during the past 20 years, we are gaily carrying on a financial system under which our notes are anchored to the unlimited issue of notes of a neighbouring power engaged in a life and death struggle.  I think such a policy represents the economics of a mad-house. Can any Deputy contemplate the situation of buying up the assets of a person who is scattering assets in the way that assets are being scattered in the prosecution of this war?</P>
    <P>I think that it is imperative now to apply fresh thoughts and to bring new ideas to bear on this question of our relationship with sterling.  It will not be an easy job at the moment to break the link entirely, but it ought to be an easy job to break parity with sterling, and it ought to be an easy job to look at the situation afresh with a view to seeing what can be done to protect Irish interests in a manner which will ensure that we will not have to bear what I fear will be the crushing fiscal and economic effects of the post-war period because of our present-day anchorage to sterling.</P>
    <P>One of the most vital needs of our people to-day, if we are to ensure that full employment will be provided for all our people, is that money should be issued to finance every worthwhile scheme of national development; that there will be no reluctance on the part of the State to issue the necessary credits to put people into employment. Every idle man and woman, every man and woman able and willing to work and who is denied an opportunity of working, is a national loss.  The idle man and woman must be fed, clothed and housed.  Because of their involuntary idleness they are being maintained at the expense of the community and denied an opportunity of contributing to the pool of wealth out of which the community must maintain them.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance said on one occasion that there was an abundance of money for every worthwhile scheme. <Col N="2453" /> I think that was a terse phrase on the part of the Minister.  He knows it has no relation to reality; money is available at 5 per cent. but not otherwise. Mention has been made of the fact that persons are employed on rotational schemes for four or five days a week. When you propose that these people should get six days; in other words, that they should do on the fifth and sixth days what they were doing on the first, second, third and fourth days, you are told they cannot be put to work on the fifth and sixth days because there is no money to keep them in employment.  The result is that these unfortunate victims of our present chaotic economic system are compelled to subsist on the fragmentary income they get from four days' work. They are denied an opportunity of getting full wages which would help to give them a better standard of living.</P>
    <P>The defence put up by the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary, and the Government generally, as regards rotational employment and their parsimonious attitude in respect of the expenditure of money on schemes of national utility, is that the cost is too high and money cannot be spared; but it seems to me that in the circumstances of to-day, and in our circumstances at any time, cost is a trifling matter if we can only produce goods against expenditure and if we can only ensure that these goods are efficiently produced and distributed.  I think that unless the Government recognises that the expenditure of money with which to put men and women into full employment represents the only real road to prosperity this nation will stagger on from one economic blizzard to another, and that the actual poverty endured by large sections of the people and the appallingly low standard of living of our people will become a permanent basis of economic servitude.</P>
    <P>The need for mobilising our resources in material wealth and man-power is greater to-day than it has been at any time before in our history. The events of the past fortnight have an ominous meaning for this nation, and we must realise that those threats <Col N="2454" /> of isolation that are now being made against us may assume very serious proportions.  They have yet to be implemented but, if they are implemented, then we must meet them with the characteristic courage of our people, and meet them in the spirit that difficulties are made in order to be surmounted.  While on this subject, perhaps I might take the opportunity of saying that the whole nation is behind the Government in the stand it has taken recently.  I, as a member of the Defence Conference, have had an opportunity of considering many aspects of our national defence, and I am breaking no confidence or giving away no secret when I say that in all the meetings of the Defence Conference the one impression made on me was the Government's scrupulous desire to maintain strictly the policy of neutrality, so far as our country was concerned, as between the different belligerents.</P>
    <P>Every possible precaution, every possible care, and the greatest prudence were exercised by the Government and by the members of all the Parties who constituted the Defence Conference, to ensure that there could be no reflection on our attitude concerning the preservation of our neutrality as between the different belligerents.  I think that an examination of the proceedings of the Defence Conference, and of the Government's handling of both national and international affairs, will show that there is no other country in the world which has maintained such a correct appreciation of what strict neutrality involves, and which acted with such commendable fairness towards the belligerents.  I think that it should also be said, not merely for the information of our own people, but for the information of the peoples of the world generally, that the reply sent by our Government to the various Notes was not the reply merely of the Fianna Fáil Party, but of our united nation&mdash;a nation which is striving, as it always has done, to maintain its rights and its own honourable way of life.  The reply issued by the Government to these Notes was a reply, not merely by the Party now in office but a reply reflecting the sentiments which every Irish man and Irish <Col N="2455" /> woman feels to-day.  Our stand in this matter has been dictated solely by Irish needs, and that standard also conforms to international law.</P>
    <P>We seek no domination over other lands or other countries.  We merely seek to preserve our rights and our neutrality, as other nations sought to preserve their neutrality until such aggression as is now threatened against us forced them into the war, but if there is still left any respect for peace-time international morality, then we have a right to expect that no aggression will be resorted to against us, and that no sanctions will be imposed upon us&mdash;and especially that no such demand should be made upon us by nations which profess to the rest of the world that they are liberty-loving nations.  If there are to be sanctions imposed upon us or aggression undertaken against us, they cannot be justified on any moral basis or by any reliance on international law. The imposition of sanctions, and the threat of aggression, can only be justified on the ground of the frenzied necessities of war, and let it be said that they cannot be justified on any other ground.</P>
    <P>In such times, vigilance must be the watch-word of our nation.  Nothing should be allowed to stand in the way of the preservation of our liberty and our national rights; and if, faced with the crisis with which we are faced to-day&mdash;a crisis which may be a continuing one, and which might lead to an eruption here&mdash;we fail to ensure that our people may be enabled to face the crisis that exists at present and the greater crisis that may yet be in store for us, and to enable them to preserve our liberty in the face of any difficulties which may manifest themselves, then posterity will pass judgment upon us, and rightly so, and I think that it will not be a judgment which will reflect much credit upon us.  If the emergency through which we are passing, and the crisis in which we are now to some extent involved, demonstrates one thing more than another, it is the necessity for national and economic awareness, and the real necessity for <Col N="2456" /> that awareness shows itself particularly in what might be described as &ldquo;the food front.&rdquo;  Food is our chief defence line.  It could be quite easily our weakest line of defence, but it ought to be our strongest line.  We have at our disposal 12,000,000 acres of arable land&mdash;arable land which is the envy of Europe.  The cultivation of 3,000,000 acres of that land would satisfy the demands of our people, and those who are responsible for the development of that land and for its administration must ensure that of those 12,000,000 acres not less than 3,000,000 acres will be used for production. In that connection, I may say that the greatest mistake that could be made in connection with this question of a possible food shortage is to haggle over the price that will be paid to the producers or the wages that will be paid to the workers.  I think it ought to be an easy matter to get the goodwill of the whole agricultural community: first, by giving the farmer a remunerative price for his crops, and, secondly, by ensuring that the agricultural labourer will be given a proper wage and a fair share of the produce of his labour.  That can be done, first, by giving the farmer a good price for his products, and, secondly, by insisting that the farmer will pay a reasonable wage to the agricultural labourer. Here, again, I should like to draw attention to the methods of our agricultural production.  What is the use of haggling about money or prices if our people are starving?  We are told about sterling assets, but what is the use of giving to Britain goods to the value of £2 if we are only getting £1 in return, and getting the remaining £1 in the shape of a credit note which may not be honoured on demand, while, at the same time, our people are unable to get food here?</P>
    <P>At present we are exporting to Britain twice as much as Britain is giving us, and, while some people seem to take a delight in what is described as a favourable balance of trade, I think we are doing to-day something which is simply economic daftness.  We have a relatively small productivity and we are exporting to Britain a very substantial portion of it. <Col N="2457" /> I do not say this in any spirit of hostility to Britain&mdash;the argument is the same if it were being sent to Germany or Russia.  Of the limited produce we have here, we are giving Britain a substantial portion and Britain is giving us back half the value of it and is chalking up in the Bank of England a credit which we know perfectly well we cannot use during this war, because Britain is taking most effective steps to freeze our external assets, and which, in the circumstances of the post-war period, we may not be able to use either.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy McGilligan was perfectly right when he pointed out yesterday that, in the post-war period, Britain will endeavour to pay her overseas debts in goods, and if her overseas debts are paid in goods to those who are her allies in this war, there may be very little goods available for us; but even if these goods were there, Britain is certainly not going to give us goods and take our sterling investments in lieu of them. If she gives us goods, it will probably be on a barter basis, on the basis that we send goods to Britain against the goods she sends us, and our sterling assets in the meantime will continue to be frozen.  I put it to the Government now that they ought to make a serious effort, by means of a long-term agricultural policy, to fix prices for agricultural produce for several years to come in order to let the farmer know what he may expect for many years ahead and to pay to the agricultural labourer a wage which will enable him to enjoy a decent standard of living and which will beget his goodwill and his enthusiasm for the essential task of producing the maximum quantity of food for the nation.</P>
    <P>If we can ensure for ourselves an abundance of food, if we can ensure that by paying the agricultural worker a decent wage and the farmer a decent price for his produce, then we are spending the money in the family, and, I never yet knew a family which became poor by distributing the family's assets amongst the various prudent members comprising the family.  We, apparently, are satisfied with a situation in which we irritate <Col N="2458" /> the farmer for months and months by haggling over prices and in which we keep the agricultural worker in a state of constant indignation by our failure to pay him a decent rate of wages, and, in circumstances like those, and being in the position of a beleaguered island, we expect to produce here the necessary food for the maintenance of our human and livestock population.</P>
    <P>Similarly in regard to fuel.  I have grave fears for the whole fuel position in the coming year.  I think it is known to everybody that timber is in pretty short supply.  It is extremely difficult to get timber now and I think the difficulties will intensify as the months pass.  Transport problems may intensify our turf problems because of the difficulty of getting turf transported from the turf to the non-turf areas, and, because the available labour power is not fully employed or thoroughly organised, I think our turf production this year will be found to be less than last year.  We continue, as Deputy Healy said, to indulge in the most wasteful of all luxuries: the carting of useless wet turf from faraway places to the City of Dublin and wasting the time of those who cut the turf, wasting the railway wagons, wasting the man-power employed, wasting petrol, wasting tyres and generally irritating everybody who has any association with the wet turf.  I think the Government ought to think, and to get somebody to help them in the thinking process, in respect of turf production.  It is the most criminal form of waste to send to the City of Dublin and other large centres of population a good deal of turf which I see on the roads and in railway trucks.  Some of it is light brown turf&mdash;yellow turf, they would call it in some areas because of its poor quality.</P>
    <P>It is not capable of standing up to the weather; it is not capable of giving a decent fire; and it is not capable of being stopped from going into mould.  The only thing it is capable of doing is wasting the time of people who have any association with it, taking up space and generally irritating the citizens on whom the thing is unfortunately passed off.  If we are to avoid what I think will be a very <Col N="2459" /> severe fuel shortage, and a particularly severe fuel shortage if there is a restriction on the export to this country of coal from Britain, we must make sure now, and not at the end of the turf-cutting season, that turf cutting will be made attractive to the producer. It is a well-known fact that the producer gets only a small percentage of the price at which turf is sold in the City of Dublin.  I should wager that turf is probably being produced at less than 24/- per ton, and in the City of Dublin the same turf costs 64/- a ton, plus a subsidy of about £1 8s. in order to enable it to be sold at that figure. What is wrong with the whole turf distribution scheme that turf, which is being produced at £1 4s. per ton, is being sold at 64/- per ton and then has to be subsidised to the extent of £1 8s. per ton in order to enable it to be sold at 64/- per ton?  If there is anything more daft than that I do not know what it is, but we sail on merrily, satisfied that that is the best that can be done and taking no steps whatever to remedy such a situation.</P>
    <P>If we are not to fall into the mistake of permitting a serious fuel shortage, which could conceivably cause considerable public disturbance, to arise, I think that at this stage turf cutting should be made attractive to every person capable of cutting turf, and it can be made attractive in one way, that is, by paying those who produce turf a decent family wage, and fortified then by the satisfaction that these persons are paid a decent family wage, we can appeal to their national pride and their sense of national preservation to win the maximum quantity of turf.  We can get turf produced in greater quantities in that way than by attempting to defend the present low rates of wages paid to the turf cutters, or by attempting to justify the outrageously high prices being charged for rubbishy turf in Dublin and many other cities and towns through the country.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the present emergency, and one which grows worse as time goes on, is the serious economic position of the workers.  The Minister <Col N="2460" /> for Finance told us, in 1939, I think, that the Government intended to set its face against the attempt of any one class to make profit out of the emergency; the clear implication of the speech he then made and amplified in the Budget statement the following year, was that if there was to be control of wages, a pegging down of wages on the one hand, there would be rigid control of prices on the other. Everybody now realises that his undertakings were wholly illusory as far as they represented Government policy or intent.  Prices have been allowed to rise so rapidly that many commodities are now out of the reach of ordinary working-class families.  Prices have been allowed to rocket skywards while the wages of the workers have been kept down to an inordinately low level.  The effect of the policy of permitting prices to rise, while keeping wages low, is that the pre-war £ is now only worth 9/- from the point of view of buying capacity.  When we talk of agricultural workers or road workers having a wage of £2 a week let us remember that wage in pre-war buying value represents only 18/-.  That situation is the inevitable outcome of the policy of permitting prices to rise while on the other hand keeping wages inordinately low.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister or the Government fully appreciate what a keen struggle ordinary working-class people have to live in the days through which we are passing or their herculean efforts to buy food, clothes and footwear.  Many families, even where the bread-winner is working, are unable to pay the current prices of articles of clothing and footwear.  I was speaking yesterday to a man with a wife and seven children.  One appreciates what the expenditure of that family on food and clothing must be. That man's wages were £3 2s. weekly and, when I met him, he was coming out of a shop where he had bought a pair of boots for a daughter aged 20. He had to pay 31/- for the boots out of his wages of £3 2s., and then provide food and clothing for a family of nine persons.  One has only to walk through the streets of this city and other towns to realise that there is, so <Col N="2461" /> far as exterior appearances go, a very notable debasement in the standard of living of the working class.</P>
    <P>In many cases their clothes are poor and tattered, while boots and shoes are bad.  Most appalling is the degrading spectacle of little children running around in their bare feet, or with some type of equipment for their feet, masquerading as boots and shoes. One has only to walk through the poor quarters to realise the amount of poverty and suffering that exists.  I am assured by social workers in the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul that even in the new areas of Crumlin, Kimmage and Drimnagh there is considerable privation and hardship because of the rising prices and of the low wages of the people living there.</P>
    <P>It is probably inevitable in a time of war, when sources of supply are cut off, or seriously restricted, that there will be some hardship, but the whole policy of the Government is, in my opinion, based upon a misconception of the value and purpose of money. The Government seems to be satisfied that the way to tide over this crisis is to debase the standard of living of the people, and that the country can be prosperous while the wages of workers are kept low.  I think that is economic heresy.  I do not think it could be justified.  I do not think there can be any sound economic justification for a policy which manifests itself in a constant lowering of the standard of living of the mass of the people.  While workers see their standard of living forced down, while it is harder than ever to buy the barest necessities of life, and while footwear and clothing are unpurchaseable by many families, on the other hand they see large industrialists able to gather in wealth, and able to make larger profits, even by handling a lesser quantity of goods. They also see that what these industrialists cannot distribute in the form of exorbitant profits, they can store away for use some other day.  I do not think anybody can pretend to be complacent about the standard of physical health of the nation to-day.  The great scourge of tuberculosis continues defiantly.  No effective steps have been taken to combat that disease in a <Col N="2462" /> manner which gives hope that its progress will be arrested at an early date. So long as the people are underfed, badly clad, and badly housed, as they are in the present emergency circumstances, it seems to me that we are simply embarking on a policy of aiding and abetting the development of T.B. by our inability to take effective steps to control its progress.</P>
    <P>Every county medical officer of health who has reported on the standard of health in the county which he administers has been compelled to call attention to the growth of malnutrition. Rickets continue to blight child life in this city as well as in other cities and towns.  From my knowledge of conditions in Dublin and of towns in my constituency I believe that if there was a close investigation of living conditions of a large section of the working-class people, a state of affairs would be revealed which would shock our sense of complacency to-day. Reports made from time to time by medical officers interested in social work reveal a deplorably low standard of health amongst young children who will be the citizens of to-morrow.  Apparently we are content with a situation when, even in the early days of their lives, the physique of these children is being blighted by malnutrition and poverty associated with low wages or no wages.  If we are going to permit that condition of affairs to develop, the future Irish nation will pay a very heavy price for our incompetence and our legislative laziness.  Reflecting on these things one is tempted to ask: Why should all this be allowed to happen?  Why should we compel our people to tolerate a low standard of living?  Why should we permit poverty, malnutrition and various other diseases which have an economic origin to inflict such privation on our people?  Why should we tolerate such a state of affairs when we have the capacity to alter it?  If they were the consequence of invasion one could understand them flowing from invasion. Why do we deliberately set out to inflict such hardship and suffering on our people?  It may be quite useless to do it in present circumstances, but I want to make a plea for a new, a Christian conception of life in this <Col N="2463" /> country towards the mass of our people, for a conception of life which will do some honour to our Christian past.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Government that this crisis may well provide the opportunity of abandoning the pagan economic philosophies to which we have been anchored too long.  I want to plead for a state of society and a condition of life, in which the State, acting for the community, will guarantee to every citizen who serves the nation a full and decent life for the service which he renders.  I want the State to say to each and every citizen who serves the nation that he will be entitled, as part of the State's recognition of his service, to a share in the national heritage of public well-being.  I want the State to say to the citizen that, in his daily life, in his service on behalf of the nation, the State will stand behind him, guaranteeing him decent wages and regular employment, and guaranteeing to him that, in want and poverty, in sickness and adversity, it will help him and befriend him.  I make the plea that, in old age, a grateful nation will insulate the aged citizen from the shocks to which, unfortunately, old age accompanied by poverty exposes him to-day.</P>
    <P>It seems to me to be a challenge to our statesmanship and to our capacity that we live in an age which has given us the most fiendishly efficient instruments of death and destruction, and the genius, the capacity and the so-called statesmanship which can give us those fiendishly efficient instruments of destruction but which cannot give the ordinary, simple, honest-to-God citizen a life which will ensure him three meals per day.  That is a challenge to our capacity and a challenge to our statesmanship, but it is even more&mdash;it is a challenge to whether we have any real Christian philosophy within us at all. I refuse to believe, so far as this country is concerned, that the emigrant ship, the labour exchange and the workhouse, are the natural destinies of our Irish men and women.  I think it is nothing short of a mockery of our Constitution that these evils should still haunt tens of thousands of our <Col N="2464" /> Irish men and women, in this fertile land of ours.</P>
    <P>This crisis could be a valuable crisis to us, if it shakes us into a sense of human values and away from philosophies that have given us such evils as poverty, malnutrition and want, and if it teaches us that men and women are the most cherished assets which this or any other nation could have.  I suggest to the Government, in the fifth year of the war&mdash;and I have submitted the same plea on every previous year of the war&mdash;that it should take stock, that it should realise the tendencies which are current to-day, that it should weigh and appraise the economic hardships and the social miseries which abound in this country to-day.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Linehan has rightly said &mdash;I think he speaks not merely for his own Party but for every good citizen &mdash;there is an abundance of co-operation available in the economic field.  I suggest to the Government that, in the course of its stocktaking, it should make up its mind to seek and to utilise the abundance of goodwill which is there available, in all Parties, for a mass attack on the social evils which confront our people to-day.  I believe that the utilisation of that goodwill, properly directed, is capable of safeguarding our people from very many of the evils which, unfortunately, press so heavily on them to-day.  I believe that goodwill, properly organised and properly directed, could avert what I fear will be still greater evils; and I believe that the implementation of a policy of national goodwill in the realm of our economic activities would enable our people to see a bright horizon, holding out the hope of a decent life.  It might do something more: it might result in an abandonment of that bleakness and drabness which, unfortunately, surrounds the lives of tens of thousands of our people to-day.</P>

      <P>Last night, Deputy Fionán Lynch recited a litany of commodities which have increased in price in the past four years.  It struck me that it would have been much easier for him to look for a commodity <Col N="2465" /> which has not increased in price in the last four years.  I do not believe he or anyone else would find one such commodity which is in general use and which has not been increased in price in the last four years.  That is the result of the complete failure of the Government to control prices. Much has been said about that in the past two days and on many previous occasions, and that complete failure cannot be denied.  Coupled with the keeping down of wages, it has resulted in great hardship and privation to the workers.</P>
      <P>The few shillings increase permitted in wages&mdash;after elaborate and costly Wages Tribunal procedure&mdash;is worth very little to a worker.  I think 11/- is the maximum increase at present, while the cost of living for the average man has not gone up by a penny less than £2 per week since 1939.  For the lucky few who have got the increase, it is not nearly enough; but what of those large sections who have not got any increase whatsoever?  Many are on small incomes and have not been able to get emergency bonuses or increases in wages, because they have not been organised.  Others who are organised are still numerically too weak to let their voices be heard above the clamour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spoke in similar strains here a few months ago, on the Estimate for the Taoiseach's Department.  I quoted one example which I had in mind, and I make no apology for putting forward the very same case again, as it is a terrible scandal.  On the Royal Canal we have, employed by the infamous Great Southern Railways, 17 lock-keepers, full-time workers, whose total wage packet is £28 11s.  I have the Christian names and surnames of those 17 men before me now, setting out which locks they control and the exact amount of money each receives.  One man is getting £1 1s. 9d.; another is getting £1 3s. 9d.  I am glad Deputy Carter is here, because on this list is Thomas Rogers, of whom he spoke about a fortnight ago.  He is down as receiving £1 9s. 9d. for controlling four locks.  That man has a family of nine and I do not suppose he will have any <Col N="2466" /> objection to my mentioning that I heard that a charity dance had to be run recently to raise money to help him and his wife and nine children.</P>

      <P>This has reference to the cost of living, which has gone up terribly, while these men have not received one penny increase. Before the stand-still Order was brought in their wages were ridiculously inadequate&mdash;£28 11s. 0d. between them, or an average of £1 13s. 7d.  That is a crying shame.  This great company, the Great Southern Railway Company, which talks in millions of pounds and whose passenger receipts alone run into tens of thousands of pounds, has refused to grant a penny increase to these men and their wives and starving families.  When I brought up this matter in November last, the Taoiseach on that occasion made a long speech in reply to the debate on his Estimate.  Here is part of what he said&mdash;I am quoting from Volume 91, column 2629, of the Official Reports of 19th November, 1943:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We first began with those at the level which could not afford to be further depressed.  We said there was a certain level.  There may be a difference of opinion between us as to the level we should try to draw. There were certain people, anyhow, at such a low level that if you depressed it any more the hardship was going to be excessive.  We tried to rule these out and allow them to negotiate with their employers, or otherwise, so that they might raise themselves up to that particular level.  At a later stage we felt that the level was somewhat low and we raised it.  A certain system was arrived at by which adjustments could be made by going before a tribunal.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government allowed men like these lock-keepers to negotiate with their employers.  I suggest that that is not good enough and that in cases like these there should be some form of compulsion on the employers to pay a <Col N="2467" /> decent living wage.  The Taoiseach, on a famous occasion, spoke about the possibility of having to go outside the system if the system did not operate to give a measure of frugal comfort to everybody.  I seriously suggest to the Minister for Finance, as I suggested on the former occasion to the Taoiseach, that cases like these, of which there are thousands, should make the Government think once more about changing radically the present wage system.</P>

      <P>Times are certainly changed when, on the occasion of the Book of Estimates being presented to us, we find that there is hardly one to criticise the increase in the Estimates. That does not look well for the Farmers' Party who came in here with the blare of trumpets to see that things would be cut down drastically.  I hold that if there were any honesty in this House or in the country, the Estimates could be drastically reduced.  There are too many doles and sops being given to people who are giving no return for them to the country.  I listened to Deputy Norton talking about what could be done in this country and more or less suggesting that we could have a heaven upon earth here. I think he will realise that he is far from seeing that being attained either by his Party or the Government.  It is easy to talk in terms like that.  But, when you find sops being doled out for ten years to hold the people in political subjection, it is difficult to see that in this State business methods will be the order of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The harder a man works here the less he is appreciated.  The waster, the chancer, those who can get money easily are considered to be the best men in the country.  Hard work is not appreciated and the dry rot will continue until honesty comes back.  Although I dread this crisis coming upon the people when they are not prepared for it, I hope the crisis will make people realise where they stand.  There is too much drifting in this country. Nobody seems to care what will happen to us.  That applies to everybody from the Government down.  Pandering to popular clamour has caused these Estimates to be swollen as they are.  I <Col N="2468" /> think it is time that stopped and the Government should give a headline to the country.  The Minister can smile, because he can say:&mdash;&ldquo;I have you all tied up with the family allowances scheme.  You shouted for that and I gave it to you.  I told you that if I heard you whining within the next few months, I would let you know about it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The chief cause for the national and economic decline for the last 10 or 15 years is because we are not getting a proper output from the people working on the land or from the people who are working in industry or on the bogs or anywhere else.  There is no question about that, but it has not been touched upon.  As a farmer, working amongst farmers, I can say that if our land were worked as it should be&mdash;I know that there are certain circumstances which keep people from doing that at the present time&mdash;one acre would be as good as three acres are now.  We are not getting the proper output from the land.  In my county I have seen thousands of acres of wheat wasting and rotting because nobody could be got to harvest it at the proper time, or no machinery to thresh it; it was left there to rot and to be eaten by rats and crows.  That is a terrible state of affairs at a time when we cannot afford to lose one barrel of wheat or oats or barley.</P>
    <P>Taking agriculture in general, I am not one of those who are always whining about the farmers and arguing that they are always down and out. I am satisfied that the farmers themselves do not want that sort of whining at all.  Most farmers, at the present time, are doing reasonably well.  They are getting fair prices for their sheep and cattle and for oats and barley.  On the whole they are doing well, and some of them, a great many, are able to pay off old debts which accrued during the economic war.  These farmers are not whining. What they do complain about is that the Government do not appreciate their position.</P>
    <P>The first thing the Government should look after is the problem of finance.  Numbers of farmers around my county with holdings varying from <Col N="2469" /> 30 to 50 acres had not the wherewithal to buy a horse or a plough, or two horses as the case might be, at the outbreak of the emergency.  The Government should have stepped in then to see that the farmers got the money to provide these things so that they would not have to depend on their neighbours to do their ploughing and sowing for them, often incurring a delay of three to five weeks in getting in their crops and a similar delay at harvest time.  The failure of the Government to provide money for these farmers was a severe set-back to agricultural development.</P>
    <P>As regards wheat-growing, while I say that it is necessary to produce wheat, I hold without fear of contradiction that it is not a paying proposition for any man, although I know we must grow the wheat.  Farmers are prepared to lose on the wheat because there is a chance of recovering their loss on cattle or on oats.  The price of wheat is disgracefully low.  You cannot expect a farmer to produce it when oats gives him such a good profit.  After growing wheat for two or three years, he will get a yield of only four or five barrels per acre, while on the same land he might get 15 to 20 barrels of oats and that is a vast difference.  You can see the profit that oats will give you.  The price of wheat should be far in advance of oats or barley or any other crop. There should be a definite encouragement to farmers to grow wheat although they know it is always a hard crop and one that gives a poor return.</P>
    <P>In my view, the farmer should have at least £4 a barrel for his wheat and no nonsense about it, because he has generally to grow it on the same land for two or three years in succession and very often cannot get the right seed to put in.  Very often the seed is rubbishy and weedy and hardly fit for pigs.  Then there is the lack of machinery.  I believe the Government could have got ample machinery four or five years ago.  When the emergency began there was no reason why they did not spend £1,000,000 on machinery. My own county is not a tillage county, but to-day you find men with 150 acres of tillage in it and they are seriously <Col N="2470" /> handicapped by not having proper equipment.  They are often months behind time in trying to turn up the land, and have often to wait for six weeks in the hope that a tractor will come along.  There is no reason why the Government should not have come to the rescue in time.  In my own area last week I saw a man who had a very fine-looking rick of wheat.  He expected to get up to 130 barrels from that rick and he had it well secured for the winter.</P>
    <P>After telling many of his neighbours, progressive farmers, not to buy seed wheat because he would have it, he threshed the rick.  They were waiting for him to thresh it and what was the result?  All he got out of that huge rick of wheat was 32 barrels, and the farmers depending on him have now to rush to the seed firms and the Government. All they can get is the new Manitoba wheat from Canada, which will yield only four barrels to the acre. I asked what was the cause of the rick turning out so badly as it did and was told that the grain was not reaped in time and that at least four barrels to the acre had been lost in the field before the crop was ricked.  The cause of that was that there were neither men nor machines to help that farmer. It is all very well talking about production. What is the use of production if you cannot reap and harvest the crop in time?  One acre properly done will yield as much as three acres badly done.</P>
    <P>Of course, a great many Deputies are talking about the social services. We all agree that the lower-paid people in this country and those living on home help are in a desperate plight. It is on their shoulders that this burden is bearing so heavily.  I have no respect for the higher paid man, or even for the farmer, but I would ask the Government to do something to help the people who have to live on 25/- a week.</P>
    <P>People who are on home help are in a desperate plight, and were it not for the charity of their neighbours, they might be found dead in their own homes.  I would ask the Government, for God's sake, to do something for these people who are in misery, the people who are crushed down by the <Col N="2471" /> burden of the emergency.  I do not care where the money comes from, but let us get them help immediately.</P>
    <P>I feel that we are not getting the required output in turf production. Take the case in my own county.  We have a vast scheme under the county council and thousands of men are on the bogs.  Beside those workers, we have a private concern headed by an energetic man who worked his way from the bottom to the top, and he is able to turn three sods for every one sod turned by the employees of the county council.  Why is that?  My idea is that the men employed by the county council have not the initiative to work because the wage rates are so small. I would prefer to see more private enterprise.  Under the present arrangement we are not getting an adequate return from the county council scheme, and it is just a waste of money.  What the hell do people care when they are working under a ganger, a hundred of them, perhaps? If he says anything to them they will tell him to go to hell.</P>

      <P>My belief is that we need more private enterprise on the bog.  If a private individual on the bog can make a profit, surely the county council officials should make a better job of it?  There is far too much waste and we have to pay through the nose for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hold that it is nearly a criminal offence to give the dole in the agricultural parts of the country.  The men who are looking for the dole should be made to toe the line.  Many of them are continually on the dole while at the same time other poor devils are up to their necks in work.  Another scandal which should be tackled is that of the black market.  In my own county there is a black market in what might be called the necessaries of life.  You have only to go to the village and pay the price if you want tea or sugar or tobacco.  I blame the Government for that.  The Border was not responsible for the growth of the <Col N="2472" /> black market.  The commodities are coming down from the shops of Dublin and the Government should be alive to the situation.  Tea costs as much as 6d., 7d. 8d. or 10d. an ounce in the black market and people pay it just to have the tea.  Half their wages goes in buying what they call necessaries. Every effort should be made to discourage the black market and the Government should take steps to conduct a thorough search of the wholesale houses to ascertain what they have in their stores.  These houses are doing away with the trade of the country shopkeeper at the expense of the small wage-earner in this country.  It is really a disgrace.</P>
    <P>This State is very poorly organised from the point of view of finance and man-power at the present time.  There is work for every man if we mobilise finance.  We should find work for them and not send them away from what is called the land of the free, to work in another country.  We were told years ago that under a policy of self-sufficiency, we could build a tariff wall around the country and that we could live comfortably on our own resources.  Now when a crisis comes upon us, we find that we would not last for seven days either as regards food supplies or the supplies of any other commodity.  I blame the Government for that.  They were always telling the people what a great country we had.  Here we are now in the teeth of a crisis with neither leadership, initiative nor anything to encourage us, with everybody going his own way, everyone trying to &ldquo;best&rdquo; his neighbour and no one trying to work honestly.  We are told that we could run the country on its own resources but that now we are likely to flop at the first fence.  I know that the majority of the people themselves are to blame.  It asked for this Government and it got it and we now see the result in a ruined nation.</P>

      <P>I rise to join in this debate because I think it is essential that some Deputy from Kerry should give expression to the views of the people of that constituency on the present situation.  We have listened all through to-day, and for the greater part of yesterday, to Deputies contributing to this debate on the increase in the cost of living.  We all know thoroughly well that the cost of living has risen steeply during the past couple of years.  We know, for instance, that a man would have to pay 34/- to-day to purchase the same quantity of goods he could have purchased for £1 in 1939. In such circumstances we can realise the plight of old age pensioners, widows and orphans, those drawing unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit, and those who have, unfortunately, to depend on national health insurance benefits.  It is all right for us who are drawing fairly good salaries to stand up here and see things in a pleasant light.  We are able to meet the increase in the cost of living but we ought to remember that the poor people I have mentioned are suffering severely under the system that has prevailed in this country for the last 22 years.  Recently, as a result of the pressure by Deputies of various Parties, the Government decided to increase the old age pension by some few shillings a week, but I believe that the system known as the food voucher system is not being properly administered.  I believe that if we are to increase the pensions and the assistance we pay to these old people we must give that increase by way of cash.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been approached in my own native town by men working on relief schemes.  These men worked for four or five days this year, but last year they were getting six days a week.  A man having 31/6 last year&mdash;that is the value of unemployment assistance and food voucher, combined&mdash;was entitled to six days' work, but through some regulation of the Department, that was increased this year to 32/-.  Therefore, for the matter of 6d. no man in <Col N="2475" /> my town is entitled to six days' work in a week.  I believe that if we cannot give our people full employment on those schemes, we should not ask them to work four or five days, because the wages we are paying them are only something like 3/- or 4/- more than they would get while they are drawing unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I should like to call attention.  When striking a rate in 1943, in the Kerry County Council we provided in our estimates for a bonus of 5/- for all clerks employed at £3 a week and under.  That was sent up to the Department of Local Government, but the Minister, although the money was provided by the ratepayers, would sanction the bonus of 5/- only for married men and fixed a rate of 3/6 for single men and women.  That was not made known to these employees until some time last October, and each of the employees who was held by the Minister to be entitled only to 3/6 per week, was being paid by the county manager at the rate of 5/-.  They were then compelled to refund 1/6 a week back to the first of April from some time in October.  That is what is happening in the country to-day.  We are asked to vote a sum of over £50,000,000 to run the country for the next 12 months.  Who is going to get the increases provided for in these Estimates? Is it the men drawing big salaries in the State to-day?  I believe that if we are giving increases we should give them to those in need of them, people in receipt of small incomes, people drawing old age pensions, unemployment assistance, and widows' and orphans' pensions.  They are the people who are most in need and it is up to any Government: Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil, Clann na Talmhan or Labour, to look after these people and to see that they have a proper existence. I heard a number of Deputies to-day commenting on the existence of a black market in this country.  I believe myself there is only one way of stamping out the black market in this country.  I was only a very small boy when I heard people boast of the police force we had at one time&mdash;a force that <Col N="2476" /> stopped corruption and blackguardism. They were known as the Republican police force.  If we want to stamp out the black market, the only way we can do it is to intern every man who is black-marketing.  We have good Irishmen interned to-day with less cause. Because they are out for one principle, they are interned.  I believe that if those men were released and if the internment camps were filled with those who are making a large profit at the expense of the poor, working-class people, we would be taking the right course to stop black-marketing.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Linehan speaking on the flight from the land.  If we are to stop the flight from the land, there must be a national drive for housing.  In my county, there was a large number of evictions of cottiers during the past few months for nonpayment of rent, and there were numerous applications for each of those houses.  That will show Deputies that there is a shortage of houses both in urban and in rural districts.  We cannot blame men for leaving the land under present conditions.  If we are to detain them on the land, whatever Government is in power will have to build houses throughout the country and entice them to settle down there. I have seen good, honest farm labourers, who were attached to the land, move into towns and cities. When they got married, they had to get accommodation and they rented a room for 8/- or 10/-.  After experience of town life, they did not want to go back to the land and they would not have the houses on the land if they went back.  If we have a national drive for housing, especially in rural Ireland, we shall have plenty of workers to produce the food the people will want during this emergency, and for years after the emergency.</P>
    <P>Some people say that there is no poverty.  When I commented on the number of demands for home assistance and such things, I was told by a prominent Fianna Fáil member of Tralee Urban Council that there was no poverty or starvation in our town or in any part of the country.  In Tralee town, through the efforts of a very efficient organisation, known as <Col N="2477" /> the St. Vincent de Paul Society, we have established what are known as penny dinners during the past three weeks.  About 300 dinners a day are being served to the poor, distressed people of my town.  That is an answer to the member of Tralee Urban Council who had the effrontery to stand up and tell the people in the chamber, and the public of Tralee, that there was no starvation or want there. Now, I go back to the road workers of the County Kerry.  They have the same wages to-day as they had in 1939, although the council some time ago passed an increase of 6/-, by way of bonus, to all these workers.  I believe that that is being communicated to the Minister for Local Government for sanction.  I hope that, when it comes before him, he will take into consideration the high cost of living and sanction this increase to the road workers of my county.</P>
    <P>We heard a lot to-day about the standstill Order.  In towns in which the population does not exceed 2,000, an employer, whether willing or not, cannot exceed the agricultural rate payable in the area.  I had the privilege and pleasure of negotiating with some of the employers in small towns in my county and they told me that they would be willing to grant an increase to the workers, believing they were entitled to it, but they were bound by the standstill Order which is being enforced by the Fianna Fáil Government and could not increase the wages beyond 39/-.  I believe that this stand-still Order is obnoxious and unfair.  It is creating a great hardship, particularly in the case of lowly-paid workers. There should be some amendment introduced whereby an employer willing to grant an increase would be permitted to do so.  The limit could be prescribed.  There is one section of workers who have not been, so far, referred to in this House.  They are auxiliary postmen in rural districts who are paid only from 25/- to 28/- per week.</P>

      <P>Very well.  In our county, eight employees are drawing about £5,500, plus travelling expenses, between them.  On the other hand, we have 33 clerks drawing £3,300 between them.  Some of these are the clerks I referred to at the outset.  When granted an increase of 5/- per week, to which they were entitled, by Kerry County Council, the Department of Local Government would not sanction it.  That system is all wrong and should be completely changed if we are to advance.  We, as Deputies, should be ashamed of ourselves.  We come in here and draw fat salaries.  Ministers draw much better salaries.  If we are to carry on and draw our salaries while our people exist in poverty and starvation, all I say is that we should be ashamed of ourselves.</P>

      <P>Permit me to compliment Deputy Spring on the fine nature of his maiden speech.</P>
      <P>I think he represents a new force coming into the Dáil, breathing the freshness, the courage and vitality of the rural workers.  I think that we are indebted to him for his contribution to this debate.  It certainly lent an air of reality to the proceedings which at times has been sadly lacking.  In fact, for the first portion of his address I was rather struck with that very air of unreality which was the keynote of our proceedings.  It appeared to me as if the House were about to discuss this Vote on Account as an abstract thing, divorced from the very critical times and situation in which we now find ourselves.  I am glad to say that later in the debate, after we had passed through the formal theoretical period of it and indulged in some humorous speeches, that we had injected into it a note of harsh reality which it is the duty of all the Deputies here to bear in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Liam Cosgrave was the first who did relate this Vote on Account to the present serious situation.  There is no other course: there is no other realism.  It cannot be discussed in abstract terms, and for that we are indebted to him.  He took occasion, of course, to characterise the Labour <Col N="2479" /> Party as the left wing of Fianna Fáil. It may be satisfactory to him to have found the relationship between the Labour Party and the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;though we do not accept such a characterisation&mdash;yet, if he remembered, in the past some of the critics of the Labour Party used to tell us that we were the left wing of Fine Gael.  Now that we are considered to be the left wing of Fianna Fáil, maybe that is an advance from the point of view of national progress.  I thought at the beginning of the proceedings of this House that it was the opinion of Fine Gael that the Farmers' Party, or Clann na Talmhan, were aspiring to that position.  It appears now that we have usurped their place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>When Deputy Cosgrave has some experience of being in a left wing Party he will know that left wing Parties get all the hard knocks and all the ha'pence.  I do not know whether he intended by that criticism of the Labour Party to show that we were to the left thinking on any specific policy, or whether we were bound by that very policy.  I can assure Deputy Cosgrave that the Labour Party has an independent line of economic thinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It takes some time, perhaps, for this to become plain to people, but plain it does become as time goes on.  I think, that, on these economic questions in particular, such as we have to face on this Vote on Account, the difference between the Labour Party and the Fianna Fáil is quite distinct.  Deputy Norton, when he was speaking, did quite a service to the country in showing how, when relating our present problems to the question of this Vote on Account, it may be unreal to talk about the disbursement of the £50,000,000 that is required&mdash;unless we consider the possibility of ever raising that amount&mdash;if our economy is going through a crisis and if we are going to face an emergency within an emergency.  Unless emergency measures of a different type and order <Col N="2480" /> to those previously adopted are taken now, it will be quite a question as to whether we can maintain national government on the basis and to the extent which is foreshadowed in this Vote on Account.  It may be that some would wish isolation upon us, but we cannot be divorced from current European history or current European economy, and it is only with this as a background that we can properly discuss the subjects to be considered under this Vote on Account: fuel, food production and the cost of living.  These will become, as time goes on, of ever greater importance and all the subsidiary questions which have engaged our attention here in the Dáil will, I think, fade into the background when we come up against the stark realities of these things and what they really mean.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Norton said, this Vote on Account shows a desire on the part of the State to collect £50,000,000 out of the pockets of the taxpayers, with an additional £7,000,000 in local taxation.  The enormity of the sacrifice demanded of the people in order to carry on the functions of government&mdash;the good functions as well as the bad functions&mdash;can only be properly appreciated when it is related to the national income of the people.  Now, as everyone knows, the figures for our national income are very difficult to assess accurately, but for many years it has been taken by most economists that our national income ranges in the order of £150,000,000: in the order of £1 per week per head of the population working, not working, dependent and independent. There have been attempts made to estimate what it would be at the present time with the inflationary tendency that is observable in Irish economics.  It has been variously estimated, according as we value the £, but it certainly could not be considered at the present day to be much higher than £200,000,000.  It may be £175,000,000.  It is not very important, because the rise in the national income is due mainly to fluctuations in money values and does not represent, I think, any real increase in the national income.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2481" /> The importance of agriculture has been often stressed here.  We could not expect that there would be any real increase in our national income when we consider that the volume of agricultural output, taking 1929-30 as the basis, at 100, was rated at 89 in 1942-43, and that the total volume declined by 7.7 per cent. in 1942-43 compared with the previous year.  If there is a shrinkage in that large sphere of our economy, it is very unlikely that there would be any real increase in the national income.  Our national income is undoubtedly low and it is on that account that the burden to be imposed upon the citizenry of the State appears so heavy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bennett and others have asserted that we have reached the ceiling as regards social services.  They have expressed their view that we could not afford any further development of our social services, but the real point of the matter is that, though the taxes are admittedly high in comparison with our present national income, they are not high in relation to taxes in other countries where the national income is higher.  New Zealand was instanced as a country which had a national income much higher than Ireland's and, as I said before, I think we will hear a great deal more about New Zealand as time goes on. New Zealand has the highest national income in the world, according to some economists.  It has been rated as high as £180 per head of the population, considerably more than three times our national income per head of the population.  It is quite obvious, therefore, that if we could raise the standard of productivity in this country and thereby raise the national income, the burden of taxation would not be so onerous as it would appear to be at present.  To translate it into ordinary figures, at the present time, out of every £3 of income, the State proposes to take £1 but, if we were able to increase that income, perhaps not exactly by three times, which would bring it up to the New Zealand figure, but by some other proportion, we would relatively reduce the proportion taken from the national income to pay for social services and for functions of Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2482" /> Instead of its being 33? per cent. of the national income, by increasing productivity&mdash;and there is every possibility of doing so&mdash;it could be reduced to 20 per cent., 15 per cent. and, perhaps, to 12½ per cent., according to the degree to which we increase productivity. Productivity must be developed, particularly in regard to foodstuffs, fuel and essentials of life.</P>
    <P>We must have a national policy, particularly in this crisis, which will enable us to increase productivity.  It may be said by the pessimists that, cut off from the world, without outside sources of supply, without the possibility of receiving what we should normally get from other countries, this is not a time to change our policy, this is not a time to tinker with economics.  Certainly, it is not a time to tinker with economics, but it is a time to make a drastic change.  It is a time to revalue things in the light of a new world, a world which may at the beginning be adverse in its relations with us.  These things, it appears to me, can be done.  They can be done by industrial and agricultural reorganisation.  They can be done by gearing up the community to a higher level than has ever been thought possible in this country.  It does not matter that this country is an old country with hundreds of years of tradition. It does not matter that we have settled ways of life and that we are conservative by nature.  If the crisis demands it, if we are faced with no way to live other than by changing our economy, then change that economy we must, in order to survive.  That is where the Labour Party differ fundamentally from the Fianna Fáil Party, whether we are the left wing of it or not.  We see, and are prepared to advocate, that fundamental changes should be made in order to preserve our nationhood, our State and the lives and well-being of the common people of the country.</P>
    <P>If the change is not easy in a crisis, experience of history tells us that it will come violently.  If you want it to come smoothly, if you want to reorganise your economy and your production, if you want to take measures to face a situation such as we have never faced before, one of the best <Col N="2483" /> ways of doing it and one of the ways that causes the least trouble in transition is undoubtedly by using finance as an instrument in making the change.</P>
    <P>I had occasion once before to differentiate between national financial policy in this country and the national financial policy in New Zealand and the Minister for Industry and Commerce characterised my statement at that time as nonsense.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Deputy Connolly,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;was talking nonsense when he said that the fact that social services operating in New Zealand are more attractive than those prevailing here is not due to a higher output per head or a greater national income or to any other material cause, but due solely to the fact that the Labour Government in New Zealand have got views about finance which are in our view unorthodox.  This is nonsense.  So far as I know, the views of the New Zealand Government in relation to finance are not different from ours.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I propose now to show very simply and very briefly that the views of the New Zealand Labour Government are far different from ours.  Actually, of course, the Minister in that case was not dealing fairly with the argument that was put up because I had shown, and I think it cannot be refuted, that the high level of social services in New Zealand had not been achieved until they had instituted a period of full employment, and that the question of full employment was linked up with the increase in the level of productivity, adequate wages, distribution of the extra volume of wealth and consequent easing of the burden of taxation, and that these things had to be linked to the question of finance.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that we had much the same financial view as that held by the Labour Government in New Zealand.  But he must have forgotten all about the Central Bank Act, and he must have forgotten all about the Currency Act.  In the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (Amendment) Act of 1936 the general functions of the Reserve <Col N="2484" /> Bank are set forth in the following words:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It shall be the general function of the Reserve Bank within the limits of its powers to give effect to the monetary policy of the Government as communicated to it from time to time by the Minister of Finance.  For this purpose and to the end that the economic and social welfare of New Zealand may be promoted and maintained the bank shall regulate and control credit and currency in New Zealand, the transfer of moneys to and from New Zealand and the disposal of moneys that are derived from the sale of any New Zealand products and for the time being are held overseas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is fundamentally different from the functions of our Central Bank Act. I do not need to go into that; it has been dealt with very fully in this House.  But, in contradistinction to the powers held by the Reserve Bank there, the function of the Central Bank Act here, I think, is more or less to maintain our parity with sterling. Deputy Norton dealt so fully with that aspect, there is no need to pursue it to show that we have tied up our economic life to the economic life of Great Britain, that we will rise if it rises and that we will fall if it falls.</P>
    <P>Whether the isolationism that is wished upon us will have any effect upon our financial relations remains to be seen, but the present crisis rightly shows how parlous is the condition of any country, particularly a small country, which ties up its financial destinies to those of a great Power which, in the natural course of its State policy, may have to infringe upon the powers of the small country; may have to take action against its economy, its very national life.  I am not suggesting that in this crisis we would need to go even as far as they have gone in New Zealand in order to achieve a financial and economic transformation.  I think it is quite possible, in the situation in which we find ourselves and with the economic traditions we have in this country, to leave the commercial banks to their own commercial <Col N="2485" /> functions.  It is not our intention to, and we do not advocate, as far as the Labour Party is concerned, any repudiation or expropriation in relation to the banks, but we do say: &ldquo;If you want to organise the economy of the country, if you want to make a reality out of the campaign to raise foodstuffs for our people during the coming crisis, if you want to organise fuel economy and organise the nation as it should be organised to meet the crisis, you will have to make finance here an instrument of the people's will and not allow finance to be an instrument for imposing the bankers' will upon the people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the extent of the unorthodoxy of the Labour Party in regard to finance.  We have complained again and again of the fact that, instead of having a planned economy such as we advocate, a policy of full employment which would enable us to raise the level of productivity, provide more food, provide better social services, we have not any considered policy on the part of Fianna Fáil.  The Government do the best they can from day to day, month to month, or even year to year, but they have no long-term policy.  They have been in office a sufficiently long time to show whether there is a long-term policy.  We still spend something like £7,000,000 on certain services which are related to the existence of poverty in one form or another in this country.  As I stated in another debate, the amount might be £9,000,000, if you take certain services into consideration.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, if we had a planned economy for the period during which Fianna Fáil has been in office, we could have taken, as they have taken in other countries, steps to eliminate unemployment as the source of all the poverty that exists, and we would be able to do without these social services on the scale so bitterly complained of by Deputy Bennett and others of his Party.  It is not to be taken that the Labour Party are against these social services.  These social services are absolutely necessary in the present state of the country. I stated that the money can be <Col N="2486" /> found, and that it is possible to have better social services, if they are required, by eliminating unemployment and the conditions that flow from it. It is quite easy to see that, even without any great increase in productivity &mdash;and there must be an increase in productivity when you put an extra 70,000 men to work&mdash;you will have that money available to reduce the taxation in other spheres and the burden will be less heavy.  You will have it both ways, by increasing the national income and decreasing what will become unnecessary social services, such as the odd million that you expend on unemployment assistance and insurance.</P>
    <P>The policy that we advocate in order to raise the productivity which would be related to a financial reorganisation would do away with many of the causes of widespread distress.  It would also affect favourably the level of wages and it would reduce the cost of living.  All these things are related and in any country such as this, where you have a large mass of unemployment, I think that, with the best wish in the world, a Government which works within the confines of the present system would be bound to have a rise in the cost of living, bound to have unsatisfactory wage rates and wage scales, and bound to have the economic chaos that presents itself to us to-day.  We can contrast the wage rates in this country&mdash;very unfavourably contrast them&mdash;with those in England.</P>
    <P>There are some very startling figures, if we were to go into them, all of which show what can be done in a country where full employment is forced upon the people, or upon the State, as a result of the necessity of war.  We want to force a policy of full employment as a policy of peace, but in England, which is an example that we might take, we read, in the <i>Financial Times</i> of the 7th March of this year, that there was a general rise in wages of no less than 76 per cent., during the five years from October, 1938, to October, 1943, and that the effect of this rise in wages was only to reduce the purchasing power of the £ by 4/-, whereas in this country, where we have no policy of full employment, <Col N="2487" /> the purchasing power of the £ has fallen by 7/6, while wages, we are informed, have increased by only 3/- to the £ in this country, that the purchasing power has fallen by more than double the rise in the rate of wages generally.</P>
    <P>Now, in reference to the cost of living, I think that nothing is so instructive, or that nothing drives the argument home so well, as to consider a group of figures which appeared in <i>The Economist</i> of the 11th March, and I think that it would be well for every Deputy in this House to study those figures.  These are the cost-of-living index figures for three countries: our own country, Éire, our next-door neighbour, Great Britain, and New Zealand&mdash;a country which is administered by a Labour Government with a policy of full employment and with financial concepts very different from our own.  Here are the startling figures.  If we take it that in August, 1929, the base with regard to the three countries concerned, was 100; in September, 1939, on the outbreak of the war, the cost of living in Éire was slightly higher, it was 101.  In Great Britain it was slightly lower, at 96, and in New Zealand it amounted to 98. Those are the figures for the three countries that I have mentioned, as they existed in September, 1939.  Now, in September, 1943, after four years of war, what is the situation?  In Éire the cost-of-living figure has gone up from 101 to 161; in Great Britain it has gone up from 96 to 121, and, in New Zealand, it has gone up from 98 to 112.</P>
    <P>Relating these figures as a percentage increase, as between 1939 and 1943, our cost-of-living figure has gone up by 59.5 per cent., whereas the cost-of-living figure in Great Britain has gone up by only 26 per cent., and the cost-of-living figure in New Zealand has gone up by only 14.3 per cent.  These are the figures that actually matter when it comes to determining the purchasing value of the £.</P>
    <P>A lot of people have talked loosely about the £ being worth only this or that, or about whether 1/- is worth 6d. or not, but these figures, when translated into purchasing value, mean <Col N="2488" /> that 20/-, in monetary value, will now only purchase, in this country, what 12/6 would have purchased in 1939. That is the true measure and the true value of the £.  Again, we have heard a very cold and careful analysis by Deputy McGilligan of the position of different types of firms in this country, and what they have done with their profits.  Now, these profits have a direct relationship to the cost of living in this country, and I should like to draw the attention of the House, following on Deputy McGilligan's analysis, to the contrast between Irish capitalism, under a form of neutrality, and English capitalism, carrying on during a period of war.  There are very significant figures in this connection, and I should like to quote the figures given by <i>The Economist</i> and the <i>Financial Times.</i>  To summarise their view upon the situation, it is that the margin of profit in Great Britain, so far as it shows an improvement, is infinitesimal.  The <i>Financial Times</i> says that the index of profits, taking 1938 as a base&mdash;100&mdash; actually dropped to 95½ at one time in 1941, and that for the third quarter of 1943 it was reckoned at 104.  Now, this is an extensive review of British firms engaged in the most profitable form of industry during times of war: the production of instruments of destruction and death.  Contrast that increase of, roughly, 4 per cent. which, of course, is related to the high incidence of taxation and the extraordinarily high incidence of excess profits taxation, and so on, with what Deputy McGilligan has referred to&mdash;firms in Ireland, working on a smaller turnover, and working under peace-time conditions, and yet being able to pay 34 per cent. in dividends.</P>
    <P>Of course, I suppose we may presume that they were able to do that by using all the usual methods of financial dodgery known to financial experts, but there is something rotten in the State of Denmark, under the present Minister for Finance, if there can be such an outrageous difference between the profit-making capacity of firms in Ireland, engaged in peaceful pursuits, as contrasted with the profit-making capacity of English firms which are engaged in the most profitable enterprise <Col N="2489" /> of all times&mdash;the production of war materials designed for destruction and death.</P>
    <P>It is often asked: what is the Government's remedy for the situation? But it appears to me that the Government have not yet examined the situation in its serious import in a way which would lead them to believe there is any necessity for a remedy.  They know as well as we know that there is poverty, unemployment and an increase in the incidence of diseases like rickets and tuberculosis and all the social diseases; they know that we labour under very heavy handicaps as a nation; but a realisation of the position has evidently not yet got under their skin sufficiently to make them realise that they must do something to end the situation.  I give them every credit for honesty of purpose and it is certainly possible to defend them, if you like, by saying that they are doing what they consider best in the circumstances, but the best is not good enough, because they have not yet realised the seriousness of the situation.  It may take this emergency within an emergency to bring them up against the stark reality of things.  It may take the development of this emergency to make them realise that there is a great deal more in the philosophy of economics and politics than they have yet dreamed of, that they can and will have to take risks in the domains of finance and economics which they never anticipated they would have to take.</P>
    <P>They have, to my mind, continually tinkered with the whole problem, but even though they may tinker with wages and hours, an end will soon be reached of the capacity of any Government, within the present system, to tinker with the system.  They will find that circumstances will force them to depart absolutely and once and for all from the policy of <i>laissez faire.</i>  They will have to leave the pre-war world and come into the open post-war world which is rapidly shaping itself around us.  They will have to have a new conception of money and they will have to give up the phobias about inflation and the dangers of tinkering with our monetary policy.  I agree, and always <Col N="2490" /> have agreed, that there is great danger in tinkering with monetary policy or anything else.  You must go at it in a courageous manner and you must take advice which has proved practical in other countries.  You must base your monetary policy, your national policy and your social policy upon the possibility of full employment in this country.</P>
    <P>I know that money policy is a matter of political high explosive and that it is as likely to lead to the disintegration of the Parties following it as to the disintegration of a political enemy, but I would stress that, in this changing world, explosives and high explosives are instruments of social well-being in many cases.  We must use these instruments to effect changes in the thoughts of our Government. We must get the Government and the Minister for Finance to do dangerous thinking in the matter of finance.  We must get the Minister to apply his mind to these things and only in that way will he be able to correlate all the different domains of our economy.  He will find that it is a good democratic policy to ease the burdens of the farmers. It is as good a democratic policy as the Labour policy to do so, but he will find that it is only possible to do so by a new orientation in finance.  There is a golden age of government wherein it should attempt to make fundamental changes that are necessary to its administrative continuance in office.  That is a thought well worth bearing in mind, particularly as this crisis looms before us and particularly as we see the growing burdens of taxation in relation to our national income.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan talked about the middle class and the burdens they bore.  The working classes have always borne the burden of taxation, direct as well as indirect.  They are used to pulling in their belts and to bearing these burdens to a greater extent than ever the middle class were, but if we read history, we will see that very often this increasing incidence of taxation has been one of the motive powers of revolution.  In France, particularly, the increasing cost of government <Col N="2491" /> and the crushing burden of taxation upon the fixed incomes of the middle class drove the middle class into revolutionary action, upsetting Governments and régimes, and from 1830 to 1870 brought about quite a chaotic state of things.  We may not have come to that stage yet, but it is undoubtedly a danger signal that our taxation should have increased to such an extent and should impose such a heavy burden upon the middle class. The middle class will undoubtedly become dangerous thinkers, and my advice to the Government is that if they want to save the situation, if they are in earnest about saving the country and about having the interests of the people at heart, they should do the dangerous thinking first and base their policy upon this dangerous thinking in these dangerous times.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>For the past two days, we have had a very long-drawn-out debate, during which every point concerning the welfare of the people has been dealt with by members of the House much better than I or men like me who are green to Parliamentary procedure could deal with it.  However, during this crisis, there are a few items to which I should like to draw the attention of the Government.  The first is the production of agricultural commodities.  More encouragement should be given to the production of milk.  I see great danger threatening that industry, owing to the fact that, even with a guaranteed price during the winter months, farmers complain day after day that the price they get is not sufficient.  I am afraid that the production of milk is in grave danger because of the ineffectiveness of the Milk Prices Order to ensure a decent return for the industry.  I do not wish to beg for any increase that would be detrimental to the needs of the poorer classes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Larkin pointed out to-day that there are huge deposits in our banks and I suggest that money should be made available during this emergency to subsidise the production of food so that it would be available for our people.  A supply of milk is necessary for good health.  A supply <Col N="2492" /> of butter is also necessary, especially for the poor and for the working classes.  Unless steps are taken in the near future to secure a decent price for butter for residents in the cities and towns they will be left without it. I urge the Government to encourage dairy farmers to keep producing milk at the peak point and, if necessary, loans should be provided for that purpose. The price of milk should be based on the butter fat basis, so that a fairly average price would be paid for all milk up to a certain standard.</P>
    <P>The production of more turf is very important.  Local authorities should not pursue a cheese-paring policy if adequate supplies are to be provided during this emergency.  Men conversant with the production of turf, and who live adjacent to bogs, should be selected as supervisors over those engaged in that work.  Deputy Larkin dealt with the transport of turf and with the bad conditions under which it often arrives at its destination. Before turf leaves the bog it should be inspected by people in authority who would be in a position to certify it fit for use by the public.  There should be a reorganisation of the transport system, because in some areas turf is brought long distances, even by military lorries while in some instances other turf is being carried in an opposite direction.  In the interests of economy overlapping of that kind should not occur.  The Department of Supplies should make arrangements, so that turf workers who have to travel long distances should be guaranteed a supply of bicycle tyres, so that they might live in their own homes instead of in camps.  Living would be cheaper in their own homes.</P>
    <P>To encourage the production of beet the percentage basis upon which the guaranteed price is paid should be reduced from 17.5 to 15.5.  Owing to the lack of manures there is not now the same output as there has been in former years.  If the percentage basis was reduced, growers would have a better chance of getting a fixed price for the crop.</P>
    <P>As the amount required in the Estimates represents a big burden of taxation for the people the possibility of <Col N="2493" /> reducing it should be looked into.  I suggest that a committee of the House, with representatives from all Departments, should go through the Estimates to see if economies could be effected.  It is doubtful if any economies could be made in the coming year, but the future burden might be reduced if the committee I suggest inquired into the administration of every Department.  Twelve months ago I noticed that each morning and evening a military lorry travelled six miles to a road block to extinguish and to light a lamp.  That meant a journey of 24 miles every day for a lorry, to do what could have been done by a person in the district for a few shillings a week.  Many things like that are occurring and they mean expense on the State.</P>
    <P>In connection with the cost of living generally, I would like that, no matter what else happens, if there are to be further increases in prices, they will come from the sources suggested by Deputy Larkin to-day and will not mean an increase on the people generally. The poorer people find the cost of living is well beyond their capacity to bear, and I hope that every possible step will be taken to ensure that that burden will not be increased.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is really a debate on the cost of living, and the chief reason for its great length and complexity is the importance it bears to us.  In discussing the cost of living, we really are discussing life in general &mdash;the ordinary everyday life of the people, what they wear, why they wear it, how sick they are and why they are sick, because all these things can, in in a civilised community, ultimately be traced to the cost of living.  We are suffering now from the evils of a form of inflation and the evils of a very high cost of living.  The remedies for those evils lie mainly in the past, and we can only point them out in the main. We are suffering from what the Government did not do some years ago.  I do not wish to blame the Government for evils which are not their fault. Many things to-day are not the Government's fault, but there are many <Col N="2494" /> things which are.  Perhaps we should have laid in more stocks, and so on. Earlier to-day Deputy Sir John Esmonde referred to the question of shipping and said that, if we had more ships, we would be to-day in a stronger position.</P>
      <P>Our people are suffering to-day.  We all know the incidence of tuberculosis has gone up.  I daresay that the incidence of rheumatism has gone up, too, on account of the poorer clothing and bad footwear.  In regard to skin diseases, one has only to look round in any public conveyance to see the number of people who seem to be suffering from what one hopes are minor skin diseases.  All these things have arisen out of the present situation. The high cost of living is preventing many of our people from getting the necessaries of life.  In the case of the children, that is very tragic, as the children who are to-day rickety will be less strong citizens in the future and less able to enjoy life in general.</P>
      <P>There has also been much discussion about our fuel position and about turf in particular.  In company with other Deputies, I have raised the question of the wet turf and I am afraid I have not got much satisfaction. The fact remains that, in the cities, the turf very often is wet.  Not only that, but it is a very expensive commodity.  There are various reasons why it costs 64/- per ton, but it is indisputable that it does cost 64/- a ton, and for that you very often get something that is wet.  At any rate, you pay three or four times more for turf now than ordinary people were accustomed to pay for coal before the war. That is a very great pity, but it remains an undisputed fact.</P>
      <P>The unfortunate people whose income has not gone up are in a very sad plight.  There are many such people at present who are not a penny better off, having had no wage increases, than they were in 1939.  They are only keeping going under present conditions by cutting down on food, clothing and fuel.  They are doing that with very great detriment to their health and with tragic deteriment to the health of their children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2495" /> Some of the Deputies to-day referred in very dignified tones to the position in which we find ourselves at the present moment and the relation which that might have to the cost of living generally.  I am only an ordinary Deputy, but I do not believe that we will suffer these sanctions of which some people seem to be afraid.  I am not a constitutional lawyer, but I believe there is a document called the Statute of Westminster; and I believe it to be inherent in that document that this country has the right to do what it likes in the present circumstances. I believe that, if sanctions were imposed on this country, it would be tantamount to tearing that document into pieces.  I would not like to see that happen, nor do I believe that such a course would be a desirable one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Most Deputies in Opposition who have spoken on this matter do not appear to realise that there is a war on and that there has been a war on for the past four years. Most Deputies, if truthful and sincere about the matter, will agree that they did not think four years ago that we would be in the position we are in to-day, or that things would be as well as they are to-day.  As far as this State is concerned, I believe that the serious part for our people is coming now.  It is now that we will experience the really serious effects of this war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could not have expected that the cost of living would not increase since 1939.  When we gave increases in agricultural prices, in order to encourage agricultural production, and when we paid certain subsidies so that our people would have sufficient food, we must have realised that the money could not come from nowhere.  Those increases could not but result in a corresponding increase in the cost of living.  It appears to me that it is not generally appreciated by those who use the increased cost of living as a basis of argument, that that increase only affects a certain number of people and that quite a few people who use the increase as a basis for greater demands are not affected to any large extent.  I <Col N="2496" /> have listened to farmer Deputies in this House and throughout the country using the increased cost of living as an argument for increased demands for agricultural produce.  But they did not seem to appreciate that the people whom they purport to represent have most of the articles that make up the increased cost of living at first cost themselves, because they are the producers of these articles.  If we take the total number of people employed, according to the last figures available, in agricultural operations and associated parts of the agricultural industry at 643,965, or 480.9 out of every 1,000 of the population, and if we take half the population under 14 years of age as belonging to the agricultural community and add 381,450 to the number returned as engaged in agricultural production, we find that at least 500 people out of every 1,000 in this State are employed wholly or mainly or indirectly in agricultural production.</P>
    <P>All these people who are so employed produce for themselves most of these articles upon which the cost-of living basis is founded and which have gone to increase the cost-of-living index figure.  So far as I can gather from the statistics that are available, the increase in the cost-of-living index figure relating solely to articles of food amounts approximately to 63 per cent., and 500 out of every 1,000, as I have stated, have those articles of food at the cost of production.  I do not think, however, that 500 out of every 1,000 people is quite correct, because any of us who know rural life and who are familiar with the populations of country towns know that many people who are returned as not being engaged in agriculture, such as small shopkeepers in country towns, school teachers, mental hospital workers, and other workers of various classes in country towns also have plots of land or farms.  Those people also have these articles of food at cost price and are not affected, at least to the same extent, by the increase in the cost of living as the man who has only his week's wages to depend upon.</P>
    <P>I mention that to show that those people who continually rail about the <Col N="2497" /> increase in the cost-of-living index figure and use that argument as a basis for increased demands should first consider whom the cost-of-living increase affects.  There is, I think, a lot of loose thinking and argument about the cost-of-living index figure in this country.  It seems to be a basis of complaint by some of the Labour Party that the figure increased only by two points from 294 in November to 296 in February.  Deputy Larkin, Junior, seemed to have more or less of a complaint about that and seemed to think there was something wrong with the statistics on which the figures are based.  Presumably, we would have a very different story if the figure in February as compared with the November figure was 50 per cent. higher. Everybody now suggests that we should get back to the 1939 figure.  But, from the speeches I heard in this House in 1939, we were then asked to get back to the 1914 figure, and the 1939 figure was all wrong then, according to the Labour Party.  Now, in 1944, we find that the figure in 1939 was all right if we could get back to it. In the midst of a world war, with the supply position as it is, with the encouragement that the State had to give to people to get them to produce enough food for the nation, or to go as far along that road as the State could possibly get them to go, we could not achieve that position without an increase in the cost of living, and we are to be congratulated, everything considered, on having the figure on the basis it now is.</P>
    <P>I have heard criticisms in the House of the Department of Supplies.  Speaking from my personal experience of that Department, I am of the opinion that it has been and is the most efficient Department in the State.  If we take into consideration the fact that we had no experience whatever of such a Department in this country, that we had no experience of the amount of organisation that it would entail, and the fact that all this organisation had to be built up, as some Deputies said, without the support of the public&mdash;as a matter of fact, in certain instances, with the absolute antagonism of the <Col N="2498" /> public&mdash;I think we have done very well.</P>
    <P>There is, however, one matter, so far as the Department's policy is concerned, which I should like to mention. Although they seem to have got most things well under control, and although black marketing has been to a large extent checked, particularly by the decisions given by the military court in prosecutions brought before them, there is one matter of complaint in my constituency that the Department of Supplies do not seem to be able to get after, and that is the black market in bicycle tyres.  I am sure the Department cannot get after that for the reason that they could not get after quite a number of other things, namely, that they have not the cooperation of the public in the matter. I think, however, there should be some system of checking the sales of tyres by the Civic Guards or some other authority so as to stop that.  It is about the only matter in respect of supplies as to which we have any general complaint in my constituency and it is a matter that can be righted.</P>
    <P>So far as the position of the people, particularly the agricultural community, and their standards are concerned, I think that the Government policy over a number of years has been reflected to a large extent in the country. I think that certain sections, particularly in the backward areas, have benefited very considerably and that their standards have been improved very much.  There also seems to be a certain amount of confused thinking here and elsewhere as to what position agriculture should occupy in the community and as to how far the State should go in interference with agriculture. For instance, in some countries, Governments and people think that agriculture should be run as a business in the way that any ordinary business man takes his chance and runs his own business without Government help and interference.</P>
    <P>It is a question for each particular State whether it considers that the agricultural section of the community should get more State help and be fostered by the community.  It cannot be said that this State has not fostered <Col N="2499" /> agriculture to a large degree.  It cannot be said that the agricultural community has not got and is not still get-thing considerable help from the State. That help has been given, and it must come through the Government from the people.  Monetary help must necessarily come from the people and it must necessarily react on the people who demand it.</P>
    <P>For the life of me, I cannot see any analogy between the position here and the position in, England.  In England, the land tenure and system of cultivation is altogether different and so is the farming unit.  In England, farming is largely a business, just the same as a commercial concern.  Somebody takes 150 or 250 acres of land and works it as a business undertaking.  It will not be suggested by anybody, inside this House or outside it, that in normal times Britain would pay £3 or £4 subsidy per acre in order to get her farmers to till their land.  Here we are not leasing land as they are.  In the main, our farmers own their own land and they have not to pay the rents which the British farmer must pay, unless they are in the position of having to take conacre lettings on the 11-months' system or for temporary convenience. Here, too, our units of farming are much smaller.  Our average farm is of a much smaller size and, in the main, they are of less productivity, I think, than those large tracts of land that are farmed out in England, so that we could have no real comparison.</P>
    <P>When people ask that it should be Government policy to pay £3 an acre for every acre tilled, they should also ask themselves from whom this money is going to come.  If we take the area under tillage, approximately 3,000,000 acres, a subsidy of £3 an acre would cost approximately £9,000,000&mdash;a similar sum to the cost of our defence forces.  I do not think any sane man would consider that.  Neither do I consider that our people throughout the country who are on small farms and who are glad to get land at £3 an acre, or even at £10 an acre in some cases, and who can make it pay, would be content to see £900 given as a subsidy <Col N="2500" /> to a 300-acre farmer before he turned the sod.</P>
    <P>I think the suggestion from Clann na Talmhan is a crazy one.  I do not know where they suggest the money would come from.  It would come from taxation and the burden would have to be borne largely by the men with farms ranging from 22 to 50 acres, who are working now to the best of their ability, and who are, generally speaking, satisfied with the return they are getting.  I think that more harm to agriculture is being done by extravagant demands.  A reasonable case can be put up where there is a genuine grievance, instead of coming into this House, day after day, and year after year, trying to create the impression that no farmer in this country is able to live and pay his way, and that there is no possible hope for anybody engaged in the agricultural industry in this country.  But I would like to see Government policy intensified as far as what we would call the land slum problem is concerned.  During this emergency the Government have an opportunity of discovering those farmers who are doing their duty, and those who do not deserve to have land and who have failed the State in this hour of national emergency&mdash;those people who have not produced the crops needed and whose lands have had to be taken over temporarily.</P>
    <P>The problem of land slums in this country is confined mainly to about four counties, Mayo, Galway, Donegal and Kerry, and the only solution for that problem is either migration or resumption of any of the lands left for resumption in these areas.  In my own particular county, there is very little land for resumption, because quite a lot has been done in that direction, but I do think that where there is land offered for sale by public auction in a congested area, and where the holding is 150 or 200 acres, free sale should not be allowed.  I think that State and Government policy should be to step in, and to endeavour to conserve the land for the relief of local congests before allowing the free sale of it.  I know that migration is a very expensive business.  It is very necessary, although it is expensive, and even in <Col N="2501" /> those cases during the past 12 or 18 months where you have farms in congested areas surrounded by people of £2 valuation, it would pay the community and the State to see that those lands were resumed, and to prevent the occurrence of free sales where you have a number of congests.  It would work out cheaper in the long run for the State to do that than to carry out migration schemes.</P>
    <P>It might not present a full picture if I did not say that there has been a tremendous improvement even in our land slum areas.  The standards of living of our people have greatly increased. One of the main difficulties, particularly with our people now, is the danger of a flight from the land because conditions in those areas are deteriorating.  A lot of those people do not appreciate the conditions existing in those areas 25 to 30 years ago, and do not appreciate the conditions we have had in Mayo as recently as 25 years ago, when people were so poor that one parish might not have two milch cows, and when a poor farmer&mdash;more of a migratory labourer than a farmer&mdash;had to endeavour to borrow a cow, for the sake of getting milk for his children and family, from a wealthier neighbour some distance away.  I think conditions have improved tremendously, and the people have got used to higher standards. They are not prepared to go back to the standards of those old days.  They are not prepared to-day in country areas to work from dawn until dusk without going anywhere except to the local fair on one day in the month. Those days are gone, and it is a waste of time to endeavour to put back the hands of the clock.  The people are used to new standards and will not go back, no matter how they may be induced to do so, but it is a good job, particularly in congested areas that numbers of people have left.</P>
    <P>It is absurd to expect, taking the case of a man with four acres of arable land who has 10 children, that the whole of these 10 children would be able to live on that small farm.  It is absurd to expect these people to sit down and contemplate a future of misery and slavery.  The only way to <Col N="2502" /> relieve such conditions is to give each farmer an economic holding, on which he will be able to live, at least in frugal comfort.  Until the Government policy is intensified, by migrating more people out of these areas and by resuming more land where it is available for the relief of congestion I cannot see any solution of this problem.</P>
    <P>The pegging down of wages has been criticised to a very large extent and I must agree that in some cases it works unfairly.  It certainly works unfairly as regards a class of people mentioned during the debate, what I might call the lower middle class or the middle class.  It was a revelation to me recently to find that a very large body of teachers in this country are working for a salary less than that paid to Civic Guards, at less than 50/- a week. These people have to maintain, and have been used to, a certain standard of living.  They have to keep up a certain appearance.  They have to dress better than the man working on the land and it is very difficult, if not practically impossible, for them to do so on the salaries they are getting to-day.  I would urge that if possible something should be done for these lower-paid sections in the public service.  At the same time, I quite agree that it is completely impossible to remove all control of wages, to put no limit to the ceiling to which wages may rise.  Even as things are we have the beginning of inflation and, unless a very strict watch is kept on wages as well as on everything else, we shall arrive at a stage at which money will be of very little value and in such a condition, the people to whom I refer would possibly be infinitely worse off than they are to-day.</P>
    <P>Somebody has mentioned the position of transport.  The people, I believe, welcomed Government interference as far as transport was concerned. I do not think anybody who had experience of the conditions which prevailed some time ago, when it might take two days to travel from Mayo to Dublin&mdash;in fact one did not know when one got into a train what time it might arrive in Dublin&mdash;can feel otherwise than thankful for the considerable improvement that has <Col N="2503" /> been effected since the Government did interfere by putting Mr. Reynolds in amongst that bunch.  I do not think anybody could have any confidence in the directors or the business ability of the company as previously constituted as far as transport was concerned during this emergency.</P>
    <P>So far as the future is concerned, I should like to see transport&mdash;particularly the railway system&mdash;taken over and controlled by the State.  If Government policy should develop in that way, I should like them to keep an eye also on the tremendous possibilities opened up by the development of air transport.  In my judgment, at all events, there is a great future for air transport.  We in this small State had better keep abreast of the times so that we can compete with the rest of the world in the development of this form of transport.  As far as various other problems are concerned, particularly the attitude that we should adopt towards our threatened isolation, I have confidence that our people will stand up to that as they have done to many similar problems throughout the ages.  I was very glad to hear similar expressions of opinion from all sides of the House to-day.  I think no matter how bad things may be, that if we all endeavour to live together as an isolated family, we shall be able to keep the country going until the emergency has passed.</P>

      <P>I could almost congratulate the Minister on the scope of this Vote on Account, if he had not been consistently increasing Budget after Budget for the past 12 years although we were always promised some easement in future years.  Were it not for that I could, as I say, almost congratulate the Minister this year because an increase of £4,000,000 or £5,000,000 looks so small in present circumstances, that one might regard it with the same disdain as one would the price of a box of matches in normal times.  The one regrettable feature about the increase is that it does not seem to help social services very much.  It does not help the farmer very much and still less does it help those people who are pinned down to <Col N="2504" /> a certain wage in the country by Orders of the Minister.  As far as rural Ireland is concerned, we can take them in rotation&mdash;the road worker, the farm labourer and the small farmer himself.  They are strictly bound down to a certain wage and no county manager or anybody else can get over it.  There is, however, no pinning down of the cost of living or of the prices at which they have to buy commodities.  The spiral goes higher every day.</P>
      <P>While the Minister and his colleagues try to satisfy the town worker, the industrial worker, they forget that the most productive man in the country is the man working on the farm or the bog.  These workers are pinned down with a vengeance.  The policy of the Government during a number of years past has educated even these workers to work on the farm only for a limited number of hours.  The worker in the old days did not take much notice of what the Government did and he worked on the farm as long as he could but now the time has come when the young man will not work on the land for longer than the eight or nine hours laid down by the Government as the working day.  That is a matter that is troubling the Farmers' Party much more than the £3 per acre tillage subsidy for which they have been looking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dairy industry will be wiped out because of the interference of Government with rural labour.  It is not so much a question of wages, but the Government have laid down hours and put the dairying industry in such a position that every farmer and his wife who keep cows must do a great part of the work in the mornings themselves and must also attend to the cows on Sundays because they cannot get people to do the job.  That is more important than the speeches we hear from the Farmers' Benches about tillage.  I am not so much concerned with the tillage problem because I feel that good farmers are doing their work in that connection regardless of the prices available.  Perhaps they would be entitled to better prices on account of the wages they are paid, but they are doing the work.  That was the <Col N="2505" /> foundation of our life in the past, as it will be in the future.</P>
    <P>As regards the social services, the Government have provided no increase in social services except in some small mercenary things by way of vouchers. Something is given to people who have to go to the home assistance officer to obtain it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Colonel Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  I heard so much here during the past couple of days that I did not know exactly what subjects were down for discussion. Deputy Connolly described the cost-of-living position very well.  It has gone to a higher figure here than it has in England, although we are neutral. Yet we are trying to endow wages in certain directions.  I blame the Labour Party as much as I blame the Government in this matter of wages.  The Labour Party never seems to trouble except about those workers who are organised and whose votes count at an election.</P>
      <P>They never think of labour in rural Ireland.  If we are to continue to produce the necessary butter and milk destined for the public of the cities and towns, rural Ireland must be looked upon as a special entity.  People here may be paying 3/- or 4/- for milk. Why not increase the price of butter in relation to that?  I do not want to raise the cost of living, but, if milk can be got in Dublin at such a price, why cannot the price of butter be raised in relation to the price of milk? Butter is as necessary a commodity as the milk which the people of Dublin drink.  Why not subsidise the price of butter and give producers a reasonable price, so that they can pay their workers a wage sufficient to enable them to obtain the necessaries of life?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole fuel position seems to me to be a joke.  I have been watching it very closely.  I was reared in the centre <Col N="2506" /> of a bog.  I know Clonsast very well, and I know a large number of the people employed in pivotal jobs there. Did 50 per cent. of them ever see a sod of turf?  No, but they fought for a certain Party over a certain period and, so long as they knew the length and breadth of a sod of turf, they were brought there.  Some of the most eminent engineers have experienced the greatest difficulty in dealing with the bogs in Laoighis and Offaly because of the men recruited by the Turf Board to do the job there.  I saw the turf supplied in Dublin.  I burned turf in a range and in grates and I cut and saved turf.  Most of the turf being used is not worth the carriage to Dublin.  I think that it is a frightful disgrace to see wagons loaded with turf so wet that it cannot be brought to Dublin.  At Portarlington, I see turf three tons of which could not be put in the biggest wagon ever built. It would not pay for the carriage.  A farmer would dump it into a bog-hole and would not dream of taking it home to burn.  Then, when they get dry turf in the towns, they have to take it into the yard and throw water on it because it will not weigh.</P>
    <P>The poor woman whose husband earns £3 a week has to buy that turf. With all the supervision by the Department of Supplies, there has been very little improvement.  What I am afraid of is that ratepayers of the Twenty-Six Counties may be mulcted in another £1,000,000 or £2,000,000 notwithstanding that the Minister for Finance promised that he would pay debts incurred in respect of turf production.  I appeal to the Minister not to be mercenary with other Departments of State in respect of the production of milk or turf or even in connection with wages.  If we are to carry on through this emergency, the Minister must deal with these matters generously.  If we can increase the Budget by £4,000,000, we can increase it by £6,000,000 or £7,000,000, if necessary, so as to make the people satisfied.  It would have been better if, three years ago, we had increased it by £10,000,000 and kept the people, who since went across the water, at home.  We would not then <Col N="2507" /> have farmers and others begging for labour to put down their crop or milk their cows.  I ask the Minister not to be mercenary so far as £4,000,000, £5,000,000 or £10,000,000 are concerned, if necessary to keep this country in production.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just a few words to say on the three subjects that it has been agreed to discuss on this Vote on Account: the cost of living, food production and fuel.  The bill that we have to meet this year is a very large one.  I remember the time when the wise men of this country threw up their hands in despair when taxation reached about £1,000,000 per county. It will soon average close on £2,000,000 per county.  Considering the very difficult and dangerous times through which we are passing, and that there does not exist in the country any real live public opinion, it would be just waste of time to go on speaking about high taxation.  All of us have to accept responsibility for the huge bill which the Minister for Finance will be putting before the House in a month or two, and of which he is now asking one-third in advance.  We know that it is by the free vote of this House, and with the support of all Parties, that a very large increase in the annual Budget will be effected this year. Therefore, there would not be much point in wasting time discussing the items in the Vote on Account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear a great many complaints day by day, week by week, and month by month, about the high cost of living.  I should like to be fair in whatever little criticism I have to make on that.  There is no doubt but that the cost of living is very high at the moment.  It is high, due to circumstances over which neither the Government nor the people as a whole have much control.  If we go through the items which make up the family budget, and especially those which are essential to the human being from the physical point of view, we find that the price of bread, butter, eggs, bacon and beef compares favourably with the price charged for these foodstuffs during the last war.  Therefore, <Col N="2508" /> I say we must be fair.  I am not going to weary the House by going through a long list.  During the last war eggs soared to 6/- a dozen, butter was 4/- to 4/6 a lb., bacon was 2/6 to 3/- and 3/6 and beef was well over 2/6 per lb. The circumstances at that time may have been somewhat different from what they are to-day.  More money may have been in circulation.  As far as those items are concerned, the fact remains that, after four years of war, and taking an impartial dispassionate view of the state of the country at the present time, we cannot complain very much under that heading.  Of course, I except the old age pensioner, the widow and the poor unfortunate unemployed people as well as those with large families whose nose is kept to the grinding stone.</P>
    <P>It is in regard to the cost of the little incidentals that one hears the greatest complaint: for example, the price of polish and other things required by a family.  In some cases the cost of these has gone up by 300 and 400 per cent.  Undoubtedly, the price of boots and clothes has increased enormously.  The increase in regard to boots is, to some extent, due to factors over which we have little or no control.  The cost of importing many of the articles used in the manufacture of boots has increased enormously. They have to be brought in from overseas.  The cost of maritime insurance, freights and all the rest adds considerably to the ultimate cost of the finished article.  I agree with Deputy Larkin (Junior) that, in certain cases, the profits made by some concerns are excessive.  I would, therefore, ask the Government to take all reasonable steps in the near future to see that articles which are essential to the people, and especially the working classes, will be sold to them at a price that they can afford to pay. These are things that weigh very heavily on the heads of families at the present time.</P>
    <P>In regard to food production, I think that the people responsible have responded nobly to the call made upon them by the Government and by the members of all Parties in this House. The farmers, notwithstanding the <Col N="2509" /> many handicaps under which they are suffering, are doing their job well.  It is true that they are suffering from a shortage of artificial manures and fertilisers, but with the quotas of these which they have received they have at least produced sufficient food to keep the people of this country fed after four years of a war unparalleled as wars go.  Since I believe that the Minister for Finance is the man primarily responsible, I would ask him to have a consultation with the Minister for Agriculture on the question of the production of beet as it affects the farmers of Louth.  The freight charge on a ton of beet from North Louth&mdash; I mean the Cooley area&mdash;is 15/- a ton, with a rebate of 2/- per ton.  That is what it costs the farmers in Cooley to deliver a ton of beet to the Carlow factory&mdash;15/- per ton.  A wagon takes on an average five tons, so that the farmer has to pay £3 15s. on each wagon of beet that he sends away.  I understand that the average yield of beet is 9 tons to 10 tons per acre.</P>
    <P>Deputies, therefore, can see the great disadvantage under which Cooley farmers labour in comparison with those who live adjacent to the several beet factories.  As far as I understand, the people in charge of the factories manufacturing sugar have guaranteed to pay freights that exceed 6/- to 8/- in the case of beet that is offered to the Tuam factory.  The Minister must be aware&mdash;Deputy Larkin (Senior) can bear me out on this&mdash;that there is not a more hard-working farmer in the Twenty-Six Counties than the farmer in the Cooley area.  There is a bigger population in Cooley, according to its area, than is to be found in any other part of the Twenty-Six Counties.  In fact, I think it exceeds that of Denmark. The farms there are small and uneconomic.  Many of those farmers live in labourers' cottages.  By reason of their thrift and industry they are able to take conacre.  They pay fabulous prices for it.  They pay £10, £15 and up to £16 per acre for land on the 11 months' system, and by their thrift and industry they are able to get sufficient crops off that land to give them a profit.  I think that those men are deserving of every consideration, <Col N="2510" /> especially in view of the fact that Cooley is scheduled as a black scab area.  They are thereby prevented from marketing their potatoes in centres where they would command a ready sale and handsome prices.  The fact is that they have to sell their potatoes to the alcohol factory that is in their area at prices averaging £4 to £4 10s. per ton as compared with the average price that prevails in other parts of the Twenty-Six Counties of from £8 to £10 per ton.</P>
    <P>In this matter of freight charges for beet, I think the Minister for Finance would be doing only bare justice by impressing on the Minister for Agriculture the necessity of considering the very heavy freight charges that the farmers of Cooley and, for that matter, the farmers in Louth who go in for beet cultivation, have to bear. These farmers are growing beet which is a very necessary commodity now that we have been cut off from outside supplies and have been for the last three or four years.</P>
    <P>I do not claim to have much experience of turf production.  I can only apply the experience I have had in other activities to turf production, but I think it is only natural that, after four years' experience, the people should expect some improvement in the quality of turf.  Everyone of us was more or less sympathetic in referring to the turf that had been produced in the first and second years of the emergency but, as the years go on. with the organisation being perfected each year, the people of the country are entitled to expect that the turf for which they have to pay £3 4s. a ton should be of fairly good quality.  I am not one of those who expect that every sod of turf should be 100 per cent. dry. I know that that would be impossible. I know that it would be impossible also to examine every sod individually. There is bound to be a certain amount of inferior turf in every consignment. just as there is bound to be a certain amount of inferior coal in every cargo of coal but I think we have now arrived at a time when the people are entitled to expect better quality turf, <Col N="2511" /> and I hope that this year there will be an improvement.</P>
    <P>Certain criticism has been expressed in regard to the price.  In that respect it is only right to say that turf is a very difficult commodity to handle.  It is all very well to say that people who have been reared in a turf area are in a position to sell turf, say, at 35/- a ton.  I take that with a grain of salt because, as far as my experience goes, it would seem that turf was never sold by the ton, but by the cart or creel. There is so much handling involved in connection with turf that the cost of transport does not surprise me in the least.  I have had no experience of handling turf, but from my experience of handling other commodities and knowing the amount of handling involved in turf before it reaches the consumer, it did not surprise me that the price went up to 64/- a ton.  In fact that is not the real price, because I understand that in addition there is a Government subsidy ranging from £1 to 24/-.  Even at that price, I think the people would not mind so much if the quality were anything like what it should be.  Let us hope that there will be an improvement this year and that the turf will reach the consumer in a satisfactory condition.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, there would not be much use in criticising this huge sum that has been asked for this year by the Minister for Finance. We will have to leave that until the war is over.  The only thing I should like to impress on the Minister and the Government is that we should not be jockeyed into spending money on what is known as post-war planning.  I respectfully submit that we will be doing very well if we get through the present emergency day by day and week by week, and do not mind about what is going to happen after the war. There is no use in bidding the devil good morrow until you meet him.  I think it will test all our energy and require the co-operation of all the people of this country, irrespective of Party, to pull through the present situation.  Therefore, so far as I am personally concerned, whilst not decrying in any way the people who are <Col N="2512" /> anxious that we should take steps to prepare for what may be the condition of affairs after the war, I think it would be very foolish if the Government were to spend any considerable sum of money on anything approaching real post-war planning, for the simple reason that we are not in a position to know whether the plans we make now are the right ones.  They might be obsolete when the war would be over.  No one can tell what the position of affairs will be when the war is over.  Nations bigger than we are cannot tell.</P>
    <P>There is no use in imagining that we are better than anybody else, that we are prophets and God's chosen people, who can see further ahead than anyone else.  We cannot and, for that reason, I think any money we have should be reserved and used to help the people as a whole to get through very difficult times which, possibly&mdash; although I hope it will not be the case &mdash;may be more difficult in the future. I especially trust the Minister for Finance will not forget my representations in regard to freight charges aplicable to the farmers of Cooley who produce beet.</P>

      <P>The House will forgive me if I say that I am a bit bewildered to know where to begin to reply and that I am tired.  That is no disrespect to anybody.  I have sat here for the best part of 24 hours.  I hardly missed a speech, or very little of any speech.</P>
      <P>The Chair informed us that there were three main subjects to be debated&mdash;the cost of living, food production and fuel production.  These subjects were debated at considerable length, but, unfortunately, there was very little attempt on the part of some Deputies to stick anyway closely&mdash; perhaps closely is not the word to use in that connection&mdash;to the three subjects that the House agreed would be best suited for discussion on this Vote on Account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2513" /> Looking back on the debate as a whole, it was a good one and a fair one.  The Government came in for a good share of criticism, but that is natural.  Most of it was fair criticism&mdash; whether justified or not I would say it was fair criticism.  Points of view were expressed from different sides of the House; in fact, there were some views expressed on my own side of the House with which I could not entirely agree. Nevertheless, I think the tone of the debate was entirely creditable to the House.</P>
    <P>There is no man in this House more capable of putting a good face on a bad case than Deputy McGilligan, but I think he made one of his worst speeches, at least one of the worst I ever heard him deliver in this House, last night.  It was a most unconvincing production, coming from him.  It lacked the usual spark and fire; it was dull and, I suggest, uninteresting.  I think he had not his whole heart in it&mdash; that is my belief, judging from what I heard him say.  He was put up to make the best case he could.  I think he could have done better.  I do not rate myself at all as anywhere nearly as good a speaker as Deputy McGilligan, but I think I could have made a better case than he did.</P>
    <P>He made some extraordinary statements in the course of that speech in an attempt to drive home to the minds of this House and the people in the country that our cost of living was unique, that we in the Dáil were responsible for permitting the cost-of-living figure to rise to an extent that no other country had allowed its cost of living to rise to.  He said that no other country had allowed the cost of living to rise to anything like the same extent as we had done.  Deputy McGilligan is a past master in handling statistics, as we know well in this House, and he is usually very well fortified with figures to prove his case.  He did not attempt to produce even one figure relating to the cost of living in any other country in Europe or elsewhere to prove the truth of his statement. He blamed the Government for the position.  I have here a book that Deputy McGilligan and others in this <Col N="2514" /> House are probably very familiar with, <i>The League of Nations Monthly Bulletin of Statistics.</i>  In the November issue of 1943&mdash;the most recent one I could get&mdash;on page 301, there is set out a list of countries in Europe with their cost-of-living figures.  Anybody who wants to see a complete list can get the <i>Bulletin</i> in the Library.</P>
    <P>I have taken out a number of countries in Europe and I find that, on the average, our figure compares favourably with the figures for most of the other countries, though it is a high cost-of-living figure, and I do not deny it.  I am taking the 1939 figure at 100.  I shall read out the list for the House&mdash;the countries are here in this order:&mdash;Bulgaria, 225; Denmark, 155; Spain, 164; Finland, 191; Ireland, 164; Iceland, 245; Norway, 151; Portugal, 159; The United Kingdom, 129; Sweden, 149; Switzerland, 150; Turkey, 356, and then there is one other country, taken as a matter of interest&mdash;Australia, 123.  Is there any foundation for, or any truth in, the statement that has been made?  I challenge anybody to say there is truth in the statement that we have a uniquely high cost-of-living figure in this country, a figure that no other country has arrived at.  There are other figures.  Let me take the figure for food only, as part of the cost-of-living figure.  It will be a matter of interest to the House. I am taking the same list of countries and the same standard for 1939&mdash;that is, 100.  As regards food, the figures are:&mdash;Bulgaria, 262; Denmark, 154; Spain, 187; Finland, 195; Ireland, 157; Iceland, 305; Norway, 156; Portugal, 158; The United Kingdom, 123; Sweden, 158; Switzerland, 163; Turkey, 555, and Australia, 110. These figures are also to be found in that statistical journal published by the League of Nations.  There again we are lower than a great many of the countries I have read out.  The figure is 157 in Ireland compared with 163 in Switzerland, another neutral country, and compared with 158 in Portugal, also a neutral country.  In Spain, another neutral country, the figure is 187 as against our 157.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2515" /> I think these figures alone show the reason why there was a lack of sincerity, to my thinking, in the speech that Deputy McGilligan made last night.  Probably he looked up the statistics.  Being the competent Deputy he is, he usually comes in well armed with facts and he does not come in at any time to make a speech in the sense that he does not know what he is talking about.  Being a trained lawyer as well, he is able to put the best face possible on his case. He did not do it last night, and there is a reason.  It is because he was misrepresenting to the House and to the country the facts as we know them now, not from any figures of mine or of the Government, but from figures produced from the <i>League of Nations Statistical Bulletin.</i></P>
    <P>On that question of figures there is one point that could be made, and perhaps it is just as well to make it at this moment.  I listened with great interest to a number of the speeches that were made to-day, and it occurred to me that it was a good thing that I did not rise, at the invitation of the Ceann Comhairle last night, to conclude the discussion, when there was evidently no desire on the part of most of the members of the House to speak on this Vote.  Deputies who were here at that time last night will remember the long delays that occurred&mdash;sometimes amounting to five minutes&mdash; before anybody would get up to speak; and, accordingly, I was called upon by the Ceann Comhairle to conclude. I thought, however, that if Deputies were given an opportunity of carrying on the discussion to-day, the House would be better pleased, and I think that the speeches to which we have listened to-day have justified my action, and justified the Ceann Comhairle in agreeing that the debate should be carried on, even though there did not seem to be any disposition on the part of the House, generally, to carry it on.  As I have said, I feel justified in that, because I have listened to a number of first-rate speeches&mdash;mostly critical, I admit, but very creditable to the members of this <Col N="2516" /> House.  One of these speeches was that made by Deputy Larkin, Junior. I thought it a very good and impressive speech, but I am afraid that it was badly spoiled by&mdash;I think I can use the phrase&mdash;a foul insinuation to the effect that the figures with regard to the cost of living, arranged by civil servants and published over the name of the Government, were manipulated figures &mdash;not alone manipulated but, perhaps, faked.  That, as I understood it, was the suggestion made by the Deputy; that these figures were faked, and produced for political purposes by the Government.  The Deputy should know, I think, that that is a most unworthy suggestion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; they were often questioned, but it was never suggested, in my hearing at any rate, that these figures were manipulated or faked by the Government for political purposes, and I say that there is no foundation for such a suggestion and that it should be withdrawn by the Deputy at the earliest opportunity, because it is a foul slander both on the Government and on the civil servants.  Oftentimes there was criticism with regard to the basis on which the cost-of-living figure was made up. For instance, in the days when we were in Opposition, members of my own Party suggested that the basis on which the cost-of-living figure was computed was wrong, but that is the furthest extent to which I ever heard any Party, or any member of any Party going: that the basis on which these figures were computed was wrong and did not truly represent the facts.  The only object of these criticisms was to try to find out whether there was any foundation for the figure that had been originally set, in view of the circumstances that arose afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, in that connection, a committee was set up in 1933 to deal with this question of the cost-of-living index figure, and the report of that committee was published by the <Col N="2517" /> Stationery Office in 1933.  I do not know whether or not Deputy Larkin, Junior, has seen that report, but one of his colleagues in the Labour Party was chairman of that committee&mdash;Mr. Tom Johnson; as honest a man as we have ever had here&mdash;and there was a unanimous report of that committee, signed by Mr. Tom Johnson, as chairman, which any Deputy can read for himself.  That report starts off by saying:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At the present time the official figure very fairly represents the <i>price</i> position as affecting civil servants.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was because civil servants were brought in, amongst other bodies, as being affected by this, and it did not mean that it particularly represented their problem.  In the second last paragraph of the report (paragraph 7) it says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have examined the actual returns used in the present method of computation and are satisfied that all due care is taken to ensure accuracy in the price returns; that the price inquiry is sufficiently extensive as to area covered; that the prices returned are free from bias; that the formula used in the computation is the best possible in all the circumstances; and that the quarterly inquiries are frequent enough for all the uses for which these figures may be required.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that that is an ample and sufficient answer to the unworthy suggestion that was made by Deputy Larkin, Junior.  There was another answer that I think might be useful to give for the benefit of Deputy Larkin, Junior, and others in the House, and that is that there is, as I am informed by those who know more about it than I, not much change in the cost-of-living figure between November and February of any year, as a rule.  I think it will be found, if the figures are examined for the last five or six years, that there was no change in most years, so far as those months are concerned, and a very slight change in other years.  Anybody who wants to check that can get the cost-of-living figures in the <i>Trade Journal</i> for the last few <Col N="2518" /> years, and it will be found that there was no change between those months in some years, although there might be a slight change in one year.  Deputy Larkin, Junior, suggests that because there was only a slight rise between November and February of last year, the figures were faked.  That charge is false.  I do not say that the charge was deliberately made, but certainly it is wrong to suggest that either the civil servants&mdash;the men who compiled these figures&mdash;or the responsible officials in the Statistical Bureau were capable of faking these figures.  They are men of as high standing as any body of men in Ireland, whether inside the Dáil or outside it, and they are no more capable of faking figures than, let us say, members of the Labour Party, whether inside or outside of this House.</P>
    <P>These statistics can be found in the Library, and I am sure that nobody will question them&mdash;certainly nobody who has been acquainted with their work during the last 30 or 40 years.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan and Deputy O'Higgins dwelt on the hardships that the cost of living causes to the middle classes.  That is quite true.  Probably, the cost of living falls with greater hardship, as Deputy O'Higgins, the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, emphasised last night, on those with fixed incomes than on anybody else&mdash;even with greater hardship on them than on the very poor.  The House knows well that efforts have been made to temper the wind to the shorn lamb, to some extent at any rate, so far as the poorer classes are concerned; but very little has been done, generally speaking, in the case of the people with fixed incomes.  Those of the artisan class&mdash;the majority of them, at any rate&mdash;have got something; not a great deal, I admit, and nothing proportionate, by way of a rise in their &ldquo;screw,&rdquo; to use a vulgar word, to the rise in the cost of living, but they have got something, whereas many of the people who have to depend on fixed incomes have nothing extra to fall back upon. I know that during and after the last war, the efforts made by the Governments of certain <Col N="2519" /> countries in Europe, notably France and Germany, and to some extent Belgium&mdash;these are countries of which I have some personal knowledge&mdash;to meet the cost of living brought ruination&mdash;I do not think that is too strong a word&mdash;to the middle classes of these great countries.</P>
    <P>We have tried to make special provision in State services to meet the increased cost of living.  We have done this much and I am not boasting about it at all, because I say it is a modest effort to try to help people with fixed incomes over very difficult and dangerous times.  The Civil Service bonus concession to the lower paid classes&mdash; nobody with an income of over £500 got anything&mdash;costs, for the current financial year, £472,000; national teachers' emergency bonus, £292,000; secondary teachers, £39,000; Gárda Síochána, £186,000, plus another £13,000.  Pay increases granted to the Army in 1942, which, of course, are continued this year, cost £241,000, in addition to which there is deferred pay which we shall be called upon to pay at the end of the emergency and which is mounting up for the soldiers at the rate of £327,000 a year.  The increases granted in marriage allowances since the emergency cost us every year £582,000.  Increases in unemployment assistance to persons in rural areas amount in round figures to £150,000; food allowances to £570,000; widows' and orphans' pensions and supplementary payments to certain beneficiaries, £135,000; grants to local authorities in respect of assistance in kind, £170,000 and £100,000 in respect of fuel for necessitous persons.  Supplemental allowances to old age pensioners, blind pensioners and certain recipients of National Health Insurance and their dependent children amount to £230,000; food subsidies to £2,196,000; and fuel&mdash;turf and timber&mdash;subsidies to £980,000.  These sums total £6,383,000, which, with agricultural produce subsidies, amounting to £870,000, is brought up to £7,253,000.</P>

      <P>No; I will not answer any question now.  These are not very big sums on the whole, but the total amounts to £7,250,000, which is a large sum even out of a total Estimate for Supply Services of £45,000,000.  Perhaps we should do more.  Deputy McGilligan, I take it, wants us to read from his speech that we have not done enough, and probably Deputy O'Higgins also has in mind that we should have done a great deal more, at any rate for the classes whose difficulties and hardships they stressed at considerable length last evening.  Perhaps we should do more, but £45,000,000 is, as Deputy O'Higgins said, and I do not find any fault with his word, a staggering amount.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan's only practical suggestion was that we should borrow millions and millions more.  If we did that, how much more staggering would the figure be, because that borrowed money must be got from somebody and must be paid for somehow, some time. Deputies have said to me: &ldquo;Go to the banks and get £10,000,000 or £20,000,000.&rdquo;  More than one Deputy made that suggestion to-day.  Suppose we paid only 1 per cent.&mdash;if it were possible to get it at that rate&mdash;the approximate cost of putting the cost of living back to, say, the 1940 figure, would be staggering; even with regard to certain items of food such as flour, bread, tea, sugar and butter, if these were to be given free to the public, the cost would be £24,000,000.</P>

      <P>If the food situation here were as bad as it is in Great Britain and the Government here had to do what is done in Great Britain, that is, to purchase and distribute all the meat, milk, vegetables and other food requirements, enormous food subsidies would be required.  If we were to do that here&mdash;and I doubt if it would be practicable&mdash;and if we were to make an attempt on that basis to bring the cost of living down to what it was in February, 1940, according to figures on which I can rely, it would cost us £50,000,000.</P>
      <P>It is all very well to compare our condition with that of Britain.  I do not think the two cases are comparable at all.  Britain is our nearest neighbour and we have had, over a long period, close and intimate association with Britain, economically, financially and industrially&mdash;so close that we were a long time trying to get rid of it.  We have got rid of it to a certain extent, but British ideas still permeate the public mind here, and whenever we are anxious to find a headline, an example of what should be done, perhaps in relation to social services or similar matters, the majority of the people here, in the Dáil and out of it, seem to think that there is only one country to look to, Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the House and to the public that no proper analogy could be made between Great Britain and a small country like this, with a population in the part that we control, of slightly less than 3,000,000, mostly engaged in agriculture and living out of the land.  As industry has not been developed to any considerable extent here, how could a just and fair comparison be made between this country and a highly developed country like Great Britain, the centre of the biggest <Col N="2522" /> Empire in the world, the richest country in the world and one of the biggest industrially developed?  That would not be a just comparison to make.  We are often told about what is proposed in Great Britain under social security plans like those of Sir William Beveridge.  We are told that our social services ought to be somewhat similar, but people forget that there is no just basis of comparison between what would be fair to people here who have to provide the money&mdash; workers as well as capitalists&mdash;and what is possible in Great Britain. Many things are possible in a war in belligerent countries that they would not think of putting into operation otherwise.  This social security scheme so often quoted here, of Sir William Beveridge, is being adopted in principle in Great Britain, but none of it is being put into operation.  I wonder will it ever be put into operation? Even though they are in the midst of a war and, as we were reminded to-day, they are able to provide £16,000,000 a day to fight it&mdash;a million or two one way or another would not be much to them&mdash;they have not yet put the plans into operation or any part of them.  I doubt if they ever will.  I do not want to prophesy on matters upon which I am not competent to prophesy, but it does not look like it.  I doubt if that scheme which is held up so often as a model will ever be put into operation.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should give somebody else a chance.  Other Deputies have a right to speak in this House and will insist on speaking.  I met a friend of mine recently who spent many years farming in New Zealand.  He was a farmer's son, and <Col N="2523" /> after he married did not get on well with his people.  They did not like the girl he married.  It is not a new story. My friend went to New Zealand and, with a few hundred pounds that he had, there was made over to him 1,000 acres of land.  He had not to buy the land, but had to pay rent out of the produce.  He lived there and reared his family.  They are home now happy in Ireland and very glad to be back here.  The children are settled on farms beside their parents.  Every time there is talk of financial matters here Deputy Davin generally, and Deputy Norton occasionally, mention New Zealand.  We are told of the social services they have in New Zealand and what a wonderful country it is for everybody who lives there.  If it is such a wonderful country why did people like my friend, who had 1,000 acres of excellent land given him, not stay in it?  That seems to require some explanation.  When I asked him why he did not stay he said: &ldquo;Well, the first reason is that I got an offer of a farm at home.&rdquo;  That was the best reason.  He was glad to come home. Any Irishman who could get the offer of a farm at home, no matter where he was, even in the El Dorado, as certain Labour Deputies describe New Zealand, or in the United States, or anywhere else would prefer to farm at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked him about conditions in New Zealand and he told me it was impossible to get help there.  He and his wife worked like slaves.  They worked hard in Ireland, but they could get some help here.  They could get none in New Zealand.  With their friends they sometimes visited the nearest big town but there was no such thing as service or help of any kind to be had. They had to work morning, noon and night.  They were supplied with machinery and were expected to work the farm with machinery.  They worked but they made no money.  They were able to make ends meet, but no more. I asked why it was so difficult to get help to run a farm out there.  After all, to work a farm of 1,000 acres, I need not tell any of my agricultural friends, would depend, even with the use of <Col N="2524" /> tractors, on every kind of machinery. I am sure Deputy Hughes could elaborate on that.  They could not get help and worked hard themselves.  I asked why and they said the white population of New Zealand is disappearing. That conversation occurred to me to-day when New Zealand was mentioned again, and I asked if there was any book giving reliable information regarding the population.  I was given this New Zealand official handbook for 1939.  Here is what it says on the trend of population:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The trend of population movement in past decades has been in the direction of a decline in the rate of population increase, the decline quickening in recent years.  There appears to be no indication at present of any radical alteration in the trend and it has become of the greatest moment to consider, in general terms at least, what a strong continuance of this trend would mean.  Boldly stated, it implies that New Zealand is facing, at only a few years' distance, the possibility of a stationary and even declining population. The remarks under this head apply, it should be stated, to population other than Maori.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The white population is disappearing in New Zealand.  That is the El Dorado of the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>As Minister for Finance, I am not hard-hearted; I am not built that way, especially where there are poor people to be considered. I know that there is hardship among probably all sections of the community. There is no section which this <Col N="2525" /> war has not hit.  We are out of it, in so far as we are not belligerents, but we are not free from its effects.  We are suffering, and must continue to suffer, perhaps at an increased rate, from now until the end of the war, whenever that comes&mdash;and, please God, it will be soon.  I see no other prospect but that of suffering of one kind or another for almost every class of our people.  The Government would like to &ldquo;temper the wind to the shorn lamb&rdquo;, as the old cliché puts it.  We would like to temper the hardships to the poor, the old and the invalid, but every time we hand out doles or adopt even the modest expenditure we have adopted so far&mdash;the system of subsidies that Deputy McGilligan was so fond of last night&mdash;we add to the inflationary tendencies here.</P>
      <P>We cannot get away from it: inflation does exist here to some extent. Everything we do in the way of adding money to the pool in circulation, without at the same time increasing production, makes the cost of living go higher and higher, and makes it harder for all classes, but particularly for the poor, to live.  We frequently have prolonged deliberation and debate in the Government, as to the just and fair price to give the farming community for wheat, beet, milk and the other products; and then we have to consider the rate of increased inflation which may follow any increase in prices.  Any Party in office&mdash;even if it were the Labour Party, as there are Labour parties in office in countries not unlike ours at present&mdash;would have to weigh carefully the pros and cons of increased prices to the producer or of increased wages to the workers.  They would have to arrive at a fair and just balance&mdash;just not alone to the farmer and the wage-earner but also to the community as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We may not have succeeded in arriving at that just balance, but I can assure the House that many hours of anxious discussion and inquiry have been spent in that task by the Government, with all the necessary statistics available, including what has been done in other countries similar to ours, <Col N="2526" /> what has been tried, what has failed and what has succeeded.  We have had all the facts and figures before us that would help us to come to a decision, and I can assure the House it is no easy task to arrive at a just and fair price to the community and to the farmer for butter, milk, wheat, beet and other agricultural produce.  The same applies to other industries.</P>
    <P>The agricultural index figure has practically doubled since 1939.  The cost of some things has more than doubled.  In 1939, over the 12 months milk was 5.3 pence sold to creameries, per gallon; at present it is 1/-.  Farmers' butter in 1939 was 1/0½d.; now it is 2/4 retail, at the price generally paid by purchasers.  The average per barrel for wheat was 29/7; it is now 48/6, plus a credit voucher of 2/6 for fertilisers.  It is scarcely necessary to quote further figures.  Oats was 12/8 and is now 35/-; sugar beet was 46/6 and is now 80/-.  The agricultural price index figure of 100 in 1939 was practically 200 in December last.</P>
    <P>I do not say that any of the amounts given to the farmer are too much.  I do not think anybody would say that, but if, for example, the price of beet went up by another 5/-, that would add to the cost of sugar.  At present, Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann, as a result of the price of beet last year and the fact that they were not allowed to increase the price of sugar, would have had to close its doors, if it were not a Government concern.  It is not paying: it is many hundreds of thousands of pounds on the wrong side.  I remember putting a tax of 1/2d. on sugar three years ago, and there was a howl from every side of the House against such a shocking thing.  There were cries about the injury to the poor, and particularly to children.</P>
    <P>You have to take that angle of the matter into consideration when you are considering the price of beet.  You may say: &ldquo;Let the Government pay the difference.&rdquo;  If they do that, it has to come out of somebody's pocket, too, and up goes the cost of living. Eventually, the farmer is paying, and <Col N="2527" /> it is just like &ldquo;feeding the dog with his own tail.&rdquo;  That is what is happening when extra money is paid to the farmer for wheat and beet.  I am not saying that, in present circumstances, he is, perhaps, not entitled to more, to encourage him to see the nation through these dangerous and difficult times.  But we have to look at the other side of the story and try as conscientious people, as I suggest we are in the Government, to balance one side of the balance sheet against the other and be fair to the community as a whole.  That is what we try to do.</P>
    <P>Up to the present, the farming community have stood well by this nation. We have not got all the wheat necessary to feed our population from them any year yet.  But they have made extraordinary strides in the growing of cereals, particularly wheat, compared with what was usual before the war. Deputy Linehan, in a very excellent speech to-day, advised us not to go over past history.  I think he was wise. The discussions we used to have, first of all, as to whether wheat could be grown in this country at all, and secondly, as to whether it was wise to grow it, are all past history now.  We are all agreed that wheat should be grown here.  Last year there was a big drop in the acreage under wheat. For the country's welfare, I hope that the 67,000 acres which we were short last year will be made up and that there will be another 100,000 acres along with that, because, unless we get that, people may have to go without bread.  No matter how willing our sailors may be to brave the oceans, circumstances may make it impossible to bring in the balance of the wheat necessary to make up the difference between what was grown last year and what we need.  We may not be able to bring in that this year.  It is as well that the farmers should know that and be encouraged to stand by the nation, as the farming community, to their credit, stood by the nation through this time of danger and difficulty so far.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, as Minister for <Col N="2528" /> Finance I try to be conscientious and to be a good guardian of the Exchequer.  I have to admit that I do not think I am as good a fighter for the Exchequer as my predecessor was. He was a more vigorous watchdog so far as the Exchequer was concerned. Anybody who had to get money from him had to make a good fight and make an excellent case for it.  I am afraid I am not always as vigilant as he was.  But I try to be conscientious and to see to it that the hard-earned money that the income-tax collectors, who are officers of the Dáil and the Government, have to screw out of our people of all classes is not spent uselessly. I think I would not be doing my duty to the Dáil and to the people if I did not do my best, at any rate, to defend the Exchequer against the inroads that every day of the year are attempted to be made upon it for, perhaps, one good cause or another. Somebody has to act as devil's advocate and somebody has to try to make people, even with good cases, prove their case before their hand is allowed to go into the public purse.  I think the House will agree that that is right and proper.  I try to do that. We do it with the farmers, we do it with the workers, we do it with everybody. Sometimes I find it hard to bear the reproaches of civil servants.  No class in the community has been made to suffer more directly than they have. By contract with the Government they were entitled to the benefit of the cost-of-living bonus.  That was stabilised and the Exchequer and the taxpayers have reaped a benefit amounting to about £1,500,000 per year owing to the sacrifices made by civil servants.  Then the Standstill Order with regard to wages has caused hardship.  We have to think of all these things before we can be generous to any class of the community. If it can be proved to be necessary that the prices paid to any one class should be increased in order to get the produce that is necessary to keep the country going during the emergency, then we will have to meet that.  But I say to every class of the community that they will have to make a very good case when going to the Government or to the Minister for Finance and prove with facts and <Col N="2529" /> figures that their claim is a just one before any increases are permitted.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan drew a most depressing picture yesterday of the prevalence of malnutrition, of the spread of tuberculosis and rickets and, above all, the increase of criminality in recent years.  He laid all the responsibility for the spread of these diseases and the increase of crime at the door of the Government.  I do not think there is one man in this House, no matter how hostile he may be to the Government, who believes that that is true, and that it is right to lay the responsibility for these things at the door of the Government.  I am older than most people in this House and I am longer in public life than any man in this House, longer elected to public office than any man in this House, and I have never known a time when there was not malnutrition in this country. I have known times when there were more bare-footed children in the City of Dublin than there are now.  There is nothing to boast of in that.  I have known times when there was a greater amount of tuberculosis in this City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>Great strides have been made even in the last 20 years in the eradication of tuberculosis and malnutrition. When I first became a member of the Dublin Corporation in January, 1906, 38 years ago, there were no such things as child welfare schemes.  There were no such things as places for expectant mothers.  I am not exaggerating by saying that possibly not one-tenth of the amount now spent on welfare schemes of that kind by the Dublin Corporation was spent at that time, although 50 per cent. of the expenditure is paid by the Government, both by the last Government and by this Government.  With the spread of modern ideas, these services tend to become more widespread and cost a good deal more now than, say, ten years ago.</P>
    <P>There has been undoubtedly an increase of crime, especially among children.  Times such as these always lead to tendencies of that kind.  Times of difficulty and danger, times when the minds of people are upset, as they are at present, lead to people taking steps <Col N="2530" /> and doing things that are not normal. That is responsible for the spread of crime, especially amongst youth, during these later years.  Efforts are being made to cope with that in recent times, and I hope that whatever finances are necessary to develop efforts in that direction will be forthcoming. It is not fair that even such a bitterly hostile critic as Deputy McGilligan should lay the responsibility for these things, that are purely accidental, purely crimes arising out of the unsettled conditions due to the war and the war atmosphere, at our doors, any more than at the doors or at the feet of any member of this Assembly.</P>
    <P>This debate covered, as I said earlier, a very wide ambit.  Many subjects were mentioned and I am afraid that even if I had the energy to-night, which I am afraid I have not&mdash;I am tired&mdash;it would take me a long time to cover even one-quarter of the variety of topics raised.  There are a few more, however, upon which I shall touch. Firstly, in regard to turf, it is certainly the blessing of God that we have turf because, just as I said earlier that we may not find it possible to transport wheat across the ocean, coal likewise may not be available.  Very little coal has been available in this country for some time.  Deputies who read the newspapers, and I am sure all Deputies do, will see that in the greatest home of coal in the world, in Great Britain, there is a great shortage of coal. Therefore, it is natural to expect that when Britain herself is in difficulties for coal, neutral Ireland will not be on the priority list anyway.  It is a Godsend, therefore, that we have turf.  We have got in since the war started, every week and every month, considerable quantities of coal from England. We cannot forget that.  Even when she has been in difficulties herself we got coal and, without the coal which we have been getting, we would have been in sore straits.  It is well to remember that.  It is natural to expect that as these difficulties of hers grow at home we may get less.  I appeal to everybody, therefore, who can influence the cutting and the saving of turf this year, to encourage everybody to cut it either for himself, his neighbour or a <Col N="2531" /> local authority and to cut as much turf as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin, to my mind, made a very serious charge against the officials of local authorities last night in speaking on this question of the quantity and quality of turf cut, saved and transported. The turf to which he referred was cut under the direction of the officials of the local authority at the request of the Government.  I used to know the county surveyors very well when I was in charge of the Local Government Department, but I do not now know who is county surveyor in Laoighis, the place to which Deputy Davin referred last night.  I think there has been a change since I was in the Local Government Department.  I do not know that the present county surveyor is a man who is acquainted with turf production, but I know that most of the county surveyors are men who were born in rural Ireland.  One or two of them are men who were born in cities or towns but most of them were born in turf areas.</P>
    <P>Even if they were not acquainted with turf production themselves, they employed as assistants or gangers men who had a good knowledge of turf production. The Government or its officials did not go down to these counties to supervise the cutting of turf.  Maybe they should have done so. I remember hearing my late colleague and friend, the former Parliamentary Secretary, God rest his soul, Deputy Hugo Flinn, speaking on one of these Votes, stating that he had given instructions that the turf was to be examined by some person qualified to examine it at the railhead before it was put on wagons to be sent to Dublin.  Perhaps his orders were not carried out, but I did hear him tell the House a couple of years ago that such orders were given by him.  Perhaps they were overlooked in the case to which Deputy Davin referred.</P>

      <P>Indeed, I am not, but I do say that, if it is not, it is largely the responsibility of those who undertook the job of producing it for the local authorities or for the Government through the local authorities.  I have found the officials of local authorities generally competent men and the work of selecting bogs and cutting turf was in most cases superintended by gangers employed by the county surveyors.  Most of these men would be men, certainly in turf districts, who would be acquainted with turf production and would know good turf from bad turf.  I was asked for the figures with regard to turf costings. These have already been given in the House.  The average price f.o.r. is 39/10.

      <P>This Government had the responsibility placed upon it by the people and the Dáil of guiding the country through difficult and dangerous times.  Even during the emergency, we had a general election.  The result of that election was that the Government were returned to office. Evidently, the people and the Dáil were satisfied with the manner in which the Government had discharged the onerous and responsible duties imposed upon them by reason of the emergency.  The Government are prepared to carry on.  They are men of knowledge and ability&mdash;as good as any that could be got in this House.  They <Col N="2535" /> are men of courage, men with records and pasts that can be inquired into. They are known.  They are prepared to carry on, to meet this House and to listen to its criticisms.  We are a minority Government here.  By uniting at any time against the Fianna Fáil Party, Opposition Parties can put the Government out.  If the Government do not do what the people wish and what they think is proper and right to guide this country through the shoals before us&mdash;they guided it safely in the past&mdash;they can be removed. But we have guided the State well.  We have guided the ship safely.  We took the risk of declaring neutrality in the name of the people and of the Oireachtas.  Very few persons thought we would see 4½ years of neutrality safely through.  With a Dáil united on that matter, we have got safely so far.  It was most encouraging and heartening to me, as one member of the Government, to hear from all sides of the House tributes during the past two days to the manner in which this country has been guided through the difficulties and dangers of the past four years.  Every Party in the House deserves its share of credit for that, because all Parties have assisted.  They have criticised, as is their right and their due, details of policy but, when anybody seeks to interfere with the welfare of the people and of the State, then they act as one man, as demonstrated here yesterday and to-day.  When such a big issue is raised, all Parties in the Dáil rise to defend the liberties of the country.  It is certainly heartening and gives us courage to continue the responsible task that you have placed on our shoulders.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The question, in the form in which I had framed and addressed it to the Taoiseach, had to do with a particular prosecution that took place before Christmas in connection with illegal traffic in sugar.  In the District Court two men were found guilty and given sentences of imprisonment. The matter then came before the Circuit Court on appeal.  The hearing of the appeal disclosed certain other facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appeared from the evidence given in the Circuit Court that one of those gentlemen who, unfortunately, has died since, said that he had consulted an official of the Department of Supplies to see whether, in fact, he could traffic in this sugar in the way in which he intended, and that he had been assured by the official that he could traffic in this way: that it was perfectly legal.  The suggestion was made that since the sugar had come into this person's hands before the control Order came into being traffic in it was permissible.  The worst <Col N="2538" /> feature of it was that it was stated&mdash; as showing this official's <i>bona fides&mdash;</i> that he had contracted to purchase and had, in fact, purchased 2 cwt. of the sugar in question in respect of which the two accused men were found guilty and sentenced to imprisonment.  One was removed to jail and the other accused man died on the morning on which he was to have gone to jail.</P>
    <P>A further point emerged in the evidence taken in the Circuit Court. It was that when certain inspectors were sent to investigate the matter, this accused man, who has since died, told them that his excuse for certain action of his was the advice of a prominent official in the Department of Supplies who had assured him that the traffic was legal.  Whatever then happened is somewhat under a cloud, but it is clear that no part of that statement, with reference to that official, appeared in the signed statement eventually produced in court from which it was clear that this accused man had said that that was the situation.  All these facts were brought out in the Circuit Court, and the judge, when eventually confirming the sentence given in the lower court, made the remark that he hoped that the official in question would be given an opportunity of explaining his conduct and attitude towards the whole matter.</P>
    <P>I put down, in the question to the Taoiseach, the substance of what I have just said.  Having said that these were the allegations made, I asked if there was anybody aware that these allegations were made, and if they were whether, in fact, they were true. I asked if this official had been prosecuted or whether there was any intention of prosecuting him, and if not, why not.</P>
    <P>I asked further if that official had been affected in any way in his pay, promotion or status on account of his conduct which had been called in question; I asked what is his present position, and what were the various steps in the promotion by which he arrived at that position, with dates that would indicate the more spectacular rises that he might have got.  I had intended to ask, by way of supplementary <Col N="2539" /> question, whether that official was, in fact, still in a position in which he might give the same wrong advice, as it turned out to be wrong advice, to other people who might consult him, and whether he was in a position to make purchases which, so far as civilians are concerned, are held to be illegal, and if discrimination was to be made between ordinary citizens and a State officer.  I requested to be informed whether there is any policy of discrimination between State officials and members of the public.</P>
    <P>Because I had raised that general question as a matter of policy, I thought it right to address my question to the Taoiseach.  I do not know how many conferences I had about the question.  At the end I had a conference with the Ceann Comhairle, and was told that it was not considered a question that should be addressed to the Head of the Government, but should be addressed to the Minister for Supplies.  I insisted that it made very little difference to me what the Minister for Supplies thinks about the prosecution of individuals.  I would understand that to be a matter for the Attorney-General, and that if any Minister answered for it it might possibly be the Minister for Justice.  I also said I was not concerned with what attitude the Minister for Supplies might take up as to whether this official had been penalised in any way because if he had that, clearly, would have been a matter for the Minister for Finance in whose Department is the Chief Establishment Officer.  This would be an establishment matter, and if any disciplinary measures were taken against that man they might be taken through the hands of the Minister for Supplies, but he would be merely acting for the Minister for Finance in the matter.  I am certainly not concerned to know what the Minister for Supplies thinks about Government policy in connection with discrimination, but if there is such a policy then I want to know what the Head of the Government thinks about it.  I consider that my question was properly framed.  It led up to the climax in which the pivotal point was whether, in fact, citizens were to be <Col N="2540" /> treated in the same way as State officials, or whether there is any question of discrimination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, I am entitled to say this: I tried to get the question answered by the Head of the Government, as it was dealing with a matter of Government policy, of discrimination between citizens.  I am entitled to say that the Ceann Comhairle refused to accept it in that form.  That is all I am stating&mdash;facts.  With regard to these facts, certain Deputies have been speaking here on the subject of democracy as a form of government, and they have asserted that, particularly at the present time, when we are ruled by Emergency Powers Orders, the two great weapons still left unblunted in the hands of Deputies are (1) the method of Parliamentary <Col N="2541" /> motion, and (2) the method of Parliamentary question.  I put down a question. If that question was to appear in the form in which it was to leave the Ceann Comhairle's office, it would have been a very blunted sort of performance that would have been operated by that particular question.</P>
      <P>I suggest that in these days, when this House gives the Government every possible latitude, when measures are given to them almost without any discussion, when we have got into the habit of very infrequent meetings of the House, and when we have got used to what is almost a practice now, when the House is not in session, of announcements of a crisis being made over the wireless&mdash;I think in all these circumstances, when Emergency Powers Orders are impacted on citizens at every hour of the day, there might be some latitude with regard to these rules under which questions are manipulated in the way in which I suggest mine was treated.  I asked if I could get the substantial matter of the question discussed here to-night and if I could get to know what are the facts with regard to this official, whether he gave wrong advice or whether there was a wrong purchase from other citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This question was put down for answer, when I first thought of it, about a fortnight ago.  When I was having my discussion with the Ceann Comhairle and his officials, I was told I might as well postpone the question for a bit, because the situation was still <i>sub judice.</i>  It was a gorgeous phrase to use in the circumstances, my whole complaint being that the citizen faces a judge and the civil servant does not face a judge.  I was told this man's case was still being examined. Examined by whom?  By members of the Government?  By other civil servants? It is going to be discussed in this House.  I suggest that if there is any case as against a civil servant, that civil servant should go before the same tribunal that the citizen goes before, and that a judge regularly appointed under our Constitution should have the right to hear his case on the same terms as he hears the citizen's case, and to impose on him <Col N="2542" /> the same penalties that the citizen is liable to, and that the only defence open to a civil servant should be the type of defence open to the ordinary citizen.</P>
    <P>Part of the question sought information as to whether there was any intention of amending the Emergency Powers Acts so as to allow the absence of a criminal intention to be pleaded by civilians in court proceedings. That cannot be done.  Over and over again it has been the experience of members practising at the Bar, in the cases of people who have done something contrary to the Emergency Powers Orders, that when you take a certain line in the examination of a witness you are told that there is no use in proceeding further along that line, as it is only leading to the point where a person did not know what he was doing or that he had no guilty intention. Has the civil servant the right to make a defence that he has no guilty intention, or that what he did was an error of judgement, or is he in the position that he has a different tribunal, different people to face, different witnesses against him, no public inquiry, and penalties very much lighter than those which may be imposed on an ordinary citizen?  In this case the man got six months and he died as a result of the sentence. The civil servant has never yet made his appearance before the courts.  I want to know what has happened in his case.</P>

With regard to my statement to the Deputy, I did not intend it for discussion in this House, but I do not object to its being mentioned in the House.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make it quite clear that, so far as the Government are concerned, there was no objection to answering now, or even a fortnight ago, any question that Deputy McGilligan chose to ask.  The only difficulty that arose was the purely technical point relating to the form of his question, which he discussed solely with the Ceann Comhairle.  If there was any difficulty which delayed him putting it on the Order Paper, it was one arising from the Standing Orders of the House.  I do not care what questions the Deputy wants to ask, and I certainly am prepared to answer such questions at any time.</P>
      <P>If I have any objection to the question which the Deputy proposes to ask, it is that upon the basis of a complete distortion of the facts he was making insinuations and assumptions which were completely unjustified.  I think the House will very easily grasp the facts in this case.  When the two men to whom Deputy McGilligan referred were being prosecuted, one of them stated that he had been assured by a Government official that it was legal for him to deliver, after the date upon which rationing came into operation, sugar which he had sold before that. First of all, let me state that the official concerned was not an official of the Department of Supplies.  He was an official of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  And in case any Deputies might think there is a connection between the Department of Supplies and the Department of Industry and Commerce because they are at present housed in the same building and subject to the same Minister, at the time this happened they were neither housed in the same building nor under the same Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I saw that statement reported in the newspapers, I made inquiries and got the facts.  I find the facts are <Col N="2544" /> very different from those which Deputy McGilligan implied in his question and implied in his statement here to-day.  I may say, before I give the facts, that an official of the Department of Supplies who was present at the court when the statement was made communicated with his senior officer by telephone; that officer communicated with me and I directed the official concerned to go forthwith to the court for the purpose of answering any statement that had been made. The official proceeded to the court, but he arrived there after the case had concluded and he did not get an opportunity of dealing with the statement.</P>
    <P>I think the House is fairly familiar with the facts of the case.  A quantity of sugar was purchased early in 1941. It was purchased, according to the statement made by the person who conducted the transaction, in anticipation that there would be an increase in the duty on sugar under the Budget. He found there was no such increase and he had sugar in his possession in excess of his requirements.  It is necessary to remember that all this happened three years ago, at a time when there was no scarcity of sugar. Although control of the sale of sugar was introduced in August, 1941, it was not because there was a scarcity of sugar then.  That control was introduced primarily for the purpose of preventing the illegal export of sugar across the Border.  The rationing of sugar on the coupon basis occurred much later.  Consequently, when this person found himself with a quantity of sugar in excess of his requirements, he had no means of disposing of it. It was not then a commodity which was scarce and for which there was a demand.  It was not a commodity which was scarce, or in great demand, and which could be sold at an increased price.  At that time, the difficulty was in getting rid of it.  According to the information which became available in the course of investigation, subsequently, a small proportion of that sugar was disposed of by him to relatives, personal friends, and employees in his business, and this official of the Department of Industry and Commerce purchased some of it.  There was, as I have explained, no restriction <Col N="2545" /> at the time on the sale or purchase of sugar; no illegality was committed and, consequently, there was no question of proceedings being taken against those persons, including the Government official, who had made these purchases.  In the case of this Government official, the sugar was, in fact, delivered to him a short time after the introduction of the rationing scheme in August, but there was nothing in the Government Order which prevented the delivery of sugar which had been purchased before the rationing scheme came into force.  The statement made by the individual who was charged was that he had asked this official, during a casual conversation, whether there was anything to prevent him from delivering, after the introduction of rationing, sugar which had been purchased before rationing came in, and that the official's statement was that he did not believe there was: that there was no illegality in the delivery, so far as he was aware, but that the proper course for the individual to take was to inquire from the Department of Supplies.</P>
    <P>I refuse to believe that two persons, one of whom had a professional position, which obliged him to know exactly what the Government regulations concerning sugar were, and whose professional business it was to advise other people upon these regulations, and the other of whom was the secretary of a company, whose duty it was to know about these regulations and to advise his employees accordingly, should be dependent, or should have acted subsequently, on information casually obtained from an official of another Department, who knew nothing whatsoever about it.  The two persons concerned in the case mentioned by Deputy McGilligan were charged, not with an offence committed in 1941, but with an offence committed in 1942, at which time it was illegal for them to sell sugar without a licence.  That was the offence with which they were charged and convicted, and the persons to whom they sold sugar illegally were also prosecuted and convicted.</P>
    <P>Now, the Deputy stated to-day that it came out in evidence in court that <Col N="2546" /> the inspectors of the Department of Supplies induced the said accused to omit from the statements they made all reference to this official.  When I saw that allegation with regard to officials of the Department, I had these officials summoned from their duty to the head office, and they were asked if any such incident had occurred.  They denied, emphatically, that any such incident had occurred. The Deputy, in his question, alleged that it was stated in evidence in court that these officials had so acted.  I emphatically deny that it was stated in the court that these people said that it had happened.  There is no evidence of that, and the senior inspector of the Department of Supplies, who was present in the court during the whole of the proceedings, stated that he had heard no such statement. The officials who conducted the inquiry stated that they made no attempt to influence the accused persons in the matter of their statement, whether from the point of view of the inclusion in or the exclusion of anything from the statement.</P>
    <P>Let me say this&mdash;because I think it is necessary to say it in order to clarify the position&mdash;that there were two statements, the first of which was one denying their guilt, and the second was the one which was produced in court.  As I have said, the first statement was one completely denying any guilt on their part, and I am informed that it is the normal practice in police court cases, and it is also the practice of the Department of Supplies, that where there are two conflicting statements of that kind, the earlier statement is not produced in court because it is assumed that the production of conflicting statements would unduly prejudice the case against the accused.  That has been the practice here for many years, and that is the reason why the first statement by the accused was not produced. The statement contained no reference to Government officials having had any transaction in the previous year, which was 1941, and in connection with which there was no illegality whatsoever. The official concerned, therefore, was not prosecuted, simply because he had <Col N="2547" /> not committed any offence.  As I have said, the persons who were concerned as purchasers of the sugar in 1942 were also prosecuted.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, no discrimination between State officials and the general public in the matter of prosecutions for offences.  I think that the fact that some State officials have, in the course of the past four years, been prosecuted for offences under Emergency Powers Orders, is proof to the contrary. I think I have stated all the facts, but may I say this: that apart from the circumstances of this case, I think that as a general rule it is undesirable that State officials, no matter how much they may be within the law, should have commercial dealings of an unusual character with persons with whom they have had or may have official contact.  That aspect of this case is one that is being considered.</P>
    <P>There is one further general remark that I should like to make before I conclude.  I think that Deputies should be slow to attack State officials here.  State officials are in an unusual position.  They are not merely unable to protect themselves, by reason of the general privileges extending to Deputies of this House, but they cannot even reply to charges against them made outside this House.  In that respect, they are different from other members of the community, who can use the public Press or other resources in order to refute charges made against them.  Public officials cannot do that. Such publicity is debarred to them, and, therefore, I think that as a general rule Deputies should be slow to make charges against public officials, since they are not in the same position as Deputies who, after all, are fair game, or ordinary members of the public who can defend themselves.  In this particular case, when reference was made in the court to this matter, the charges were fully investigated and the circumstances were as I have described.  There was no offence and no irregularity on the part of the official concerned in this respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to preface my remarks by saying that I agree with the Minister for Supplies with regard to the making of unfounded accusations against civil servants, but I want to know what is the Government policy concerning secretaries of Departments or officers junior to secretaries who are serving in that capacity and, at the same time, serving as either directors or managing directors of public companies, of companies such as Irish Shipping, <Col N="2551" /> Limited.  One civil servant does exercise such functions&mdash;a man of the highest integrity&mdash;and I do not for one moment want to be taken as making any accusation similar to the wholly-unfounded accusation made here by Deputy Flanagan.</P>
      <P>The secretary of the Department of Supplies acts as chairman of the Millers' Control Committee, and I should like to know what is the general Government policy with regard to that.  I should like to say this that, whether or not any cases have come to light, there is an impression, or there is likely to be an impression, that an official in that capacity, acting as he must act or may be likely to act, at the same time, in a discretionary capacity, due to his high office in the Department, may be placed in an invidious position and, as the matter has been raised, I think we should have an authoritative explanation of Government policy in that regard.</P>
      <P>Some individual may, at some time, have occasion to look for a licence or for some facility to which he is entitled from the Department.  He may see a company, whether private or public, receiving a benefit, and while on the merits of the case that company may be entitled to the full benefit and he may not be entitled to any benefit, the fact that the idea gets abroad that, because of the association with it of an individual who is, at the same time, an officer of the Department, influence may be exerted, will have, in my opinion, a detrimental effect on the Civil Service as a whole.</P>
      <P>I know from my own information that what the Minister has said concerning the secretary of the Department of Supplies and the particular company is absolutely a fact, and I deprecate the making of unfounded accusations, but I think the position should be cleared up because that particular officer may be placed in an invidious position due to the fact that he is chairman of the Millers' Control Committee, and chairman of Irish Shipping, Limited, and, at the same time, secretary of the Department of Supplies.</P>

      <P>The appointment of the secretary of the Department of Supplies as chairman of Irish Shipping, Ltd., was due to the fact that it was necessary, in relation to that company on its formation, to ensure that its policy developed in accordance with the Government's intentions.  Normally, we would have sought somebody with experience of the shipping business, but having regard to the peculiar circumstances here, we could not regard any such person available to us as disinterested, and, furthermore, difficulties would have arisen in making a selection as between personnel from the boards of existing companies. May I say that the chairman of the company receives no remuneration for acting in that capacity?  The Millers' Control Committee is in a somewhat different position.  I was not anxious that the secretary should act as chairman of that body.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Control Committee, as the House may not know, is established for the purpose of regulating the business of the flour-milling industry during the emergency.  It was necessary to eliminate the unnecessary transportation of wheat from the areas in which it was grown, or the merchants who purchased it, to flour millers, to ensure that the wheat from a particular district went to the nearest mill and that the flour from that mill was sold in the area adjacent to the mill. There was, as it were, a rationalisation of the collection of grain and the distribution of flour.  Furthermore, under the subsidy arrangement, it is necessary to ensure that there will be agreement among the millers as a whole to the distribution between themselves of <Col N="2553" /> a proportion of the total proceeds of the industry which constitutes the 6 percent. on capital which they are entitled to earn.  Unfortunately, we could not get agreement on any other chairman, and the only proposal which the committee would accept was one involving what I hoped would be the temporary chairmanship of the secretary of the Department.  In order to get the scheme working, they agreed to that. In practice, I think he rarely presides at the meetings now, but the situation in which he is chairman of the committee has continued in operation since then.  Again, there is no question of any remuneration attaching to the post.</P>

      <P>Supplementary to the Minister's reply, in connection with Irish Shipping, Limited, I understood from the reply the Minister gave to-day that if, say, the firm of Messrs. Wm. and P. Thompson were applying for shipping space, the secretary of the Department had no function?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No function whatever. May I say that it is the standard practice in the Civil Service&mdash;certainly in the Departments of the Civil Service with which I am acquainted&mdash;that where any official has any association of any kind with a firm doing business with the Department&mdash;that association need not necessarily be a financial one; the firm may be the property of a relative or may be managed by a relative&mdash;that official, even if in the normal course it would come within his official duties, does not deal with the matter.  In relation to any business which the firm of Messrs.  Thompson and Co. have to do with the Department of Supplies, the secretary of the Department does not see the papers, nor is he in any way consulted concerning the matter.  The firm have, in fact, very little business with the Department of Supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The allocation of shipping space for the importation of prunes, which was the matter raised to-day, is a routine matter.  It is occasionally possible to give shipping space for the importation of prunes and everybody interested in that importation of prunes gets an allocation of space.  The <Col N="2554" /> actual quantity of prunes imported by this firm, since the importation of prunes was resumed, represents only a very small fraction of the total importation. The granting of export licences is, of course, in accordance with normal practice, by which firms doing an export business, like brewers and distillers, and so forth, are facilitated in maintaining their export connection during the emergency.</P>

      <Col N="2559" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the question which I raised and which was discussed on the Second Reading, of course, one gets accustomed to this attitude with regard to the Civil Service, but there are times when it passes the bounds of honesty, and I think to-night is one of those occasions. This House has grown up in the tradition that civil servants, in the main, are people who cannot answer back and, therefore, that it is not fair to attack them, as they have not the ordinary rights of a human being of meeting the attack with a reply.  We have drifted into the stage in which the anonymity of civil servants has now become their great strength.  Life has been made more chaotic than ordinarily it is by the civil servants operating at every hand's turn on people's lives, with their being protected by anonymity, so that people do not know against whom they are operating.</P>
      <P>In any event, I have been making most careful inquiries regarding this case and I have refrained from giving the official's name.  My description, even if it is a misdescription, is that he is &ldquo;in a particular Department&rdquo; and I have tried to preserve his anonymity. I made inquiries and verified every item I have down in the question, from people who were in court. I was not content to verify it from merely one person, but I got corroborative evidence on every point.  What am I to do?  The Civil Service cannot be attacked, but an allegation is made with regard to a civil servant in open court and at the end of the case the judge is moved to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I hope the official mentioned will be given some opportunity to explain his position.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is, in any event, such a situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How can a Deputy raise that point? Surely it is by putting down a question in the form in which I put one down&mdash;&ldquo;Is somebody aware that in connection with a particular prosecution it was stated in court....&rdquo;  I <Col N="2560" /> say that and then put the statement or allegation and then I go on to ask my question, as originally drafted: &ldquo;whether in fact the official had purchased the sugar and had given the particular assurance that the traffic was legal.&rdquo;  How can I raise this matter? Is the Civil Service going to be so entirely protected that we are to be dumb in this House with regard to such a matter?</P>
    <P>If there are any rights in this matter, surely I must raise this question. I suggest that I have raised it in the most careful manner possible.  It is agreed that the official did make a purchase. We are told now, of course, that it was in regard to sugar that was not really the subject matter for prosecution. From what is told to him, the Minister is satisfied that no crime was committed.  I do not care what the Minister thinks: it is a question for the law officer.  Why should the judge not take some cognisance of what the official did?  There were two accused persons.  That is what is annoying people.  These officials are being sent around the country to turn things inside out and they have to get something. They are in the nature of <i>agents provocatures.</i>  They go around snooping to see whether people are overcharging or whether they are selling things they should not sell or whether they are selling without licences.  There is a feeling, often expressed in court, that these officials decide these matters.  Here was a case where an official definitely told a man his sale would be legal.  It was also stated in court definitely&mdash;and I am informed was agreed to by the inspector &mdash;that he had sought this advice and got an assurance from the official that his transactions were legal.  The Minister tells us he is satisfied that a man of the standing of this accused person &mdash;now dead&mdash;would not need to fall back on the assurance of such a person. Whether he had to or not, I say it was stated in court that he did go looking for advice and got such advice. The official backed up the assurance to the man by purchasing sugar.</P>
    <P>With regard to the inspectors, I queried that point with the greatest <Col N="2561" /> particularity and this was certainly what occurred in court.  The inspector, in cross-examination, agreed that this accused man had stated at some time that he had sought the assurance from this official, which was verified by this official's purchase of sugar. He recited that, whether he did it or not and, because that statement was not in the document produced in court, the official was asked to explain it and admitted that it was beyond all question that this unfortunate man certainly had stated to the man investigating that he went to the official with the subject-matter of this question and had got an assurance from him.  There is no doubt about it that that statement nowhere appears in the document as signed by him. Why was it omitted?  When people are sent to make an investigation, they put questions and take down the answers and put the result in narrative form.  When a man offers a statement, there has to be some good reason why it is omitted.  It possibly is that the word &ldquo;induced&rdquo; is a wrong word to have used in the question, but there is an omission.  How did it occur?  That is a substantial matter.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, I understand that, when the point was raised in court, it would appear&mdash;I do not think any statement was made about this&mdash; that the presiding authority in that particular court deemed it to be a much more grave thing, that something admitted, even stated, had disappeared from the statement.  Then, whether what was said was true or not, these are two things which cannot be denied.  I say that a denial may come to me here but, with regard to my position as a Deputy, I was not content to go to one person alone in this connection, but I had it verified in a variety of ways and got it brought down to very fine points of detail and I checked up on those details.  I got at least corroborative evidence from more than one person in respect of every item in the question.  I suggest there is something here to which the Minister has to reply&mdash;whether it is admitted by the inspectors that, at some stage or another, they heard from this accused man these assertions; <Col N="2562" /> and, if it is a fact that these assertions do not appear in the final statement, some reason must be given as to why they were omitted.  That is what I want to know.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can answer the Deputy's question quite easily.  I must not have made the picture clear to him or the House when speaking previously.  The accused person had ten tons of sugar which he purchased on speculation early in 1941 and which he was under a difficulty in disposing of when he wished to do so.  There was, as I have said, at the time no scarcity of sugar and consequently no reason why people should buy sugar from this individual rather than from their regular suppliers.  He succeeded in disposing of a small quantity of that ten tons of sugar&mdash;a quantity less than half a ton&mdash;in his personal sales, before sugar rationing came into operation. In relation to that sale of sugar by him, or the purchase of that sugar by the individuals concerned, there was no offence and, consequently, no prosecution lay either against the people who purchased the sugar or against the person subsequently accused for the sale of that quantity of sugar.  In the following year he sold the remaining 9½ tons illegally and to persons who purchased it illegally, and was able to do so because the circumstances had by then fundamentally changed.  In the following year, there was a scarcity of sugar. There was a formal rationing scheme in operation and people were disposed to adopt irregular methods in order to get sugar in excess of the ration.  It is with the offence of selling sugar in 1942 that these two men were charged and, as I have said already, those to whom they sold the sugar were also charged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan, in a very formidable-sounding statement, said that this individual sought an assurance from the official in question as to his right to dispose of the sugar.  In fact, he asked him the question during the course of a game of golf.  Is it seriously suggested that this secretary of an important company, who had regular contacts with Government <Col N="2563" /> Departments and knew where to go for advice, would, in the course of a game of golf, ask a casual question of an official of another Department relating to sugar rationing and then, 12 months later, act as if the reply given to that question still represented sound advice in the circumstances then existing?  Anyone who likes to believe that can do so.  In any event, while I think the official was ill-advised even to offer a suggestion on a matter affecting another Department, the opinion which he is reported to have offered was correct at that time.  That was in June, 1941, before sugar was rationed at all and 12 months before the offences with which the two men were subsequently charged were committed. I can say also that the law advisers of the Government were consulted and did formally advise that no prosecution lay against the persons who had purchased the sugar in 1941.</P>
    <P>There is a further suggestion by Deputy McGilligan that the inspectors of the Department of Supplies who dealt with this matter subsequently acted irregularly in the sense that they sought to secure the deletion from the statement made by the accused person of the name of an official because it would be embarrassing to the Department or for some other reason.  I have stated that the chief senior inspector of the Department of Supplies was present in court during the whole of the proceedings and he assures me that he heard no statement made in evidence to the effect that there had been a previous statement by the accused person containing the name of the official; and the two inspectors who took the statements have testified to me that neither of them ever indicated to any person concerned in the transactions that it would be embarrassing or undesirable to mention the transaction in which the official was involved.  They stated definitely that there was no mention of the official's name in either statement, and that the question of mentioning that name had not been raised in any way by either of the two accused persons.  I am prepared to take the statement of these two <Col N="2564" /> officials, who had no interest in this matter.  As a matter of fact, when that official's name was mentioned as an official of the Department of Supplies, their first response was that there was no such person in the Department of Supplies&mdash;nor was there&mdash; that they never heard of the official in question and, consequently, would have no interest whatever in suppressing any information concerning him. Nor did they, in fact, do so, because the full reports of these officials were available to the Department, the books of the firm were available to the Department, and extracts from these books, containing the records of the transactions, are still available in the Department and they show all these transactions.</P>

      <P>In the Circuit Court.  Does not the Minister understand <Col N="2566" /> that witnesses are heard in the Circuit Court on appeal?</P>

      <P>The case was a complete rehearing.  Every witness who appeared below had to appear above.  Does the Minister say that his object was not that the official should be paraded as a witness?</P>

      <P>I received a telephone message to the effect that the name of this official had been mentioned as having been involved in this transaction. I did not know what the reference in the court had been.  I merely said: &ldquo;Tell him to go there straight away and give the court any assistance it requires.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Minister said that the conversation in question took place during a game of golf before the rationing of sugar came in?</P>

      <P>Why should a person who was accused in the case speak to an official about any transaction before rationing came in?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The conversation, it is alleged, occurred in August, 1941, just after the rationing came into operation. The purchase of the sugar took place before that and the delivery afterwards, which was not an offence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that if any ordinary individual got sugar from any wholesaler or retailer after the rationing, he would be guilty of an offence?</P>
