      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £377,600, be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1945, for Wound and Disability Pensions, Further Pensions and Married Pensions, Allowances and Gratuities (No. 26 of 1923, No. 12 of 1927, No. 24 of 1932, No. 15 of 1937, No. 2 of 1941 and No. 14 of 1943), Military Service Pensions, Allowances and Gratuities (No. 48 of 1924, No. 26 of 1932, No. 43 of 1934 and No. 33 of 1938), Pensions, Allowances and Gratuities (No. 37 of 1936); Payments in respect of Compensation for Members of the Local Defence Force (No. 28 of 1939); and for sundry Contributions and Expenses in respect thereof, etc.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decrease of £65,407 in the Army Pensions Vote for the financial year 1944-45 is mainly due to a decrease in the number of awards under the Military <Col N="1576" /> Service Pensions Act, 1934, partly offset by an increase due to the operation of the Army Pensions Act, 1943. The chief service of the Vote for Army pensions is the payment of pensions and gratuities under the authority of various Acts passed since 1923 by the Oireachtas, and, of the total Vote of £566,300, no less a sum than £558,228 nett is required to defray the cost of pensions and gratuities which are expected to fall for payment during the financial year 1944-45.</P>
    <P>The sum of £558,228 nett is made up in the following way: (a) Gross cost of 15,565 pensions already authorised, £537,661; (b) gross cost of 625 new pensions, £28,128; (c) gross cost of arrears on new pensions, £56,771, making the cost of pensions, £622,560; (d) cost of gratuities, £8,077, the total gross cost amounting to £630,637; (e) less deductions for deaths and abatements, £72,409.  The total nett cost of pensions and gratuities amounts to £558,228.</P>
    <P>From these figures it is clear that, excluding arrears and gratuities, the annual recurring gross charge to the Exchequer in respect of Army pensions will, at the end of the present financial year, be about £565,789 or, allowing for abatements (£72,409), a nett annual charge of about £493,380.</P>
    <P>The pensions code for the Army now consists of some 14 Acts and a scheme, together with another scheme for the Local Defence Force.  All these Acts and schemes may be said to deal with the three main problems of awards for service, awards for disablement, and awards for the dependents of deceased personnel.  As regards service, the present Estimate provides for:&mdash;3,101 pensions under the 1924 Act at a gross cost of £148,800; 10,970 pensions under the 1934 Act at a gross cost of £320,175; 34 pensions under the Connaught Rangers Act at a gross cost of £1,027; 95 pensions under the Defence Forces pensions schemes at a gross cost of £12,377.  That makes a total of 14,200 service pensions at a gross cost of £482,379.</P>
    <P>It will thus be seen that, of the total cost (£622,560) of pensions generally, no less than £482,379, or 77 <Col N="1577" /> per cent., is absorbed by awards in respect of service.  This figure clearly shows that the State has made and is making generous provision for all those who have rendered military service.</P>
    <P>As regards awards in respect of disablement, the present Estimate makes provision for:&mdash;429 pensions under the 1923 Act at a cost of £24,834; 141 pensions under the 1927 Act at a cost of £12,753; 394 pensions under the 1932 Act at a cost of £36,424; 205 pensions under the 1937 Act at a cost of £12,625; 11 pensions under the 1941 Act at a cost of £430; 150 pensions under the 1943 Act at a cost of £25,299; 72 pensions under the L.D.F. scheme at a cost of £2,672; 59 Easter Week special allowances at a cost of £4,200, and one disability pension under the Connaught Rangers Act, £47.  That makes a total of 1,462 disablement pensions at a cost of £119,284.</P>
    <P>As regards awards to the dependents of deceased military personnel we are providing in the Estimate for:&mdash;52 widows, one child and 31 other dependents under the 1923 Act at a cost of £4,759; 46 widows and 56 children under the 1927 Act at a cost of £3,054; 60 widows, 76 children and six other dependents under the 1932 Act at a cost of £5,990; three widows and 65 other dependents under the 1937 Act at a cost of £3,417; 18 widows, 54 children and 14 other dependents under the 1943 Act at a cost of £1,885; 16 widows and 38 children under the Defence Forces Pensions Schemes at a cost of £1,665; one dependent's allowance under the Connaught Rangers Act at a cost of £27; one other dependent under the L.D.F. scheme at a cost of £100; making a total of 197 at a cost of £20,897.</P>
    <P>It will thus be seen that the gross total of £622,560 borne by this Estimate in respect of pensions is made up by:&mdash;(a) Awards in respect of service totalling £482,379 or 77.5 per cent.; (b) awards in respect of disablement totalling £119,284 or 19 per cent; (c) awards in respect of dependents totalling £20,897 or 3.5 per cent.; the total cost being £622,560.</P>
    <P>In addition to pensions, the Estimate carries £8,077 in respect of gratuities <Col N="1578" /> made up as follows:&mdash;Wound gratuities (sub-head E), £500; remarriage gratuities (sub-head F), £210; short service gratuities (sub-head J), £7,367; making a total of £8,077.</P>
    <P>As regards the three statutory bodies which administer the different Pensions Acts, the Military Service Registration Board has a mere nominal existence, whose only function is to meet at rare intervals for the purpose of dealing with technical matters. For some time past the Referee and Advisory Committee have been working on a full-time basis in order to adjudicate on appeals which have been referred back to them on the grounds that evidence not available on the original adjudication has since been forthcoming.  It is hoped that these appeals will soon be determined.  In this connection it is necessary to point out that under the 1934 Act all appeals in which additional evidence not previously available is forthcoming must be referred back to the Referee so that it is not possible to state with any degree of accuracy when the work of the committee will be finished.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Army Pensions Board is, and during the coming year will be, fully occupied in dealing with claims under the Army Pensions Act, 1943, and under the various schemes of compensation made for the Local Defence Force, the Local Security Force, injured seamen and civilians. As regards the claims of soldiers discharged medically unfit, we are holding the men as long as possible and arrangements have been made to have them collected together at certain centres so that they may make their claims and be medically examined by the Army Pensions Board before they are finally discharged.  The cost of the two statutory bodies for the year is estimated at £3,475.</P>
    <P>The remaining items of the Estimate may be said to be made up of expenditure incidental to the award of pensions, and they are estimated at £4,597 for the year.  They are made up of the following: Surgical and medical appliances for disabled pensioners (sub-head G), £400; hospital treatment for pensioners (sub-heads H and N), £1,630; expenses of applicants <Col N="1579" /> for disablement pensions and of witnesses for service pensions (sub-heads K and N), £2,350; miscellaneous incidental expenses (sub-heads L and N), £217; giving a total of £4,597.</P>
    <P>Hence the present Estimate for £566,300 which the Dáil is asked to approve and to vote may be summed up under the following four heads: Net cost of pension awards under the different Acts, £550,151; net cost of gratuities under the various Acts, £8,077; cost of statutory bodies, £3,475; incidentals, £4,597, making the total asked for, £566,300.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do so for the purpose of placing <Col N="1580" /> before the Minister the reasons why, in my opinion, we should not pass a Vote of this kind, to give pensions to men who served the country, when there are others who did equally as much, and in many cases more, who have not got any reward.  The cases I want to bring to the Minister's notice are solely the cases of Old I.R.A. men from 1916 to 1921.  I do not want the House for a moment to think that I have any sympathy with the thousands of applicants through the country who applied for pensions when, as a matter of fact, they should be charged with forgery for claiming any association with the I.R.A.</P>
    <P>The cases I have in mind&mdash;there are not a great many to-day&mdash;are all cases which stand out and which involve service which cannot be denied.  In every case, the forms are with the Referee and many of the applicants, having been heard, have been refused pensions.  Hundreds have been refused without even being called to put up any case, while, at the same time, there are men in the particular districts in which these people reside who are in receipt of pensions who did not do as much for the freedom of the country as these people did.  I know that the Minister is sympathetic with the Old I.R.A.  There is no man in the nation who appreciates more what the Old I.R.A. tried to do for the country than the Minister.  Therefore, I could never understand how complete authority was given to the Referee to decide cases on his own, without even allowing applicants to give evidence on their own behalf.</P>
    <P>Among the cases which I wish to bring before the Minister are cases from every county in the 32 counties, but most of them are cases of men in Cork, Galway and Mayo and in Dublin.  There are, of course, individual cases in practically every portion of the State, but the majority arise in these four counties.  To give an illustration of the type of case I refer to, I shall take case No. 1, the case of a man who joined the National Volunteers in 1913, transferred to the Irish Volunteers in 1914, and went out on the hillsides in 1916 in obedience to the call.  On the instructions <Col N="1581" /> of the commanding officer, however, they did not rise in that particular town, though the men were mobilised.  He was arrested after 1916 and interned.  His internment form was Form C, indicating that he was known to be a prominent member of the Volunteers or Citizen Army.  He was released at Christmas, organised his district again and took part in raids for arms and every activity there. He was, as a matter of fact, the local officer and he directed every activity carried out in that area.  He was arrested in 1919 and kept in prison until the Treaty.  I can say without hesitation that no major engagement would ever have taken place in the district were it not for his activity previous to his arrest.  On arrest, he was taken to Eglinton Barracks in Galway, where he was kicked and injured by the Black and Tans, being compelled to spend several months in Renmore Military Hospital.</P>
    <P>When he made an application for a disability pension, even though, when the trouble was over, he was unable to follow the occupation which he followed previously and had to take up an alternative way of living, he was told that the amount of his disability was not sufficient to qualify him under the Act. When he applied, later on, for a military service pension, he was told that his case did not come within the Act because he had taken part in no major engagements.  I wonder was the attack which the Tans made on him, which broke so many of his ribs, in Galway prison, when he was there with a former Minister, Deputy Ruttledge, a major engagement?  I should like to know who defined &ldquo;major engagement&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Another man in the same area, to whom the same conditions applied, received the same answer, although he did not apply for a disability pension because he was not broken up as the other man was.  I spoke of this case to somebody recently and he said: &ldquo;Many a fellow was glad to be arrested at that time.&rdquo;  To show that there was nothing bogus about the claims of these men, I may say that they were arrested and brought to <Col N="1582" /> Galway Jail in company with Deputy Ruttledge, and, whether one agrees or disagrees with Deputy Ruttledge, there is no one who will say that he tried to get himself arrested, and what applies to him applies to these gentlemen.  In the same week, another man from that district was sent to jail but his ribs were not broken in Eglinton Barracks. They were all released on the occasion of the general release from the Curragh and the peculiar thing is that though this man could not have taken part in or done anything more than the other two men, he has a pension of £80.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>That should not surprise you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>By the way I might mention, without meaning any slur, of course, on the other people who have been turned down, that they think it rather funny that the man who got the £80 pension happened to be the brother of a Deputy of this House at the time.  I am not saying that that had anything to do with it, but it was peculiar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Deputy is probably right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, the two men to whom I referred previously had done more in the way of organisation work than that man from the same district had done, and yet they got nothing.  We have also the case of a man who took part in an engagement in Pearse Street, Dublin. At this engagement Leo Fitzgerald was killed, and Volunteer Traynor was afterwards executed for his part in the engagement.  Now, I have here in my possession a certificate on behalf of this applicant, signed by a man who was actually sentenced to death for taking part in the engagement.  The certificate is signed by John Donnelly, who was under sentence of death at the same time that Deputy MacEoin was under sentence of death, and the certificate from John Donnelly is that this man&mdash;I shall refer to this as Case No. 3&mdash;took part in the engagement in Pearse Street.  Yet this man's <Col N="1583" /> claim was also turned down and he has not got a pension.  When he pressed his claim for a pension he was told that this was only one isolated incident and, therefore, would not entitle him to a pension.  When it suited the Pensions Board, they turned down the claim of this gentleman on the ground that that was only an isolated incident, although, from the very fact that one man was killed and that another man who took part in the same engagement was afterwards executed, shows that he must have risked his life on that occasion; and yet, mind you, the man to whom I referred previously, who is in receipt of a pension of £80, never took part, previous to the Truce, in even an isolated engagement such as that at Pearse Street where one man was killed and as a result of which another man was executed.</P>
      <P>That is proof that I am not endeavouring to put ridiculous cases before the Minister.  There you have a certificate signed by a man who was actually under sentence of death, and we know that were it not for the activities and for the work that these gentlemen did at that time, when this nation was very much Anglicised and when the outlook in this country, even after 1916, was more imperial than otherwise&mdash;every member of this House knows, just as well as every individual within the nation knows, that were it not for the activities of these great men, and great men, I say, they were &mdash;both those who are in receipt of pensions for what they did and those other genuine cases which have been turned down by the Pensions Board&mdash; we would not be sitting here in this House to-day, nor would this nation be in the peaceful condition in which it now is.  I am rather surprised when I hear it said that this person or that person helped to save the nation.  I believe that there would be no nation at all were it not for the work that these men did for this country at the outset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are hundreds of the type of cases to which I have referred&mdash; thousands, as a matter of fact, originally&mdash;but the number is not so large <Col N="1584" /> now because it must be remembered that the activities to which I am referring took place a quarter of a century ago, many of these people have died in the meantime, and accordingly the amount of genuine cases would be very small.  I want to repeat that I am only concerned with real, genuine cases.  I do not want any &ldquo;chancer&rdquo; coming along and getting money from the State to which he is not entitled and which he never earned.  The amount of money that would be involved, so far as the genuine cases are concerned, is so small that I appeal to the House, to the Minister and to the Government to do something for these people.  In various parts of the country I have discussed this matter with people who have this grievance, and they will take that grievance to the grave if it is not remedied, because they feel that they are being robbed.  In that connection, it must be remembered that the Proclamation of Easter Week, 1916, promised equal treatment for all our citizens, but there has not been equal treatment so far as the Old I.R.A. are concerned.  In my opinion, the majority of these people&mdash;I do not say all, but the majority of them&mdash;would be satisfied if they got some gratuity or pension.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should they?  Not likely!  They should get what they are entitled to, and that is all there is about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that Deputy MacEoin feels that way, but my reason for saying it is that these people feel that their case is so hopeless so far as a pension is concerned that they would be satisfied with a gratuity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1924 a Pensions Act was introduced and passed here, and there was an amending Act in 1934, and my idea, accordingly, in this motion, is that there should be some amending legislation in 1944 that <Col N="1585" /> would satisfy the claims of all those deserving cases.  Now, I do not know whether Deputy Anthony or any of the Cork Deputies are interested in this, but I do know that there is a great number of the type of people to whom I refer in Cork City and County.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Are they all genuine cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, many of the claims may not be genuine, but the Cork Deputies should know more about that than I do.  However, I am sure that at least some of the claims are genuine.  I do not know how the definition of a major engagement has been come to, but let us take the case of a couple of men who go to raid a house for arms.  They go to a house where they know there is a gun.  That gun belongs to an enemy of the country and they want to get it so that it can be used for the defence of this country and bring about the position which we now have.  As a matter of fact, their ambition was to achieve a better position than we now have; they wanted to achieve an Irish Republic for the whole 32 counties.  Did these men not risk their lives in going to a house where they knew there were one or two fully armed people hostile to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>If there was only one man in the house and if six or eight men came to raid it, there would be nothing very brave about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>If he was armed, he would not need to be a very clever man to be able to shoot the six of them.  Deputy Anthony will have to admit that, if these people did not go and get the arms, they could not be used afterwards for the defence of this country.  Deputy Anthony seems to be enjoying this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not enjoying it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Our present position was brought about by the efforts of such men just as much as by the efforts of others, and I am surprised and disappointed that there should be even one person remaining in this nation, <Col N="1586" /> not to speak of a Deputy of this House, who does not appreciate what was done by the men of our time from 1916 to 1921.  I should be surprised that anybody would make any effort to deride what these men did, what they stood for, and what their aims were.  I am not going into the cases of people who received pensions to which they were not entitled or of which they were not deserving.  Mind you, if the Minister wanted information in that regard, I think I would be in a position to give him at least a few cases, and I think he would find it very difficult to justify the granting of a pension in such cases as I have in mind.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, I know in one case a man is in receipt of a pension and the nationalists in the area at the time were afraid of him; they were not satisfied that he was genuine.  In the area in which I reside, Finglas, there is only one person in receipt of a pension.  Definitely, I say that that gentleman was entitled to a pension, that he was 100 per cent. qualified. Surely even the Minister will agree with me that in that district there were more than one man actively engaged.  The Minister is aware of the activities of some of the men in that particular district.  If no major engagement took place in the Finglas area, it was not the fault of the men in the district; it was the fault of whatever officer was responsible.  I do know that they were standing by, ready for the call, and that they did everything they were asked to do.  It is peculiar that only one person in that area is in receipt of a pension.  Let there be no misunderstanding.  I say he certainly was entitled to it and, as a matter of fact, I would give him more if I could.  I am sure the Minister is fully aware that in that district there was more than one I.R.A. man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, I know particular districts where, I understand, there were 60 applicants for pensions and I know that the number of I.R.A. men in the district could be accommodated in a Ford car.  I do not want such districts to be compared with Finglas or such people to be compared with the men of Fingal.  These men are very disappointed.  They feel they have a <Col N="1587" /> great grievance.  These men risked their lives for the freedom of this country, obeyed every order that was given to them, and did everything possible and, after all, when we have established a native Government and have been fairly generous and fláitheamhail enough with some people, is it not hard luck that some of these men are forced, or have been forced within the last few years, to leave their own country and to seek a living in the country that they fought against?  It is very poor satisfaction. I know the Minister is sympathetic but I feel that he should use his influence with the Government to bring forward some amending legislation.</P>

      <P>The Minister should take steps to remedy those cases. Perhaps the law is sufficient already to have it done.  I am satisfied that many of these people did not get justice before the Court of Referees. They could not have got justice seeing that some of them were not even called.  There were some who were called who did not get justice.  I have lists of cases but I do not wish to detain the House quoting them.  I have cases that would surprise Deputies. I have the case of one man who took part in what I think was the finest major engagement that took place in this period, the Carrowkennedy Ambush.  It is a peculiar thing that John Hoban&mdash;I will mention his name because he is in America&mdash;did not qualify for a pension even though he took part in that ambush.  I feel that every member of the House is in sympathy with the position.  In every district they know of cases similar to those I have in mind.  I would appeal to the Minister and to the House to support the proposition that the cases of those men should get the consideration they deserve from an Irish Government.</P>

      <P>I claim the indulgence of the House for a few moments while I deal with this motion <Col N="1588" /> and with the Vote in as broad a fashion as I can.  It is true that there was never legislation passed by either this Government or the last Government that received such criticism as the Military Service Pensions Acts of 1924 and 1934.  It is true that there was never a piece of legislation passed by the assembly of any country with the administration of which there was as much dissatisfaction as there was with the administration of both these Acts.  That dissatisfaction in regard to the 1924 Act was brought about by several causes.  The first cause was that it was confined to those who had service, not only pre-Truce, but also in the National Army or the Defence Forces.  That did exclude those who remained neutral, as it was called, and those who joined the Executive Forces and who fought against the State.  The difficulties under which the 1924 Act was administered were very great because several people when requiring certificates and evidence from officers of the Volunteers could not get them.  Why? Because some of these officers were members of the Executive Forces and refused to recognise.  Parliament, refused to give the certificates and would not touch the 1924 Act with a 40-foot pole.  The result was that several people failed to qualify because they had not the necessary evidence. The 1934 Act was passed.  While I did not accept the view of several of my colleagues, I insisted that that Act was a just Act and that it should get all the sympathy, all the help that this House or this country could give it.  I want to say, without blowing any horn, that as far as I am concerned, I have tried to see justice done to every Volunteer, whether he was with me or against me in the years 1922 and 1923, and I shall continue to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a considerable amount of woolly thinking in regard to the whole Act and the Deputy who has sat down and who has made a case for certain people was guilty of woolly thinking. What does he do?  In making a case for certain people who, in his opinion, are entitled to a pension, he starts to make a case against people who have pensions on the grounds that they <Col N="1589" /> were not entitled to them.  What does he know?  One of the points he makes is that Volunteers in the district were afraid of a particular person.  I can tell the House that two-thirds of the Volunteers were afraid of the best officer who was ever in the Longford Brigade.  Why?  Because that officer was acting as intelligence officer for me in Longford and was going in and out to the military barracks in the discharge of his duty for me and for headquarters.  Several people would ask: &ldquo;Are you going to allow that fellow to go in and out?&rdquo;  Therefore, before you start condemning anybody who is in receipt of a pension, you may take it that, whether he is a first cousin or a brother of a Deputy or anything else, he could not get a pension if he were not entitled to it and did not make a case for it.</P>

      <P>If I could say differently against this Administration I would say it just as quickly.  I am going to say a few things against them in a few minutes.  That woolly thinking was brought about by the Party opposite.  In the years 1923 to 1931, what was the campaign in this country? The campaign was to lower in the estimation of their fellow countrymen the people who were then in receipt of pensions for serving this country.  They were described as traitors, as being treacherous to the Republic and so forth.  The Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;and I charge them publicly with it and I want to have it on the records of the House&mdash;put out their posters saying: &ldquo;Here is the roll of honour.&rdquo;  They gave a list of every one of us in receipt of military service pensions, including some people who are now sitting on the Fianna Fáil Benches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accepted that designation that Fianna Fáil applied to us; it was a roll of honour because it contained the names of men who served this country faithfully and well in its hour of need but, in publishing that, Fianna Fáil appealed to the cupidity of every poor unfortunate devil in the country who had not got a living.  They so influenced the people of the country that the <Col N="1590" /> question of military service pensions stank in the nostrils of everyone of them.  Military service pensions were attacked, not only by Fianna Fáil, but by people from whom one would expect better.  It was said that no Government ever gave a youngster a pension for short-time service.  They were attacked by Fianna Fáil on the one side and, on the other, by what might be called the pro-British element or the ex-Unionist Party in this country and also by one-time members of the Irish Parliamentary Party.  The charge made was that nobody ever got a pension for short-time service but these people forgot that young fellows from Britain were recruited to the R.I.C. in this country, that the first recruit came to this country in December, 1919, and that the last was taken in in May, 1921. These recruits were then known as Black and Tans as distinct from the Auxiliaries.</P>
    <P>Now what do we find?  Let us examine the treatment the British Government gave these men.  They were excluded from the R.I.C.  Articles of the Treaty but what did the British Government do for them?  I refer Deputies to the Command Papers of the British House of Commons, Volume 17, 1922, Command Paper, 1719.  What is the pension to-day of the British recruit to the R.I.C. who had a service of one year or under?  He has a pension of 18/6 a week or £47 16s. a year for the rest of his life&mdash;for less than one month's service in some cases, because the Truce came in July.  They were demobilised on the 11th January, 1922.  The ordinary R.I.C.  British recruit or constable, if he had over one year's service, has a pension of £50 14s. 6d. a year and if he had over 18 months' service, his a pension is £68. So that the most junior of these young fellows who came into the R.I.C. after December, 1919, has a pension of £68 a year.  Yet according to certain people nobody ever got a pension for short-time service.  Comparisons are odious&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>But just imagine the pensions that are paid here, pensions <Col N="1591" /> of £5 a year.  In reply to a Parliamentary question here, it was stated that the minimum pension paid is £2 15s. 11d. a year or something like that-a pension of £2 15s. 11d. for serving this country and there is nobody in receipt of that £2 15s. 11d. who has not more than three months' service. To go up a bit in the ranks on the British side, the head constable in the R.I.C. with the minimum service, that is, under 12 months, has £82 16s., the third-class D.I. has £115, and if he became a second-class D.I. he has £137.  If he is a first-class inspector he has £303.</P>
      <P>I want to deal with this point first. I want to show the parsimony of the present Government and of the previous Government, as far as we are concerned.  I do not exonerate one more than the other.  I can, however, defend the 1924 Act and the administration of it, but I cannot defend the 1934 Act and its administration, because conditions have been much more settled and much easier since the passing of the 1934 Act.  The total of military service pensions paid under both Acts amounts to about £400,000. Perhaps I could put it this way. Under the 1924 Act the total amount payable per annum is £148,800 and under the 1934 Act, up to date, the total is £274,146.  I have heard certain criticism and, of course, it was just criticism in a way.  People said: &ldquo;Look at the criticism which the Fianna Fáil Party expressed in regard to the 1924 Act, but look at what they are doing themselves.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  But mind you that sum of £274,000, as I pointed out in the first instance, covers Cumann na mBan, who were not included in the 1924 Act, and also people who were neutral and took no side during the civil war.  I hold that the expenditure under both Acts is totally inadequate for this reason if for nothing else.  The Appropriations-in-Aid of the Army Vote this year amount to over £200,000 and the bulk of these Appropriations-in-Aid is made up of <Col N="1592" /> proceeds from sales of old uniforms, scrap, old iron, etc.  Therefore, the proceeds of sales from scrap in the Army is sufficient to pay pensions under one Act and yet we have people saying that these pensions amount to a very high figure.  Deputy Anthony thinks the expenditure is too much. The Pensions Bill for the few thousand people who joined the R.I.C. is exactly £1,300,000 a year.  Yet we knocked hell out of them.  We knocked hell out of the Auxiliaries and out of the British military, too, and out of the &ldquo;go-boys&rdquo; in this country who are now shouting against pensions.  Deputy Anthony says that it did not require very great courage to go to a house in which there was only one man, but it was not the one man in the house that had to be considered; it was the British forces backing the man that created the danger.  It was not what one had to suffer from that particular man but what one might expect from the forces that man could rally behind him and the punishment and the hardships that could be imposed by these forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act as it stands is ample to deal with every case, but it is the administration of the Act about which I complain bitterly.  The fact of the matter is that there was no great difficulty in people, who applied in the first year of the administration and whose cases were heard then, getting a pension.  I want to be quite fair by saying that in the granting of pensions there was neither fear, favour nor affection shown.  I do not charge the Administration with any malpractices. Pensions were granted as the claims were established, but then, of course, old Mother Hubbard in the Department of Finance got busy.  It did not matter whether you were entitled to a pension or not; once they made up their minds on what they were going to pay, that was the end of it.  Now, is it not time that justice should be done to the men and women who served this country?  I admit candidly that were it not for the Civil War we probably would never have had military service pensions, but that is beside the point.  Military service pensions are there; they have been granted and there is an obligation, I <Col N="1593" /> insist, on the Government of the day, whoever they are, to see that justice is done to everybody who is entitled to receive a pension or a certificate of service.  There is nothing to stop a person who receives a certificate of service from refusing to accept the amount to which he would be entitled. He can send it back if he does not want it but, like everybody else, we are anxious about our honour and we like to have a certificate testifying to the service that we rendered in that particular period.  If this was going to be a recurring expenditure for any length of time there might be something in saying: &ldquo;Well, we cannot continue this expenditure indefinitely.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Look around at the comrades of those days, and the comrades of the past-we are getting few and far between.  We are getting grey haired and old, and in another quarter of a century, how many pensioners will be left?  There may be a few dodderers like myself who intend to live to be 100, but I feel that I will be going about then with a long, white beard and if any members of the Fianna Fáil Party are left, they will say that I am a great fellow and they will boost me for all they are worth, but that will be no good to the comrades who have suffered during this period.</P>
    <P>I insist that whatever sum is necessary to give recognition of their service, this House should provide it. The British Government is paying out £1,300,000 in respect of the Black-and-Tans. The difference between the Volunteers and the Black-and-Tans is that the Volunteers were volunteers, and that the Black-and-Tans had a paid holiday in this country.  Soldiers of this country are getting only one-fifth of what has been paid to the Black-and-Tans and I insist that although £1,300,000 would not be enough to give recognition to the Volunteers who served, at least they should be entitled to something around that figure, and if it were administered properly, every man who rendered service would secure recognition.</P>
    <P>Let me come to the point of what constitutes service.  I want to be quite <Col N="1594" /> clear on it and it is the farthest thing from my mind to cast any reflection on any of the three Referees under the recent Act.  As far as they could, they administered the Act, and in passing, I want to point out that there were three people who constituted the board. Two of the members of the board could overrule the judge.  One of them was a former Adjutant-General and the other was a prominent member of the I.R.A. who had 1916 service.  Under the 1934 Act, the Referee is the sole authority.  One of these three learned judges is a very decent man&mdash;I know it is said in this country that we never say anything good of a man until he is dead&mdash;and he did his best, but he did not know the circumstances, and our people in making their cases did not know how to present them.  One half of the applicants under the 1934 Act firmly believed that it was sufficient to have been in the Volunteers and to have voted for Fianna Fáil to qualify for a pension.  No doubt, the people took the same line under the 1924 Act. Mr. Beatty asked an applicant what he did in 1917.  The reply was: &ldquo;Does not everybody know what I did?  I did everything.&rdquo;  Mr. Beatty wrote down: answer he got: &ldquo;Everything&rdquo; and arrived at a total which equalled &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;  When I intervened, I was told I had no function in the matter but I was given permission to ask a question.  I asked the applicant: &ldquo;Did you slash down the roof of such a barracks during such an attack?&rdquo;  The applicant replied: &ldquo;Of course I did; does not everyone know that?&rdquo;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the judge, &ldquo;but I did not know it.&rdquo;  If I was not present, that applicant would have been turned down, and all the water in the world would not wash the Government, myself or the Referee of a charge of prejudice.</P>
    <P>A number of these applicants&mdash;I will leave out that they were Fianna Fáil supporters&mdash;did not fill their forms correctly. The form itself is a statutory declaration and it was the basis of their claim.  Anyone examining the form would see that it was a most formidable <Col N="1595" /> document, but, in general, the forms were filled up in a rough-and-ready fashion and many claims were rejected on the form alone.  When I say rejected, I mean that the applicants got the usual 21-day notice. Again, when an applicant got this notice, he did not understand it.  The only thing he could understand was that it had been decided that he was not entitled to a pension.  This 21-day period was given so that the applicant might put up further evidence, but generally speaking, the interpretation of the document was that the claim was turned down.  Scores, hundreds and thousands, were turned down on that point.  I insist that no matter how learned the judges were, they had no idea of service or what constituted service. Time after time I have made this point, and I now make it on this Vote.</P>
    <P>An O.C. was attacking Point A, which was surrounded by British forces.  It was absolutely essential that he held particular roads during the engagement, and, in certain cases, the best men were left out on the roads, because they were going to meet the brunt of the attack by the enemy forces.  The people who were under the commanding officer were before his eyes and knew what was going on.  In a number of cases, they never fired a shot&mdash;in nearly every case in my area where there was an outpost, they never had to fire a shot, but the answer of the Referee is: &ldquo;It was hard luck, but as you never fired a shot it was not active service.&rdquo;  For a time, that state of affairs continued, and suddenly the decision was arrived at that persons who gave service of a dangerous and essential character were entitled to receive certificates.  As it left here, the Act provided that people who served in Easter Week or between the 21st April and the 11th July, 1921, were entitled to certificates.  Once it applied to these men, it was all right and that went on until about 100 or 150 people qualified.  Then the bottom fell out of it, and a situation was created in which one man with a particular type of service got a pension while another man with a similar service was refused it.</P>
    <P>God knows we have had trouble <Col N="1596" /> enough without creating more of it.  I am not going to grumble against any member of the Volunteers getting a pension.  The only complaint I have is that the largest sum any of them got was not enough, and I say &ldquo;God give them the strength for years and years to draw what they are getting, and the devil thank the begrudgers&rdquo;.  I insist that these grievances should be rectified, and that a board should be established which has full knowledge of the circumstances under which these engagements took place and the service rendered.  Justice can be done in that way.  No amendment of the Act is necessary; it is purely a matter of administration.  In addition to the Act, there are regulations made by the Minister and rules made by the Referee&mdash;three codes.  Before the poor devil of an applicant has a chance he has to know the whole three of them, but, mind you, very few of the applicants know anything about them until they go in and, after hearing one of these rules quoted, they realise that they are finished.</P>

      <P>I will try to shorten my remarks.  This is one of the occasions on which I would feel justified in taking up the time of Deputy Lynch as well as my own.  The political favouritism I charge is this: a regulation was made that 1935 was the last date for receiving applications. That was altered to 1936 and again in 1937 and later to 1938 and 1939, but 1939 was the end, and it was stated that under no circumstances were any applications to be made after that, although several brigade committees were at the time making their investigations.  There were some people who remained true to the Republic and who refused to apply for a pension, but who, after a time, decided that, as the money was not Fianna Fáil money, nor Fine Gael money, but the people's money, they might as well apply.  I told these: &ldquo;As good Republicans you are quite sound in your philosophy&rdquo; and they applied.  A petition was sent in by our brigade committee that application forms be sent to these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1597" /> We were told that, as the last day for applying had passed, nothing could be done.  Then came the General Election of 1943 and a number of forms were sent out to certain people. I do not intend to take Deputy Tunney's line that that was not correct.</P>
    <P>My argument is that, when the forms were sent out to those people, they should be sent out to everyone. The Minister, in reply to me, says that individual applications had been received prior to 15th July, 1943, which was the latest date for the acceptance of applications.  Who was informed that July 15th, 1943, was the latest date?  They say that there is no record of a list of names submitted to the Department in 1943 at that date, but that there was a list of names in May, 1943, which accompanied a registered letter.  For a time, it was claimed that these letters were not received, so we started registering them to make sure that delivery was proved.  My only hope is that the people who got these forms will get pensions, and that they will continue to support this Administration and, as I remarked earlier in this discussion, I hope they will live for years to draw the pensions.  I have not the slightest grudge against their getting pensions &mdash;my grudge is that those who are equally entitled are not getting them, whether they are Republicans or anything else.  I submit that the fixing of the date is an arbitrary procedure. Why not fix the 15th August, 1944?  I assert that these people should be entitled to get forms of application in 1955, if they apply for them.  When these men were giving service there was no fixed time or hour for them.</P>
    <P>On the question of disability, there are widows of officers of the Volunteers left derelict with their families because they did not comply with some technical point.  I do not know whether the Minister for Defence is responsible; I think he is not, but I can see the long finger of Lady Finance behind him.  The widow and orphan may starve because some regulation or other is not observed. The time has come for that to stop <Col N="1598" /> so that the hardships of the widows and orphans of the men who observed their country in her hour of need may be relieved.  The Government must see that justice is done, and I am sure that every member of the House will support them.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why the democratically-elected Government we have should refuse to follow the wishes of every member of the Oireachtas.  I appeal to the Minister and tell him that, if necessary, he can get all the strength and the power that the House can give him to do justice to these men and the dependents of those who fought between 1916 and 1923, because, for good or ill, it is part of the history of this country and every single person who fought, whether in the Four Courts or outside it, in 1922 should get justice.  This Government should not let to-day pass without starting to give justice to those people who still have life.  Finance will not be robbed nor any wrong done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that there is a limitation, so far as time is concerned, on this Estimate as on the others.  For that reason, I shall be very brief, indeed.  In the course of his speech, Deputy MacEoin asked on, at least, four occasions that justice be done.  I want to assure Deputy MacEoin and Deputy Tunney that any steps directed to the granting of justice to those who fought for this country from 1916 onwards and who suffered because of their action will have my very strongest support.  I have said that on more than one occasion on this Estimate.  At the same time, I have a good deal of sympathy with the Minister. I understand that there are about 60,000 applicants for pensions under the various Acts.  We have had an estimate&mdash;rather a liberal estimate&mdash; that towards the end of the period there were less than 3,000 effective and active members of the I.R.A.  One is, naturally, inclined, in these circumstances, to be curious and to examine carefully any applications that may come before the board.  Under every system or code of rules, certain persons will suffer hardships.  I interrupted a moment ago when Deputy Tunney very <Col N="1599" /> properly asked that some clear definition should be given of &ldquo;major operation&rdquo; and &ldquo;minor operation&rdquo;.  Some doubt has, apparently, crept into the minds of the board which inquires into these matters as to what constitutes a major and a minor operation.  Some clarification should be provided, whether by means of an Order in Council or an amending Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make my position in the matter quite clear.  Frequently, I have urged in this House&mdash;I did it ten or 12 years ago&mdash;that wherever it is proved to the satisfaction of this court or committee that a woman has lost a husband or a son in action, that woman should be adequately compensated either by a liberal pension or a liberal gratuity.  It is most regrettable to any decent, self-respecting Irishman to be met in the streets of Dublin, as I have been me on many occasions for the past nine or ten years, by men with collection boxes for dependents of 1916 men in the county home.  That is what I have been confronted with from time to time and I have been here every Easter over a period of about 20 years.  That is sufficient evidence that certain hardships have been created.  On the other hand, let us see how far this country is prepared to commit itself to a policy which may have very enduring effects. We had two revolutionary periods. How one would designate these revolutionary periods would depend on the point of view which one had regarding them.  In my view&mdash;a view which I held then and which I hold now to a very considerable extent&mdash;one set of men got pensions, which they richly deserved, for saving the country and dragging it out of chaos&mdash;what almost amounted to Balkanised conditions. That revolutionary period passed and we had a second revolution.  It appeared to the ordinary taxpayer and citizen who wanted to live in peace and amity with his neighbours that another board was set up to provide pensions for those who endeavoured to destroy the structure set up by the first revolutionary movement and its army.  After all, there is something to be said for the man in the street <Col N="1600" /> in this regard&mdash;the taxpayer who has to foot the bill for all these things. Deputy MacEoin very liberally interpreted, as I am sure we all interpret them at this stage, the intentions behind those Pension Acts&mdash;that, for the sake of the future peace of the country, it was a good thing to make these awards to those who took part in both these revolutionary movements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  No objection was raised then and no objection is raised now to the setting up of machinery and the provision of money to administer these Acts.  Deputy MacEoin said that it was in the administration of the money allotted for pensions and gratuities the trouble originated. If so, that ought to be a relatively easy matter to settle.  Let us have regard to those persons who could not make a case for themselves.  I am aware of a number of genuine cases in Cork, but I am also aware of some which are not genuine and it may be a very useful thing, from the point of view of political gain, to play up to everybody on such an occasion as this. I am aware of cases which were 100 per cent. honest and, because of some mistake in the filling of the forms, due to want of the necessary education, or some omission, the case was not so stated as to entitle the applicant to a pension.  On the other hand, some claims have been made which no board with commonsense would allow.  There are persons in Cork who gave very fine service in an administrative capacity, who were part and parcel of the whole machine, and who have not even applied for a pension.  Persons who gave less service have applied&mdash;I do not know with what success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any Minister for Defence will have a very difficult and unpopular job in dealing with these pension claims.  Hardships are bound to occur and, no matter what machinery is established, until it is proved to the satisfaction of the body set up for the purpose that the person is entitled to benefit under one of the Acts, I am afraid that nothing further can be done.  I know cases where mothers deprived of their sons are <Col N="1601" /> now in straitened circumstances.  I do not know what can be done in cases like that.  If there is any revision of these Acts in future, I hope attention will be paid to the claims of widows and orphans.  Something should be done for them.  I have the feeling that under the previous Administration some mistakes were made as a result of which widows and others were deprived of pensions.  Deputy MacEoin must know all about these matters and judging by his remarks steps should be taken to remedy any mistakes that were made. I have the greatest sympathy with the Minister's position, because no matter what he does he will be blamed for not awarding pensions to all who claim them.  I read recently of a case where a pension was claimed by a woman who attempted to poison British soldiers in Cork Barracks.  I am certain that no Deputy would have any sympathy with the claims of persons whose activities consisted in conduct of that kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister informed us that he had 14 Pensions Acts to administer, and within the terms of these Acts he should be able to dispense justice to those with whose claims he has to deal.  I want to refer to the position of fathers and mothers who lost the support of their sons and whose applications for pensions have been before the Minister for a considerable period.  It is about time that some decision was arrived at in these cases.  I am not suggesting that all claims should be granted, or that compensation should be awarded in every case, but decisions should be arrived at within a reasonable time. I am aware of a dozen cases of various kinds hanging fire for a couple of years. I think the Minister, with 14 Acts of Parliament at his disposal, should be able to get the machinery going and I urge him to expedite decisions.  I want now to deal with the hardy annual of the Military Service Pensions Acts and to say that we are fortunate in having in this debate Deputies on both sides of the House with plenty of experience of active service.  It can be taken that these Deputies spoke in the interests of I.R.A.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin was right when he <Col N="1602" /> stated that he knew of no piece of legislation which had evoked so much criticism as the Military Service Pensions Act.  I waited patiently to hear some Fianna Fáil Deputies discussing the administration of that Act.  I was told that they were prepared to do so. I invite them to do so now.  I understood they were prepared to give support to the proposals put forward by the Old I.R.A.  I invite their help now in view of Deputy MacEoin's plea.  A dozen years ago these Deputies would have made the welkin ring as to the necessity of providing, compensation for men who won our national freedom. Have these men got all the compensation they were entitled to? I am afraid they have not.  I am afraid that, within the machinery set up to administer the Military Service Pensions Act, there is very little chance of their getting the justice to which many of them are entitled.  On every occasion the Minister gave as a reason for that position, that there was no definition of &ldquo;active service&rdquo; and that they did not want to exclude claimants.  Deputy MacEoin pointed out some people are opposed to the granting of pensions for military service of that kind.  If it was made clear that the Government was not prepared to give military service pensions, claimants would know their position.  I believe a statement of the kind was made as part of the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party some years ago, but that it was abandoned later.</P>
    <P>When the Cosgrave régime brought in a Military Service Pensions Act it was made a condition that there should be service in the National Army as well as in the I.R.A.  There was a good deal of opposition to such a qualification.  Those who were then in the wilderness said that they would not support any qualification of that kind.  I think what was really meant was that it was not intended to introduce a Military Service Pensions Act at all.  But for some activity on the part of those who had military service probably we would not have had the Act of 1934.  Those who took the anti-Treaty side said that if pensions were to be given to those who took the pro-Treaty side, they saw no reason why <Col N="1603" /> they should not be entitled to pensions for service pre-Truce and post-Truce as well as those who got military service pensions.  That embraced a number of people.  A great many carried their service from pre-Truce to post-Truce.</P>
    <P>Let us consider what kind of an Army we had from 1918 to 1922. Surely we do not consider that it was an army similar to the British, German or French Armies.  Was it not an army that had to take advantage of every weapon that came to hand, to try to obstruct the operations of the British authorities?  I doubt if a man who knocked down a bridge or blocked a road was not giving just as good military service as a man with a rifle who fired a shot.  It must be remembered that there were not then sufficient rifles to go around, and that our people had to endeavour in every possible way to obstruct the operations of the British Government.  While there is no use in pretending that we defeated the British Government during that period, we did make the operations of that Government impossible, and every person who lent a hand then rendered service to this State.  I agree that there has been too much talk about these people not being entitled to pensions.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin was quite right when he said that some people were suspected by their own men, they were such good intelligence officers.  I think the greatest recommendation such men could get was to be suspect by their own men, seeing how successful they were in hiding their identity.  The Minister brought in people to advise him instead of those with experience of what &ldquo;active service&rdquo; consisted of at that period.  Surely every man attested into an army on a war footing is on active service.  Every man who has attested at the present time in the belligerent countries is on active service. Active service, therefore, would be different for the period I am speaking about from what it would be to-day and the Minister knows perfectly well that men engaged in hazardous work who did not stand behind a rifle and did not come under fire.  The Minister <Col N="1604" /> set up a board, set up a Referee.  I am not making any attempt to discredit the three men who acted as the Referees but I do not think any of these men had active service of any kind, that they had either active service as soldiers taking part in military operations or took part in defence preparatory work such as the blocking of roads or digging of trenches.  I do not think they had any experience of that kind and these are the men who define what active service is.</P>
    <P>There is a demand from men of the Old I.R.A. organisations that there should be a sworn inquiry as to how the administration of this Act is conducted. Surely there is a case for that.  Surely there is a case for the Minister taking some senior officer out of the Army, some man with pre-Treaty service at the present time a trained soldier, and putting him in as one member of the tribunal and then taking an Old I.R.A. man who has experience also.  Then appoint whoever you like as a chairman, appoint a judge if you like who is learned in law and in the Acts of Parliament and military codes, and let him direct the tribunal as to how evidence is taken and what is evidence in these particular cases.  Let the whole position be examined by that tribunal.  There is one thing that I have always missed in getting some of these cases examined.  Those of us who helped from time to time ex-British Army men in endeavouring to secure their pensions always found there is such a thing as the soldiers' friend.  He gave very valuable help to the averaage British soldier in trying to secure what the soldier was entitled to from the British authorities.  We have no such thing here.  We know how these fellows come up from the country. Some of them have never been ten miles from their home town.  A man comes up here and goes into the office and he is cross-questioned.  We know that men will break down very easily before the fire of a cross-examination by people trained in cross-examination and people whose profession is to cross-examine and confuse.  That is what they are there for.  It is before <Col N="1605" /> these people that these men come and that is the reason a great many of them fail to make their case as fully and adequately as they should make it.</P>
    <P>I have had an opportunity of discussing matters privately with the Minister and I firmly believe that the Minister does not want to avoid facing up to this situation.  I want to help him to force his Cabinet to try to face up to the situation and the dissatisfaction that exists.  Deputy Anthony says that there are 60,000 applicants.  I do not know how many applicants there are, but I know there are many applicants who can justly claim that they have grounds for their claims.  I want to help the Minister to secure a tribunal that will give examination to the claims that have been turned down by his referees.  The Minister said before that these claims were <i>sub judice.</i> Well, there may be a few of them but, of course, he knows perfectly well that the whole body of them are not <i>sub judice.</i>  The whole body of them can be discussed in detail here and it is just as well that he should get through with them and not have it coming up as a hardy annual.</P>
    <P>I want to finish on the note that I have at least half a dozen letters from Old I.R.A. men who assure me that many of the Fianna Fáil Deputies are in favour of an inquiry such as I have indicated.  I invite them now as the proper time to show that they are in favour of this court of inquiry and I invite them to tell the House and the Minister that it is time that this court of inquiry was set up and to tell the Minister that to their knowledge there are many cases up and down the country that should be re-examined and that a tribunal with men on it with experience of active service should be set up to examine the cases I refer to and give a decision on the merits of the cases themselves.  It is not on the point of whether we can pay.  If we cannot pay we should never have brought in the legislation.  If we could not pay the men with service in the Old I.R.A. and in the Army then the previous Government should never have brought in the Act of 1924 and if we cannot pay the men with service in the <Col N="1606" /> Old I.R.A. and the period after the Treaty the Fianna Fáil Government should never have brought in the 1934 Act.  But having brought them in you should not continue to give the impression that the Minister for Finance or favouritism of some kind is preventing the just administration of the Act and preventing people who are entitled to it from getting their fair share of the amount of money voted by the Dáil for pensions.  That is the impression created and the sooner the Minister dispels it the better for the Minister and the better for the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasCarter1921" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words on this.  We discussed this on the Supplementary Vote, and in my appeal to the Minister on that occasion I asked him to allow applicants who have been turned down to produce additional evidence which many of them tell me they can do.  I think that the Minister should see that that is done.  Great hardships exist in the country as a whole.  For instance, two brothers were in the same ambush and one of these men is getting a pension and the other is not.  There must be something wrong there, and I hold and maintain that one of the brothers did not make a good case for himself when he came up to Dublin and came before the representative of the Finance Department.  The representative of the Finance Department examined him and he went down on his examination. I think that that is really the great difficulty that these men down the country have to face.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have another case of a man who was asked who would guarantee that he had been wounded.  As I told the House before, this man was in a very big ambush.  He was badly wounded. The doctor near the place was not friendly, with the result that his comrades had to hide this man in a clamp of turf.  He was treated locally by what we call in the country &ldquo;a quack doctor&rdquo;.  That man is not able to produce a medical certificate, due to the circumstances I have mentioned. Since he was wounded he has never been able to lift his arm.  Men in his position should be allowed to put their <Col N="1607" /> cases forward again.  There is the case of another man who was on the top of a police barrack removing the slates.  He sat on an old mattress when bullets were going up through the roof of the barrack.  His case has also been turned down.  I think it is going too far to turn down such cases. I ask the Minister to allow those men to put in additional evidence.  In my opinion the present Act would cover all such cases and that no amending Bill is necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan spoke on the legal aspect of the matter, but for my part I do not think it would be necessary to set up a new committee to consider these cases.  The one that has been investigating cases for the past few years would, I think, do all right.  If those men were given an opportunity of producing additional evidence they would be satisfied.  If they do not get that they will be dissatisfied.  If a vote is challenged on this Estimate and I have to obey the Party, I will be sorry to have to vote against those fellows.  I know the Minister's intentions are good.  With Deputy Hogan, I would ask him to approach the Minister for Finance and ask him to leave this matter open for another year or nine months so that the men concerned will have an opportunity of producing additional evidence.</P>
    <P>I make the same appeal on behalf of members of Cumann na mBan.  Many of those women gave great service and made great sacrifices during the period that we are considering.  They are now married women.  At the period I speak of, they went into the hills and nursed wounded men and on many occasions, as I know myself, they were fired on by the British Forces.  In certain districts applications for pensions on their behalf have been turned down. I hope the Minister will give consideration to their case and to that of the Old I.R.A.  Deputy MacEoin made a very good case for the men concerned, in one of the best speeches that I have heard for a long time.  I would ask the Minister not to have this matter put to a vote, but to accept the suggestions that have been put forward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the requests made to the Minister by previous speakers.  If it is not possible to grant pensions, then let gratuities be granted to those who gave service in the period under review.  I, with others, have raised this matter on previous occasions.  A number of those men waited on practically every member of the House about a month ago. They told us that men who had served the country were now suffering hardship, and asked if we could do anything that would tend to improve their position.  I think that, instead of appealing to the Minister to do something in these cases, a united demand should go forth from every part of the House on behalf of those men.  In cases where service is proved, then let an adequate gratuity be paid.</P>
      <P>There is also a difficulty in regard to soldiers who are killed and those who meet with accidents and are discharged.  In the case of death, parents sometimes find a great difficulty in proving dependency.  The position should be made easier for such people. We have also the cases of soldiers who suffer a breakdown in health.  Unless a soldier can show that his breakdown in health was due entirely to something that happened in the Army, he is not entitled to consideration.  To say that his ailment was aggravated by Army service will not be accepted.  We all know that young men joining the Army have to pass a severe medical examination. After some years of training they may have a breakdown in health.  They may be suffering from tuberculosis or some other disease.  They are told that their Army service was not responsible for that, and they are fired out on the scrap heap.  In such cases the parents have to do the best they can for them. If the soldier dies, the parents have to depend on friends or on some form of assistance.</P>
      <P>I also desire to draw the attention of the Minister to the inadequacy of the allowances that are being paid to the widows and orphans of officers and men who have died in the service.  These allowances have not been increased during the past five years, and, as we all know, the cost of living in that period has doubled, if not trebled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1609" /> The present allowances are totally inadequate to provide the necessaries of life.  Appeals have been made from many parts of the House for a bonus for pensioners who have served in various Departments.  I myself asked that a bonus should be paid on the pensions awarded to discharged or retired postal officials who are trying to live on 15/- or 16/- a week.  Appeals of the same kind have been made in the case of employees of local authorities who have been on pension for some years.  The widows of the officers and men that I now speak for find themselves in a sad pecuniary position.  Their husbands gave good service in the Army, and I suggest to the Minister that their widows and children should not be forgotten.  If a bonus is being given by the State to other retired servants, then I suggest it should not forget the dependents of those who gave good service in the Army.  We should not forget the widows and orphans of those men who died before the emergency.  The allowance which was fixed as a reasonable allowance for them then will only buy half the quantity of necessaries of life to-day and I earnestly appeal to the Minister to consider that point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Anthony has referred to the pensions granted under the 1924 Act as granted to people who had defended the State in its initial stages and to pensions granted under the 1934 Act as granted to people who wanted to destroy the State.  That is a misleading description in each case.  Under both Acts, the primary reason was pre-Truce service. The 1934 Act also included men who did not take action after the Truce.  The compensation paid to those men was not excessive.  Apart altogether from the risks to life and limb, there was a loss of time which they could have devoted to advancing themselves in their particular career or profession.  That loss was very considerable in the case of men who gave active service.  Even where the maximum pensions were paid, they are not, on the average, as well off to-day <Col N="1610" /> as they would have been, perhaps, if they had given no service to the State. I do not think anybody should seek to misrepresent their position.  Neither should it be suggested that a bad precedent would be established by giving pensions to able-bodied people.  The circumstances under which these pensions were earned are not likely to recur in the history of this country. We had only one successful War of Independence in 700 years and it is to be hoped that another war will not be necessary.</P>
      <P>The Minister should make perfectly clear the position of applicants who have been turned down and who still have an opportunity to appeal for reconsideration.  He should make clear to them what steps they should take and should remember the position of those who are outside this State&mdash;in the Six Counties, in Great Britain or the United States&mdash;and who may not have an opportunity of seeking that reconsideration.  By reason of the difficulties of communication at present, those people may be at a disadvantage and the Minister should make special arrangements in regard to their claims, where necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not intended to intervene in this debate, as I said most of what I intended to say when the Supplementary Estimate was before the House.  I had not waited until then to express my views on the constitution of the board.  I have turned up a report of the debate on the Estimate for Army Pensions in March, 1936.  That was when the 1934 Act was just beginning to come into operation, as an inordinately long time elapsed before any pensions were granted under that Act.  It is easy to understand that the preparatory work occupied quite a long time, as 20 years had then elapsed from the time of the Rising and 15 years from the time of the Truce, making it difficult to collect the evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was not in the House to hear Deputy Anthony's remarks, but I have listened with interest to what Deputy Cogan has reported of them.  In the 1936 debate I have referred to, I stated that, no matter what view one might have taken of the civil war, the House <Col N="1611" /> had passed the 1934 Act and, as a consequence, certain persons were given certain rights and were entitled to have those rights dealt with as expeditiously as possible and with a bias towards the applicant, in accordance with the intentions of the House.  I went on to say that the board under the 1924 Act was more favourable towards the claimant than the type of body established under the 1934 Act.  I advocated then that the law should be changed&mdash;which was not strictly allowable on an Estimates debate&mdash;and I advocated the amendment of the Act, in order to bring in the type of board we had under the 1924 Act.  That board consisted of two Old I.R.A. men and an independent chairman, who had nothing to do with the Old I.R.A.  In that respect, I disagree with Deputy Hogan's point that it is a fault in the referee that he should not have had pre-Truce service or service in the Old I.R.A.  In fact, the chairman of the board had no such service: he was a district justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>He was the chairman of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. F. Lynch Mr. F. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The chairman had no I.R.A. service, but as the board was then constituted, any two members of the board decided whether or not a person was entitled to a pension.  I have said already that I cannot remember one instance where there was a difference of opinion amongst the members of the board.  They thrashed the matter out and, as far as I can remember, the decision was always unanimous.  The administration of that Act is now almost complete, except in so far as appeals are concerned. It is idle to talk now about the type of board, since something was not done away back in 1936.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that blame is attached to the board in many cases unfairly. Perhaps I should not refer to this as a board at all.  It is not really a board; it is the referee who is the deciding person, and he is assisted by an advisory body.  But I think a great deal of the blame that is thrown on the referee should more rightly be thrown on the persons whose duty it <Col N="1612" /> was to see that verification was properly done.</P>
    <P>The people who administer the 1934 Act have difficulties that we did not have to face under the 1924 Act.  In the first place, ten years more had passed from the time of the 1924 Act, thus making it more difficult to collect evidence of events that occurred many years before, especially evidence relating to pre-1921 incidents.  There are also other aspects of the 1934 Act which made things more difficult from the point of view of administration. We who formed the board under the 1924 Act had not the question of rank to consider, and that is a very burning and very difficult question which arises in a great many cases under the 1934 Act.  Ranks were fixed for us under the 1924 Act by the rank which the man held on his discharge from the National Army.  In the second place, they had to deal under the 1934 Act with large numbers of persons of a type we had not to deal with.  I am calculating that the persons who took part in the civil war on the Minister's side would equal-out with the persons who took part in the civil war on my side&mdash;those in the National Army.  The 1924 Act deals with those who had pre-Truce and National Army service; the 1934 Act deals with those who had pre-Truce service and service with what we called the &ldquo;Irregulars&rdquo;, those who opposed the State in a civil war.  I calculate that those would balance out.</P>
    <P>But there was another group introduced which naturally came in when the 1934 Act was being passed.  It was the intention of Mr. Staines, who was a Deputy or a Senator at the time, that the &ldquo;neutrals&rdquo; should come in, those persons who had service pre-Truce, but who took no part in the Civil War; and there were also the Cumann na mBan. I forget whether that organisation was provided for in the original Bill; I do not think the Cumann na mBan were provided for in the 1934 Bill as drafted and introduced.  At any rate, examination of the cases of persons who took no part in the Civil War, but who had pre-Truce service, together with examination of the cases of persons connected with Cumann na mBan, added enormously <Col N="1613" /> to the work this body has to do. It is fair to them to say that, because comparisons might be drawn.  It might be mentioned, for instance, that we discharged the duties under the 1924 Act in four years to the day.  The 1924 Act became law on October 1st, 1924, and all papers and documents were handed over to the Government archives on October 1st, 1928.  But we had a much easier job.</P>
    <P>I think a large part of the blame is due to the slackness of the verifying officers attached to the brigade committees in the various brigade areas. In some cases there is something more than slackness alleged, and I am afraid I have come to believe that there is some foundation for that allegation&mdash; that some of the members of brigade committees, once they had looked after their own pensions and the pensions of their pals, did not worry themselves too much about their other old comrades. It is a shocking thing to imagine that that could be done, that there are persons of that type; but one has to come to the conclusion that that is so &mdash;that once they had looked after themselves and their friends, they took precious little care to worry about their other old comrades.</P>
    <P>When I was speaking on the Supplementary Estimate, I mentioned that I had become almost convinced that something of the kind occurred in the Kerry No. 2 Brigade area.  I have had no such complaints, or anything like the volume of complaints at any rate, from the other brigade areas in Kerry, the No. 1 Brigade area in the north and the No. 3 Brigade area in the extreme south&mdash;my own native area.  I have had no serious complaints about the work of the brigade committees in either the north or the extreme south, but I have had scores, even hundreds, of complaints about the work of the brigade committee in the Kerry No. 2 area, the east-Kerry area.  I had allegations from persons on whom I have very great reliance that certain members of that brigade committee were not themselves entitled to pensions, and that by one circumstance or another at the start they worked themselves in to be members of this committee, looked after themselves and their friends, and then acted in a way that was extremely <Col N="1614" /> contemptible, to say the least of it. They took no interest whatever in seeing that the cases of other unfortunate fellows were attended to.</P>
    <P>Some of those unfortunate men, through Volunteer work, through neglect of their education, largely because of their Volunteer activities, are now almost illiterate and are incapable of dealing with those rather instricate forms. Some of these men did not get anything like the assistance they should have got from the brigade committee, and for that reason I lay the greatest portion of the blame for any flaw there has been in this Act on the neglect of those bodies throughout the country rather than on the Referee and the advisory body here.</P>
    <P>I do know that the staff up there are extremely helpful.  Most of the members of the staff, to my own knowledge&mdash;the persons I have come across&mdash;were themselves active men in the Old I.R.A.  Many of them were civil servants then and many of them lost their positions in the Civil Service and they were reinstated after the Truce or subsequent to that period. They have the interests of the pensioners at heart and I know it melts their hearts to see how very badly certain cases have been presented, largely because of the negligence of the brigade committees.  The secretary of the board is outstanding in that respect.  I think any Deputy who has approached him in connection with military service pensions cannot but pay tribute to the work he has done. I say that the more gladly because he and I were on different sides in the civil war.</P>
    <P>I do not know that any good purpose can be served by what is asked for in a file I have here from the North Kerry Executive.  I am rather amused at getting it, because I had occasion a couple of months ago to give a very stern public rebuke to this body in the Kerry Press for making statements for which there was no foundation, and which they ran away from when I did give them the rebuke.  At any rate, I have this file which advocates a public sworn inquiry.  I say that I do not see what good purpose could be served by it. But, since some good purpose <Col N="1615" /> can be served by it, I think the Minister might give way.  I do not see what harm it could do and it might do good.  Personally, I should like to see an inquiry by some body into the operations of the brigade committee in the Kerry No. 2 area.  It would relieve the minds of a great many people if such an inquiry were held and it might clear the air.  If there is anything in the allegations that are being made, then that will be shown.  On the other hand, it will be to the advantage of these brigade committees if these allegations are disproved.  Therefore, I would support the holding of a public sworn inquiry to that extent.</P>
    <P>The operation of the abatement of pensions works out very peculiarly in some ways and I wonder whether, at this hour of the day, we might not reconsider that whole business.  The abatement of pensions was provided for under the 1924 Act.  Everybody who has any experience of legislation knows that once you create a precedent of that kind you will never get away from it.  There was a case for it in my view under the 1924 Act and I will tell you why.  There were a lot of young fellows being demobilised out of the Army in 1924.  The State was young.  There were a certain number of vacancies in various public services at the time waiting to be filled by suitable persons; but there were only a limited number in comparison with the number of persons who claimed to have a good deal of national service and who would be looking for them.  Therefore, it was really a way of limiting the number of applications for posts in the public service and in the service of local authorities, by making it more attractive for those persons who got pension to look for employment outside; in other words, if they got employment outside there would be no abatement in their pensions, whereas, if they went into the public service, there would be an abatement by which, in many cases, they would lose all their pensions and, in all cases, lose a proportion. That was the case for the provision in the 1924 Act.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1616" /> There is really no case for continuing it now, especially in regard to what you might call the more lowly-paid workers.  I say that there is justification even still where a person has a high salary&mdash;£500, £600, £800 or £1,000; there would be no point in such a person expecting to get paid his pension as well.  The extraordinary thing about it is that, if the service had been given in Germany, Japan, or Great Britain, the person would be entitled to draw his full pension.  But because his service happened to be in Ireland and the money will be coming out of the same pool, there is a provision that a person drawing a salary of a certain amount cannot draw any pension at all. But that should not apply to the junior clerk in the Civil Service or under a local authority or a person of that kind whose usual salary is only £2, £3, £4 or £5 a week.  That kind of person might be allowed to escape the abatement of pension.  It is now 23 years since the Truce, and I think it is time that we should wipe out that abatement, especially in the case of persons having up to, say, £300 a year.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary way in which this abatement works has come to my notice lately.  There are certain members of the detective division here who had pre-Truce service and were entitled to military service pensions.  Because they had completed 17 years' service in the detective force, they were recently granted a munificent increase of 2/6 a week or £6 10s. a year.  That brought them from one class into another, with the result that they lost £8 of their military service pension.  By getting an increase of £6 10s. a year they suffered a nett loss of 30/- a year.  Some provision ought to be made&mdash;I think it could be made administratively&mdash;by which that could be got over.</P>
    <P>There is another very peculiar arrangement in connection with the same people.  Some of them, who are married, in lieu of housing, uniform and boots, get a cash allowance.  First of all, they get an allowance for uniform and boots and then they get an allowance for married quarters. Because that is paid in cash, there is an abatement of their military service pensions.  If they were single men living <Col N="1617" /> in and getting these benefits in kind, they would not suffer this abatement in pension.  That is an anomaly. I am almost afraid to mention that, because I fear that those living inside will suffer an abatement which they were escaping before.  I hope that will not be the result.  I think that type of allowance should not be subject to abatement at all&mdash;the cash allowance in lieu of housing and uniform.  I shall wind up on the same note on which I wound up on the Supplementary Estimate. I ask the Minister to refer back all cases which come to him and let these people have another run for their money if they think they can put their case more lucidly than it was put before.  Do not stand too rigidly on this question of new evidence, because some of that evidence when presented more lucidly might be tantamount to bringing a man over the border line and qualify him for a pension.  I suggest that the Minister should send these cases to Mr. Cremin and let him decide whether or not, on the evidence that has newly come in, they would be worth referring back to the board.  I think that the applicants could wisely accept his verdict as to whether or not they would be eligible.  Of course, it would be throwing additional work on him, and I am sure he will not thank me for that.  But, from my experience of Mr. Cremin's work there, I think that, if he were given a discretion, after looking at the new evidence and at the files in his possession, looking at what came up before and the new evidence, he would be able to say whether the case was worth referring back and I should leave it to his judgment. If the Minister would agree to that, I believe the applicants would be well served.</P>

      <P>Upon another occasion I approached this matter in a spirit of accommodation and I am going to make the same appeal again to all sides of the House.  The motion is one that a Minister or a Government must reject.  Are members of the Government Party honest in the statements they make outside this Assembly and in the letters they have written to men who complain about <Col N="1618" /> injustice?  What are we to think of ambiguous statements such as that made here a moment ago by a Fianna Fáil Deputy, who, I think, when it comes to a question of voting in this House, will live up to the principles he has always lived up to, despite any Minister or any Government or any Party?  Either there is an issue here or there is not an issue.  Are there any men who gave service to this country who have been treated unjustly or unfairly or who have not had their case stated as it might be stated? Is that true or not?  We had two members on this side speaking on behalf of the I.R.A.  Incidentally, there is never any mention of the I.C.A.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. F. Lynch Mr. F. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Lynch</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>In my day, they were not included and maybe that was the unfortunate reason.  We have also heard reference to-day to Cumann na mBan but if I were an I.R.A. man, an I.C.A. man or a member of Cumann na mBan, and had to seek assistance and sympathy from certain Deputies, I would be ashamed to be associated with the application for that reason alone.  The Minister knows the background of this matter, and I submit that he should not allow himself to be misled by certain appeals on this issue.  Nobody will challenge the deep sense of sympathy of the Minister with all the groups associated with this movement&mdash;the I.R.A., the I.C.A., Cumann na mBan and American Alliance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the issue?  Certain men and women went out and risked everything &mdash;position, preferment and even the ordinary chance of life.  Some have been treated partially and some impartially, and there is a deep feeling of dissatisfaction amongst the men who had any connection with that period.  I do not know why it is limited to 1916.  The 1916 period could not have taken place, were it not for 1915, 1914 and 1913.  I was in Ottawa when word came across that the men had gone out in Dublin.  I went to New York as fast as I could and got in touch with those associated with headquarters.  I saw there an exhibition of incompetence and lack of knowledge of the <Col N="1619" /> people here.  I saw in an official paper three photographs of men who were said to be out in the Rising in Dublin. I would forgive the ignorance of those in the movement in New York because many of them were using the movement for political reasons for themselves, but there were men in the movement in America who knew intimately the men at home, and when one saw Sheehy-Skeffington with two foul beasts that cursed the world for too long and put forward as two of the revolutionaries who were out in 1916, it made one pause to think.  I do not want to mention the names.  They were put with men of great purpose, high-souled men, because of this lack of knowledge of the movement.</P>
    <P>The same thing occurs to-day.  There are people trying to use this movement to-day, trying to use the needs of these men and women, and we know what they were doing in 1916, 1915, 1914 and 1913, and what they were doing up to 1922, if the truth is found in the places where it can be found.  Now we get a certain sympathy for these men and women which is being utilised by mischievous elements who pretend that they have the right to speak.  There are many sections of the I.R.A. movement, and I suggest that they might get together on this issue, and go with other men and women who do not forget the historical truth and who know the things that happened and the services rendered, to the Government and say: &ldquo;Let us set up a court of qualification, a court of inquiry, and finish this matter.&rdquo;  I do not care whether you put Mr. Cremin, Deputy Moylan and my friend, Deputy Lynch, on that body.  Everybody knows that these men have records.  They have had their differences of opinion, and I hope they have settled them.</P>
    <P>Let these men sit down and let these other men come before them and say: &ldquo;This is my position and this is where I was.&rdquo;  If that body says: &ldquo;We cannot recognise your claim&rdquo;, that finishes it.  Let us get this thing finished in this generation.  I remember seeing a woman in America who was getting a pension from the American Government in respect of a man who fought in 1776.  We <Col N="1620" /> now have people claiming that they were associated with the movement here, and I see some of them getting pensions whose attitude in the years before I left for America we knew. We also knew what their attitude was when I came home and when the two sections here were at death grips with each other.  But they have pensions.</P>
    <P>I mentioned to the Minister on the last occasion the name of a man whom he knew when he was a boy running around the North Circular Road.  He knows his son who was in his own brigade.  That man had a British Army pension which he gave up when he went out in 1916.  He was out before that, and I suppose he took more arms over Portobello wall than possibly any man in Dublin.  His pension was taken from him as soon as he was tried by the British, and he afterwards was an applicant for a pension here.  He would not apply for a pension under the 1924 Act, but when the later Act came into force, he applied and got a pension.  For all his years of service&mdash;in jail, on hunger strike and getting ammunition&mdash;he got a pension of 5/- per week.  He lived for two months afterwards.  The treatment he got after all his appeals broke his heart.  That man was Patrick Kavanagh, one of the first members of the Citizen Army in Dublin.</P>
    <P>There was also the man I spoke of previously, John Cooper, who lay for 11 years in hospital in Dublin, as a result of injuries sustained in 1916. Not a soul ever went near him to give him a drink of water and it was only by accident that he was discovered.  He got a pension of 5/- and, when he died, he had not a soul in the world to bury him.  No Tricolour was put over his coffin and there was not a penny came from those who were his comrades.  I was glad when I saw him in the earth.  I could mention thousands of others like him. I meet them in the streets of Dublin&mdash; men who were wounded and men who developed organic diseases.  I remember my own sister treating a man for four years for wounds he had received. He could get no doctor to treat him at that time, and when he went to get his pension, he was not even considered. I knew that man when he <Col N="1621" /> was only a boy of 16 in Fianna Eireann.</P>
    <P>I suggest that you set up a body of men like Mr. Cremin and one or two others associated with him to which these doubtful cases could be referred. Let the men be told when going into that board that they will get every help in filling up their papers.  In that connection, what Deputy Lynch and Deputy MacEoin has said is true.  It must have been some lawyer who drafted these forms for the purpose of disqualifying people.  Surely the issue is: were you in the service of the nation; with whom were you associated; and is there anybody who can verify your statement?  Take my own case.  I have been asked in a number of cases to act as verifying officer and to state in writing that I know the men involved in the particular application. My statement was accepted.  I had occasion, not because I wanted a pension&mdash;whether I deserve it or not is another matter&mdash;to put in an application under the 1934 Act.  I need not tell the House that I would not have put in an application under the 1924 Act.  If that Government had remained in office to the day of judgment, I would not have moved, but I thought I would put in the application when a Government was in power with which I had a sort of sympathy.  To this day, I have not received even an acknowledgment of my application.</P>
    <P>Whether I was giving service in 1916, 1917 and 1918 is a matter which will have to be justified in some way, but the peculiar thing is that the Government of 1921 and 1922 paid people to defend me against charges arising out of my actions on behalf of this country. I must have been doing something, although I do not, like many people, tell everybody about what I am doing. I suggest that there may be a lot more men and women here who have as good a right to having their cases heard and giving them an opportunity to justify their position.  I remember that when I came back here from America&mdash;there had been a deputation of I.R.A.-men and officers, waiting for me in New York, who told me what was the position here at home, and I was still on active service&mdash;and I saw men here who were claiming that they <Col N="1622" /> were carrying on the fight in 1922 and who afterwards claimed that they carried it on up to the cease fire order, but it did not seem to me at that time that they were interested in anything. I knew everything about them, and it appeared to me that all they were interested in at that time was going to race-meetings and getting all the drink they could.  Yet I saw applications for pensions made by some of these men, and they are getting pensions, although, of course, some of their pensions are an insult to anybody.</P>
    <P>With regard, to the abatement of pensions, I think it is only right that there should be some abatement in the pension of a man who is already receiving a salary of £400 or £500 a year from the State, but I cannot understand why there should be no abatement in the case of a man engaged in an industry, let us say, and earning a salary of £5,000 or £6,000 a year.  As I have said, I can understand an abatement of pension in the case of officials of the State who are drawing large salaries from the State, but I do not think there should be any abatement in the case of the lower ranks, where a man is earning only £2 a week.  Yet that man has to suffer an abatement in his pension also.  Worse than that, if he applies for work on the rotational system under the Dublin Corporation or any other such body, the fact that he has a small pension comes up against him, and indeed, for a few years, until I broke it down, preference for ordinary labouring work, in one case, would not be given to Old I.R.A. men.  I think it would be agreed that preference should be given to a man who had served in the field, and eventually it was agreed that an Old I.R.A. man should get 25 per cent. preference in regard to ordinary street work, ordinary labouring work.  As soon as he gets that job, however, he loses the few shillings that he gets by way of a pension, and if he goes to the Labour Exchange to get his turn in rotational work, when he states that he has a pension he is cut off and cannot even get a term of rotational work. If that is not unfairness and absolute victimisation, I should like to know what it is.  What is the good of giving a man 5/-, 10/- or 12/- a week, and <Col N="1623" /> then depriving him of his ordinary chances of life?  I could quote dozens, even hundreds, of cases of that kind. Here you have men on the point of starvation, and just because they have these few shillings they are to be deprived of getting their ordinary chance in life.  I do not think that there is any man on those benches over there who could venture to justify that, and if there is any such man then I do not know what type of man he is.</P>
    <P>I would not mind so much if this were going to cost some enormous amount of money, but actually it would only cost the country a few pounds. You all have heard the indictment that was made to-day by Deputy General MacEoin.  It is time that somebody called attention to the matter.  Here you had an organised gang of bloody murderers, in half uniforms, brought over here to attack our people. These people gave 12 or 15 months' service against the men on our side here, the men who are now lying dead.  You crucify the dead, belie the living and deny them the right to live, while these foul beasts who came over here to murder our people&mdash; people who have had no equal in the annals of any country in the world&mdash; are getting in pensions over £1,000,000 a year.  Some of them are getting pensions of £1,000 a year after giving about one month's service in fighting our people, and yet you refuse to your own men, some of whom have developed all kinds of organic diseases as a result of their service to this country, a decent pension or even the right to live, just because it might offend the Minister for Finance; it might worry him; there may not be enough in this country to pay it, and so on and so forth.  Why did you put your hand to the plough at all if you were not prepared to go ahead with it?</P>
    <P>The Government that was in power at the time of the 1924 Act, of course, had men in uniform serving under it, and they could clearly point out that they were serving in the Army and could easily get the records, as has been stated.  They had had four years in which to get these records.  Then you had a hiatus of ten years, and <Col N="1624" /> after the lapse of that period, men had lost touch; they had lost documents, some of those who could have verified for them had died in the meantime, and so on, and it was difficult to get the records in the cases of these men after ten years. You had a statement here to-day, however, about two brothers who took part in an ambush, and when I was listening to that I was reminded of how it coincided with the case of men that I know of.  Two men had gone with a certain man, who had rendered a great measure of service to this country&mdash;he carried the stamp of it on his face and on his body&mdash;and these two brothers were to keep open the avenues of approach to the place of ambush.  They were to hold up anybody who might come along.  One brother got a pension while the other, who, in my opinion, had given more service, never even got a chance to put up his case.  Yet both of them had been in the fighting.  One had been in the British Army, came over here, threw off his uniform and stepped in to take part in the fight for this country. These are the kind of cases we meet with every day.  You listen to these men or to deputations on their behalf.  You get letters from them, but what is the use of all that if you cannot open the eyes of the Government to the facts as they exist, and get them to agree to grant even a measure of justice to these people?</P>
    <P>That is all we are asking for.  We are not asking to give pensions to people who do not deserve them.  If I thought that a fellow was a humbug&mdash; and I can damn quickly reckon a fellow up&mdash;if I knew in my heart and soul that he was a humbug and was only playing a game, I can assure you that he would not get away with it so far as I am concerned.  I know Mr. Cremin.  He is an intelligent man, who has given great service to this country, and nobody would dare to attack his position or reputation personally.  If I had a grievance, I would go straight up to Mr. Cremin and put it to him.  I would say: &ldquo;What do you think of this position, or do you think that this is just?&rdquo;  I remember Deputy General MacEoin in former days.  We all know <Col N="1625" /> what he has done, and do you mean to say that I would not go straight up to him and ask him: &ldquo;What is your opinion with regard to this case?&rdquo; and I would accept his decision, just as I would accept the decision of Mr. Cremin.  If he decided against me, then I would accept it.</P>
    <P>Now I do not think it is the desire of anybody here to press this matter to a division, and I think that the Government ought to agree to set up a committee of inquiry such as has been suggested.  Let it be a committee of this House, if you like.  Let there be two members from one side and two members from the other, even though they may have differed from one another in the past, appointed to sit on that committee and inquire as to the credentials of the individual applicants so as to determine whether an applicant would be justified in going any further with his case.  Is not that a reasonable proposition? In that case, it seems to me that a man would have no grievance, but so long as he has a grievance, he feels hurt, and I think we are all hurt &mdash;hurt as regards citizenship and as regards comradeship&mdash;and we do not want to feel when we go home at night that some comrade has been earmarked for unfair treatment or has been victimised in any shape or form. I think that that ought not be permitted to remain in the minds of anybody and I am quite sure that my comrades in the Labour Movement would stand for no kind of jobbery or corruption or for any man trying to get away with something to which he was not entitled.</P>
    <P>Instances have been cited from every side of the House of hard cases of men who have been waiting for years to have this matter considered.  Is that fair and proper?  We know how we in this country have differences of political views.  A man may be approached to verify on behalf of a certain applicant that he had given service and, because of his political views, he may refuse to do so.  That has been done openly.  I have heard that stated by such men to applicants.  I saw a man present a document for signature to another man, and, because of his political views, he refused to sign. Deputy Lynch pointed out that he <Col N="1626" /> knew of cases where certain people, because of political animus, refused to verify.  Does not the House know that that is true?  We have that attitude. It is not a proper attitude.  I would not care who the man was.  One particular man came to me to verify that he had given service in a particular organisation.  I did not like that man. I would not like to live in the same country with him if I could help it, but I appended my signature because I knew the facts.  Why should not I do so?  Why should not any other man do it?</P>
    <P>There were other matters with which I wanted to deal at some length.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle has been very good to me, and I think he was also very good to the Deputy who preceded me.  I should like to make this appeal to the Government: Because of old associations, and because of the appeal made by men who were associated with them in very perilous periods, who afterwards differed from them, now that they have come to realise one another's imperfections and, perhaps, lack of vision, and have come to work and associate together in order to carry this nation to what we all believe is its destiny, they should get this cancer out of the body politic, get rid of this disease, bring in some social doctors of the type I suggest to investigate the claims of the men and women who gave service to this country.</P>

      <P>It is essential, I think, in the interests of government in this country that there should be no body of opinion, no matter how important or no matter how unimportant, that believes that the laws are not being fairly and properly enforced. I intervene in this debate because of the grievance that exists in the minds of many of my constituents in the County Wexford, with regard to the administration of the 1934 Act.  It is not the first time that the case of these men has been mentioned in the Dáil. It has been brought up, I think, on every occasion on which it could be brought up.  My only interest in the matter is to see that if laws exist entitling persons to certain benefits the persons so entitled shall receive the benefits.  I have had for the <Col N="1627" /> past two or three years numerous letters placed before me in connection with cases in which, in my own personal judgment and from a perusal of the particular Act of Parliament concerned, there was undoubtedly evidence of a very substantial <i>prima facie</i> case for consideration and for the granting of a pension.  It is with that in view that I add my voice, as a complete outsider to any controversy that there might be between any particular interests in the particular organisation concerned, purely in the interests of justice, and in the interests of good government.  I would ask the Minister to create machinery under which the case of these particular persons&mdash;who by reason of an historical incident are particularly numerous in my constituency&mdash;will be reconsidered, and I would suggest that there should not be left any suspicion that there was unfair treatment or discrimination against anyone.</P>

      <P>At Question Time yesterday I put down a question and I notice that the matter has been mentioned by Deputy Lynch and Deputy Hogan.  I asked the Minister to have a public sworn inquiry held.  I come from Enniscorthy where, at the moment, I think the greatest grievances exist.  The men of Enniscorthy came out in 1916 on instructions from Dublin.  Many of those who took part in the Rising have been granted pensions but the majority have been turned down.  In some cases the referee and the committee grant pensions while in other cases, on the same references, and on similar evidence, they withhold pensions.  I am not speaking on behalf of anyone who has not a genuine case.  I have here statements signed by T.D. Sinnott, now County Manager; by Paul Galligan, Vice-Commandant of Enniscorthy, 1 Post Office Buildings, Henry Street, Dublin; by Seamus Doyle, ex-Adjutant, Wexford Brigade; by R.F. King, former Captain, Wexford Brigade, 1916; by Philip Murphy and by Patrick Keegan, Commandant and Quarter-Master, Wexford Brigade; by William Quirke, late Captain, F Company; by W.J. Brennan-Whitmore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1628" /> Evidence has been submitted on behalf of Enniscorthy men.  On the same references, some have been granted pensions and others have been refused. In spite of that evidence, these people have been turned down as not being persons to whom the Act applied, while others have been granted pensions on the same evidence.  I think that shows there is something wrong.  The question I put down yesterday is a question coming from the Executive of the Old Comrades' Association, Irish Republican Army.  Owen McCarthy of Cork is the General Secretary.  I know men in Enniscorthy who were the first I saw in the Volunteer uniform before the Rising, who did anything that could be done in the fight for Irish freedom, who have been turned down as not being persons to whom the Act applied, although the evidence submitted could not have been better than what is contained in the papers the signatures to which I have read.  The majority of the Enniscorthy people can prove that beyond doubt.</P>
    <P>In 1916 I was myself a bank porter in the Munster and Leinster Bank.  I joined the Volunteer Forces there at an early stage.  I belonged to the Shannon Company in 1914 and I stood in the shadow of Vinegar Hill when the late Pádraig Pearse, God rest his soul, addressed that company. I took my part in the Rising although I did not seek a pension.  I was one of those who was not arrested and I went back to my job when the surrender came.  The leaders of the Volunteers in Enniscorthy came to Arbour Hill to interview Pádraig Pearse before they surrendered in Enniscorthy.  The men in Enniscorthy did not surrender until their leaders came back from Arbour Hill and the conditions of surrender to which they agreed were that the six leaders who signed the Proclamation were to be detained but that the rank and file should go free.  What happened?  The leaders were taken into custody and all over the town there were wholesale arrests.  The men were taken away to Frongoch and the other detention camps and were kept there until Christmas.  I was lucky in that I was <Col N="1629" /> not arrested but I left the town soon afterwards and went to Scotland with many more of my comrades.  I passed through Dublin on the 6th June, 1916, and I remember seeing Liberty Hall smouldering.  I went across the Channel and remained there until Christmas. It should be remembered that certain employers at that time would not take into their employment any person who had hand, act or part in the Insurrection. The soldiers at the time were making many arrests and the manager of the bank said to me: &ldquo;O'Leary, I should not like to have you taken out of here; this is a Government job.&rdquo;  I then went my way.</P>
    <P>When the forms came out in 1934, with a number of my comrades I filled in a form.  I was called to Collins Barracks soon afterwards but at that time I was in Galway at a union conference and I never appeared before the Referee.  After some time I got word that I was not a person to whom the Act applied, although I never went before the Referee at all.  That was the way the majority of the people down there were treated.  Some of them, ordinary workers, went to the trouble of getting motor cars to come up here to Dublin.  At the time many of them were unemployed.  After a short time they were informed that they were to be cut off without any pension.  Very few of these men got any pension.  The I.R.A. from that district feel that they have a big grievance and it will never be redressed unless the Minister does what we ask him to do to-day.  Some of them are in receipt of pensions of 3/6 a week and that is deducted from the unemployment insurance to which they are entitled.  One of these men had 6/- a week unemployment benefit, but when he got his pension he was not allowed to sign at the labour exchange and as a result he could not get any work on relief schemes.  That is happening all the time in my constituency.  I submitted a list of 40 names; I am not making an appeal for any individual in particular but I want all these cases as far as possible reopened so that a fair chance will be given to the people concerned because a very big grievance exists in Enniscorthy and in the rural <Col N="1630" /> area adjoining, in regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>Throughout County Wexford you have also a number of men who took part in the fight later than 1916.  They took part in ambushes down there in the fight against the British and in the civil war as well.  Some of these men who took part in the civil war on what is now the Government side have been turned down although men who took part on the Cosgrave side got pensions. That has given rise to another grievance. There are also some ladies in Enniscorthy who took part in the struggle.  A few of them got pensions while others were informed that they were not persons to whom the Act applied.  There is no doubt that Enniscorthy should have received more consideration than any other town in Ireland because the men came out there when the word was given.  They came out on Easter Monday.  Since that time one of those who signed the Declaration has passed to the next world.  He was at one time employed in the Department of Fisheries and after his death his wife got only a few pounds that was due to him.  He received only £4 per annum of his pension while he was employed and after his death she got £15.  At the moment she is in very bad circumstances.  She had a son who was in the Army but he was discharged for some trifling reason.  He then went to the North and joined the air force there.  I appealed to the Minister some time ago to reconsider his case as he wanted to get back to the Army here but without avail.  He was put out of the British forces in the North because he had in his pocket the record of his father's participation in the Rising of 1916.  He was discharged and sent across the Border.  At the same time he was willing to join the Army or the Marine Service here, but his application was rejected.  There are several other people who have been discharged from the Army for trifling reasons.  I have already written to the Minister in connection with the case of men who had scabies and who contracted skin disease on their discharge. They are now on home assistance.</P>

      <P>In the case which I have in mind it turned into eczema.  I have one case from New Ross before the Minister at the moment.  A number of other soldiers were discharged and would be very grateful to get this 6d. per day deferred pay now, to help them over these hard times instead of waiting until the emergency has passed. It is doubtful if some of them will live until after the emergency is over.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I would appeal to the Minister, on behalf of the 1916 men in Enniscorthy, to set up a sworn inquiry to consider the cases of men whose claims for pensions have been turned down.  I think the House will agree that that is necessary because it is apparent that there is some undercurrent at work when the claims of some men, who have as good a case as people who got pensions, have been turned down.  I appeal to the Minister to give favourable consideration to these claims from Enniscorthy from men and women.  A few of the Cumann na mBan there got pensions but others got nothing.  I would ask the Minister to give the demands that have been submitted to him from all I.R.A. men in the whole of Ireland his earliest attention and to set up this sworn inquiry. By doing so, he will be merely doing justice to the men whose actions from 1916 onwards made this Dáil possible.</P>

      <P>As far as the men who have lost their health as a result of their activities are concerned, I trust that the Minister will satisfy himself fully that ample justice is being done to them, and not only that, but that he will see, so far as humanly possible, that the conviction is carried to their minds that justice is being done.  In this world you may do justice and yet fail to carry conviction to a man's mind that you have done it, so that his grievance is just as great as if he had been treated unjustly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I hear Deputies wailing and lamenting the sad cases of vigorous, hearty men who have not got pensions <Col N="1632" /> for what they did in 1916, 1919, 1921 or in the years that followed, I must confess that I have very little sympathy with them.  I see Deputies sitting in this House&mdash;hearty, strong, vigorous men&mdash;who, as far as I can see, suffered no ill effects from their exertions in 1919, or at any other time, and yet they are enjoying comfortable pensions for the rest of their lives.  At the present time the Greeks are fighting for their existence, the Norwegians are fighting for their existence, the Danes are fighting for their existence, Belgians are fighting for their existence, the Dutch are fighting for their existence, the Yugoslavs are fighting for their existence, and the Bulgarians are fighting for their existence, all fighting a very bitter and dangerous war.</P>
    <P>All the simple, plain people of these countries are not conscripts, and they are all out in the trenches under heavy and intensive fire at times, and I do not suppose that it is suggested that every private soldier fighting in the battlefield in defence of his own particular country is going to receive a pension for life on the scale of the 1924 Act or the 1934 Act, provided he emerges from the conflict unscathed.  He will look back on that period of service to his country as part of his duty as a citizen to defend his country when his country stands in need of defence, and he will resume his job of trying to earn his living.  That is not an ungenerous attitude.  You hear Deputies every day complaining that somebody or another has not got a pension&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was born in the tradition that if you went into exile you went into exile, and you came home and struggled to your feet again, and tried to get on, and the only reward you wanted was your belief that your exertions were in the common cause. If you went to jail you went to jail and came out again and you went on once again with your work.  It never crossed the minds of these men that they should saddle themselves on the Irish people for the rest of their lives. What is the justification for quartering all these men on the community for the rest of their lives when they are well able to earn their own living?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to distinguish between the men who were incapacitated and the men who were not.  I want to go to the assistance of the man who is incapacitated so that his wife and his family will not suffer because of his incapacity, but I see great big, burly men, weighing up to 20 stone, who have been quartered on the community for the rest of their lives, and I cannot understand why they do not earn their own living like the rest of us.  All honour to them for exerting themselves in doing what they thought was right. I am perfectly sure that when they took those risks, they were not taking them from any base motive.  They were actuated by lofty motives.  That being so, why do they tarnish their own action by quartering themselves on the community now?  Upon my word, in view of the recent agitation that more pensions should be granted, I would recommend that these big, healthy men, for shame-sake, should go to the Government and say they want to earn their own living and do not want pensions. I remember before they came into office that Fianna Fáil campaigned the country with the thesis that they were going to take pensions from every able-bodied man when they got into office.  They got into office and then <Col N="1634" /> somebody said: &ldquo;Why should we not give pensions?&rdquo; and there and then they executed a complete <i>volte face</i> and to-day we are looking at some of the healthiest pensioners I ever saw in any country in the world.  I hope they will long survive, and from all present appearances they show every sign of doing it.  It is the strangest change of policy I have ever seen.  There is a good deal to be said for the thesis that people in full health and earning capacity should never have got pensions and I suggest that if we go on distributing pensions we do not know where we may stop.</P>
    <P>Somebody has suggested that simply by a change in the administration of the Act, large categories of persons could be brought in to get more pensions. We have almost reached a stage when a man who has not got a pension will be as rare as a white blackbird. If you had the legions of people who have got pensions for this or for that, and tried to assemble them in the Fifteen Acres in the Phoenix Park, I doubt if you would find room for them. At some stage we will have to call a halt when we find the community is unable to bear the expenditure in which these pensions involve the State.  But a time has already come when a persuasive campaign on this question of pensions should begin.  It would not be so drastic as the one on which Fianna Fáil won the election.  I would not take a pension from anyone who managed to wangle one, but I suggest that if he weighed more than 14 stone he would consider surrendering his pension, and that those weighing between 12 and 14 stone would surrender half the pension, and be prepared to give the little fellows under 12 stone&mdash;those of modest dimensions &mdash;whatever pensions they have.</P>

This country should be profoundly grateful to God for preserving Seán MacEoin to serve his country.  Probably no soldier suffered heavier or more dangerous wounds, and Seán MacEoin is the last man who would wish anyone to refer to that.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I make that suggestion, that instead of adding large categories to the roll of pensioners, we should make up our minds that a subtraction might properly be made.  At the same time, let us examine our consciences as to whether we should have been a little more generous to those who have lost their health as the result of wounds or suffering in the course of their activities, further exacerbated by the accumulation of years.  There are men in early middle age who have been able to carry the wounds and disabilities they sustained, but as years accumulate upon them, they are finding that they are breaking down under the strain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to see that kind of case reviewed.  I would like to see the men who carried on bravely, thus adding to their disabilities, having their cases reviewed when their earning capacity is failing earlier than they expected because they are delicate men. Reform on those lines would have the unanimous support of this House. Reform on the lines of adding to the already swollen lists of able-bodied pensioners may be consented to by this House because Deputies are afraid to speak the truth.  If any Deputy spoke what was in his heart, in 85 per cent. of the cases he would say that able-bodied <Col N="1636" /> men should not be added to these already excessive lists.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made my suggestion. Deputies fear to speak their minds on this matter because they believe that the group of persons who regard themselves as entitled to pensions is a powerful political force.  The same thing applies in America, where people are afraid to attack the American Legion, who are in the pension racket too.  There are people looking for pensions in my constituency and if they do not like what I am saying they can lump it.  I believe that the vast majority of the people agree with me, and I give my views every time an agitation is started to add to the list of pensions we already had.</P>
      <P>Unlike Deputy Cafferky, I am perfectly familiar with the way in which words can be misrepresented, and here and now I can forecast how my speech will be represented outside this House. It will be said that my views are that everyone who fought in 1916 and 1921 and in the years afterwards was a dirty, cowardly, worthless job-hunter. That is how my speech will be interpreted. The tale will be told widely that I insulted the memory of Pearse, MacDermott and MacDonagh, that I insulted the flag and tried to represent Sinn Féin as a dirty, money-grubbing conspiracy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There you are.  Deputy Brady has started it already.  That does not surprise me.  It hits him as it hits many others.  Everyone knows that I never had the least bit of sympathy with Sinn Féin.  Everybody knows I was opposed to Sinn Féin, but everybody knows that I respected those who honestly did their best to further the Sinn Féin movement according to their conscience.  I have the profoundest respect for the leaders of the Cumann na nGaedheal movement who founded the State and acted according to their conscience, and I <Col N="1637" /> have respect for those persons who went out on the Irregular side at that time according to their conscience.  I thought them terribly wrong, but that does not prevent me from desiring to see sufficient justice done to them.  I do not think, however, that justice demands that able-bodied men should secure the right to be quartered on the community for all time.  Help the wounded and afflicted, but take every precaution to see that able-bodied men do not creep in to gain the benefit of this clamour for pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I thoroughly agree with everything that Deputy Dillon has said.  He set out to make an honest speech and he did it as he is well able to do.  I hold the worst thing that happened was when the Government brought in this scheme of pensions for able-bodied men and I am speaking as a pensioner.  We should do justice to the maimed and impoverished men, but we have really degraded and dragged in the mud a great organisation, the I.R.A., which will go down in history as the greatest organisation the country produced. We went through a Civil War from 1921 to 1924.  In 1924, when the Government were going to disband the men who came out victorious, they found themselves up against great obstacles. Many men who had sacrificed six or seven years in prison were dissatisfied because they were going to be thrown on the scrap-heap when their money was gone and their hopes disillusioned. Those men said: &ldquo;We are not going to stand for this&rdquo; with the result that we were on the verge of another Civil War and a mutiny in the Army.  You can see the position.  The Government had barely pulled through one Civil War when it was facing another one, perhaps of more dangerous dimensions.</P>
      <P>There were many men in that Government who did not believe in a policy of pensions.  The late Kevin O'Higgins was one of the men who did not believe in it, and I think he was quite right.  When it became a fact that pensions were granted, it was only right that the people who were entitled to them should be looked after.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1638" /> That is why I stand up to make this appeal.  I thoroughly agree that it is not the Minister nor the two boards who are responsible.  In most cases, it is the mean attitude of some man down the country in a brigade area. Some of these men, having got their own pensions, have sat down and forgotten their comrades.  They were very vocal when they could join yet another organisation and get their pensions granted.  When they got their pensions, they forgot their comrades and would not bother giving them even the signature on the document which was necessary when making an application.  It is hard luck on the Old I.R.A. to have to wait from 1924 to 1944, especially in those cases where men gave worthy service. We find hundreds and hundreds of men drawing pensions, not only under the recent Act but under the first Pensions Act, who never did a day's work for the country.  I believe that a sworn inquiry into the matter is desirable. The reason people are so sore about this crying for pensions is that they sometimes think they would be better off if they never had the I.R.A. They say that there is nothing but talk about what they did.  The men who did genuine work, such as the Minister and Deputy MacEoin, say very little about what they did.</P>
    <P>All this talk comes from men who are not entitled to pensions but who are trying to wangle them by hook or by crook.  Some of them are holding back the few remaining men who are entitled to pensions and who are not getting them.  There is no doubt that a great many persons are drawing pensions who are not entitled to them. I ask the Minister not to put the final closure on the Pensions Act until justice is done to those remaining.  In my own county, there would not be more than six or seven who are entitled to pensions and who have failed to obtain them.  It would be easy to cover all the genuine cases.  The members of the adjudicating board should be men like the Minister, Deputy MacEoin and Deputy Lynch. Although we differed in the past we are practically back at the stage where we began.  We have almost forgotten old quarrels and we may march <Col N="1639" /> shoulder to shoulder as old comrades again.  It would be a great thing for the country if the few hundred cases that remain were dealt with, so that it would not be necessary to make an appeal next year.  Nothing is so humiliating to an ex-I.R.A. man as to have to appeal on behalf of his comrades 25 years after the event.  I appreciate the view of Deputy Dillon and those who, if I may say so, were standing on the fence and looking at the matter from a different viewpoint. They were as loyal and patriotic as we were and they would have done as much if they had seen things as we saw them.</P>

The country will never get respect if we cannot agree to differ.  Every time Deputy Dillon gets up to speak, he speaks the plain, naked truth, as a man, and we must respect him for that.  We have a good many Deputies here getting up with their tongues in their cheeks and saying what they do not believe.  That is what has our country where it is. I shall tell the truth whether it hurts or pleases friends or foes.  I was elected for that purpose and, if I be put out of public life for telling the truth, I shall go out honourably, with my head up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The speech made by Deputy Dillon was a very outspoken one and was the speech of a brave man, but I think it is obvious to everybody that Deputy Dillon is not completely in touch with the situation.  He is not in touch with the circumstances of the Rising of 1916.  I am not one of those who would advocate a pension for an able-bodied man who has his profession, but the position is that, whether we like it or not, certain people enjoy <Col N="1640" /> pensions under the different Acts of the Oireachtas, notwithstanding that they are, or would be considered to be, able-bodied men.  Some people would suggest that nobody should be given a pension or an allowance unless he had been disabled in the fight for Irish freedom, but we must remember that young men had their careers interrupted at that period. Some of these young men were serving apprenticeship to certain trades.  Some were studying at secondary schools and universities for certain professions. They had to leave these training places because they had taken up arms in defence of their country.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon referred to Belgium, Holland, Rumania, Bulgaria, and other countries.  I suggest to Deputy Dillon and everybody else who thinks like him that the position in these countries is not parallel with the position here.  Here, unfortunately, we had not only the British against us, but we had a great many of our own fellow countrymen against us.  In consequence of that, it was necessary for those young men who went out to fight for their country to remain on the run for from five to seven years, with the result that they were unable to fulfil the apprenticeship which they had taken upon themselves, or to follow the courses in the schools upon which they had entered.  Apart from that, many men are to-day a bundle of nerves because of what they went through.  Some men had to lie out in ditches and haystacks in all sorts of weather and their health has suffered as a consequence.  Surely, neither Deputy Dillon nor anybody else would suggest that men of that type should not receive a pension for the service rendered to their country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great deal depends upon the interpretation of &ldquo;major engagement.&rdquo;  I was struck by the interpretation placed upon certain sections of the Act by Deputy MacEoin.  Here is a man who went through every stage of the battle for Irish freedom.  He knew what he was talking about because he had to deal with members of his brigade.  He cited to us cases of men who were on outpost duty.  These men, he said, <Col N="1641" /> might never have taken part in what would be considered a major engagement. Yet, he was of opinion that these men should get the same consideration as the men who received pensions.  I feel it incumbent upon me once again&mdash;I have been doing it for the past ten years&mdash;to refer, even at the risk of boring the House and the Minister, to the case of the Enniscorthy men.  Here is the only town outside the City of Dublin which took up arms in a general way.  Not alone the men of Enniscorthy, but the members of Cumann na mBan and Fianna Eireann were concerned.  On Easter Monday morning, 1916, they took over complete control of the town.  They kept control of the town for a week. When word was conveyed to them in some manner that Patrick Pearse, James Connolly, and the other leaders &mdash;God rest their souls&mdash;had surrendered in Dublin, they refused to believe it.  They insisted on being brought to Dublin to confer with those leaders before they would agree to relinquish the fight for Irish freedom at that time.  Some of those men have passed to their eternal reward, but the great majority of those who fought under them are still in Enniscorthy. Some of them have received pensions. Others who gave equal service in the cause of Irish freedom, not alone in Easter Week, but prior to and subsequent to Easter Week, are still seeking justice.</P>
    <P>I was arrested in Easter Week.  I served a term of imprisonment in Stafford Prison with Enniscorthy men who are now seeking pensions.  I know the earnestness with which these men, too, took up the task of fighting for the freedom of this country.  Some of those who were then strong men are now in a delicate state of health. When some of these men returned they found, unfortunately, that those for whom they worked refused to take them back into their employment.  They had to walk the streets of the towns and the cities of Ireland in some cases for years, and as a result of not being able to procure work to support themselves and their families they fell into ill-health.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1642" /> I submit that that was due to the task they took upon themselves in Easter Week and at subsequent dates. Not alone were men from Enniscorthy involved but men from Ferns, Ballycarney and surrounding districts.  Men anxious to strike a blow for Ireland came to Enniscorthy to take part in the fight in Easter, 1916, and it is poor compensation for them to find that, in order to prove their claims for Army allowances, they have to go to Dublin to face what is almost a board of judicial inquiry.  Many men from distant parts were perhaps never in Dublin previously, and when they go before the tribunal they become agitated and may give answers to simple questions which may prejudice their cases.  When is the Government going to do something which will remove the necessity for debates of this kind when this Estimate is being considered?  Those of us who have been members of the Dáil for a considerable time when we go to districts in which there are men who served their country faithfully in the past, are constantly being asked by them when they are going to receive proper treatment.  They remind us that it was the sacrifices made by them that resulted in the setting up of this House and in creating the positions we now occupy.</P>
    <P>Through the medium of their organisation these men are asking for a sworn inquiry into the working of the different Military Service Pension Acts.  Why should not that request be conceded?  We are entitled to assume that if it is conceded they will accept the findings of such an inquiry.  Would not that be a good way, even from the Government point of view, to dispose of this problem once and for all?  Perhaps it would be well to bring new minds to bear on the question.  I do not want to say anything personal about one who has passed to his eternal reward, but for a considerable time a man who held a high position on the board which assessed pensions or otherwise, had been a member of the Irish Parliamentary Party.  I am not condemning them and I am not condemning the Parliamentary Party when I say that I think it follows as night the day that a man in his position, <Col N="1643" /> who had been antagonistic to the Sinn Féin Movement and to the I.R.A. during the greater portion of his life could not be expected to do justice to men whom he considered a few years previously to be his enemies.  I want to make it perfectly clear that I am not making a personal attack on that man.  I merely want to say that his mind and his surroundings would not permit him to give a fair decision in so far as these applications are concerned. I ask the Minister to make a serious effort to remove once and for all the necessity for discussions of this kind year after year.</P>
    <P>With regard to major or minor engagements, I would accept the proposal of Deputy Dillon that certain members of this House who were actively engaged in the fight for Irish freedom, such as Deputy MacEoin and others, who were members of the I.R.A., should form a committee to investigate the claims that have been heard and to find out if the Act has been applied in a generous manner towards people who were prepared to sacrifice their lives in the interests of their country.  It could be said of many men that they did not take part in what the Act defines as &ldquo;a major engagement&rdquo;. But we must remember that certain men were on duty at outposts and were ready, if necessary, to sacrifice their lives, but in their case the opportunity did not present itself as it did to others who are now drawing pensions, perhaps in consequence of one incident which was interpreted by the board as &ldquo;a major operation&rdquo;. I suggest that this country can once again well afford to go into the whole question of giving allowances to men and women who gave service when the country needed it.  The best service that could be rendered by this or by any other Government is to make a determined effort to settle this question before the Estimate comes up for discussion again.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin referred to the fact that when a man in receipt of an I.R.A. pension goes to the labour exchange to claim unemployment assistance the amount of the pension is <Col N="1644" /> taken into consideration.  I think that is dastardly, and I suggest that special provision should be made to deal with men drawing pensions.  I go further and say that men drawing pensions from the British Government should get the same concession.  For example, a man drawing a pension of 20 per cent. from the British Government, amounting to about 8/-, may have a sufficient number of children to enable him to draw the full 17/6 weekly.  That man may have sufficient children to enable him to draw the full 17/6 that a man in the same degree of need would be permitted to draw, but because he is in receipt of a pension he only gets the difference between that amount and the amount which a person who is not in receipt of a pension would get.  That is not the worst of it.  If there is a relief grant in the area and that man is drawing 8/- per week and the amount he would be able to draw if he had no pension would be 17/6 per week, it is only when the labour exchanges get down as far as the people getting 9/6 per week that man is given a job.  Surely that is not the proper treatment for men who were prepared to sacrifice their lives to achieve the country's freedom.</P>
    <P>We all know what we thought of the I.R.A. in the old days; we know how we cheered when the opportunity presented itself for them to be able to appear in public.  Were it not for the sacrifices they made this Dáil would not be assembling here to-day.  I asked the Minister to go back to his Government and state what has been stated here to-day from all parts of the House. With the exception of two Deputies everybody is desirous that all those who have suffered in the fight for Irish freedom should be treated properly and generously.  This will not be a recurrent expenditure.  It will only be a case of a certain amount of money for a certain number of years, but let us do the big thing and recognise the sacrifices these people made and were prepared to make and let us once for all remove the necessity for long debates of this kind on Army pensions.</P>

      <P>One would imagine from listening to Deputies Giles and <Col N="1645" /> Dillon that any member who does not speak with the same voice as they is saying something that he does not exactly believe.  In my opinion that is a very unfair statement for any Deputy in this House to make.  No doubt there may be Deputies on the Fine Gael Benches, on the Fianna Fáil and Labour, too, and perhaps on ours, who do believe that there should never have been any such things as pensions for the men that were in the Old I.R.A.  I believe no doubt there are, but when you hear Deputies in this House standing up to-day and advocating that, you very naturally ask the question why they did not advocate that view when such legislation was going through in this House.  We know very well in their day it was started.  Undoubtedly, it is an Act of this House, and Fine Gael in their day started it by their Pensions Act.  Fianna Fáil started the racket by saying that they would take the pensions from them when they got in, but when they got in they gave pensions to their own men.  My view, to be straight and honest is, first and foremost, that those people who went out and made these sacrifices are certainly entitled to some pension. Take a farmer's son who sacrificed his home and went out to fight, or take the students that were in college and went out on the run for years.  Surely they made sacrifices, and at the least they should get some compensation for the sacrifices they made.  I do not know whether this matter has been mentioned, but I would ask the Minister to take serious note of the discontent which exists&mdash;and in my opinion there is cause for it&mdash;among the Old I.R.A. on the pension question at the present time.  We must remember that when the civil war broke out, of perhaps 90 per cent. of those who were in the fight for freedom, some went over to the Free State forces side and others remained on the Republican side. Loyal comrades and good friends parted company, and no doubt the greater friends they are, when they part company, the greater enemies they become.  The civil war ended, and later on under the Pensions Acts what were called verifying officers were appointed. These people generally were <Col N="1646" /> brigade O.C.s and battalion O.C.s in the fight for freedom in the early days. Does the Minister expect that these verifying officers who come up to give evidence are to make their statements in camera to the board?</P>
      <P>In the case of a man who was an O.C. of an I.R.A. brigade that went over to the Free State side in the Civil War, does the Minister not realise that it is very possible that that man would not give an honest statement about his comrade in the days from 1916 on?  The same thing applies to a man who fought on the Republican side and who was later appointed a verifying officer.  Do you believe he would give an honest statement? I am not saying he would not, but it is very likely he would not. In my opinion, honest statements were not given by these verifying officers in many cases.  This is one thing I would ask the Minister seriously to consider, because I know that in my own area, while there are certain men getting pensions who deserve them, there are men who have been turned down who definitely deserve them as much as the men who are getting them.</P>
      <P>All these verifying officers were themselves applicants for pensions. What percentage of these officers were turned down?  Were not pensions granted in the cases of all verifying officers?  Another statement was made at a political meeting&mdash;I think the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis.  A certain Minister made a statement that something like 60,000 or 80,000 applications were made for pensions, and he said that he believed that if Michael Collins were alive to-day he would say that there was not that number in the fight for Irish freedom.  Probably the Minister can correct that.  But would the Minister just examine this matter: how many brigade O.C.s who were supposed to have 300 men under their command, and how many company captains who were supposed to have 60 men under their command, got pensions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If he would multiply the number of officers by the number of men whom they were supposed to have under <Col N="1647" /> them, he would find, I think, that there were over 80,000 men in arms against the British in this country.  I know a certain man in my area who got an I.R.A. pension.  Would it surprise the Minister to know that because he is in receipt of that pension he is debarred from benefiting under certain schemes that are being operated in my county?  This man was a farmer's son; he went out in the fight for freedom, got wounded, and was interned. He is, as I have said, debarred from availing of certain schemes under the Department of Agriculture because of the fact that he is in receipt of a pension.</P>

      <P>It shows, anyhow, the treatment that is being meted out to some of those men.  I fail to see why the Minister would not agree to have a committee set up to consider these cases.  Let it be composed of men sitting on both sides of this House.  The committee might be composed of five or six, and you will find genuine Old I.R.A. men on both sides of this House.  Let the function of that committee be to examine all cases independently.  If that examination is carried out, I venture to say that you will find pensions will be withdrawn from many persons who have them, while in many other cases applicants who were refused pensions will be granted them.</P>

      <P>It is only fair to say that under the 1934 Act the Minister, his predecessor and the Government acted in a very generous manner in regard to the claims of the Old I.R.A. Not only that, but they approached the subject fairly and impartially. There are many members on the other side of the House who were verifying officers, and they will admit that the Minister opened up cases which were turned down under the 1924 Act and got them re-examined.  I know of one case in which an award was made.  I <Col N="1648" /> am not against&mdash;though I do not see it will do any good-having a reexamination of cases over a series of years, cases that have been decided and in which awards have been made. I can speak as a verifying officer.  I am aware that when complaints came from brigade areas that there was unfair dealing the Minister opened the door and allowed the brigades and battalions to meet; he let them elect a fresh group of verifying officers. That happened in the First Eastern Division anyhow.  It happened in Louth, Meath, Kildare and part of Offaly.  I feel, at the same time, that when dealing with pension applications under this Act there was a sudden closing of the door, and that the operation of the Act was brought to an end.</P>
      <P>So far as my area is concerned, I have nothing to complain of.  I think that the men who gave service got their reward.  At the same time, I feel that there are a number of borderline cases of men who would come within the definition of &ldquo;key-men.&rdquo; These should not have been dealt with in a sudden fashion.  I think that we would have from a dozen to 20 such cases in my area, and I imagine that in every other brigade in the First Eastern Division you would find much the same thing.  From my knowledge of the country, Irishmen are much the same all over.  From conversations that I have had with Deputies on the other side of the House, I think that if these cases were met, and if their number was limited to the definition of &ldquo;key men&rdquo;, all the complaints that Deputy Corish referred to would cease.  The cost would be light, but I am not concerned with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that this nation could never repay in money or in kind the sacrifices which those men made from 1916 to 1921.  We do not want them to go out at the end of their lives as the Fenians did, soured, disillusioned and bittered.  We have freedom now, and we do not want them to go to lonely graves as so many of the Fenians did. Theirs was not a loquacious part. They neither shouted nor bawled, and <Col N="1649" /> they did not make speeches.  A lot of them gave their lives for the country. Many of them were in the ranks, not for a year or two years or three years. A lot of them in 1913 joined the Fianna as boys.  They gave to the service of the country the best part of their lives, and were active from 1913 to 1923 or 1924, no matter what side they took. At any rate, the best years of their lives went into the Cause, and neither money nor goods could repay them.  It is extraordinary that in this Assembly we should hear the Dillons and the rest who never lost a wink of sleep or a night's rest, gassing away.  It is terrible in this year of 1944, in the national Assembly&mdash;I would not mind it occurring in stormont or somewhere else&mdash;to hear the Dillons and the Anthonys and the rest of them.  It is a disgrace in the national Assembly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>I am still of the opinion, which I expressed in this House on the first occasion that I dealt with the question of pensions to the Old I.R.A., that the great cause of the uneasiness and jealousy that exist to-day between those who received pensions and those who did not, arises out of the Act of 1924, and of the later Act of 1934.  The Deputy who has preceded me shouted about the Dillons and the Anthonys.  I want to assure him that, as far as my people are concerned, we were not opposed to the I.R.A. movement in its early days.</P>
      <P>Even if it were necessary, in order to complete the freedom of this country, we would not be opposed to it.  What I am opposed to is that men of physical ability should be drawing pensions.  Some of them have professional or other positions in life and did no more than some of those who have been turned down, and perhaps less. That is the reason for the agitation of those who have been disqualified and who are now asking Deputies to put their cases forward in the House on every possible occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the legislation had been passed to deal with men who were injured&mdash;like Deputy General Seán MacEoin&mdash;or their widows or children, the Act <Col N="1650" /> should have dealt with that type of person and not with physically fit men. When Fianna Fáil were in the minority and were endeavouring to become the Government, they denounced in the strongest language, from political platforms and even from these benches, the actions of the Government of that time.  When Fianna Fáil came into power, however, instead of repealing or amending the 1924 Act, they brought in another Act and granted pensions to their own group.  Deputies may think that I am envious or bear some spite or hatred towards the I.R.A. men. How could I, coming from the county from which I come?  I was often taken out of bed and put lying on the floor, in order to give those men a bed to lie on.  We housed them for years and years, and hundreds of people did likewise, and were only too willing to do it.  As schoolboys, we helped to carry stories of the movements of the Black-and-Tans and R.I.C.  How could I bear hatred towards those men?  I rise to protest against the putting of a greater burden upon taxation, by granting another few thousand pensions to physically fit men.  The Minister would satisfy all sides of the House by repealing the Acts of 1924 and 1934 and dealing with injured men or their widows and children, if in need of assistance from the State.  That would settle things, once and for all. Otherwise, even if the Minister sympathetically considers the points put forward now, certain men will continue to be dissatisfied.</P>
    <P>Many of those who were scouts at that time are of the opinion to-day that they should get pensions.  They were only young boys of 16 or 17 when the prisoners were let loose from Castlebar.  I had a brother, only a young lad, who did not take any part in the fighting with arms, and he could not be considered.  There are hundreds of those to-day who feel that they should get pensions.  The people generally are opposed to that&mdash;that is, if they feel the same way about it as those in my constituency.  It is an everyday occurrence to hear this pension principle described as &ldquo;a racket&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There are other men drawing pensions <Col N="1651" /> to-day whose qualifications we cannot fathom.  How did they qualify for a pension?  Living beside them and associating with them, we knew all their actions and knew whether they were on active service or not, whether they took part in an ambush or fired on any of the foreign troops here.  We know they did not.  Yet they have got pensions.  That causes a certain amount of querying, of jealousy and of envy, and people come to the conclusion that this Assembly is not what it should be.</P>
    <P>I do not rise to belittle the I.R.A. or the I.R.B., or any organisation associated with the War of Independence. I and everybody belonging to me were wholeheartedly behind it, and believed this country had the right to independence and to a national Assembly. However, it is wrong to think that we can compensate the men who fought in 1916, and down to 1922-23, by a pension or such remuneration.  The part they played in the defence of the country is a priceless one.  If Pádraic Pearse, James Connolly, Clarke or MacDonagh, who fought and died in the Revolution, were alive to-day and were offered payment in compensation for their patriotism, I believe they would consider it an insult.  They were opposing foreign force when England was in difficulties, as Czechoslovakia did in the 1914 war.  Instead of a pension, they might be compensated by the erection of some monument or by the inscribing of their names in a Golden Book, which through centuries to come would be a record of their patriotism.  They would prefer that to being offered a few pounds.</P>

The last time I spoke here, I may not have been as cute as I am now, and I was misrepresented.  Some of my opponents, for political purposes, tried to misrepresent my intentions and said I was trying to belittle the patriotism of the 1916 men.  I doubt if any man in this Assembly would, in his heart, try to belittle those men. Even if he did try, he would fail, as they were far above that.</P>
      <P>We see widows and orphans, old age pensioners and little children in poverty, misery and squalor in their homes in this country; and then we hear men on all sides of the House saying that, in order to remove this little bit of jealousy, bigotry or envy that exists between members of the old I.R.A., those who took part or did not take part&mdash;whether they did or not &mdash;should be given pensions in order to have finished with it.  I cannot understand the attitude of such Deputies.  I was listening to Deputy Giles.  He made a ferocious attack on me.

      <P>The Deputy asked me what I did in 1916.  Seeing that I was just a couple of years old at that time, I think it was a ridiculous question to put to me.  I am in this House because of the action of the I.R.A. in those years.  The I.R.A. were the cause of bringing this Assembly into being, and I realise that I could not be here if they had not played their part in 1916 and in subsequent years.  It cannot be assumed that I would not have played my part in 1916 if I was old enough then, nor can it be suggested that every young Irishman of to-day, if he was old enough in 1916, would have been a coward or would have worn the white feather and would not play his part with other Irishmen. That would be a wrong line to take.</P>

Perhaps, through no fault of their own, they may not be so much in touch with the people outside, and may not know the opinions of those people as to how things here have been run.  I should like to suggest to the Minister that there is only one way to end the type of controversy that exists in the House.  Either repeal all the legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Although the Chair rules that I must not make any suggestion about the repeal of legislation, in my humble opinion that is the only way to put an end to all this controversy. It has been suggested here that the Government might set up a board or a commission.  No matter what you may set up, I suggest that there will be men in the country who will declare: &ldquo;We are being victimised.  We took part in various incidents.&rdquo;  You will also have statements to this effect: &ldquo;I was not called out to take part in an ambush, but if I was called out I was quite ready to play my part.&rdquo;  I know hundreds of men who, if they were called out, would give of their best, and they might have equalled the best of the old soldiers of the I.R.A. if they were brought into action.  But there never was need to call on their services, or they never came up against armed forces, and, therefore, they are disqualified. That is the position that exists in relation to many men to-day. Until they die, or unless there is some change made in the legislation, you never will have a satisfactory position as regards dealing with the Old I.R.A.</P>

      <P>I am one of the people who were associated with the I.R.A. movement in Mayo during the period of the Black and Tan war and the civil war, and I think I know more about the people of Mayo than Deputy Cafferky.  In Mayo I met the finest <Col N="1654" /> types of men that Ireland ever produced. I met them when they were &ldquo;on the run&rdquo;.  I also met in Mayo the finest types of people the world has ever produced in so far as showing hospitality to the men of the I.R.A. is concerned.  I am quite satisfied that if I went to Mayo to-day and travelled over the same ground that I travelled there years ago, going through every village and town in the constituency that Deputy Cafferky represents, I would not find one individual giving expression to the views that the Deputy expressed here to-day. He talks about men with physical disabilities. The Deputy claims he was in the cradle at the time the fighting was in progress.</P>
      <P>The least anybody would expect here is that when a man talks he will talk on a subject he knows something about.  Deputy Cafferky, all the time he has been here, has been talking about the men of 1916.  There was fighting done in other years, too, but the Deputy does not know much about that either.  Does Deputy Cafferky deny that there were men who went out in 1918, 1919, 1920 and 1921, who sacrificed good careers and who were unable in succeeding years to pick up the lost threads, as it were, and put themselves on equal terms with their brothers and others who had never taken up a gun?  Does the Deputy suggest that these men who gave up good careers, and in later years were obliged to travel through all parts of the world, are not entitled to have their claims favourably considered by any Government which calls itself a National Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy then went on to apologise, to tell us that he did not want to be misrepresented as he had been mispresented here before, and that he merely wanted to make his position clear.  He mentioned that when he made a statement here a year ago he was not as cute as he is now.  Deputy Kennedy struck a note that anybody with any sort of a broad national outlook here would clap or cheer, and that is, that the Dillons and the rest of the people he named, who are claiming some sort of link with the past, had an outlook which is very far <Col N="1655" /> removed from what most of the nationals in this country to-day would regard as their type of nationalism.  I sincerely hope that Deputy Cafferky will try to study a little more of the history of his native county.  In all the fighting that took place in this country, I think there are very few counties that can say Mayo was second to them. County Mayo has taken up a marvellous stand all through the fight for Irish freedom, and the men who did their share in the fighting there deserve every consideration from the people of this generation.</P>

      <P>I do not dispute that. Deputy Donnellan questioned the Minister regarding the number of verifying officers who qualified for pensions. Any man who has had association with the I.R.A. movement can easily understand that if a veryifying officer did not qualify for a pension surely he could not qualify for the position of verifying officer.  Every verifying officer must be entitled to a pension. As to the question of I.R.A. pensioners being debarred from schemes of work in my county, I do not know that that <Col N="1656" /> is the case.  So far as the county council engineers are concerned, I think they give favourable consideration to these men.  There are, of course, certain types of work for which such pensioners will not qualify. I do not know any case of any man having been refused such work in my county.</P>
      <P>Every Deputy will agree that there are men who have been turned down for pensions who are definitely entitled to them.  In the making up of the case there was something wrong somewhere, and that was due to the fact that so many years have elapsed since these events took place and it is hard for people to stretch their memories back.  When filling up the forms, some men were not very particular as to what they put in.  They thought that it was merely a question of making application and that if there was any mistake they could remedy it at a later stage.  When they came before the board to be questioned, naturally a lot of them were very nervous, particularly when dates and periods were being thrown at them, and they were asked: &ldquo;What about such a thing in the first period and about such a thing in the second period?&rdquo;  and so on.  It is hard for a person to remember particular dates within a period.  I know that these officers were prepared to help them in every way they could, but these men did not understand that. If they had had the cheek to ask these officers a question regarding the dates, these officers would have tried to facilitate them as best they could.  But they did not do that, and the result was that the case they made on their application forms and the case that they made before the board conflicted, or one did not bear out the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was also, of course, the question of the case made by verifying officers.  In some instances, verifying officers had not gone into each individual case as they should have if they were to verify the cases properly.  If I have to make a case for an individual before any Department I must know the whole history of the case, or otherwise I cannot make the case as it should be made.  The verifying officers, after all, are only human beings and <Col N="1657" /> they may have had to verify the cases of 40, 60 or 80 men.  That would be all right if it were a question of doing it for a recent period, but when a man has to go back 15 or 20 years and try to remember things that happened in that period, particularly if verifying for a person who may have been with him in one scrap but not in another, it is very hard for him to make the position very clear.</P>
    <P>I know cases where references were submitted on behalf of men to the effect that they gave service in such-and-such a place on such-and-such a date and, for some reason, these references have not been accepted.  I sincerely hope that the Minister will find some way of dealing with these cases. The number is not so very great. Despite what Deputy Dillon or some other Deputies have told us thousands of times, this country is not bankrupt yet, and will get over having to contribute the few extra pounds to meet these cases.  The country will be able to survive that.  The Minister need not have any fear in that direction and the Minister for Finance can also be assured of that.  I ask the Minister, therefore, to give consideration to these cases.  It would be no harm if Deputy Cafferky realised that some of the men who were in this movement and who were actively engaged in service during those difficult years had their nerves shattered.  If you read the papers every day you will find that many of these men are fading away. These men are not to be compared with men who had a rather rosy time.</P>

      <P>I can enlighten you. Men who were in this movement went hungry for days, and, perhaps, for <Col N="1658" /> weeks they did not take off their clothes.  When that continued for a year or two years it must have an effect on them in later years.  Perhaps, that is a little bit of enlightenment for Deputy Cafferky.  Such hardships must have told on these men in after life. As I say, the number of these cases to be considered is not very many, and I am sure the vast majority of the people will be grateful to the Minister and the Minister for Finance if their cases are looked into.  Whatever small amount it will cost will be gladly met by the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear to me that the hub around which this debate revolved to-day was that pensions should be granted to everybody who stated that he had a claim to a pension. As most Deputies are aware, there is a board operating, with a judge presiding, and with representatives of the Old I.R.A. attending.  Applicants can place before that board any case which they have to make.  In the first instance, they are provided with forms in which they are asked to give certain details, following certain printed instructions, and every possible help, from the point of view of the printed form, is provided in order that the men may state as fully as possible every possible phase of service which they think they gave to the nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have seen some of these forms.  I have seen them filled in with very closely lined pages of writing.  I have examined some of them, not in my official capacity as a Minister, because I would have no right to see them, but in my capacity as a verifying officer in other times, and it was patent to me that the forms as filled in could never in any circumstances produce a result which would be favourable to the applicants.  These men not only had help from the printed form, but they had help from their colleagues, from men who had served with them in the Volunteers, and neither the men who were filling in the forms, nor the men helping them could produce any more evidence than was produced on the forms, and how that board can be expected to give a verdict in favour of <Col N="1659" /> the applicant would appear to me to be rather puzzling.</P>
    <P>The judge must base his decision on the evidence before him.  There have been three judges since the board was established, and not one of these, in my opinion, held the slightest prejudice against any of the applicants, and it was with very great regret that I heard Deputy Corish refer to the late referee &mdash;Judge O'Donnell&mdash;and use words to the effect that his former political outlook would not permit him to do justice to certain of the applicants.  The Deputy said he was not making a charge, but, if that is not a charge, I do not know what charges are.  It was certainly a very grave insinuation.  A judge, I understand, is sworn to do justice in the case with which he is dealing, and nobody who met the late Judge O'Donnell, whatever political views he may have held, either in the past or up to the time of his death, could suggest for a moment that he would refuse to do justice to applicants in general because he did not agree with the actions in respect of which they were applying for pensions.  I regret that statement very much, and I am sure that Deputy Corish, when making it, scarcely realised that he was making a charge against such an honourable man.</P>
    <P>The fact remains that everyone of these judges dealt with these cases on their merits and on their merits alone. They had no particular interest, good, bad, or indifferent in applicants. They had an interest only in the case placed before them for decision, and their decisions, I am certain, were always based on the evidence placed before them.  What else did we do?  We placed at the disposal of the referee two Republican Army Officers of senior rank.  What was the purpose of placing these officers at the disposal of the referee? It was to see that the interests of the applicants would in every case receive proper consideration.</P>
    <P>That was not sufficient.  I mentioned on a former occasion that I deliberately and with malice aforethought <Col N="1660" /> loaded the dice, so to speak, against the Minister for Finance, by placing in the position of secretary to the referee an old I.R.A. man with a record second to none in this country.  Deputy Lynch made an appeal to me to-day and said he would be satisfied if I agreed to allow the secretary to the referee to decide what cases should be referred back.  I want to assure the Deputy that that is in effect what has been operating for some time past.  Here we have the position of the referee basing his decision on purely legal grounds and the applicants being helped in practically the same way as that which operates under the British system of the &ldquo;soldier's friend&rdquo;, to which some Deputy referred to-day, and if the decision is against the applicant, the applicant is allowed 21 days in which to appeal.  Approximately 20,000 have taken advantage of that right to appeal.  Deputy Lynch was, I think, referring to a different type of appeal when he asked me earlier what number of appeals had been referred back by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister stated a few months ago that there were still about 50,000 appeals to be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>They have been dealt with, but I am referring now to appeals on the ground that there is now available additional evidence&mdash;which is a totally different type of appeal. These appeals numbered 808.  In other words, the applicant, having failed in his 21 days' appeal, makes an appeal in which he gives sworn testimony that the evidence he is now producing is evidence which was not available at the first hearing.  It is the usual procedure, I understand, in the civil courts, and 808 such cases have been referred back by me to the referee, on the advice of the secretary.  Of that number, 768 have been dealt with, leaving a small number still outstanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Practically every Deputy who spoke to-day referred to persons who were receiving pensions to which they were not entitled.  I do not know whether that was an insinuation against members of the board or not, but if any Deputy can provide me with evidence <Col N="1661" /> that there is a person in receipt of a pension to which he is not entitled I will guarantee to that Deputy to have the matter taken up and examined, and that if what he suggests is found to be the case, the pension will be withdrawn and the person who has made a false claim and, I presume, has produced false evidence to secure the pension, will be dealt with in the proper manner.</P>
    <P>There was also considerable reference to &ldquo;major engagement.&rdquo; There is no such thing as a reference to a major engagement in the Act. This conception of a major engagement, I understand, has grown up largely in the minds of the applicants themselves.  &ldquo;Active service&rdquo; is the only definition that comes near &ldquo;major engagement&rdquo; in the Act, and the words contained in the particular section are also contained in the section of the 1924 Act.  Listening to Deputy MacEoin and, to a certain extent, Deputy Fionán Lynch, to-day, one might come to the conclusion that all the cases that were dealt with under the 1924 Act were dealt with perfectly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the impression that was left on my mind, but it is not so.  I have had a number of individuals coming to me and making a special appeal to me to secure service for them, having failed to secure it under the 1924 Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of those men produced evidence to me such as was mentioned by Deputies here to-day, and naturally left me, as it must have left the Deputies who mentioned their cases here, wondering why the board turned the applicants down.  In one particular case that I have in mind the young man&mdash;and I am only telling the House now what he told me, and the members of this House will have to understand that when they are being told these things themselves, they are only hearing one side of the case&mdash;told me of a number of engagements in which he had taken part.  He <Col N="1662" /> not only told me that, but said that he was arrested whilst he was engaged in attending a particular class, an engineering class, I think, or something of that type, and that he was sent away to Wormwood Scrubs, where he went on a hunger strike of 24 days. After his release, he told me, he resumed his activities, was again arrested, and sent to Ballykinlar Camp, where he remained until the Truce.  After his release from Ballykinlar, apparently, he joined the forces of the National Army.  Yet, in spite of all this, according to himself at any rate, he had failed to secure a pension. I am only mentioning that case to show you that it is not peculiar to the 1934 Act that a man's claim, or his own estimate of his claim, at any rate, is not accepted.  There may have been very good reasons in this case, but that is what he told me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case, if the facts were found to be as stated by the man concerned, would not the Minister agree he would be entitled to a pension?</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>If the facts were as the man gave them to me, I certainly would be inclined to think that he would be entitled to a pension, but that is only my opinion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>What I was going to say was simply that the 1924 board must have had these facts before them, because if the facts presented to them were as they were stated to me by the man concerned, I do not see how the board could turn him down.  I do not know how Deputy Fionán Lynch, who, I think, was a member of that board, would have regarded the evidence I have mentioned, as having been told to me, as evidence of active service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. F. Lynch Mr. F. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Lynch</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I presume that what the man would have to do in order to secure a pension would be, not to convince me or any Minister for Defence, but to convince the referee. It must be remembered that when an applicant goes before the referee he is placed on his oath, and he may not be prepared to make the same firm statements that he has made outside when he had no commitments of any kind.  I must presume, therefore, that a very large number of the cases which have failed, have failed because the evidence which was placed before the referee and his assessors was not sufficient to secure the person concerned service as a person to whom the Act applies.  Now, the verifying officers were selected, not by the referee or by me, or by any machinery of State whatever.  They were selected by the applicants themselves in every respect.  When the 1934 Pensions Bill became an Act, the Brigades all over the country called together all their active officers.</P>
      <P>Here in Dublin I know that we called not only the active officers but the individual members, by having their companies remobilised, and there it was decided that every man who served in the I.R.A. at that time would be given every help by his officers. The brigade committee at the time undertook to give all the help possible both by verification and by any other means in their power, and they did that and did it fairly successfully.  I suppose, however, that in Dublin there have been more unsuccessful applicants, possibly because of the very large numbers involved, than in any other county in Ireland, and the amount of dissatisfaction that exists, while I suppose it is large, is not perhaps as large as it is in the country districts where Deputies can be continually harassed by individuals who are obsessed with the idea or impression that they are entitled to be awarded a certificate which would secure them a pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know of any means by which these people can be given any greater opportunity than that with which they have been provided up to the present.  There is no question that a sworn inquiry is necessary or that, if it is necessary, it is going to provide <Col N="1664" /> any different results.  If the sworn inquiry were required to investigate something that the referee has been doing wrong, it might be different, but is there any suggestion that the referee or the members of the board have been doing something wrong?  I do not think that that is the suggestion at all.  The only suggestion, then, is that if a sworn inquiry is set up, a few more applicants for pensions will manage to squeeze through.  That is the position as I see it, and, as far as I am aware, I do not think that a sworn inquiry would help in any single way. If any man believes that he has a case, he may make an appeal to the referee, in which he gives sworn testimony that the evidence which he is now producing is new evidence and evidence which was not available at the first hearing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Among other points raised was one with regard to the abatement of pensions.  I think Deputy Fionán Lynch and other Deputies raised that matter.  On the introduction of amendment to a Bill some <Col N="1668" /> time ago I gave an undertaking to the House that I would bring the matter to the attention of the Government.  I gave the same undertaking to the Seanad.  I have carried out my undertaking.  I have brought it to the attention of the Government and the Government has set up a sub-committee of the Cabinet to examine the matter.  The matter is at present under discussion and will in due course be referred back to the Government for their attention.  It is true, as Deputy MacEoin said to-day, that no piece of legislation has caused more dissatisfaction than the particular Pensions Act we are discussing to-day. That is true, but I suppose the answer to that is that where something in the nature of a reward is held out to people and they fail to secure that reward, it may be narrowly or by a wide measure, there is bound to be dissatisfaction.  It cannot be otherwise. I wish when Deputies are listening to complaints that they would take the rational point of view and ask those who are pressing and harassing them, to do the only thing that it is possible to do, that is, to prepare an appeal, have it sworn before a commissioner for oaths and have it sent to me. In that form, and in that form only, I can deal with it.  I have already told the House that I have had 808 cases of that type already referred back.  I have also mentioned to the House in reply to the request to have the Secretary to the referee the person who should refer back, he is virtually doing that. The secretary to the referee has been operating in that way for quite a considerable time.  If Deputies would take the line of action I have suggested they would save themselves worry, they would save the House a considerable amount of time, and they would save me a tremendous amount of worry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter.  I would not mention it but for the fact that it was referred to by at least two or three Deputies, slightingly, in some cases&mdash; namely, the question of Fianna Fáil, before they came into office, campaigning against pensions.  That is true. They did that, and I am not going to deny it for a moment, but they did it <Col N="1669" /> conscientiously believing that they were right.  While it was not one of the main planks in the election campaign because, as far as I can see, it is one that would react rather against them than for them at that particular period, nevertheless, it was during that campaign that the reference was made and a poster published.  When they came into office it was their intention to operate what they honestly believed in, that is, that they would withdraw from the persons who were holding pensions already, the pensions which in fact they had been awarded. I understand that deputations of the holders of these pensions at that time were received, and the cases, from their point of view, placed before the Government. The Government, having heard that these men had built up, in many cases, very heavy commitments on the strength of the pensions which they were receiving&mdash;in some cases for housing, in others for furniture, the education of their children, etc.&mdash;decided that to proceed in the way in which they had originally intended would be a great injustice.</P>
    <P>I want to assure Deputy Dillon, who applauded Deputy MacEoin's references to that matter, that Fianna Fáil has not a one-track mind in regard to anything the Party takes up.  They could, if they wished, have gone ahead with their policy of withdrawing pensions, but they did not, because they believed, as I have already mentioned, that to have done so would have been a great injustice to certain individuals who had more or less built up their future on these pensions and had committed themselves to many undertakings which it would not have been possible to fulfil if these pensions were withdrawn.  I do not think there is any room for derision in respect of the action which the Government took at that time.  They took the only action that was possible, and that was to allow these men to continue to draw their pensions, and as far as possible to equalise matters by allowing colleagues of their own, who had taken a different side in the later fighting, to draw pensions also if they were entitled to them.  That, as far as I am <Col N="1670" /> concerned, is the position in regard to that particular phase.</P>

      <P>Deputy Anthony referred to 1916 men in want.  May I remind Deputies that they themselves, not so very long ago, passed a Bill, now an Act, which grants to 1916 men who are incapacitated and unable to work, a pension of £78 per year in the case of single men, and £98 in the case of married men, together with an allowance for children?  A fairly large number of men are now benefiting under that Act, and I have been assured by a very large number that it is the most beneficial feature of the treatment that has been accorded to them as a result of pension legislation. It assures them of something like 30/- a week, provided they are unable to work by reason of some incapacity.  I wish to make this further statement, <Col N="1671" /> and I do so only because Deputy Larkin suggested that he made application and that we took no notice of it.  I would regard that as casting a slur on the civil servants who deal with that particular branch.  I had inquiries made, and I find that Deputy Larkin did make application for a form by messenger, and that the messenger was, in fact, provided with a form to bring to him, but there was no written application as far as we can discover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I can have that matter examined also.  Deputy Donnellan and a number of other Deputies suggested that verifying officers were not doing their duty.  I can hardly believe that because verifying officers, in the first instance, were appointed by their own colleagues.  They were so appointed because they were regarded as being the most knowledgeable men, men with the most information about the activities which had taken place in their area.  To suggest that these men deliberately refused to verify claims for some of their colleagues, because of some personal reason, seems to me to place a very low estimate on the integrity of these men, and to make us feel that we have a very low opinion of our own countrymen in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that that happens, and if it does happen it is a very rare occurrence.  The referee himself on numerous occasions&mdash;the late Judge O'Donnell in particular &mdash; in conversation with me, went out of his way specially to praise the activities of verifying officers, and to mention the fact that he thought the reward given to these men in respect of travelling <Col N="1672" /> expenses should be greater, having regard to the amount of work, worry and loss of time in which they were involved by reason of having to come up merely to give evidence on behalf of their colleagues.  I think I have practically covered all points raised by Deputies.  I want to assure them again that if there is anything that can be done within reason in regard to any man who thinks he has a grievance, I shall do everything within the four corners of the Act to help him.  Beyond that I do not think I can go.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister if he would be good enough to investigate the facts in connection with the death of John Hooper, a private in the Citizen Army of 1916?  He lay in Dublin Union for 11 years.  Nobody considered his case, and after death the arrangements for his burial had to be seen to by a number of other people.

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £677,983 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1945, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Offices of the Minister for Lands and of the Irish Land Commission (44 and 45 Vict., c. 49, <Col N="1673" /> sec. 46, and c. 71, sec. 4; 48 and 49 Vict., c. 73, secs. 17, 18 and 20; 54 and 55 Vict., c. 48; 3 Edw. 7, c. 37; 7 Edw. 7, c. 38, and c. 56; 9 Edw. 7, c. 42; Nos. 27 and 42 of 1923; No. 25 of 1925; No. 11 of 1926; No. 19 of 1927; No. 31 of 1929; No. 11 of 1931; Nos. 33 and 38 of 1933; No. 11 of 1934; No. 41 of 1936; and No. 26 of 1939).</P>
    <P>Owing to the restriction of activities which has been imposed upon the Land Commission by emergency conditions, the Estimate for Lands has become virtually stereotyped and few of the sub-heads call for particular comment. The increase of £10,854 under sub-head A for salaries, wages and allowances is due to the increased bonus granted as an emergency measure to the lower paid civil servants.  The salaries and bonuses of the staff of the Land Commission on loan to other Departments are still mainly borne on the Vote.  A note on page 234 of the printed Estimates explains that the Estimate for Lands includes provision for £74,773 in respect of officers on loan, of which only £1,740 is recoverable.</P>
    <P>The sub-head of most public interest is sub-head I&mdash;Improvement of Estates, etc.  This expenditure is bound to reflect the reduced rate of land division and the amount to be provided for the coming year is down by £23,052.  That this Estimate is still as big as it is may be regarded as largely due to the fact that much of the improvement expenditure in a particular year arises out of sanctions made in previous years.  Owing to the increased cost of labour and materials a smaller return is obtainable.  During the past year a sum of £228,461 was expended and the Estimate for the present year corresponds approximately to that figure.</P>
    <P>The sharp increase of £2,250 under sub-head N is due to exceptional provision for repair of an embankment in County Waterford.  The decrease of £4,400 under sub-head P is due to the winding up of the most of the remaining proceedings under the Land Acts of 1903 and 1909.  The small changes occurring under other heads scarcely require explanation, not being out of the normal.  Several of the sub-heads <Col N="1674" /> of the Vote represent nominal amounts provided for contingencies unlikely to arise.  The difficult position of the Land Commission under prevailing conditions appears to be still widely misunderstood. It is very hard to get the public fully to realise that with a greatly depleted staff, with grave difficulties of transport and shortage of materials, fresh proceedings for the acquisition or resumption of land for equipment and division into holdings are virtually precluded.</P>
    <P>The skeleton staff remaining in the acquisition and resales division have been employed in completing the purchase of lands in respect of which commitments had been already undertaken, or in effecting exchange of holdings. It is to their credit that approximately 80,000 acres have been acquired for division during the four years from 1st April, 1940, to 31st March, 1944, despite the growing emergency difficulties.  The obstacles have been even greater in the division of land, as many of the trained inspectors have had to be seconded to the Department of Agriculture for tillage inspection, while those remaining lack proper transport facilities and can cover only a very small distance daily, their operative power being diminished on that account by about 60 per cent.  Building and fencing materials and machinery for pumps and so on are scarce, and their transport is also difficult and slow.  It has been by great efforts only that some 79,000 acres have been divided in the four years since 1st April, 1940.</P>
    <P>The figures for the past year have fallen to some 10,000 acres acquired and some 12,000 acres divided, and there is likely to be a progressive decrease during the continuance of present conditions.  It cannot be otherwise. The policy of group migration, which offers the best hope of relieving congestion where relief is most required has also been affected by present difficulties, and in the past year it has been found possible to transfer, under the group scheme, only nine migrant families to the midlands, all coming from County Kerry.</P>
    <P>The vesting of tenanted land in the tenant-purchasers, and all the varied <Col N="1675" /> work of the purchase division associated therewith, are equally hampered; and rearrangement work has had to be almost completely postponed. Only 169 holdings of tenanted land were revested in the tenants in the past year and only 492 holdings on Congested District Board estates were resold; 522 turbary rights on bogs on these estates were vested in the tenants and 332 parcels of untenanted land allotted under the 1923-39 Acts were vested in the allottees.</P>
    <P>In spite of the difficulties which have to be contended with the Land Commission continue to be deluged with correspondence urging fresh acquisition of land all over the country, and the speeding up of the division of particular estates, with sundry complaints of delay and neglect.  Such correspondence is often useless, and tends to defeat its own object by further clogging the already overloaded machinery of the Land Commission and wasting the time of the staff in futile research and investigation. It would be really helpful if Deputies would refrain from urging fresh proceedings, as some so often do, which they should know to be out of the question, and from complaining of delays which they should realise to be inevitable.  The Land Commission are doing their best to cope with a great volume of accumulated work under trying conditions, and while these conditions continue there is no hope of increased progress.  This may seem a pessimistic conclusion, but it is necessary to face facts.  Not until the Land Commission staff is restored and conditions improve can we take up again with vigour the work of land settlement.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity of reminding the House that a great deal of the work which the Land Commission is committed to perform, and which is still very far from completion, originated over 30 years ago, in regard to the problems that were inherited from the Congested Districts Board, and over 20 years ago, in regard to the purchase and resale of tenanted land coming within the provisions of the Land Act of 1923.  The <Col N="1676" /> main job of the Land Commission in the west is to deal with the congestion problem.  After the assimilation of the Congested Districts Board by the Land Commission in 1923 there was a general demand for concentration on the acquisition and division of untenanted land and pursuance of that policy also took from the amount of attention that could be given to the relief of western congestion.  There are still on the Land Commission's hands some 15,000 holdings of land purchased 30 years ago by the Congested Districts Board for the purpose of improvement or rearrangement and enlargement before resale, and resale should, in the ordinary course, have followed without undue delay.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that there are also about 30,000 holdings in a similar position among the tenanted land holdings on estates lodged in the Land Commission for purchase and resale under the 1923 Act.  The investigation and preparation of all these holdings for resale, after improvement and rearrangement, together with the settlement of turbary rights, etc., entail work similar to, and in continuation of, the activities begun by the Congested Districts Board.  Real progress in this task would result in great economic advantage to the tenants and sub-tenants, and in a corresponding increase in agricultural stability and production to the national advantage. In addition to unsold holdings and parcels, there are also on the hands of the Land Commission some 800 migrants' holdings which are being let under grazing arrangements to between 2,000 and 3,000 temporary allottees.  Some of these have been on the Land Commission's hands for over 20 years.  Under ideal conditions neither the Land Commission nor the Congested Districts Board would have lands on hands for indefinite periods. Their function is and was to settle other people in ownership, not to become owners or landlords themselves.</P>
    <P>I regard it as particularly unfortunate that this work has had so many serious setbacks, and I have been advised that if the present emergency had not arisen in 1939, arrangements <Col N="1677" /> which had then been made by the Land Commission and were about to fructify would have resulted in substantial progress. The frequent breaks in the continuity of the task of dealing with this problem have given rise to greater difficulties and expense in its ultimate solution.  Migrations have been taking place from the vicinity of a great many holdings in congested districts in the West for which rearrangement schemes were in course of preparation but work on these schemes has had to be suspended because of the transfer of inspectors to more pressing emergency duties in other Departments.</P>
    <P>Rearrangement is tedious and difficult even under the most favourable conditions, such as if it were performed soon after the removal of the migrants. The longer the migrants' holdings are permitted to remain on the hands of the Land Commission under letting agreements the more difficult it becomes to deal with the tenants. They, naturally, come to regard the parcels as their own property, and the bargaining value of the vacated lands tends to disappear.  I am satisfied that this work requires considerable experience and the exercise of sound judgment and tact on the part of the inspectors concerned, and I intend that its discharge shall have prior claim on the Land Commission inspectors when they again become available in sufficient numbers to tackle it once more.</P>
    <P>Out of over 105,000 holdings of tenanted land coming under the provisions of the Land Acts 1923-39, about 74,000 remain to be revested in the tenants.  The listing under the Land Act, 1931, of 80,000 holdings for vesting in the Land Commission had to be rushed, and considerable time has been involved since in the amendment of the lists which, owing to the furnishing of incorrect or incomplete information by landlords, contained numerous errors.</P>
    <P>When dealing with property of this kind every possible safeguard has to be taken against error.  In order to implement the policy of past years which was centred on the expedition of land division, the attention of the Purchase Branch was focussed to a great extent on the resumption of tenanted land <Col N="1678" /> holdings with a view to their division and a great deal of effort which might have been available for revesting had to be devoted to matters not directly connected with that process.  Before revesting can be accomplished the holdings have to be surveyed so as to determine their boundaries occupancy, appurtenant rights, etc., and inspections must also be made.  The loss by transfer of trained staff has caused an almost complete stoppage of revesting output since 1940, and the existing staff of the Purchase Branch are barely able to cope with the most pressing problems such as repairs to embankments, turbary, drainage, sub-divisions, release of guarantee deposits, etc., and only a small portion of their time can be devoted to replying to correspondence which continues to arise from, and on behalf of, parties interested in other Land Commission proceedings.</P>
    <P>It has been a serious drag on the Land Commission to have to maintain a large staff in the Purchase Branch for the conduct of a large volume of correspondence and work which would come to an end with completion of revesting, and I have under consideration representations which have been made by the Department with a view to having that work accelerated as soon as possible.  The Land Acts were designed to transfer all the rights and responsibilities of ownership to the tenant occupiers, and the sooner that transfer can be accomplished the better I would be pleased.  In passing, I would like to remind Deputies that the Land Commission's current responsibilities and work in relation to the position of the 74,000 unvested tenant purchasers are considerable.</P>
    <P>My predecessor called the attention of the House last year to the fact that the amount of work falling on the headquarters of the Land Commission after the division of untenanted land is considerably greater (by two to one, I am told) than that involved before or in the course of the division.  That fact is again mentioned to show that the decks are by no means clear when lands are acquired and divided in parcels among allottees sanctioned by the commissioners. Indeed, the most tedious and <Col N="1679" /> most troublesome work arises when the allottees have been put into occupation&mdash;questions affecting boundaries, fences, rights-of-way, water supply, improvements, and general requests and complaints of a varied character. There are about 45,000 parcels of untenanted land allotted by the Land Commission awaiting revesting in the allottees.  Many of these were allotted between ten and 20 years ago.  Each additional year that passes renders the work of revesting more costly and difficult, while the addition of every parcel or holding to the unvested category entails additional responsibility and labour for the Land Commission in its capacity of landlord.</P>
    <P>The general experience of the Land Commission has emphasised the conviction that the division of untenanted land is a process that has to be performed with meticulous care, especially in regard to the selection and approval of allottees.  Such examination as has been possible up to the present of the use to which allotted parcels have been put has disclosed disappointing results in a great many instances.  The Land Commission propose, when staff becomes available for the purpose, to exercise their powers of recovery of allotments when the conditions under which they were given are not being strictly observed.  In that connection I regret that my Department is not now in a position to give greater attention to this important matter.</P>
    <P>The one bright spot in the present situation is the continued improvement in the collection of land purchase annuities, which seems to indicate an increase in the prosperity of farmers generally.  The arrears for all gales since the enactment of the Land Act of 1933 represented at 31st January last only 2.7 per cent. of the total annuities collectable.  It is something of an achievement to have collected over 97 per cent. of the outstanding payments and such a result definitely enhances the financial credit of our country.</P>
    <P>A word may also be said about turbary lettings from bogs in the hands of the Land Commission.  In the past year approximately 150,000 tons of turf <Col N="1680" /> were cut under such lettings and a sum of £44,600 was expended on turbary development by the Land Commission. Every effort is being made to effect this year the maximum increase in production.  To this end special attention is being paid to the construction of roads and drains, where necessary, to make available further areas of bogs for turf cutting and tenants are being encouraged to cut turf on their allotments for sale in addition to their own requirements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, of course, that there is bound to be a certain amount of unreality about the discussion on this Estimate, because of the fact that the main task of the Land Commission, namely, the acquisition and distribution of land, has practically ceased owing to the transfer of such a big proportion of the staff to other Departments.  I am sorry that the Minister did not tell us the amount of money provided for salaries in this Estimate which is really payable to members of a staff transferred to other Departments of the Government.  I assume that these salaries have been shown in the Estimates for the last four years, and I think that after four years it is time the salaries of the men of the former Land Commission staff should be shown in the Estimates for the appropriate Department.</P>
      <P>After all, it seems misleading to the members of this House to see £354,896 in the Land Commission Estimate for salaries, wages and allowances, whereas it appears that less than half that amount is payable to the actual Land Commission staff at the moment. The balance is payable to former members of the staff who are now on other Government work, and it appears to me to be false accountancy that the salaries should not be shown in the Estimate for the Department to which they are now attached, so as to give the members of the Dáil an opportunity of knowing exactly what amount is being spent at the present moment by these different Departments of Government on salaries, wages and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister can do anything about it, but if this war continues for another year, or two or three, I assume that according to <Col N="1681" /> the present arrangement, members of the Land Commission staff who are now attached to other Departments will still continue to be shown in the Land Commission Estimate.  It is unfair to the Land Commission and to the members of this House that we do not know exactly what the total amount of money is actually being spent on the staff of the Departments to which they were transferred.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that there was no justification whatever for stopping the division of land.  I know perfectly well that an Order was made by the Government some years ago that land division was to stop for the duration of the emergency, but I can only assume that the Government, when they made that Order, did not contemplate that the war would last so long as it has lasted.  If they had thought that the war would last six or eight years, they would never have made such an Order.  It is unfair to congests and small farmers who are looking for additions of land that such an Order should have been made.  In view of the tillage regulations, an addition of land would be a wonderful boon to many of these small farmers. They are obliged to till their holdings up to the hilt under extremely difficult conditions, lacking, as they do, artificial manures, with the result that their little farms will be so exhausted at the end of the war that it will take many years to restore them to their original state of fertility.  If additions of land were given to these people during the war years, it would make a wonderful difference to them.  The Minister should insist that the members of his inspectorial staff now engaged on tillage operations be returned to his Department for the purpose of resuming their proper duty&mdash;the inspection and division of land purchased by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>There should now be a sufficient number of well-trained juniors in the Department of Agriculture to undertake the duties which these men have been discharging.  If they have not a sufficient number of qualified juniors in the Department of Agriculture, they should be able to get personnel from the staffs of the various agricultural <Col N="1682" /> colleges and institutions.  Every farmer realises that while the war lasts he has to till a certain area of his land.  In view of the many prosecutions which have been instituted and in view of the propaganda conducted by members of the Government over the radio and in public speeches in the country, every farmer realises his obligations and I do not think it is necessary to have so many inspectors operating exclusively on tillage work. In the interests of the small farmers, particularly the congests, who are looking for additions to their holdings, the Minister should secure that his inspectors return and resume the duties they should properly be discharging even during the war years.</P>
    <P>While the Land Commission has ceased to purchase and distribute untenanted land, there has been wholesale speculation in land in several districts. In some areas, land is fetching fabulous prices.  Men who never thought of speculating in land before are buying land at extremely high prices at present, with the result that farmers who might have had an opportunity of buying some of this land are debarred from doing so because of the high prices.  Traders and merchants are entering the market for land at present.  Many of them are doing so because of the huge profits they are earning in their business and because they want to avoid the payment of income-tax.  I realise that, under existing legislation, the Minister cannot stop that.  Some of these people may retain the land simply as a speculation during the war but others of them will work the land for the purpose of recovering the money paid for it.  As a result of intensive working during the period of occupation, the land will be so exhausted by the end of the war that it will be of very little use to the Land Commission or to the unfortunate allottees who will, eventually, get it.  That type of speculation may continue for the duration of the war.  I suggest that the Minister should examine this matter to see if it is possible to devise ways and means of limiting the scope of these speculative operations and exercising some type of control over them.  Even some tenants who had land vested in them <Col N="1683" /> recently by the Land Commission&mdash; land which was purchased at the taxpayers' expense and presented to them free&mdash;sold their holdings at the high speculative prices prevailing.  We may assume that many more of them who have had parcels of land vested in them during recent years will enter the market while these high prices are available.  It is regrettable to think that the unfortunate taxpayer has had to meet the cost of buying land for people who avail of the first opportunity to dispose of it at a high price.</P>
    <P>As regards the size of holdings given to allottees, I think that the limit is about 25 statute acres.  I wonder if the Minister is satisfied that that represents an economic holding and that it is possible for a farmer on a holding of that size to make a decent living and support a wife and family.  I suggest that the Minister should examine that question in view of the change brought about by the war and the conditions likely to prevail when the war is over.  I understand that the 24-acre standard applies to every part of the country.</P>
    <P>The small farmer in the West who has been accustomed to live on a small holding, might be able to eke out an existence on a holding of that size, but the man in Meath, Wicklow, or Wexford would not dream of living on so small a holding.  Agriculture is becoming more mechanised, and by the time the war is over it will be more mechanised than it is to-day.  In view of that change, I suggest that the Minister and the Land Commission should consider giving to allottees larger holdings than they have been in the habit of giving in the past.</P>
    <P>I remember reading a suggestion in a newspaper of the advisability of the Minister making an examination into the results achieved by land purchase; what use people who got land were making of it; how many had succeeded in making good, and if it would not be necessary to do something more for them than to hand over substantial parcels of land.  During the period that I was in the Land Commission I felt that its functions should not merely stop with the division of land.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1684" /> Take the case of a landless man who got possession of a farm of 20 or 25 acres, who needed further help from some other Department, and who, in some cases, might need some capital in order to make the best use of land.  I had the idea at one time of linking up such attempts with another Government Department, from which a man could get expert assistance to enable him to use land to the best advantage. I often wondered if it would not be advisable to devise some form of credit to give further assistance to men of that type.  Every Deputy is aware that when land is given to a landless man, or when a small farmer gets an addition to his holding, he may have to let that land in order to realise a sufficient amount of money to stock it.  As the letting may be for an indefinite period, such an individual may never be really able to use the land in the way that the Land Commission intended.  I suggest to the Minister, now that his mind is not over-occupied with the problems that his predecessor had to deal with, that he might devote some serious thought to the question of providing additional assistance from the Department of Agriculture, or even from the Agricultural Credit Corporation, for people who were put into possession of new farms or given an addition to existing holdings, so that they might be able to make the best use of them.  It always appeared to me to be waste of public money to put people in possession of land if they could not utilise it to advantage.  There has always been a blank in our land legislation in that respect.  The Minister is extremely energetic, and he understands conditions in the country, and for that reason I suggest that that is a problem for his serious consideration.</P>
    <P>With regard to migration, I understood from the Minister's statement that it has practically ceased.  I was outside the Dáil for a number of years, but my recollection is that group or colony migration was first undertaken in 1935, for the dual object of relieving congestion in the Gaeltacht areas, and preserving the Irish language.  I always felt very sceptical about the <Col N="1685" /> success of the second object.  I would be curious to know from the Minister if he is satisfied that these migration schemes have been a success.  I have no definite information on the subject. I heard many stories about the manner in which some migrants manage their holdings.  I know perfectly well that they were assisted in every possible way by the Government, but I always felt that it was a mistake to transfer people from their original environment to some of the best land in eastern counties like Meath and Kildare.</P>
    <P>I believe that it would be far more economical, from the point of view of the Land Commission and the State, to migrate big farmers and to give their land to smaller people who would then have a better opportunity of succeeding in life.  The Government embarked on very costly schemes, involving a three-fold migration, and after eight years' experience I should like to know if the Minister is satisfied that the experiment was worth while and that the money spent was really justified. I do not know what truth there is in the report that some migrants have returned to their original homes, and abandoned the farms they got to other people.  There is an opportunity during the war, on account of the high prices prevailing, for these men to do better than they did previously, but I should like to have the Minister's views as to the success or failure of these migration schemes.  I am perfectly satisfied that, from the standpoint of preserving and extending the use of the Irish language, these schemes have not been a success.  It was always considered to be a fatal mistake to try to extend the language by taking people away from the real home of the language, and putting them into a purely English and foreign environment, where it was inevitable that they would succumb to such an environment.  I understand that they have gradually succumbed to such influences.</P>
    <P>As far as I can recollect the Minister did not mention anything in his statement about reclamation, but at one period the Land Commission was very enthusiastic about such schemes.  They undertook a big reclamation scheme in County Galway, another along the Donegal seaboard, and another in <Col N="1686" /> County Mayo.  I wonder if these schemes are still in operation and, if so, what measure of success they achieved.  It appears to me that this is an opportune time to extend schemes of reclamation of as much of the waste land in these areas as it is possible for the Land Commission to deal with.  Turbary is a subject that is in the minds of the majority of the people at the present time.  It is a subject, of course, that is a very frequent cause of dispute and now on account of the very high prices prevailing for turf these disputes are more numerous than they used to be pre-war. There are many cases where the Land Commission took over bogs many years ago and put them in charge of trustees.  While, of course, the trustees probably exercise a certain authority over the people using these bogs during later years the people getting turf in these bogs have refused in many cases to recognise the authority of these trustees and they went out and deliberately took possession of banks of turf without any authority whatsoever. So long as the war continues and the high prices prevail for turf you can rest assured that you will have that type of vandalism, as I suppose I must call it, going on in these bogs administered by trustees.  I do suggest to the Minister that with a view to ending the disputes and exercising efficient and effective control over these bogs and assuring that the best use will be made of the land, the Land Commission should take over possession completely and divide up the bogs in proper proportion among the tenants.  I am interested in one particular case and I have been writing to the Land Commission about a bog that is almost completely waterlogged although it is supplying turf for 25 or 30 families.  I will supply the Minister later with the details of the particular bog in which I am interested.</P>
    <P>Erosion is going on all along the seaboard.  I do not know if the Minister has given any thought to the matter, but personally I cannot see how it is possible to find a remedy because erosion is going on not alone in this country but in most European countries and even in <Col N="1687" /> some of the central parts of the United States.  In some parts of the western seaboard of this country it has become a very serious problem.  I think the Minister has had numerous applications for abatement of Land Commission annuities because of the erosion which has been going on over long years.  I do not know what the attitude of the commission would be but I do suggest that in all fairness to the tenants the Minister should consider their claims sympathetically and give them some abatement, because I think that in strict equity and justice they are entitled to some abatement. I cannot see myself there is any solution for this problem of erosion unless we build a huge concrete wall all round the coast of Ireland, and I suppose that is an utter and absolute impossibility.  However, erosion is getting much more serious in some parts of Ireland during recent years. I have one particular area in mind along a stretch of seaboard, and I saw it myself a few months ago and I was amazed after visiting it to discover that so much land had disappeared in two or three years.  It is a serious problem, particularly for farmers who live along certain stretches of the western seaboard.  I am glad to learn from the Minister that annuities are being paid up so promptly.  It is an indication, I assume, that the farmers are in the happy position of being able to meet these payments promptly.  I hope that happy position will continue. The Minister, I think, also mentioned that there is still a balance of 1903 and 1909 Land Act cases to be dealt with, presumably to be vested. I was under the impression before I left the Land Commission that all these cases had been dealt with.  Presumably, I was under a misapprehension. One last point with regard to the old Congested Districts Board holdings.  I have written about one case.  I am not going to mention it now, but generally in certain western counties I have received numerous complaints about the rearrangement of holdings.  I realise that the delay is due to the fact that the Land Commission is trying to acquire adjoining <Col N="1688" /> land for the purpose of making a scheme.  I am afraid in some cases it is very hard to justify the delay because in one particular case the tenants were assured in 1926 that immediate steps would be taken to acquire an additional portion of land in order to carry out the rearrangement of their holdings.  So far the land has not been acquired and these unfortunate tenants are in the same position now as they were in 1926 and the years prior to that.  I do suggest to the Minister now that he has breathing space he should get rid of these rearrangement schemes and Congested Districts Board schemes and that these tenants who are waiting so long to have their grievances redressed should receive special and sympathetic consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are, of course, in the peculiar position, in discussing this Vote and in discussing the administration of the Department, that its main and primary function is suspended, non-existent, to a very large extent. That, of course, reduces the compass of this debate to very narrow limits, because the main subject for discussion on this Vote would be a subject we cannot discuss now in view of the fact that that function has ceased.  I want to add my voice to what has been said by Deputy Roddy.  I think the policy of the Land Commission in this particular matter, or the policy of the Government which has become the policy of the Land Commission, to cease all activity of this kind in the matter of land division, can hardly be defended.  I think there is a good case for this in view of the drive for compulsory tillage and better and more general use of the land throughout the country.  I know no better way by which that drive could be helped than by proceeding with the work of dividing the land.  I understood the Minister to say that the question of settling the people on the land involved the building of houses and other things and that that was impossible of attainment at the present time.  I do not think that that would entirely justify what has happened.  There are some rather peculiar cases that serve to illustrate the point I have in mind.  In <Col N="1689" /> portion of my constituency of West Cork that was once part of the constituency in North Cork and was represented by the Minister, a case was brought to my notice some time ago where a man held two holdings of average size for the county.  He made no effort to carry out any tillage for a period of nine years and had consistently refused the approaches made to him by his neighbours for the use of the land on conacre or for any facilities for planting potatoes or other crops of a food-producing nature.  In conjunction with the farm he had a turf bank and he refused to make that available.  I recognise that this is not an average type of person and that he is an exception, and that the person concerned was probably not representative of the average farmer in the county.  In fact, I know positively that he was not.  But up to this year no steps were taken.  I presume that this man is now being dealt with in another way by the Department that concerns itself with compulsory tillage, but I could imagine very much better results in that particular district of which I have some personal knowledge if the Land Commission was put in a position to exercise its ordinary function and make sure that the local people who were willing to use the land for a considerable time would be given an opportunity of doing so.  I want to be very brief and only to refer to a couple of more points&mdash;delay in the vesting of holdings.  I want to discuss this matter from the angle of a number of people who are concerned in sub-tenancies. The sub-tenancies are sub-tenancies of very small holdings.  I have in mind some people who live in labourers' cottages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They have sub-tenancies of lands that are close to their cottages.  The vesting proceedings that would enable them to become the owners of these lands have been delayed for a number of years.  That puts those people in a big difficulty.  Presumably, they are getting the benefits of the reduction in rents to which sub-tenants are entitled, the reductions, I take it, being in proportion to the reductions which the people, to whom they pay rents, receive.  One, if not the only, advantage, which the present Cottage Purchase <Col N="1690" /> Act gives to the tenants of labourers' cottages is this: that tenants who also possess small holdings are given facilities by which the small holding and the cottage tenancy may be amalgamated.  A number of those people, so far as I know, cannot avail of the terms of the cottage purchase scheme.  The number is not very great, but I think it is important to have it mentioned here.  The reason why they cannot do so is because the vesting proceedings in regard to the holding on which they are sub-tenants are being held up.  I would ask the Minister to look into cases of that kind, and see whether, without any serious departure in the policy of the Land Commission or without any fear of certain awkward precedents, cases of that kind might not be picked out and given attention.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister the number of people actually employed at the moment on work of one kind or another by the Land Commission, such as gangers and labourers, and what their rate of wages is.  I have an idea that the rate of wages paid by the Land Commission in the past was not entirely satisfactory, although I have a recollection that the hours of labour were good, comparing favourably with those operating on public works generally.  I am not making any positive complaint except to say that I have a recollection that things were not exactly satisfactory in that respect in the past.</P>
    <P>I want to say from my own personal experience that, in a limited way, what the Minister has said about the payment of arrears of Land Commission annuities is so.  I had the rather pleasant experience in the last year or two of seeing a number of people who had been in difficulties in that respect for a number of years, steadily overcome those difficulties.  I want to express my thanks to the Land Commission for the facilities they have given to people of that kind in the past, facilities which enabled them to keep their homes and to be able to get an early release from all their financial difficulties.  I have had 21 years' experience in approaching officials of the Land Commission in regard to the collection <Col N="1691" /> of annuities.  I have always received from them the fullest consideration that I could possibly expect. I found that the people for whom a reasonably good case could be made always got very fair consideration. There are many people in the possession of their holdings to-day who have been able to overcome all their difficulties, judging by the comfortable circumstances in which they are at present, people who, possibly, could not have retained their holdings if it were not for the considerate policy adopted by the Land Commission towards them.  That, I think, is something that ought to go on record and I gladly say that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MatthewOReilly" hpid="Mr. M. O'Reilly Mr. M. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to assure Deputy Roddy that, so far as the migratory schemes in the County Meath are concerned, that very few, if any, of the migrants have left the county and gone back to the county from which they came originally.  The scheme seems to be a success and the people concerned seem to be able to work their holdings reasonably well. They have some difficulties, of course. They consider that the holdings are too small.  That is a matter that it will not be easy to get over now.  I think I am correct in stating that the Minister said that there were something like 74,000 holdings that were not vested.  I did not think that the number was so big.  I certainly do know that there are a large number of tenants who hold their land as mere tenants from the Land Commission.  I always feel that when tenants are not vested, notwithstanding what the Land Commission may say, they do not feel that they have any sort of security in their holdings.  Once a normal tenant is in that position he is not inclined to risk very much capital in his holding or, in fact, to put very much of his labour into it.  I think I am correct in stating that was the feeling all over Europe: in Germany, Holland, Belgium and other countries in which feudalism was destroyed at an earlier date than it was destroyed here.  I should say that one of the causes of the success of farmers in those countries was the security they had in their holdings.  It <Col N="1692" /> is a human trait.  The objections that I hear from the Land Commission in regard to vesting are small objections. They are concerned with machinery, the difficulty of transport at the present time, and that inspectors have other duties, and so on.  Somehow or another, I feel that the tenants are under the impression that the land is simply State-owned.  Such land may, of course, have its advantages, but in a country like this State-owned land is not a thing that will satisfy the aspirations of our farmers.  I would be glad if the Minister, when replying, would go into that matter in some detail.</P>
      <P>We have a good deal of land still in the country that has not been vested. Some land, I think, under the 1903 Land Purchase Act, is not yet vested.  The position is that when the nominal owners of this land, because that really is all they are, come to make wills before they die, all sorts of complications are raised as far as the Land Commission is concerned.  I believe myself that a bigger effort should be made to vest that land, or at least some satisfactory reason should be given as to why it is not being vested. The Land Commission, of course, has made extraordinary progress.  None of us will deny that.  Some time ago I happened to be reading a book that gave some particulars about land in the County Meath up to the year 1870. The book revealed that in that year there was one landlord in the county who owned 60,000 acres.  There were many others with huge holdings. Practically all of them have now disappeared. At the present time, when land is becoming extremely valuable and people are looking to it as the means of producing food, the division of it is being stopped.  We are not able to go on with land division any more than we are able to vest land. I think we should try to do one thing, and that is to vest the lands that have been recently divided.  We do not expect, of course, that retained holdings would be vested.  It may be the policy of the Land Commission to retain these holdings for future division, but certainly, as regards the tenants for whom I have been speaking, the vesting of their lands should be proceeded with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1693" /> Deputy Roddy raised the question of credit.  We have all sorts of patchwork credit systems in this country.  I do not think there is any country in the world that has as many credit societies as we have.  We have banks, post offices, the Land Commission and the Agricultural Credit Corporation lending money, but every day I get a letter complaining that there is no credit.  That should be rectified, which could be done by allowing the tenant to sell his holding or to borrow money from the ordinary banks, for seeds, etc.  There is the same objection to this co-operative banking system amongst farmers as there is against borrowing: one farmer does not want to state his position to another.  When he seeks a loan from the county council, he has to get several other farmers to &ldquo;back the bill&rdquo;, and has to expose his position.  That is objectionable.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding all the credit bodies, I do not believe we have any legitimate credit.  If these tenants were vested, there is no doubt they would pay their annuities and be able to pay them. The deficit in annuity payments is only 2 per cent, which shows that the tenants are people who meet their commitments.  I understand that the banks are prepared to lend small sums to farmers whose lands are vested; but if they are not vested they will not do so.  That being so, we should give the banking system a chance of proving its worth, by giving the tenants a chance to borrow money with confidence.  No one would deny that there is a great dearth of money amongst farmers, in spite of what is said about there being £25,000,000 belonging to farmers in the banks here.  That is a nominal amount, and there is no segregation, so we do not know who owns that money.</P>
    <P>As far as I can see, there is a dearth of working capital.  The banks are not averse to advancing money, provided the farmers can give legitimate security.  The new farmers, especially the man who has started without much machinery and with very little capital, are in the greatest difficulty and need that money most. I recommended one farmer to the Agricultural Credit Corporation, but <Col N="1694" /> that body being fairly well tied up in a steel jacket, will lend only to the fellow who can get money from the bank more easily and with less publicity. We should try to vest as many tenants as possible and, even if one tenant sells land to another, there should not be any great objection.  It may mean getting a better tenant; or a tenant may sell because of ill-health or because a particular district does not suit him; and, therefore, by vesting and allowing free sale, people would eventually find themselves in more natural surroundings.  I do not see any great danger in doing that.  I plead ignorance to the exact reason for its not being done, and hope the Minister will tell the House the exact reason.  The farming community wish to have the land completely within their own power and possession.  That would help progress and cause a greater flow of capital to the land. There is great necessity to do that for this most important of our industries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>In the stress and strain of war and when blockades have operated against essential food supplies for most countries, the dominant consideration has been the expansion of food production in each individual country.  In doing that, the respective Governments have paid far more attention than we have to the equipment and the education of agriculturists.  In Great Britain, for instance, farmers have been graded into three classes: A, B and C, and the man who does not reach grade C is dispossessed. Under the peculiar system of tenure there, it is quite easy to dispossess a man.  That system is definitely making for far more efficiency.</P>
      <P>If we believe it is absolutely essential to export substantial surpluses in the post-war period, we must realise that we will have to face that efficiency then.  We will have to compete against the British farmer in his own market and operate under certain handicaps and difficulties which he has not to experience.  Even at the present time, the British farmers appreciate that the competition from outside sources in the post-war period will be something they must seriously consider now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1695" /> Much has been written on this whole matter.  Sir Daniel Hall, late Director of Rothamsted, has written a very interesting book on <i>Reconstruction and the Land.</i>  When Great Britain, Denmark and other countries have concerned themselves with this problem, surely it is time for us to do so, in order to develop a better type of agriculture and improve the disposition of land generally, in regard to how it is held, the type of people who hold it and the qualifications of those who own and use it.  We have not attempted to develop a proper land policy <i>per se.</i></P>
    <P>I suggest that the activities of the Minister's Department are merely nominal and I am not inclined to agree that circumstances have forced that situation.  I question the wisdom of dropping land division and the settlement of the problems arising out of congestion.  New vested interests will have been created in the interregnum between the dropping of activity and its restarting, whenever that is likely to take place.  There must be respect for those vested interests and that will give rise to further problems.</P>
    <P>Deputy Roddy referred to the amount of speculation in land.  It is extraordinary that we have not yet taken control of that.  Such speculation is undesirable from the national point of view, if we believe implicitly in all the things we say and profess regarding the value of our agriculture. We seem to have ignored that speculation and the type of people who are now using the land.  Big business people with substantial capital, feeling that sterling was very shaky, went down the country a couple of years ago from the City of Dublin and bought farms, in order to secure something of material value.  Some individuals bought a number of farms but those individuals had no roots and no long-term interest in the land. Farmers who have reared their families on the land and who still have two or three sons remaining, whose love for the land is real and who obviously respect the fertility of the soil, are ideally suited to use the land in the national interest.  Such men, however, possibly with an eye to enabling the <Col N="1696" /> eldest son to get married and settle down on the farm, now find themselves in competition against big business magnates from the city, who are interested merely from a speculative point of view in securing themselves against the threatened fall of sterling and who are prepared to pay any money in order to secure something of material value.  The farmer there was beaten from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo;; he could not compete because he had not the capital resources like the other fellow and he was knocked out.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons why the Scottish farmer is such a success is that the whole system of tenure in Scotland makes for successful agriculture.  It is a type of system which weeds out the inept farmer and encourages the best. Operating a system like that over a long period has secured for Scotland some of the finest farmers.  I am not advocating that system, because it is a landlord system.  Great Britain has the same.  At the same time, that type of system has this advantage, there is no capital involved in the first instance. Very often a man taking over a holding of land in this country is mulcted for a big capital outlay and that is a millstone around his neck for the rest of his life.  That is one of the disadvantages, but there are advantages, too.  In Scotland if a man shows that he is an active, efficient farmer, at the end of seven years his lease is renewed, and he gets probably double the amount of land that he got in the first instance.  If he does not show that he is a successful farmer, he simply retains the original holding.  If he shows that he is a bad farmer, he probably will not secure a renewal of his lease.</P>
    <P>Just as in our own case, there is a system of peasant proprietorship on the Continent.  Take Denmark, for instance. Denmark has certainly taken precautions to ensure that no one is in possession of land unless he is fully equipped educationally, technically, and in every other way, and unless he is a man who has a real taste for working on the land.  In that way Denmark has almost led the world in her agriculture.  She advanced from a very low state after the Napoleonic wars to her present high position.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1697" /> When Bishop Grunfeld started the folk high school in Denmark he inculcated in the people a love for the land and a high standard of honour so far as liabilities are concerned.  He encouraged a love for their country among the people and corrected whatever deficiencies there were as a result of their primary education.  The young people do not attend the folk high school until they are 18 years.  There is a gap between the period when they leave the primary schools and enter the folk high schools.  There they get a practical outlook on life.  They attend a sort of university.  There is no examination; there is free entry and nothing is compulsory.  Compare that type of education with ours.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Reilly referred to the provision of credit and the use of land as collateral security.  There is no collateral security required in Denmark, because a man's word is his bond and the honour of the Danish farmer is so high that he is given whatever credit he needs.  The amount of credit given in Denmark, we were informed recently through a very able paper read by Professor Beddy, is something like £25 an acre.  Indebtedness is far higher there than here, and yet there is no difficulty in collecting debts, because a man's honour is so high that his anxiety all the time is to be in a position to meet his liabilities.</P>
    <P>This land question ought to be examined by some sort of commission. It may be asked whether it is wise to allow that sort of thing.  I know it is revolutionary to talk like that, but we all realise that around every town in rural Ireland there are individuals, big businessmen who are inclined to grab the best farms.  Nationally it is not wise to permit that because the utilisation of land is undergoing a complete change.  The war has changed the whole outlook in this connection. When a man has a good way of living otherwise, he should not be permitted to enter into the occupation of large tracts of land.  This land question will have to be very carefully examined.</P>
    <P>Another point arises as to whether 20 acres could be regarded as an economic unit.  We have been pursuing that matter for years.  Now that <Col N="1698" /> there is a breathing space, a pause in our efforts so far as the land problem is concerned, I think it would be advisable to have the matter examined in a constructive way.  We should set up a commission which would take suitable evidence and see if we are pursuing a wise policy in regard to land utilisation.  As regards the 20-acre unit, the people in Western Ireland have a different outlook from those who live in the eastern counties.  Some impartial body should determine who is right and who is wrong.</P>
    <P>In this national Assembly we ought to have a common land policy.  There ought not to be political issues involved. There is an inclination among economists and agricultural experts towards a bigger unit, a feeling that in the post-war years there will be little room for the smaller farmers, that competition will be keen and that modern equipment will be essential. Apart from the tremendous material destruction attending the war, there is always arising out of wars an accumulation of new ideas, new means of production, new technique.  This war has had precisely that effect in other countries.  I do not know if it has affected us to the same extent.  That is what I am worried about and what is agitating my mind is that if we do not wake up now we may not be able to meet the rivalry of outside countries in the post-war period.  Our duty now is to prepare and equip our people for the competition after the war.</P>
    <P>I am one of those who believe that in the post-war world, with the development of machinery, with power on the farm, the bigger unit that will be more economic from the power point of view will be the better unit from the national point of view.  But in our circumstances, taking into consideration the amount of land available and the number of families living on small holdings, something will have to be done towards helping the people in a far more definite way.  I have suggested that we ought to help the small farmers by getting them to co-operate to a far greater extent.  There has been a certain amount of voluntary co-operation where land settlement has taken place <Col N="1699" /> under migratory schemes.  But, as that is voluntary, very often it breaks down because there is no proper control. Where a number of individuals enter into an arrangement to share machinery it will inevitably raise trouble as to who will get priority and all that sort of thing.  If we had a system in operation set up by the State, under which a committee would be elected which would control the operation and maintenance of machinery, I think that difficulty would be got over.</P>
    <P>I suggested to the Minister's predecessor on more than one occasion that, for experimental purposes, he should avail of the estate unit, once it is divided.  If you divide an estate of 400 or 500 acres and settle a number of families there you should try co-operation on the unit as a whole in the provision of modern machinery, tractor equipment, etc., and set up an elected control committee.  I suggest that the tenants should get an opportunity every year or every two or three years to elect their committee of control and that that committee of control should direct the operations and the maintenance of the machinery.  In that way the individuals would get the service of the machinery at exactly cost price, no more and no less.  Credit facilities, of course, would have to be provided for the purchase of the machinery.  I suggest to the Minister, if he is interested in this problem of making a real success of the division and resettlement of land, that where people are settled on the land in small units, which some of us are inclined to question the economy of, the only way he can hope to make it an economic matter is by an intensive system of co-operation.  I believe that is possible, but I also believe that it is impossible to do it on a voluntary basis.</P>
    <P>Again, I might say on this whole matter of the disposal and the occupation of land and the type of people who ought to occupy it, that obviously it is people who have roots in the soil who will make a success of the land.  I think it is unfortunate that there is no association between the Department of Lands and the Department of Agriculture in this matter.  As a matter of <Col N="1700" /> fact, I think the Department of Agriculture should control this matter absolutely, because there is a very definite relation between them and this whole problem of stepping up fertility and production generally and the type of people who use the land.  The Land Commission have shown that they have no interest in the preservation of fertility, because they have grossly abused a great deal of land which has been on their hands for some years. That land has been set for cereal crops year after year after year.  If you want to destroy the fertility of land, that is the one way in which you can destroy it.  The Land Commission are setting a shocking example to the community generally by pursuing a system that is not a system of husbandry at all.  It is a system of erosion, of undermining the surface of the land without regard to the future.</P>
    <P>There are other anomalies in the whole of the Land Acts code, not only on the legal side but on the financial side as well.  So far as redemption and the cost of redemption is concerned, it seems to me an extraordinary anomaly that where land is acquired by a public authority, or where a tenant is desirous of redeeming whatever amount of the loan is outstanding, that is calculated on the price of bonds which are purely fictitious, because these bonds have been discharged under the 1938 agreement.  There is an appreciation in the cost of redemption, probably from the 17 to 20 years' purchase, because there is a <i>pro rata</i> increase in the value of the bonds at present.  As the bonds have already been discharged, it beats me why it should be on that basis.  There is a sum to be voted to make good the land bond fund.  I suppose it is a matter of accountancy and book-keeping.  I should like the Minister to give the House some information on that matter, because I thought that these bonds had already disappeared.</P>

      <P>There are two matters I want to raise on this Estimate.  One is the policy of the Land Commission in respect to migrating people from northern, western and southern areas to eastern areas.  I have some experience of the Land Commission's <Col N="1701" /> policy of migration so far as Kildare is concerned.  Whatever may be the good intentions of the Land Commission from the standpoint of endeavouring to migrate people from areas where there are uneconomic holdings and very little soil, the operation of this scheme so far as persons in Kildare are concerned works out very inequitably.  The Land Commission have migrated persons from the west and south to lands in Kildare which were acquired by the Land Commission for division.  The local people, who live in the vicinity of these estates, have long been looking forward to the acquisition and division of the lands as their hope of securing land for their own maintenance and the maintenance of their families only to find that, when the Land Commission acquired these estates, it has in many instances handed over the lands to migrants from other areas.  I can sympathise with the Land Commission's general policy of endeavouring to migrate people, but I do not think that that policy ought to be pushed to the extent of inflicting hardship on people living convenient to the divided estates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have an example of one case at present in Kildare.  This particular estate is probably the only one for a couple of miles around that is likely to be divided.  The local people expected that they would be considered for holdings on the estate.  The Land Commission has decided to put migrants on the estate and the local people, therefore, who have been looking forward to getting holdings on the estate find that their needs will not be satisfied.  Even if any further land is divided in the area, they live so far away from the land which may be divided in future that there is little likelihood of their being considered in connection with the division of such land.  One can understand transferring migrants from western and southern areas to eastern areas if there is land available in eastern areas.  But it seems to me to be a very serious hardship on local people, who have worked on estates, who have been reared in the vicinity of estates, who have been expecting that the division of the estates would provide them with <Col N="1702" /> the land they were anxious to obtain, that they should see the estates divided up amongst people who have no association with the place, who have no roots in the place, and, as a result, a number of local people forced to leave the place because of their inability to secure land which is the best anchorage one can have in a particular place.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that in this matter the local people are entitled to consideration, to fair and sympathetic consideration, and that he is not in any way solving the problem of migration by transferring these people from western and southern areas into eastern areas where the effect of their transfer is to cause considerable local agitation in those areas.  If there should be land available in eastern areas which is not required for local persons, one could quite understand and sympathise with the idea of migrating people to such land.  But I, for one, strongly protest against local people's claims being passed over when the effect of passing over their claims is that they are not likely ever to secure land, unless they are in a position to buy it in the open market, which is an impossible proposition so far as the generality of agricultural workers are concerned.  I want again to plead that the claims of local people should receive sympathetic considera tion, and that the Land Commission ought to recognise the natural and understandable desire of locals to be considered for holdings on estates which are being divided in the areas in which they live.</P>
    <P>The second matter with which I want to deal is the policy of the Land Commission in respect of lands which it already holds.  I have been endeavouring to get the Land Commission to divide lands which it has on hands for a long time, but for some reason or other the Land Commission seems to be unwilling to divide lands.  I know that in some areas the Land Commission has been letting lands year after year for the growing of cereals, and, as a matter of fact, some of these lands have been quarried because of the manner in which the Land Commission have been letting them for a number <Col N="1703" /> of years.  I know of no insuperable difficulty in dividing lands which the Land Commission has on hands.  The Minister may say that he has no staff, that he has relayed his staff on to the Department of Agriculture; but I do not think the problem requires such a large staff, or that the difficulty is wholly a staff difficulty.  For some reason the Land Commission apparently prefers to hold the lands it has.  Very little action of a tangible kind is being taken to divide the lands which they have, and I should like the Minister to say what is the policy of the Land Commission in respect of lands which it holds.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that there should be no difficulty in dividing these lands. There certainly should be no difficulty in dividing the lands they have on hands for years.  There is a substantial area of land in County Kildare in the hands of the Land Commission.  There is a keen local demand for these lands, but instead of the local people getting the lettings of these lands pretty well-to-do people can manage to come in and get the lettings, and the local people who might be considered for holdings if the lands were divided are being shut out from the prospect of getting that land on conacre from the Land Commission because of the claims of better-off people and their ability to get the lettings.  I raised this matter on this Estimate last year, and I then understood that the Minister proposed to take steps to accelerate the division of lands which the Land Commission had on hands.  I do not know what steps the Minister has taken in the meantime, but, whatever they are, they have not manifested themselves to any extent in County Kildare.  I should like the Minister to have the matter further examined, with a view to accelerating the allocation of lands which the Land Commission have on hands for quite a substantial period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Norton and Deputy Hughes that the land in the hands of the Land Commission for a number of years should be <Col N="1704" /> divided as soon as possible.  I understand that there is a difficulty in that the staff has been taken away, but the fact nevertheless remains that, in the constituency from which I come, there is more undivided land in the hands of the Land Commission than at any previous period.  The Land Commission has to conform to the tillage regulations.  Three-eighths of the arable land have to be cultivated this year and the appropriate quota had to be cultivated in previous years, with the result that for the past three or four years the same land has been growing cereal crops and is being run out.  That is the chief reason why the Land Commission should try to dispose of the lands it has on hands.</P>
      <P>So far as the acquisition of land is concerned, there is no use in our making any representations at present, although I believe it is the greatest worry which Deputies from the West of Ireland of every Party have.  Continued representations are being made to them to bring pressure on the Minister and his Department to have estates acquired, due to the fact that there is acute congestion, which is even more acute at present because our imports have been almost cut out, and, where there is congestion of that kind and large families, it is a terrible hardship and strain on the people to have to go several miles to a conacre field and pay prices from £4 to £14 per acre for land on which to grow a crop to provide for themselves and their families.  That has accentuated the desire of the people to force on the notice of the Land Commission the necessity of acquiring land.  We, of course, understand, but it is very hard to explain to the people why the Land Commission has decided on a different policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hughes spoke of the post-war policy of the Land Commission and what it should be.  I do not propose to follow the arguments he put up, but there are, all over the country, farmers with very large tracts of land. A number of these are undoubtedly a decided asset to the State in the present emergency.  They are working and tilling their land in the correct way and keeping it up to a proper <Col N="1705" /> state of fertility; but there are a number of other farmers with as much land, and, in some instances, more, who are not capable of tilling their lands, and who are setting it, and in some cases it is now of very little use to them.  They hand it over to the auctioneer, who does his best to get as good a price as he can, but, owing to the fact that it has been in conacre tillage for a number of years and that there is no desire on the part of the people getting the conacre to bring manure into the land and grow a green crop there in one of the three years, that land is also deteriorating.</P>
    <P>I hold that people who are not capable, at an important time like this, of working the land they hold should be marked out by the Land Commission as the first people from whom lands will be acquired in the post-war period.  There is no reason why they should be left an almost unlimited area of land which they are not capable of working, which they are not working properly and which is not being worked properly even now, despite the fact that it is let in conacre because they do not seem to be in a position to fence off portions of it, and consequently they have to continue letting the same land year in and year out.</P>
    <P>There is a good deal of talk about turf production, and we are all very anxious to see turf production speeded up.  The Land Commission in my county have bogs in hands for a number of years which they have not divided amongst the people.  I cannot understand why these bogs have not been divided.  I am sure the Land Commission will put up the argument that it thought it had more important work to do in dividing out the land, but it gave holdings to people years ago and promised, turbary for the holdings.  These people have not yet got the turbary promised to them and the turbary is locked up and is not in production.  If turf production is so important as we believe it to be, that is one of the first problems, in the West of Ireland, anyhow, which the Land Commission should tackle.  In addition, the Land Commission have a staff of gangers and supervising gangers, who, I believe, <Col N="1706" /> know much more about turf production than any other staff of men, whether county council gangers or others.  A number of these have been laid off work owing to the restricted operations of the Land Commission. I do not see why the supervisors and gangers of the Land Commission, who are mainly farmers' sons with practical experience of turf production, should not be organised and sent out in charge of gangs to produce turf on the bogs held by the Land Commission. I believe they would produce turf of a quality far superior to anything that has been produced by any other body, because of their practical experience.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is one other matter, a local matter, to which I wish to direct the Minister's attention.  The Irish Land Commission inspected about 1,100 acres on the Ashtown Estate at Woodlawn, County Galway, a few years ago, the record No. of which is S. 9,443.  They decided after inspecting the land, that, roughly, 142 acres of that land were suitable for Land Commission purposes.  The remainder, I understand, has been handed over to the Forestry Branch for afforestation purposes. Now, I am not by any means averse from afforestation, but I am told by the people in the vicinity that there are 40 statute acres of the land on which the Forestry Division propose to plant trees, which have been growing crops for the past three years. That land immediately adjoins the lands that are in the hands of the Land Commission.  It has given a return, so far as wheat is concerned, to the extent of eight barrels per statute acre, for the past three years, which is not a bad return at all, and I believe that it has given an abnormally high yield for barley.  Now, if that is so, I cannot understand the Land Commission handing over land of that kind to the Forestry Division.  There are also, on the other part of the land in the hands of the Forestry Division, at least 200 acres which, I am informed by reputable people, is also arable land; and they hold, and I hold with them, if that is true, that it would be put to a much better purpose by dividing it up amongst people concerned and using it for the growing <Col N="1707" /> of food crops rather than planting it with trees which, after all, will not give a return for the next 50 years.</P>
    <P>I wish to say, in passing, that I have been in communication with the Minister and his Department, and also with his predecessor, for the last three years on this matter, but I have always got the reply that the Land Commission did not consider the land suitable for their purposes.  Deputy Donnellan, a few weeks ago, put down a question dealing with the matter, pointing out that it had been reported to him that certain portions of that land had been producing crops for the past three years, but the Minister's reply was that he was not aware of that.  Since then I checked up, and was told what I have already stated about the part of it that did produce crops for the past three years.</P>
    <P>Of course, rumours are flying about fairly freely, and very often they are not reliable, but there is one rumour going through that particular district of Woodlawn, and that is that when the Land Commission was taking over this land, Lady Ashtown and her son, Mr. Trench, made an arrangement with the Irish Land Commission whereby an assurance was given that a certain part of the land would not be divided, as they did not want houses to be erected within view of their mansion.  Of course, I am not at all asserting that that is true, but I should like the Minister to be in the position to state definitely that no agreement of that kind was entered into, because I do hold that, after all, the ordinary tenants have just as good a right to have their homesteads and holdings laid out in a suitable place as the owners have.  They have as good a right, and perhaps a much better right, to decide where they should be placed after the land has been handed over.  That is all I have to say, Sir, except to express the wish that the Minister will investigate the cases I have mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. F. Lynch Mr. F. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very much interested, I must say, in the speech made by Deputy O'Reilly, and I endorse <Col N="1708" /> everything he has said.  I was glad also to note that, in connection with the matter he raised, the reinvestment of holdings of the Land Commission, the Minister devoted a good part of his opening statement this year to that question.  We are inclined to lose sight of the fact that the primary purpose for which the Land Commission was set up, and the primary purpose of all our Land Acts, was to make the tenant farmers of Ireland the fee simple owners of their lands.  Now, so long as we fail to achieve that purpose, or in so far as we fail to achieve it, we are not carrying out the objects of the Land Acts or the objects for which the Land Commission was set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has told us, and, indeed, the last Land Commission Report shows, that since the passing of the Land Act of 1923 the total of the tenanted land that is vested in the Land Commission under the Land Acts up to the 31st March, 1943, comprises 105,288 holdings, and we are also told in the report that out of that number of 105,288 holdings only 29,917 holdings have been revested in the tenant purchasers up to the 31st March, 1943. Now, that means that after 21 years only about a quarter of the number of holdings that have been taken up and vested in the Land Commission have been revested in the tenant purchasers, with all the consequences to the tenants that Deputy O'Reilly has pointed out, such as difficulties in obtaining credit, and so on, and, in the case of the allottees, the much more serious difficulty that they have not the right of free sale.  The right of free sale remains, I think, in the case of most of the tenant owners of land: that is, the tenant who was an ordinary tenant prior to the passing of the compulsory clauses of the Act of 1923. Such a tenant retains the right of free sale, even without the sanction of the Land Commission, so long as he is selling the whole of his land and not subdividing it.  The case of the allottees, however, is different, and going back ten, 15 and almost 20 years, a number of these persons who have been given portions of land without having the land vested in them, still find that they cannot sell their land without the <Col N="1709" /> sanction of the Land Commission, which is very difficult to get, even in some extraordinary cases.</P>
    <P>Now, I do not blame the Land Commission at all for adopting the attitude that it would not lightly allow a man, who was given an allotment of land only a few years ago, to turn that gift of land into cash.  I think it is perfectly right that the man should have the land for a certain number of years, but I think it is unreasonable to keep a man waiting for, say, anything over ten years before giving him his full rights as fee-simple owner of the land.  I have one particular case in mind which I came across professionally&mdash;it is not a case in my constituency at all&mdash;of a man who got land about nine years ago&mdash;ten years ago, I think.  That man was a very hard-working farmer who used his land to very great advantage and made a bit of money out of it.  He had some capital in addition to what he made out of the land.  On the farm which he was allotted there was no dwelling-house and none was built for him because he was living in a house adjacent, which belonged to his father. The father died intestate, but now that man wants to get married and he wants a house of his own because his sisters and another brother are residing in the old family house.  In order that he might be in a position to get married he bought a farm about four or five miles away on which there was a dwelling-house, paying something like £1,300 for it, and, of course, he was counting on the sale of the holding which he had to meet portion of the purchase price.  Sanction to that has been held up for at least three months.  I think that is a case where sanction should be given without delay, because it is not a question of a man turning a grant of land into cash. It is a question of a man who was given land improving himself in his landed position, as it were, getting a better holding and a more suitable holding to enable him to bring up a family.  It is an entirely different position from that of the man who gets land this year and, in a few years' time, says he will go off to some other form of undertaking, invests in a public house, for instance, and sells the <Col N="1710" /> land and turns the grant of land into a public house.  I would have no sympathy with that kind of person but, certainly, where you have genuine sale by a man who sells for the purpose of putting up part of the purchase money for another farm, I think that is a case which automatically should be sanctioned. I think sanction ought to be granted every time in such cases.</P>
    <P>The question of vesting arises on this whole matter.  There seems to me to be no real excuse for the prolonged and inordinate delays that have occurred in revesting holdings in the tenants.  The popular cry in our constituencies is &ldquo;Insist on more acquisition and more division,&rdquo; but now that acquisition and division are set aside for the moment it would pay us well to concentrate for a period and devote whatever staff is left in the Land Commission to that very essential matter of having the holdings that have been acquired by the Land Commission revested in the tenants.  Indeed, even at any time I think Deputies might concern themselves with that question.  It is every bit as important as going on with more acquisition and more division. The other thing seems to be more important.  It meets the outcry in a man's particular constituency to put down questions, and so on, but in fact I think it is more important that the work of revesting should be undertaken now more promptly rather than that further acquisition and division of land should be continued.  When the Land Commission does get back its staff, I think it would be no harm if it were to forget further acquisition and division for a while and concentrate on getting rid of the abnormal amount of holdings vested in the Land Commission and get them vested in the tenants.</P>
    <P>The number of migrants' holdings that the Minister mentioned as being still in the hands of the Land Commission is, I think, far too high.  I think the Minister said that something like 800 holdings of migrants from the western counties are in the hands of the Land Commission and are being let out in conacre or some way for grazing for quite a number of years. Perhaps I took him up wrongly.  It seems to me to be abnormal.  It seems <Col N="1711" /> to me to be an amazing position that in congested areas the Land Commission should retain those lands for a number of years without doing something about them.  There seems to me to be no excuse for that.  Here you have areas where there is an absolute outcry for rendering uneconomic holdings economic.  The means are there; the land is there in the hands of the Land Commission; and it is doing nothing about it.  I think that is a matter of primary importance.</P>
    <P>The Minister should concentrate in getting something done about the allocation of these migrants' holdings in these congested areas, that he should concentrate as soon as possible, when staff becomes available, on seeing that all these holdings vested in the Land Commission are vested in the tenants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last two occasions when this Estimate was before the House I suggested that advantage should be taken by the Minister and by the Government of the lull in the distribution of land to consider the whole policy of land settlement over the past 20 years.  There is no doubt whatever that our whole agricultural economy depends to a large extent upon our system of land tenure.  I do not agree with Deputy Hughes' suggestion that farmers should be graded, so to speak, like pigs at a bacon factory into grade A, grade B and grade C, but I do hold that agricultural policy and land policy demand that the State should exercise rights over land tenure.  In this House, I have been persistently advocating fixity of tenure for farmers and it might be taken by some people as a suggestion that the State should have no right whatsoever to acquire land for the relief of congestion or any other essential purpose.  I do not hold any such view, but I do hold that the <Col N="1712" /> farmer who works his land not only himself and his family but to the best advantage of the community, should be secure in the possession of his holding. Under existing legislation he has no such security and that is the view which I have frequently expressed.  At the present time, when land division is not in active operation, it should be the duty of the State to see how far land division has been successful in the past, to see how far it has contributed to a better agricultural system in this country.  Various views are expressed in regard to the size of an agricultural holding.  There is the view that no holding should exceed 30, 40 or 50 acres.  There is another view that no holding should be less than 30, 40 or 50 acres.  I think practical experience in other countries has shown that a wide variety of holdings is desirable. In Denmark, for example, the size of holdings corresponds to a great extent to the size of holdings in this country and I do not think that anyone could say that agriculture in Denmark has not been highly efficient.  I am not of the opinion that ruthless sub-division of land into small holdings will make for greater efficiency.  Neither am I of the opinion that the abolition of small holdings and their consolidation into large units will increase efficiency. There is room for the small farmer and there is room for the big farmer and I can testify that we have efficient farmers in each category.</P>
      <P>I have practical knowledge and experience of one particular holding of over 1,000 acres, upon which there are practically 100 men employed, and on that holding the standard of output is higher than on many of the small holdings adjoining.  In addition to that, the standard of remuneration of those 100 employees is higher than it would probably be if the estate were divided amongst them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that, in considering land policy generally, the policy of the Department of Agriculture cuts very much into the operations of the Land Commission.  I was reading an Irish legend recently which might have some bearing on this question.  It may have been in the realms of mythology but, strangely enough, it dealt with a certain <Col N="1713" /> individual who was known as &ldquo;The Long Lad&rdquo;.  One of his feats was to take two decrepit ladies, heat them on a blacksmith's fire and weld them into one beautiful young woman. I am not going to alarm the Chamber by suggesting that the Taoiseach might attempt a similar operation with the Minister for Lands and the Minister for Agriculture and make one good Minister out of two bad Ministers, but I do suggest that he might well consider such a step in regard to these two Departments because, as Deputy Roddy and Deputy Hughes pointed out, the operations and the activities of the two Departments are closely inter-allied and as time goes on they will tend to become even more closely allied.  One of the functions of either the Department of Lands or the Department of Agriculture, or of a new Department in which both these Departments will have been merged, will be to see that land is efficiently worked whether the holdings are large or small.  To suggest, as some people suggest, that there is something evil or undesirable about small holdings, on the one hand, or large holdings on the other, is altogether wrong and undesirable, and it is not a tendency which should be encouraged in future.</P>
    <P>In regard to lands which have been divided by the Land Commission, one aspect often strikes me, and that is in regard to the justice of the present system of land division.  Recently my attention was drawn to an estate which had been divided mainly amongst uneconomic holders in a certain district.  Two particular uneconomic holders were applicants for allotments on that estate.  One of them, by his industry and thrift during the past 20 years, was able to purchase a small piece of land at a fairly high price in the open market.  By consolidating that with his former holding, he brought his valuation to the limit beyond which it was not possible, under existing regulations, for the Land Commission to give him an additional holding.  The other small holder, although he was also an industrious and useful citizen, had not acquired additional land.  The result was that the man who had not acquired an additional parcel of land in the <Col N="1714" /> open market was entitled to, and received, a substantial allotment, whereas the man who had invested all his life savings in acquiring additional land was debarred from benefiting from the distribution by the Land Commission. I want to know is that system going to continue and if so, what steps the Land Commission will in future take to avoid inflicting injustice, as injustice there certainly is in a system of that kind.</P>
    <P>The same injustice operates in the case of landless men.  There are, for example, two small farmers.  One of them succeeds, as a result of thrift over a number of years, in purchasing a holding, say, for his second son, whereas the other does not bother to make any provision of that kind.  Then it is held that the son of the man who has purchased the additional holding is not entitled to land whereas the son of the other man is.  Injustice seems to be inherent in that system, and the question naturally arises whether the present system of land division is fair and just.  I think that question will have to be considered right now before land division on a large scale is resumed. My own personal view is that any person who receives land through the Land Commission or otherwise should receive it on payment, over a time or otherwise, of the same amount as he would pay in the open market. The function of the Land Commission should be to facilitate desirable and suitable persons in acquiring such land and their function should end there.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter with which I should like to deal.  The Minister referred to the great improvement in the collection of arrears of land annuities outstanding.  It is hoped that in the course of another year or two all outstanding arrears will be wiped out, and that the Land Commission can then start with a clean slate.  In this connection, I should like to express the hope that never again will any political Party in this country bring the question of the payment of land annuities into the arena of political strife as the Fianna Fáil Party did in 1928 and 1929. They set an example then which was followed by other Parties.  I hope now that the question of the payment of <Col N="1715" /> land annuities will be removed entirely from the political arena.  The point I want to make is that if conditions in agriculture should become difficult in future, the Land Commission should not be required again to act as a credit institution in regard to agriculture. That is a function which the Land Commission was never fitted to perform. If special credit facilities are required by farmers they should be provided from some other source than through the Land Commission.  What I mean is, that if farmers in a certain year, whether in the near or distant future, find it difficult to meet payments to the Land Commission, some other credit institution should be provided from which farmers can obtain money to pay the Land Commission and that the Land Commission should have no function in deciding whether a person is able to pay or not. In that way, the Land Commission will be relieved of a very difficult task, and a task they were never fitted to perform.</P>
    <P>There is another small matter in relation to land division to which I want to refer.  That is the method of fencing land which has been sub-divided and allotted to tenants.  Very good sod-bank fences have been erected by the Land Commission.  In many cases, they have been efficiently erected.  My experience in my own constituency is that the work has been fairly well done.  But no quicks or plants are being planted upon those ditches, and the result is that those sod fences erected a few years ago are crumbling away.  That is, perhaps, more noticeable in County Kildare than elsewhere. One still sees the old fences covered with good, whitethorn hedges, whereas the new fences erected by the Land Commission are absolutely bare, and are crumbling away.  There may be some administrative difficulty in the matter, or there may be difficulty in obtaining quicks, and this may have debarred the Land Commission from taking the necessary precaution of providing hedges on its fences.  The absence of such plantations has resulted in the waste of an enormous <Col N="1716" /> amount of public money, because these fences will last only a few years.</P>
    <P>Another matter brought to my notice is, I think, quite common in connection with the allotment of new holdings. In one case, the number of out-offices was slightly in excess of what the Land Commission thought necessary for the tenant and they proceeded, at very considerable expense, to pull down very good out-offices.  The pulling down of useful out-offices on an agricultural holding was a hopelessly undesirable activity for a Government Department.  It is very hard accurately to estimate the number of out-offices required on an agricultural holding.  On the average holding, we have not half enough houses for live stock, implements and all the things which require out-office accommodation. In Denmark and other countries which have been mentioned, the number of out-buildings on farms is three times the average number here.  It is ridiculous for a Government Department to send out men to pull down existing out-offices.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>The previous speaker and others have stressed a very laudable point&mdash;that persons utilising their land properly should not be interfered with in connection with the division of land.  But there is no good point which may not be unduly stressed and I feel that the weight of this appeal from Deputies on this Estimate and on previous Estimates must have permeated the minds of the Land Commission to such an extent that it resulted in evoking a standstill Order in connection with land division and consequent paralysis of this activity.  If Deputies argue that a man who utilises his land well is, notwithstanding the size of his farm, not to be interfered with, I wonder where the land is to come from for people who have no land and who are potentially useful land-holders.  Are they to be denied any possibility of getting a portion of land because existing holders, irrespective of the size of their farms, are working the land to the best possible advantage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had previous discussion on this matter and Deputy Cogan adverted to it just now.  He said that <Col N="1717" /> nobody should argue against the utilisation of any particular type of holding, large or small.  I am arguing for the provision of holdings of a suitable character for suitable tenants who are at present denied the right to get a piece of land.  There are considerable numbers of them in the country.  Considerable numbers of them have left the country because of the failure to provide them with an opportunity to get into farming.  They include farmers' sons and good agricultural labourers.  The paralysis of land division is attributable to a considerable extent to the economic crisis through which we are passing, but I want to repeat the argument of several other speakers, that land already taken over by the Land Commission, land that has, so to speak, been caught in the Land Commission machine for several years, should be divided.  I do not think that anybody would argue that there should be a standstill in respect of land caught in the Land Commission machine.  We got an assurance from the predecessor of the present Minister that, while not inclined to expand land division in the present emergency, they would go on with the division of land which they had acquired or were in process of acquiring.  In the county I represent, there are several holdings which were in process of acquisition four or five years ago and which are in the same position now.  I think that, the emergency notwithstanding, there is a duty devolving on the Land Commission and on this House to let the people know that we have not fully abandoned land division, that it is to be the eventual policy, and the best way to do that is to proceed to divide the lands already in possession of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Another point with which I want to deal, not for the first time, was adverted to.  I hope that when the Land Commission get into their stride they will attend to it.  I refer to the regulation of the distance within which uneconomic holders and landless men must live from an estate in order to obtain land on that estate when it is under division.  The distance was reduced from a radius of two miles and one mile to one mile and half a mile <Col N="1718" /> for uneconomic holders and landless men, respectively.  If there was any sensible view behind that change, the aim should have been to make the land more available for economic working. If there are several landless men, otherwise suitable, living five-eighths of a mile from an estate which is being divided, they are not eligible to receive a holding on that estate.  I have cases in which men were definitely ruled out from participation in the allocation of an estate because they were five-eighths of a mile from the estate.  The next estate being divided there, will, probably, be in the next county, and, when that is dealt with, there is no chance during their lifetime of another estate being divided in their proximity. If a man be a suitable tenant for the land, it is nonsensical, because he does not come within the magic circle of half a mile, to rule him out, considering that it is the last chance he will ever have of getting a portion of land. Similarly, in the case of uneconomic holders, they must reside within an area of one mile.  Formerly, it was two miles.  I wonder what happened the uneconomic holder that he could not make the two miles which the Land Commission thought him capable of formerly.  I think that the distances of two miles and one mile were very conservative, and I ask the Minister to look into that point so as to see if he could not allow men who come within the former ambit to participate in land division, bearing in mind that I have umpteen cases to prove that because men lived five-eighths of a mile from the place of allocation they have been ruled out.</P>
    <P>Whatever allegation may be made against the Land Commission of being slow in their methods, I always believed that they were very quick to recover anything belonging to them. I have, however, to complain that they have been dilatory in taking possession of something that is their own. An estate in County Limerick&mdash;the Danaher estate&mdash;has been the subject of litigation over a number of years. The owner won the first round and the Land Commission the second round. Having proceeded to get possession of that estate, the Land Commission gave <Col N="1719" /> the owner 12 months to get rid of the stock.  At the end of 12 months, they gave him a further period of 12 months.  Pressure was brought to bear in this House by some Deputies&mdash; pressure may have been brought to bear in another direction by other Deputies&mdash;and the land was vested in the Land Commission on 6th January. This gentleman still declines to be disturbed. The court messengers ordered to take possession must be moving on crutches.  If I owed a debt I would have the sheriff's officers at my door within 24 hours.  They have not reached that place yet.  A considerable number of men are hungry for the division of that estate.  A scheme was prepared in 1936 but the owner has been able to evade the Land Commission ever since. Although the Land Commission got possession over a year ago they might speed up the matter now because this man continues to defy them.  There is turbary on the land which was made available to his friends by this gentleman. I am not sure but he is making it available this year.  The turbary would be useful to the people in the locality at present.  If a new scheme is necessary for the division of the land it would be useful if the people could get turf there this season.  I ask the Minister to make a note of the case to see if anything could be done about this case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I come from a county that is very much affected by land division and that has many grievances in that respect.  The people feel that they got a raw deal over land division. For a number of years there has been land division in the county, but in my opinion there was a great deal of slackness in the selection of applicants, with the result that the Land Commission is now pestered, trying to get money out of tenants who are not even living in the houses they got.  I hold that the Land Commission was at fault when political pressure was tried, because a large number of those selected for land should not have got it.  Many of them never had a penny and are living on home help.  That type of person is not suitable for the land, and that is why I blame the Land Commission for not <Col N="1720" /> giving more consideration to the rights of local applicants.  In my opinion, the migration schemes were a dismal failure.  A few of the people who came with the first colony are a credit to themselves, but many of the others have not the slightest idea about working of land, of public decency or of respect for the feelings of others.  They spend a good deal of time in the courts because of trouble they create in the streets.  I am glad to say that the Land Commission is now selecting a better type of applicant, and that those who have come from Donegal, Clare and Kerry seem to be a decent respectable class.  They are making good progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am definitely of opinion, however, that the migration schemes are not a success, inasmuch as the farms that the people have to live on are too small.  Most of the migrants who got land are helped by relatives in England who send money home to them.  The average farm is from 20 to 25 statute acres and if there is depression at the conclusion of this war many of these people may be in dire straits.  It will then be a case of selling out many of these holdings.  The size of farm that might be economic in Mayo would not be economic in Meath.  People with land in Mayo are assisted by relatives in England and by fishing, but in Meath, where they have no other income, they could not make a living on such farms.  But for the war many migrants would have returned to their former districts.  If there is to be further migration I ask the Minister to see that those who are brought up will be made to respect the rights of the people of Meath and Kildare.  Many farmers in Kildare and Meath have capital but they got no chance of investing it in land.  I asked some time ago concerning the part-purchase of farms.  Many farms remain in the hands of the Land Commission for some time before being allotted.  I ask the Minister to give farmers who can put down a couple of hundred pounds a chance to get land, because if these men put money into holdings they will make a success of them.  If there was a scheme catering for people of that type we would have a class of farmers who would be a credit to themselves and to the State.  The present Minister <Col N="1721" /> is an energetic man and I ask him to give consideration to the claims of such people.  There has been a good deal of speculation in land in Meath in the last few years.  It is unfortunate that the Land Commission did not get possession of some large farms that changed hands at good prices.  I hold that farms which have recently been purchased should be divided and that an eye should be kept on them by the Land Commission.  Some of these holdings changed hands two or three times in a few years.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies spoke about the vesting of land.  I hold that the Land Commission has been slack in that respect. I am living on a holding that was divided 16 years ago.  I raised a question on several occasions as to when that land will be vested.  I have raised the question two or three or four times of when they are going to vest some of these holdings and the answer is always the same, that they have not been able to reach it owing to the pressure of work.  I have made a success myself of my own little holding.  I hold it is double the value of what it was when I got it.  That was done by hard work, by honest work and it is the same with many of my neighbours. They find themselves completely handicapped for want of capital.  They cannot go to the bank and say: &ldquo;I want money to buy stock,&rdquo; because they will be asked: &ldquo;Where are the title deeds of the farm?&rdquo; The tenant has to hang his head and say: &ldquo;I have not got them.&rdquo; You have only a tenancy and can be put out at 15 days' notice.  That is holding up a vast amount of work in Meath and there is no earthly reason why the Land Commission should not make an effort to vest these holdings in the tenants who have made a success of them.  I know there can be no such thing as a man expecting the Government to vest land in him after two or three years.  I would not believe that myself but after five or eight years the Land Commission should see who is making good and the man who is making good should be given a chance to acquire his holding.</P>
    <P>The vesting of land is a burning question in my county and it should get <Col N="1722" /> speedier attention than anything else. Fixity of tenure I hold also is a burning question, but I hold that cannot be dealt with until land division is completed and the sooner it is tackled in a proper way, in a really revolutionary manner, the better, so that it can be got through in five or eight years.  You can have no fixity of tenure until then.  I have another grievance in connection with the migrants.  They are continually coming up complaining of the way they have been treated by the Land Commission.  They said they were told they were getting special facilities, a farm and certain assets.  They were to get certain stock and the Land Commission came to them down in the West and gave them a form to sign, and they say that the forms they signed were very different from the transaction the Land Commission carried out afterwards.  They told they were to get two or three yearlings and other things, and others were to get a cart and a horse and when they came up the Land Commission did not provide them.  That is very unfair to the migrants.  If they signed a statement the Land Commission should stand over that.  If they had to sign statements, the statements should be read over clearly to them by the inspector so that these people will know what is to be expected.  I am convinced that many of these men cannot read at all.  Many of them are old people and if they sign, they sign sometimes more or less blindly.  They come up expecting a land of milk and honey and instead of that they get miserable patches of scraggy land in Meath with perhaps an old Kerry cow.  They got a very bad deal, a very raw deal. More attention should be paid to them.</P>
    <P>As regards the water supply, I hold the Land Commission has treated the people badly.  Take the land in Meath. The Meath man was ready to do anything to get the land, but when he gets into it he sometimes cannot use it.  I hold that if a farm is divided it should be provided with water.  We know what happens.  They must have a lot of old barrels, and sometimes they have to bring the water a long distance.  When it is a question of the Land Commission sinking holes for water, they go down 15 or 20 feet <Col N="1723" /> and then they get surface water, but when June comes along the pump goes dry and it is no use.  There should be provided a system of water.  It is no use putting down a pump two or three feet because when the dry weather comes, the pump goes dry.  There are places in County Meath where you cannot get water for a depth of 60 feet, and in others you have only to go down ten feet.  I ask that when the Land Commission is sinking pumps it will sink them properly and see that there is a constant supply of water there.  I do not think I have much more to say at the present moment, but I would like to see the Land Commission more energetic in taking over the estates.  There is no reason why we should not get on with it.  In future I would ask that the rights of the Meath people would be respected.  We have no objection to the migrants coming to Meath. There is room for both migrants and Meath people, but one of the mistakes is the herding of 15 or 20 migrants together.  That tends to bring about hostility and to make them a colony on their own.  They look down on the Meath people and the Meath people growl at them.  Migrants and Meath people should be put together as neighbours.  If the migrants were brought up for the purpose of spreading the Irish language I say that the scheme is a dismal failure.  Not a word of Irish is spoken in the district.  Every one of them that comes up comes up with the purpose of acquiring a proper knowledge of English. The first thing they want is to get a proper grasp of English, and when they have got it they go across to England to look for big money.  If the purpose was to relieve congestion I hold that it would be far better to do as Paddy Hogan suggested, and take a larger landholder from Mayo.  Meath, Kildare and Westmeath are the natural gateway to the British market.  Take Athenry, Ballinasloe, Roscommon and other places which are living by the sale of cattle and sheep they send to County Meath, Kildare and Westmeath. The West of Ireland would be the most dismal failure without Meath. It would be cropped.  The amount of <Col N="1724" /> money that goes down from County Meath to the West for store cattle, sheep and ewes is simply enormous, in order to bring them to Meath, in order to carry on the economy there.  I would ask the Land Commission to think very seriously of this.  I want to say the successful farmer in County Meath will not buy a Meath store bull because of what the change of land will do.  It is far better to buy in the West.  They would not buy a Meath store bull.  They get them from the West.</P>
    <P>I think that is the right economy for Meath and the West.  Meath is able to absorb live stock from the West, but if you carry on the policy of bringing uneconomic holders from the West, planting them in Meath, you will intensify the problem.  You are killing the natural markets and the export trade.  Go back to the old policy of Paddy Hogan and take the larger farmer from the West and give him 80 or 70 acres of good land in Meath. He will be an asset to Meath and an asset to the country.  The men who get the land he has left behind him will be assets in the surrounding districts. We have gone too far in this blind alley of migration.  The migrants are good, honest men, and what I have said on their behalf is true.  They have been put on small holdings and left until they have found that what we say is the truth.  I ask the Minister to give the farmer's son in County Meath a chance to buy land.  He may have a couple of hundred pounds in the bank, and if he has not his father will help him.  When men are brought from the West, put them on decent holdings in County Meath, and then you will have something worth while in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard a lot of people in this House advocating the acquisition by the Land Commission of any large farm that is put up for sale.  If that policy is prosecuted, it means that you are going to destroy, as you have very largely done already, free sale in this country.  If you destroy free sale, the land of this country will deteriorate steadily, for no one will put his savings into land which he knows cannot be realised if and when <Col N="1725" /> the necessity for so doing arises. Speculation such as that outlined by Deputy Giles in land should be stopped.  Nobody in this country wants to see land made the subject of speculation. Whether the farmer be large or small, whether he is cultivating ten acres or 1,000 acres, if he is living on his land and living by his land, he should have fixity of tenure.  He should have free sale, and he should have a fair rent which, in our modern times, does not come within the ambit of the Minister's authority, because a fair rent means exemption from excessive rates, and that is a matter that we can take up with the Minister for Local Government and Public Health. But free sale and fixity of tenure both come within the Minister's purview. The accursed Land Act of 1933 destroyed them both, and the desire to have that Act worked in its worst possible interpretation is liable to do steadily increasing damage.  Deputy Blowick shakes his head when I say that free sale and fixity of tenure were both destroyed by the 1933 Land Act. If the Deputy had studied that Act as closely as I have done, and the principles enshrined in it, he would see that it did destroy both.  I am not going to argue that question now.  I do warn the House against the destruction of free sale.  If you destroy free sale, then you are going to destroy the land of Ireland.</P>
      <P>I am going to speak on something that must be present to the mind of every Deputy in the House, and I dare any Deputy, on any side of the House, to get up and address himself to it. How long are we going to go on buying land through the Land Commission for £100 an acre and selling it to the farmers for £50 an acre?  The money of Midas will not pay the bill if we go on doing that for long enough.  I always think that the land annuities racket was one of the most shameful rackets that our people ever engaged in.  We got away with it.  We duped the English out of the money that we had undertaken to pay them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be some people who may be proud of that performance <Col N="1726" /> but there are others of us who are not.  Whether we are proud of it or ashamed of it, it is true that we made something out of it.  We got our pound of flesh.  That is past history. In the 1933 Land Act we inserted the provision that all land annuities hereafter would be reduced by 50 per cent.  That means that we go out&mdash;when I say &ldquo;we&rdquo; I mean the community&mdash;and we buy a holding for £1,000.  We divide it into five holdings, the price of each to the purchaser being £200.  We improve the holding out of revenue and we charge the incoming tenant nothing for the improvement. We then fix the annuity.  Remember the basis on which we fix the annuity. Under the land code, the annuity is primarily intended to redeem the principal and interest for the term usually of 60 years, but if the holding is of such a character that it will not bear the full economic annuity, plus a reasonable livelihood for the man living on the land, then the annuity is abated by so much as will bring it down to a figure which will enable the farmer to pay it and have for himself and his family a reasonable living out of the land.  Having ascertained what the annuity shall be, we then halve it and we charge one-half of the total price to posterity, and the purchaser gets the land for half what it cost the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it any wonder there should be land hunger?  Suppose we started to buy public houses and sell them at half the price they cost us, would there not be a hunger for public houses, or supposing we started to buy race courses or dog tracks or any other piece of property and sell them to purchasers for one-half what they cost, would there not be a hunger for any such property?  There is hunger amongst any reasonable body of men for anything that you can buy for one-half of what it costs.  How long are we going to go on doing that?  The Minister knows the magnitude of that problem just as well as I do.  Every Deputy knows how utterly impossible it is for this community to go on deliberately buying land and selling it at half its cost.  There is no Deputy who will get up and speak his mind on this.  Do Deputies believe that the <Col N="1727" /> deadweight debt of our community should be allowed indefinitely to grow in order to finance that absurdity?  I think that the farmers who used to be on the land in this country, if you made that proposition to them&mdash;that they ought to agitate in order to ensure that land purchase would be conducted on the lines that the farmers would only be asked to pay one-half of what the land cost&mdash;would have laughed in your face and despised you. But, faith, it is the most popular piece of legislation that was passed in this House in the generation in which we live.  People in this country used to be proud of paying their way, but soon we are going to have a situation in which everybody in the country will be either a pensioner on one fund or another, or else will be acquiring his homestead at a price one-half of which is being defrayed by the community.</P>
    <P>I would be glad if the Minister would tell us: is it intended for ever to go on buying land at a cost of £100 an acre to the community and selling it to the incoming tenant for £50?  I want to put to the Minister a specific question which, perhaps, he will find it convenient to answer in a categorical way when winding up the debate.  As I understand the situation, the reduction of the land annuities by 50 per cent. in no case altered the term over which they are to be paid.  That is to say, that if there was a 60-year annuity under the Wyndham Act, which was £20 prior to the passing of the 1933 Land Act, that annuity remains a 60-year annuity, but that instead of paying £20 a year you now pay £10 a year.  Would the Minister be good enough to tell me when the annuities under the Ashbourne Act, under the Wyndham Act, under the Hogan Act, and under the 1933 Land Act will come to an end in relation to the date of the several purchase agreements made?</P>
    <P>I wonder did the Minister, when introducing the Vote, announce the all-important news that one of our ancient offices of State has ceased to be and has been transferred to his Department since this Estimate was last before the Dáil.  The Quit Rent Office <Col N="1728" /> has ceased to be and has now deteriorated into nothing more than a section of the Minister's Department. Such an announcement would have had this interesting consequence&mdash;that, whereas the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee has been asked every year for the past eight years to explain what the Quit Rent Office is, that pleasing duty will in future devolve upon the Minister for Lands.  I can assure him, from painful experience, that it will take a good deal of trouble to work out a formula adequately to explain the Quit Rent Office, to secure the comprehension of the members of the committee.</P>
    <P>I remember one of the <i>tours de force</i> of Deputy Aiken when he was Minister for Lands and was putting through the House the introduction of the &ldquo;Land Commission Warrant&rdquo;.  This was to be a simple procedure, designed to save everyone trouble and largely designed to protect the rights of the county council in regard to tenant purchasers.  Of course, it has since been an instrument of oppression, designed to withhold from them the simple right to go into court and argue with a creditor as to whether some claim is due or not.  I know that, in a great many cases, the warrants have been addressed to the proper people for the proper amounts; but I have come across cases in which the sheriff has issued a warrant against a man for his neighbour's rent and there were no means of holding up the proceedings. If a man did not pay, not only the rent claimed but the costs endorsed on the warrant, the sheriff's bailiffs came out and took his cattle.</P>
    <P>I remember getting in touch, on one occasion, with some section of the Land Commission and pointing out that the warrant was addressed to the wrong man.  I was informed that nothing could be done about it once the warrant was issued, that there were no means of stopping it and that it was better to pay up and look cheerful and do his best to recover the amount from his neighbour.  I suppose he had some right in civil law to sue his neighbour, if he could prove to the district justice that he had been the victim of a warrant which should never have been issued against him; <Col N="1729" /> but to describe that as a simplification is to hurl an insult at the tenant purchaser. It is ludicrous and, in my opinion, rotten in principle and ought to be stopped.  The ordinary process should be restored whereby, if the Land Commission wants to sue people for their rent, they have to go to the courts in the same way as any other creditor.</P>
    <P>I would again stress the point with which I opened: if fixity of tenure, free sale and fair rent are not restored, the land of Ireland will deteriorate to the condition in which it was in 1879, before which these things were not won for our people.  The natural cupidity and folly of our people have been exploited to turn everybody in this country into a land grabber and an emergency man. I do not mind those who are brought up by land grabbers and emergency men failing to comprehend the wicked iniquity of their action in destroying free sale, fixity of tenure and fair rent, but those who are born of small farmers, who knew the struggle that our fathers made in order to secure these things&mdash;and the bulk of the Deputies of this House belong to that class&mdash;should be able to appreciate that their fathers were not fools.  They had experienced the absence of fixity of tenure, free sale and fair rent.  They knew the misery of living without these things and were prepared to sacrifice everything in order to get them.  The generation to which we belong grew up in the enjoyment of these things.  Many families in this country saw, in two generations, their people rise from destitution to a reasonable degree of prosperity and comfort; but, like fools who would abandon liberty because they were born into, it and have never known what it is to suffer under tyranny, some people in this generation would throw away fair rent, fixity of tenure and free sale, in order to open to themselves the possibility of grabbing their neighbour's land.</P>
    <P>There was a time when an emergency man or a grabber was boycotted until he let go.  There was a time when the sons and descendants of such creatures were marked and remembered as people whom no one should trust, as <Col N="1730" /> people deserving in their community of nothing but toleration.  The conduct that brought those sanctions down on people's heads 50 years ago is, in the new Fianna Fáil dispensation, the epitome of patriotism.  The grabber who is forever agitating at the doors of the Land Commission to get his neighbour's land distributed, the emergency man who is prepared to grab his neighbour's farm&mdash;these are the honoured callers on the Land Commission now.  God be with the days when such people would not dare to show their faces there, as they would run serious risk of getting their necks broken if they did.</P>
    <P>I want to see returning the days when the Land Commission and the Congested Districts Board were recognised by every decent tenant purchaser and farmer as a friend of those who wanted to work their land and did not covet their neighbour's farm, who were not prepared to stop to subterfuge, in order to get that which did not by right belong to them.  I grieve to see, in many parts of the country, the Land Commission looked upon as the agent of the grabber and the emergency man. Unless we resist that tendency and restore the old philosophy, the land will suffer, the people who live upon the land will suffer and, if that is let come to pass, the things we are supposed to represent will suffer bitterly as well.</P>

What happens in regard to the distribution of land? A piece of land is vacant in some area. In the main, it has not been worked for some considerable time, perhaps, and the landless men and uneconomic holders in the area make representations to the Land Commission to take it over and divide it up equitably amongst these people.  Unfortunately, the Land Commission does not divide the land immediately, in a great many cases, but leaves it there for a considerable time without division.  It is out of production and sometimes is a burden on the county council, as the rates are not paid on it.  The ordinary small farmer, middle-sized farmer or large farmer has no fear that anyone will go in and take over his land.</P>

      <P>My grievance with the Land Commission is that they are not distributing land at all.  I know the Minister may say that he has not sufficient staff.  Perhaps he has not sufficient staff for the preparation of plans for the distribution of land, but there is nothing to prevent him acquiring land with the object eventually of giving it to the uneconomic holders and landless men in the area.  I know districts in County Clare where there are hundreds of acres of land that could be acquired.  We heard Deputy Giles speak of people going from County Clare to County Meath.  We are aware that people are coming from Meath to purchase land in County Clare.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We may be, but we do not do that now.  We know that men from County Meath and other counties who have large sums of money and who can well afford to take over land, have been coming to County Clare for that purpose, and if that sort of thing continues the uneconomic holders and landless men in these areas in Clare will never get an opportunity of acquiring a stake in the soil of their county.  There is no use in the Minister saying he cannot do anything in this matter.  The Minister ought to know that in County Clare there is a good deal of dissatisfaction in regard to the manner in which fairly large tracts of land have been disposed of.  They were sold under the noses of the landless men and the uneconomic holders. Those unfortunate men cannot get an opportunity of making their holdings economic.  They have not a proper opportunity of growing crops because the land goes to the well-to-do people who come from outside areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested to hear Deputy Dillon talking about the way the land annuities are being adjusted.  Evidently Deputy Dillon would like the land annuities to be doubled.  He said <Col N="1733" /> they were halved, and posterity would have to pay one-half and the present land annuitant the other half.  I was about to raise the question of the land annuities, and to ask the Minister how much of the money originally advanced has been redeemed by the efflux of time.  I cannot find an account of that anywhere; I cannot get information indicating how much of the money advanced has been redeemed through the payment of land annuities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan said he hoped nobody would drag the land annuities into the arena of politics again.  I do not know what he meant by that, and I would like him to develop that point.  Is it his idea that the land annuitant should pay the land annuities indefinitely? Is there to be no time limit?  Will the amount advanced ever be repaid?  I have made some investigations into the amount of money advanced to one land annuitant.  Let me take the case of a man who bought under the 1891 Act.  This is a real instance&mdash;it is nothing I imagined or a case coming from a fevered imagination like the type of thing we have had from Deputy Dillon. I will give figures relating to one definite case.  A sum of £200 was advanced in 1891 to a small farmer.  His land annuity was £8 16s.&mdash;£4 8s. per half year.  Several sections of the 1891 Act affected the payment of the land annuity, and when the 1896 Act came into operation this man was allowed three decadal reductions.  At the end of the decadal reductions his annuity was £4 4s. 2d.  In 1933 the annuity was halved, and it now works out at £2 4s. 4d. per annum.  I went to the trouble of making a hurried calculation as to what the man paid with respect to the £200 advanced in 1891 and I find he has paid at least twice the £200.</P>
    <P>I wonder how Deputy Dillon would defend that method?  He found fault with the land annuities being halved, but he did not deal with the Land Act of 1891 or the Act of 1896, and he did not explain to us how they worked out in a case of that sort.  I should like to hear from the Minister how many of these advances have been redeemed through the efflux of time.  I should <Col N="1734" /> like some definite information on that point, and he might tell us whether this land tax, for that is all it is at the moment, will continue indefinitely or will it stop when the amount advanced for the purchase of the land is repaid.</P>
    <P>References have been made to the division of land and the erection of houses, but there is one matter that has been only lightly touched upon, and that is that there is very little use in giving land and houses to people unless you can give them some credit upon which to operate.  The Land Commission do not seem to appreciate the difficulty of people in that connection.  They do not seem to realise that people have to carry on when they enter into a new holding, and that they are faced with considerable expense.  When you see an allottee endeavouring to dispose of his property, which he acquired possibly five or ten years ago and which he is not capable of working, do you realise that he has to dispose of it because he has not sufficient money to work the holding successfully?  The Minister and the Department do not seem to realise that difficulty.</P>
    <P>We are told that land is not being divided because there is not sufficient staff, and that they are not erecting houses and distributing plots because they have not adequate staff or cannot get the material.  I put it to the Minister for Local Government on a former occasion and I will put it to the Minister for Lands now, that there is a considerable amount of material at our very doors if we will only use it.  I have seen cement being brought in for the erection of houses on allotments where, by simply digging the soil, you could get the best of stone with which to erect dwellings for the allottees. There is no reason why the allottees could not get houses erected of good stone which could be quarried and prepared, and there would be no necessity to wait for material to come in. The Minister may tell us that it is necessary to wait for the material in order to proceed with house erection, but I suggest that the quarries might be used to advantage.</P>
    <P>I will repeat what I said with respect to the division of land.  In County <Col N="1735" /> Clare nothing has been done within the last ten years in the way of land division.  When large tracts become available the Department allows men with a couple of thousand pounds at their disposal to buy that land right under the noses of the landless men and the uneconomic holders.  I have a letter here from a resident in North Clare and it might interest the Minister to hear what he says.  He says that &ldquo;since Mr. de Valera came into power not one acre of land has been bought in North Clare.&rdquo;  That is a very sorry testimonial, but unfortunately it is too true.  There has been very little land, practically none, bought for distribution in that area.</P>
    <P>If we are to have increased production the only way to secure it is to give a man a piece of land so that he may cultivate it usefully and take an interest in it.  The only way to achieve that is by dividing the ranches and preventing the people with thousands of pounds at their disposal from buying land and leaving the landless men and the uneconomic holders idle on the plains where they were born.</P>

      <P>One would be tempted to get into a discussion with regard to the financing of land in this country and the finances of the Land Commission.  I am one of those who will not be tempted to enter into any discussion of the kind, because I frankly admit that the financing of land division in this country is a complete mystery to me.  Now that the period within which Ashbourne purchasers should have relieved themselves of financial responsibility is running to an end, like many other Deputies I have got a number of queries as to what is the position of these people.  Some of them claim that their financial responsibilities in the way of payment of annuities came to an end in 1939; that they are still receiving demands for annuities and that they are still paying annuities.  It may be that some of these people are not aware of the fact that the decadal deductions extend the period. However, I have asked a number of people, those with a close knowledge <Col N="1736" /> of land purchase and those with a deep knowledge of law, and I cannot find anybody who will give an answer which they say is based on conviction and knowledge.  I hope that at the end of this debate that matter will be dealt with, and dealt with clearly, by the Minister.  I have listened to two Deputies of different Parties, both of them with great knowledge of land and both of them with a knowledge of law, and each of them seemed to be equally puzzled as to what the position is in such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the policy of land division in this country and the necessity for fixing the farmer firmly on his holding, without any uneasiness and without any instability, with the right to go to the bank with the title deeds of his land and raise money up to a percentage of the value of his holding, just the same as a business man, superficially those two policies are in conflict and have been in conflict nearly through the whole period of the life of this State.  When I was a boy, and when the Nationalist Movement in this country was rallied behind the three F's, and, at the same time, the planting of people from the land on the land was part of the national demand, there was no paradox, there was no contradiction.  The lands that the people wanted divided were the huge estates of thousands of acres, and it was the holders of such estates who were regarded as ranchers.  The wheel went round.  The larger estates, so far as it was economic to take them over, were taken over and divided.  Still we have the same cry&mdash;the land for the people and drive out the ranchers.  But the rancher of to-day is not the man with thousands of acres.  In many counties, the man who is pointed out as the rancher and whose land everybody is after is the man with 100 or 150 acres.  If that man's position is to be rendered unstable and insecure&mdash;the successful farmer, the working farmer, the man who is living entirely out of the land and by the land, the man who hopes to leave portion of his land to one son and another portion to another son, hoping that, by hard work and perseverance and economy, they in the course of time will expand these bits <Col N="1737" /> of holdings so as to raise other families on them&mdash;then I think there is no future for agriculture as a whole in this country.</P>
    <P>Now, with this kind of contradictory policies, both in themselves desirable and defensible, I think we have reached the time for a survey of each country, for a firm declaration on an ordnance map as to what lands may be the objective of the Land Commission and what lands will remain immune even from the threat or the fear of land division.  If a farmer makes good in land and, by reason of health or any other reason, wants to retire, he should have the same right to sell his property in a free market as the man who bought stocks and shares or the man who has put his money into a business.  There can be no stability about the whole agricultural life of this country unless some principles of that kind are accepted.  The Land Commission, as such, can only carry out whatever the policy of the Government is, in accordance with legislation passed.  I have found the Land Commission always a most exemplary Department and always most obliging and willing to help.  But I do think the time has come when there has to be some clear declaration as to what is the State policy with regard to land generally.</P>
    <P>With regard to those who get land, I do not agree with other speakers that, because a man has no money, he must get no share in land division. But I do think that no interference should take place with inspectors and commissioners in the division of land. I have met very many inspectors in a great number of counties and I have spoken privately and intimately to them and, in many cases, they have no doubt whatever as to who is the right type of applicant and, if they are left alone, the right type of applicant will get it.  A man should not be ruled out because he has no money.  The man who has worked on the land, who understands farming, who has a love for the land, who has a serious outlook in life, who they know is going to get married and is hoping to build a home, that type of man should be considered. The man who has no land <Col N="1738" /> and who has made a livelihood by renting land from others and has put by a bit of capital, that is the type of man who should come first.  But the fellow from an urban area who may have no association with land is unlikely ever to make good on land.</P>
    <P>I would recommend to the Department of Lands something like the Scottish system.  If you put a penniless man into land, he may be a deserving person; he may be the kind of fellow who will make good, but, if he has not a penny in his pocket, no credit behind him, there should be a linking up between the Land Commission and the Agricultural Credit Corporation so that that man would start with a piece of equipment, with a few sticks of furniture in the house, with perhaps a little foundation stock, even though that has to be costed on to his annuity and will make his annuity a bit higher.  When the first-class labouring man, the ploughman, gets a holding in Scotland, he walks into a holding furnished and equipped.  He must get a farmer to back him in the bank for one year's rent, and a farmer will not do that except the man is of an outstanding type, except he is a labouring man who has pulled to the front.  But that man starts with the necessary implements.  He starts with a house furnished in a meagre way. He is in a position to put the plough into the land and to start being a farmer from the day he turns the key in the door.  When the penniless man takes over, what can he do?  He has no capital to buy implements, equipment, furniture and stock.  He can only set the land until he gets together a bit of capital.  Four or five years of that and he realises that he is getting so much soft money, that he is getting more by letting the land than he has to pay by way of annuity.  He is carrying on his job on the roads or working as a labourer, and he looks on this as an annuity or pension.  There is no incentive to him ever to become a real farmer.  He was spoiled in the lazy years when the policy of the country forced him to set his land.  Any man without money who is going into land should be equipped by the State.</P>
    <P>There are one or two points about <Col N="1739" /> Land Commission activities to which I should like to draw attention.  When a house is built by the Land Commission, a pump is generally sunk, and I doubt very much if there is ever any analysis of the water before the pump is sunk.  After the pump has been sunk, when the water is examined and found to be polluted and the attention of the Land Commission is drawn to it, nothing ever happens.  The people are left to drink the polluted water.  The pump is sunk into a polluted well; the annuitant pays the cost of the pump; and is then left without a pure water supply.  I come up against that in my professional work once a month.  I do not know why the same practice as is operated by a board of health cannot apply, under which the water supply is analysed before the pump is sunk, and, if found to be polluted, the same authority which sinks the pump pumps out the well, treats the water and gives back a pure water supply to the person concerned.</P>
    <P>There is another matter with which one does not like dealing in a public way.  A great number of, if not all, Land Commission houses are built without any sanitary conveniences.  We know that the acres are broad and the hedges are sheltered, but surely, in 1944, we should have progressed beyond that.  One out of every three Land Commission people who take over holdings nowadays go in for dairying, and before they can offer milk for sale for human consumption, their premises are subject to a very strict medical and veterinary investigation. One of the first things they are asked is: where do you get rid of the human excreta?  Is it in one of the stables? Is it where you milk the cows and is that the milk you propose to sell?  The smallest labourer's cottage is built with such conveniences, and I do not think the extra cost of giving modest sanitary conveniences to people going into Land Commission houses should be regarded as prohibitive.</P>
    <P>We all understand that, during this emergency, the Land Commission is in fact a non-functioning Department. When the cat is away, the mice will play, and the Minister is already aware of the fact that, whether it is a syndicate <Col N="1740" /> which is working or whether it is one or two individuals of unlimited wealth, something unnatural is going on with regard to land.  In one of the two counties I represent, four or five huge estates have been bought by one individual, an industrialist, a man who is not going to work the land or live on the land.  I consider that unfair to people in that neighbourhood.  In another county with which.  I am familiar, the same thing is going on, and mansions with the estates that go with them have been purchased by non-nationals who had never any association with the land.  Speculation, unequalled in stock exchange circles, is rampant in Irish lands, under the noses of the people and the Land Commission stands by idle and inactive.</P>
    <P>These lands, after being despoiled of residence and all the rest, are divided up into big parcels and sold to the highest bidder, irrespective of whether that bidder had any association with the land or not.  I suggest to the Minister that if speculators of that kind are to plunge in and the Minister has no power to buy or to compete in the buying, he should at least take powers to see that speculative sub-division of land does not take place during the emergency, and let the person who buys the land in order to sell every article of value on it&mdash;timber, stone, lead piping, glass, doors, and everything else&mdash;hold the baby when the emergency is over.  Something will have to be done by the Government.  If not you are leaning back and provoking the people to do something themselves. That would be a tragedy and it would be a very serious backward step.  The matter is universal enough and grave enough at present to require Government examination and some serious grappling with it.  I do not think it reasonable, in a country where the State is committed to a policy of land division, where people have waited quietly and patiently, knowing that such and such a place will be divided some day, that they should see an emergency come upon them, should see the Land Commission callously inactive and a person from goodness knows where, who merely happens to have immense money or immense credit, <Col N="1741" /> wading in and taking these places from under their noses.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission is one of these great departments which get hidebound in their own regulations and tripped up by their own red tape. There is a working rule of thumb that no land will go to a person outside a certain distance from the divided land. That is all right if you are dividing land in every parish every month, but when you come up against the situation where, perhaps, outstandingly the most deserving claimant in a parish or in a county happens to live in an area where it is never likely that there will be any land division, or at any rate any land division within five miles of it, where that man is making good, and very good, by taking land, and where all his people before him have been in land, surely there should be an exception to such a rule.  Surely, no rule is worth while if there is not an occasional exception to prove the value of the rule; but I find a kind of rigidity that results in injustices, and when you bring up a specific case, everybody admits that an injustice has been done, but you are told: &ldquo;What can we do? The rule is there&rdquo;.  And it is just a matter of putting a compass on a map to show that the man lives outside a specific district, and that, therefore, the rule must be enforced.  Surely, these rules are not designed with a view to doing injustices?  In any kind of Departmental rules and regulations, the power should lie somewhere to make a decision with regard to the waiving of a rule or taking an elastic view of it.</P>
    <P>I am calling these few things to the Minister's notice, because I think it is time that his attention was directed to them.  With regard to the general expression of discontent in connection with land policy in this country, the commission is not responsible for that. We are debating at the moment Acts that were passed ten, 12 or 15 years ago.  It is a case of making the best of the legal powers that exist at the moment, and it is from that point of view and in that spirit that I have been speaking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamFrancisODonne" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Agricultural Ireland seems to me to be divided into two <Col N="1742" /> classes at the moment: the rancher and the &ldquo;chancer&rdquo;.  Anybody owning about 40 Irish acres or over, in the minds of many people, is a rancher, and I suppose we can gauge for ourselves what the &ldquo;chancers&rdquo; are.  The &ldquo;chancers&rdquo; remind me very much of that well-known character, the Vicar of Bray, whose boast it was that whatever monarch might reign, or whatever Party might be in power he would still be Vicar of Bray.  In the same way, no matter what Party may be in power here, you will always have the &ldquo;chancer&rdquo;.  The Vicar of Bray was a clergyman, a Catholic clergyman, in Bray, which is a little place in Lincolnshire, England, and is not to be confused with the place in Ireland of the same name, and when Henry VIII was Defender of the Faith, which was the Holy Roman Catholic Faith, the Vicar preached the doctrines of that Church. I suppose, however, that the strings or bonds with Rome were not tightened up as much in those days as now, and so, when Henry VIII did a <i>volte face</i>, and broke with Rome, the Vicar still remained in his position by now following Lutheran doctrines.  Then, when the eldest daughter of Henry VIII, who was a Catholic, succeeded Henry, the Vicar reverted to Catholic teachings again, and when another daughter of Henry succeeded the eldest daughter, the Vicar followed her in her Protestantism.  So it is with the &ldquo;chancers&rdquo;.  Whatever Party is in power they will follow that Party, and so long as the Land Commission or the Government continue in their present policy you will always have Vicars of Bray and &ldquo;chancers&rdquo;.  I might even have a little bit of a grievance myself if I were to see my little place of about 20 Irish acres surrounded by &ldquo;chancers&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a good deal to be considered in regard to the apportioning of these lands.  I am connected with the land, and at least three generations before me have been connected with it.  I know Irish history and the history of the land struggle here, as I heard it at the firesides in the country and as I learned it in the National Library in Dublin during a residence here of more than 20 years.  I know the problem that exists, but this matter of the <Col N="1743" /> division of land seems to me to be a very peculiar thing.  Suppose that an estate is to be divided, and you have 100 claimants for pieces of land on that estate: how are you going to divide it fairly among these claimants? How do you pick them out?  I can understand the man who took part in the late campaign being given a preference in the division of land.  These people got grants of land, and justly so, but now the next thing you have is that if you are a speaker of Irish you will get the preference.  I do not know Irish, beyond some such phrase as &ldquo;Cad tá tú a rá&rdquo;, which I picked up, because I did not get a chance of learning the language, but why should preference be given to these people, just because they know Irish?  I think that there should be some other test of merit when it comes to apportioning land.  Why should a man get a grant of land for any other reason than that of pounds, shillings and pence?  Is he going to be subsidised by the State? We know that you are taking a lot of land off the planters.  There might be a good reason for that, and yet is there?  But how do you pick 20 men out of 100, leaving, as you are bound to do, the other 80 with a grievance. I suggest that the proper way and the only way to find out the value of land is, when you take it over, to put it up for resale by public auction.  If a farmer's son, or even a tradesman with land traditions, who has gone, say, to America, and made a bit of money, returns to this country and wants to get 10 or 20 acres of land, he will not get it, and I hold that 20 applicants out of 100 should not be privileged to get the land, because it only means that you are creating 80 malcontents, and such a procedure is not based on either justice or honesty.  I do not want to indulge in destructive criticism, but I do suggest that there should be equal honesty and justice for all when it comes to the distribution of these lands.  I am pointing out that, whatever Party is in power you will always have the &ldquo;chancers&rdquo; and, like the Vicar of Bray, it will be a case of: &ldquo;Whatsoever King may reign, I shall be Vicar of Bray.&rdquo;  Whether a Labour Party <Col N="1744" /> or a Fine Gael Party, or any other Party comes into power, you will still have the &ldquo;chancers&rdquo; and you will still have equity and justice not being properly observed in the distribution of land.</P>
    <P>Now, I was very glad when I saw this proposal of restricting speeches to 20 or 30 minutes being introduced, and I hope that the rule is being observed, as it will be a check on some of the windbags here.  I am still behind the clock, and the few more words that I have to say will finish me.  I believe in the advice of an old priest in Maynooth who said: &ldquo;If your sermon is not prepared, do not speak for 15 minutes, and if it is prepared do not speak for more than a quarter of an hour.&rdquo;  The question of water supply is a very important one in connection with this matter of land division. I think that you may have heard me twice before speaking on this matter, and at the risk of appearing to join the ranks of the windbags, I am referring to it again.  At a meeting of the county council in Clonmel last June I proposed a little resolution which was what we would call in county council circles a snowball resolution, the effect of which was that a national survey of the water supply situation should be undertaken with a view to putting a proper water supply into every house in rural Ireland.  I have very kindly feelings towards Deputy O'Higgins because of those three F's which have been referred to. I remember when the Land Act was passed.  That is a long time ago, and I remember the three phrases: fixity of tenure, fair rent, and free sale, which gave rise to the phrase, the three F's.  That clause in the Act was known as the Healy clause, and Gladstone congratulated Healy on what he called the three F's, because of the alliteration. It was a beautiful phrase and was described as the Magna Charta of the Irish farmer, and I felt great pride in listening to Deputy O'Higgins to-day, a nephew of Tim Healy, when he spoke in connection with this business of a water supply.</P>

      <P>I suggest that it is of the greatest importance at the moment, in this matter of the division of land, to see that when houses are built on these lands a pump should be sunk in connection with every one of them.  That is the point I am coming at.  The sinking of a proper, modern pump in every farmyard is of the greatest importance.  I am not referring to the kind of pumps which were relics of hydraulic inefficiency and inconvenience, as depicted by Brinsley McNamara in <i>The Valley of the Squinting Windows.</i>  Such pumps are out of date and unhealthy, and they certainly should never be passed by any board of public health.  Around my part of the country, where we have the Suir flowing through&mdash;it flows through the town&mdash;you can see barrels used for holding the water, and pools also being used for drinking water.</P>

      <P>I am suggesting that in this country we should see that proper and modern pumps are sunk, as has been done in Canada, Australia and New Zealand, because the only way of getting a supply of clean and pure water is by installing the best kind of pump that can be sunk. Deputy O'Higgins was quite right in saying that in many cases the cattle are allowed to drink out of these old pools, and you have cases of the water being contaminated by the droppings or excreta of the cattle.  I suggest that, next to housing, the most important thing is the sinking of modern pumps. Our county council adopted the resolution, and since we will shortly have the matter of arterial drainage coming along, I suggest that the two things should go hand in hand, because the provision of a proper water supply is of the very greatest importance and, therefore, I think that, when we come to deal with these matters, the question of the sinking of a pump in every farmyard should be included.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>A great deal of the <Col N="1746" /> debate has been taken up with the consideration of two particular matters, namely, the division of land and fixity of tenure of the owners.  On the face of it, it is rather difficult to reconcile the two things but I believe it can be done.  I have been as ardent a fighter for the rights of the farmer to fixity of tenure as, I believe, any Deputy in this House.  For 17 years, since I entered this House, I have been fighting for that right.  When the 1933 Land Act was introduced, I strenuously fought for that particular principle and I referred to the Bill as an eviction cum plunder Bill because, in my opinion, it interfered with the rights of the tenant farmer to own his land.  It did away, as I said then, with the results of the fight of generations for the three F's, to which Dr. O'Higgins and the last speaker referred, and it substituted three other F's&mdash;the power of the Land Commission to fleece, filch, and forfeit.</P>
      <P>That was the result of that Act.  I believe I have turned out a true prophet, judging by the results of the last 11 years.  Nobody knows better than the Minister for Lands what has taken place in the last five or six years and what is taking place now. The Minister sees every day a desire on the part of some of the allottees to sell their lands, to cash in on the generosity of this State, to cash in at figures that would seem impossible.  I know of a case where an allottee has applied to the Land Commission to sell a farm for which he is getting £3,000. I do not know whether he has got permission or not.  I know the figure the original owner of that land got, but I wish the House knew it.  I do not want to mention where it is, but it is a case in point.  I believe that until we have fixed the farmer on his land with the right to own it we will never have settled conditions in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made a moment ago to the provision of capital for the new tenants.  I agree with that principle, but I want to provide capital for the old tenants, and until there is some certainty of his ownership, he is denied <Col N="1747" /> that capital.  There was a bank director listening to the debate up to recently, and I wish he were here now. I know of no bank in any county that would lend any individual farmer in this State 10d. on the security of his land alone.  If any Deputy knows a bank manager more generous than those I know, I hope he will tell me about him and I will be with him to-morrow or the day after.  I know no bank manager who would lend as much as would jingle on a tombstone on the security of land alone, because the farmer has no title to his land, and the bank knows it.  The land is not his. It may be taken from him to-morrow or the next day, and then the banks could whistle for the money owed to them.  Until that is remedied, there can be no settled conditions of agriculture in this country.  How is it going to be remedied while at the same time preserving the right to the Land Commission to divide lands?</P>
    <P>It might be argued that anybody who speaks for the rights of the farmer to own his land is opposed to land division. I am not, definitely.  I say we must have fixity of tenure, with certain limitations, if you like, and the limitations must be (1) that no farmer with an average holding, up to 200 acres of land, will have his land taken from him except in very exceptional circumstances, and if in exceptional circumstances the State thinks it right to resume or to take that land the farmer must get the full market value for it.  He has not been getting it. He must get such a sum that, if he wishes, he can go into the market in some other county or the same county and buy another farm.  That is the first condition.  The second condition is that no farmer, big or small, will be relieved of his land as long as he is farming it under proper conditions, providing all that any Government could expect in the way of food and other things for the people and employing sufficient labour.  With those two provisos, I think we should leave every farmer in this country settled on his land.</P>
    <P>I believe the State should approach the question of land division as they approach every other question.  If <Col N="1748" /> they are to give the full value of the land, it is difficult to give it to the incoming tenant at a fair rent.  The State in regard to land division&mdash;I am repeating what I said on a number of occasions&mdash;must proceed in the same way as they do in connection with any other social service.  If they want to benefit one section of the community they should not do it at the expense of another.  It must be done at the expense of the State.  If there is any loss involved in the purchase of land from one farmer and the distribution of it to another, that loss must be borne by the State, let it be great or small, and there should not be a loss to the unfortunate individual owner.</P>
    <P>Having come to divide the land, and having paid dearly for it&mdash;because I hope the Government in future will pay a sufficient price to the owner&mdash; and recognising that the State must lose a good deal in the division, care must be taken that it is given to the proper people.  That has not been done in the past.  I am not blaming this Government alone.  The previous Government were as bad in that respect. Land was given to people who should never have got it, who never made proper use of it and would not make proper use of it if they were there until they were as old as Methuselah.  The present Minister for Lands, who, I believe, is anxious to do the right thing and is going to make the allottees do the right thing, is not responsible for that.</P>
    <P>The question of the vesting of land was referred to.  Let the land be vested properly in the owner.  Let the land be vested in the new owner also, but not for a period.  I suggest that land should be given to people in much the same way as it is given in other countries.  I was an allottee of land. I got free land in another country&mdash; Canada&mdash;30 or 40 years ago, but I got it on conditions.  I was presented with 160 acres of land, and the Government said: &ldquo;If you do such and such, in three or four years we will give you a title to it, but if you do not fulfil these conditions you will not get the land.&rdquo; Half the people who got the land never got a title to it, because they did not fulfil the conditions.  If any State <Col N="1749" /> wishes to be generous to individuals and to encourage them to work the land, and if the State spends money on such a scheme, it has a right to say: &ldquo;Do such and such a thing and then we will give you title.&rdquo;  I believe that is the way in which we ought to proceed. I believe the Government should say: &ldquo;We will give you 20 acres or 30 or 40 acres&rdquo;&mdash;I hope not less than 20&mdash;&ldquo;but we will enforce conditions&mdash;you will have to do such and such before you get title.&rdquo;  A period of four or five years might be fixed within which the tenant should fulfil the conditions laid down.  Then, on the fulfilment of these conditions, the State could give him a title and vest the holding in him.  Of course, conditions might arise in later years in which that man might no longer be able to engage in farming. He then should have the same right to dispose of his holding as any other farmer, and the Land Commission could see, if necessary, that the incoming tenant also made proper use of the holding.</P>
    <P>In regard to land division generally, I think that the proper type of men have not been selected as tenants.  I know many men who worked hard in the United States, and, having accumulated £300 or £400, came back here with the Irish instinct to own land, but they never got a sod.  Such men may get land now under the new Minister, because he looks at things in their proper perspective; but they did not get it under former Ministers, even when my own Party was in power. Whenever I tried to put forward the claims of such men, men with a small capital of say £300, who could make good use of land, I found that the Land Commission attitude was &ldquo;Oh, that man can afford to buy land.&rdquo; Well, everybody knows the amount of land you can get for £300.  I suggest that that is the type of men who should get the land, men who could make proper use of it.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins referred to a few matters with which I should also like to deal.  One was the case of annuities on lands purchased under old Land Acts&mdash;the Ashbourne Act and others. There is a doubt in the minds of many of these tenant purchasers as to when <Col N="1750" /> their annuities will cease.  I was talking to a man only within the last four days who wanted to know how he stood in this regard.  He purchased under the Ashbourne Act and, as far as he knows, his annuities should have ceased or should soon cease.  He never availed of the decadal reductions, but he believes that the 49 years should have now drawn to a close.  He has written to the Land Commission several times on the matter, but he has never been informed when he will be free from the obligation of paying annuities.  That is a position that should be rectified, and I hope the Minister will be able to tell us that at some time these annuities will terminate and that he will be able to say when that time will be.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I wish to draw attention, I have often referred to before.  Deputy Cogan referred to it this evening.  That is the question of the erection of fences in connection with the division of land.  In the last ten or 12 years, both in connection with the Land Commission Vote and the Vote for the Local Government Department, I have frequently referred to this matter.  I always call these fences &ldquo;governmental fences&rdquo;, whether they are put up in connection with land division or around the half acre allotted by the Local Government Department in connection with cottage schemes.  The fences that are put up are ridiculous.  They consist of a narrow bank about four feet wide at the bottom, tapering to a width of about four inches at the top.  In 99 cases out of 100 the fences crumble before six months, and there might as well be no fence there at all.  I suggest that whatever is done with regard to internal fences, boundary fences should be of such a character as to be permanent.  There is no use in putting up fences that will crumble when the neighbour's cow looks at them, because one can almost say that that is what happens.  The cow has only to rub her side against the bank and it disappears. That is not the type of fence that should be built as a boundary. The ordinary farmer who has to erect fences around a tillage plot would not be satisfied with such fences.  I again suggest to the Minister that a little <Col N="1751" /> extra money expended on this work at the start would serve a useful purpose and would obviate many disputes between tenants.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to the system of land tenure in other countries &mdash;the Scottish system and the Danish system.  I hope we are not going to follow systems which obtain in other countries&mdash;whether of individual ownership or of Governmental ownership. The system of letting land from year to year on the lowest term gives a man no guarantee that he will be allowed to retain his holding.  We tried that system in this country; we had it here and the people rebelled against it, defeated it and broke it. As I said at the start, the tenant farmers fought for and won the right of free sale, fixity of tenure and fair rent.  They won that through our predecessors, men who had an interest in this country and surely we are not going to abolish what they fought for and won?  I hope this Government or some Government will settle that question finally and give the farmer once and for all the fruits of what generations fought for so nobly and won.  I hope that the Minister will look into the question of annuities and the question of fences to which I have referred and that, when the next debate on this Vote takes place, we shall have some better declaration of future policy in regard to land division.  I hope the Minister will indicate that it is intended to give land only to such people as the Government feels will use it properly, that a preference will be given to men with some capital, so long as they are not millionaires&mdash;the sons of farmers, workers and landless men who have proved by taking conacre and grazing that they can make proper use of land.  These are the type of people we want to attract to land and settle there if possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>A statement was made in this House during this debate that we robbed the British, so to speak, in taking the annuities away from them.  I think that speeches such as that tend to go back to the past rather than to look forward to the <Col N="1752" /> future.  As a matter of fact, the same Deputy who said that this was robbery said that what is happening in this country is that we are paying £100 an acre for land and giving it to people at £50 an acre and that this country could not exist if that continued. His idea apparently was that the annuities should again be doubled to get back this £100 per acre. So far as we people on the land are concerned, I want to make our attitude very clear.  We believe that the land annuities should be wiped out entirely. We believe that they are only a hindrance and that we, who had to carry on the fight in the economic war, won these concessions.  We were the people who had to suffer and in many cases we were victimised.  That struggle cost us a certain amount of money but we won it and we think it unfair that our own Government should hold half of what we won in that fight.</P>
      <P>Part of Deputy Giles' speech might be summed up in this way: &ldquo;Come on ye people from Connaught to the wide plains of Meath; you are welcome there,&rdquo; but he wound up his speech more or less by saying that it was a mistake to send people from the West there at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite right.  He made one rather serious statement when he said that certain promises were made by the Land Commission to these people, promises of a certain amount of stock, and that these promises were not fulfilled.  Many of these come from my area.  Some of them are friends of my own as a matter of fact, and if the promises were not kept it was not the fault of the present Minister because he was not in office then.  I think it was rather due to a mistake in the Civil Service.  I have a list of what they were promised&mdash;of course it was prepared by a civil servant. Here it is: a horse, a cow, two yearlings, ten hens and ten cocks.  The civil servant who drew up that list had, apparently, a terribly high sense of morality, but when it came back to the Department, naturally enough older heads wiped out nine of the cocks. That was the only change and I do <Col N="1753" /> not think there is any great complaint about it.  The only thing that was withdrawn from the list in the first agreement were the nine cocks.</P>
      <P>To turn to more serious matters, it is all right talking about taking over land in Meath but it should be done. Where a man has a large farm and is not using it to the advantage of the country, it should be taken over.  But there is land to be taken over in the West of Ireland as well as in County Meath.  It is not long since I put a question to the Minister in connection with an estate in County Galway.  The Land Commission took over 700 acres of the Ashtown estate.  They have turned around and handed 500 acres of that estate to the Forestry Department. I asked the Minister then if he was aware that this was arable land, that it grew crops last year, and he told me that that was not the case. That land was wired in for forestry although there were many applications from landless men and uneconomic holders for it.  Not later than last Sunday I was in that area and I saw that land.  Forty acres of it, which definitely grew oats and wheat last year, are now fenced in for forestry purposes and taken from the people who wanted it for tillage.  I defy contradiction by the Department or anybody in this House of that statement, and Deputy Beegan will bear out what I have said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear a good deal about the question of fair price.  I agree that a man should get a fair price for his land when it is taken over by the Land Commission.  But there are other things to be considered.  I have worn holes in my boots going across to the Land Commission about a certain farm which was supposed to be acquired outside Tuam.  Notice was served on the owner.  By some underhand arrangements, he sold this farm of 60 acres of bad land&mdash;bad because he was not able to look after it.  He obtained £800 for it.  Although notice was served on him that it was to be acquired, he got twice what the piece of land was worth.  The Land Commission have consented to the buyer being the tenant but they have told me that they will acquire it no matter who is the owner.  If they do not pay £800 for it, they will be <Col N="1754" /> told that they are not paying a fair price.  I believe that arrangements were made and that that price was put on it so that, when the Land Commission would take it over, they would have to pay twice the price of the land. In parts of the West of Ireland&mdash;the Minister need not go as far as Meath at all&mdash;there is a great deal to be desired as regards land division.  I expect much from the new Minister.  I know he is a most energetic man.  I want to tell him that 20 and 22-acre farms are too small.  I believe that we must go to from 30 to 40 acres to enable a man to exist.  Of course, Deputy Giles tells us, more or less, that people from the West are not suited for land at all.  He says that their children live by going over and back to England, by fishing and that sort of thing.  That is what I gathered from Deputy Giles' speech.  For years, that was the case but we are looking forward to better conditions and we trust that that will not be necessary while there is land the owners of which are not using it advantageously.  To go back to the Ashtown estate, there is a rumour, which may be either right or wrong, that Lady Ashtown went to the Department and got a guarantee that, instead of dividing this arable land amongst landless men and uneconomic holders, it would be planted. If such a guarantee was given, it was such as the British would give in days gone by to prevent our people getting a living.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of rather strange statements were made on this Vote.  We had Deputy's Dillon's statement demanding that 50 per cent. be put back again on the farmers.  Only a few years ago Deputy Dillon came in as sub-leader to the Parnell of 1932, to look after the farmers, and apparently the manner in which he is looking after them now is to demand that their annuities be increased by 50 per cent., and that we get back into the old rut.  He has fallen so much in love with John Bull that he wants to hand him back the annuities again, according to his statement.  Deputy Bennett talked about fixity of tenure.  Anything taken from fixity of tenure was taken by the Act of 1923, and I should <Col N="1755" /> like to see anybody endeavouring to take land off the farmers.  That is about the most ridiculous statement I heard.  Then, the Deputy went on to ask that one set of farmers be made permanent in their holdings while the farmer who gets land from the Land Commission is to have no permanency and is not to have any claim or right. These are rather ridiculous statements. I cannot agree with the statement of my friend, Deputy Donnellan, about the land annuities being completely wiped out.  When the question of the division of the money, rightly held here by the Irish people, was approached under the Act of 1933, we had to remember one thing: We could wipe out the annuities completely in the case of the farmers who purchased their land prior to 1923, but if we were to do that there would be no more taking over of land.  The farmers who came under the 1923, 1927 and subsequent Acts would have to pay their full annuities, because their payments were not involved in the struggle.  The annuities withheld from Britain were the annuities due before 1923.  No annuities arising under any Act of the Oireachtas were involved.</P>
      <P>There was the choice of wiping out annuities in the case of men who purchased prior to the Act of 1923, and to let unfortunate people be held down by landlords until compulsory power was given by the Dáil to take over their land.  These people would get no relief and would be compelled to pay the full annuities.  The 50 per cent. being paid by those who purchased under the old Act goes towards half the annuities of these people as well as paying for land taken over for division. I must agree with Deputy Donnellan in some of the things he said.  I do not believe 22 acres of land is an economic holding.  Any man who gets 22 acres from the Land Commission, if he is going to remain on the land, must go out and work for his neighbours. He could not make a livelihood on a holding of that size.  There is no good in pretending that he could.  It is as well for a man to be a beggar in Galway as to be a beggar in Meath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1756" /> Dealing with the taking over of estates, it is many years since I raised the question of taking over the Flower estate in County Cork.  It consists of some 420 acres and is held by an absentee tenant who lives in Birmingham. The Land Commission took over 40 acres.  They did not notify any of the people who were demanding a division of this estate, but held a kind of court in Cork to which nobody but the solicitor for the owner was admitted. The following week an advertisement appeared in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> stating that 380 acres of the rich land of Cloyne were to be let on the 11 months' system.  It has been let on that system ever since.  There are applications for land from all parts of the country.  There were 380 acres there held by an absentee, and after an inquiry, as they would put it in the Land Commission, they came back from their tour and decided to take 40 acres. Even the tillage portion is being let still.  Until compulsory powers were brought in ordering the growing of ten per cent. under wheat the tillage on that estate was let under a regulation which prescribed that no wheat was to be grown.  That regulation was made by the man living in Birmingham.  The parishes of Cloyne and Aghadoo were planted.  The smallest holdings in these combined parishes would contain about 250 acres.  The planters are still there and are quite happy.  When the attention of the Land Commission was drawn to the position an inspector went down and the result was that 40 acres were taken.  If the Department took the trouble to get the daily newspapers for three months, and if they looked up the lettings of land, both for tillage and grazing in that area, it would be realised that there is plenty of land there to be taken over and divided amongst the people whose ancestors were driven from it.  Apparently, the Land Commission are not prepared to do that.</P>
    <P>I believe that there is no use in dividing up land into 20 or 22-acre farms.  I consider that to be waste of money.  No man could rear a family on a holding of that size.  It means he becomes an agricultural labourer who has to seek work <Col N="1757" /> in competition with ordinary labourers in the neighbourhood.  It is a wrong policy to create uneconomic holdings.  I inspected holdings in Meath, and if I were in charge of the Land Commission at the time estates were being divided, those responsible would not hold their positions very long.  I saw 2,000 acres divided up on the Gibbstown estate.  It consisted of a castle, 50 box stalls for horses, 120 stalls for cows, hay barns and other buildings.  The Land Commission carved the estate up, but left only 196 acres of land with the house.  I looked over the 196 acres and considered that only about three acres were fit to stick a plough in.  The castle and 196 acres were left there, but 50 yards away the Land Commission built cottages that cost £300 or £400 each for new allottees.  If the intention was to leave a decent holding in which a farmer could be established, and on which he could keep a bull, and other machinery for the convenience of small allottees, the place should have been divided fairly and the money spent on buildings saved.  The Minister laughed when I mentioned keeping a bull there.</P>

      <P>What farmer could keep a bull on a holding of 20 acres?  My opinion of what occurred there was that it was a scandal.  I think when the big estates of that description are being divided, and where the land that is being allotted is definitely insufficient for the allottee to have a livelihood for himself, his wife and his family without having to go outside, the least you would expect would be that the Land Commission would leave some fairly big holding where these men could get employment, and where such things as a reaper, binder and mowing machine would be for loan to the smallholder.  There is nothing of that description.  I saw the manner in which these things were done, because I took another trip down there to have a look at them and see how they were getting on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am more than anxious to see unfortunate men who are living in the bogs and on the mountains taken and put into decent land, wherever it can be found for them.  I went down to <Col N="1758" /> see how they got on.  I would like to hear from the Meath Deputies how many of these men are making a success on the 20 acres, or is it going back to the old system under which the fellow that was put out gets it back for grazing?  That is a thing I do not know.  I think in that respect the Department will want to inquire into it.  I hope it will make further investigation in my constituency into the holdings that are left there without being tilled, on which there is neither tillage nor grazing, which are held year after year by purely absentee tenants. I would like to have the Minister look up the file of the Flower estate and see what reason the Land Commission were able to give for not acquiring the whole of that estate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephMeighan" hpid="Mr. Meighan Mr. Meighan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meighan</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me rather amusing to hear some of the Deputies asking the Government to increase by a certain amount the acreage given to new allottees, in order to make them more economic than they usually would be.  I gather from Deputies Donnellan and Corry that nothing less than from 30 to 40 acres is sufficient.  I agree with them.  I have known the Congested Districts Board in my own area to give ten acres of land to people that were taken from the West of Ireland from congested areas and from places in Roscommon.  They were absolutely unable to live on that land exclusively, that is, if they had a family.  They lived on it and made well on it, but it was by the women doing the work in the fields and the men going out on the roads or going across to England.  The amusing thing is to be asking the Government to do these things in view of the instance I have here.  I am going to quote a case now. It is in Mayo, and the representative of the owner was his sister.  The son of the family happens to be in America.  I am informed that the valuation of the holding was only 5/-, and in 1925 there was an addition made to it of three acres.  The family circumstances, due to a number of deaths in the family, became pretty acute, with the result that the young man that had intended to settle down found himself in difficulties and emigrated to America.  I am also informed <Col N="1759" /> that he is now in the American Army and is unable to return.  Notwithstanding that, the Land Commission has served notice on him and on his sister to give up this three acres that they gave in 1925, leaving the old place with a valuation of 5/- for this young man to come back to and settle down.  I approached the Land Commission on the matter, and I was informed that if I could satisfy them that he intended to come back they would stay their hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I went home and consulted with the representative and she has satisfied me that he has the intention of coming back and produced a letter.  It was dated back some time.  I assured the Land Commission, as I assure the Minister and the House, that if I did not really believe that he intended to come back I would have nothing to do with the case.  However, the representative had an affidavit sworn and produced a letter from her brother in America saying that he did intend to come back.  Evidently it is impossible for him to come back at the present time.  The case was put that the land was not being used properly, but I have been assured by the sister that she was quite prepared to give the land for tillage to any people in the area until her brother would return. I also pointed out to the Land Commission that possession of the land was not to be taken until the 1st August and asked what would be done about the tillage.  They could give me no information but that the possession would be taken on the 1st August.  If they were anxious to comply with the tillage regulations one would fancy that they would take it over so that the tillage regulations could be complied with.  However, the sister has made arrangements and the whole little lot has been let and cultivated, I think, in oats.  Well, as I have said, I would be very slow to take up the case if I thought there was no intention of the young man coming home.  I think it is a great hardship and a bad proceeding for the Government to take from a little farm which they have made economic the land that they gave to them and to leave it uneconomic.  The Minister will understand <Col N="1760" /> that I said I am informed that the valuation of the old place is 5/-.  I appeal to the Minister even at this late hour to use a little clemency in the matter.  I am sure that he is aware, as most people are, that little holdings like this have great sentimental value for the family.  For these reasons and other reasons I think it is a very great hardship for the Land Commission to insist on proceeding as they intend to do.  With regard to the division of estates, I can understand the fact that a large number of the staff of the Land Commission has been transferred and their duties in the way of land division must be curtailed.  At the same time I have complaints to make to this effect, that I think that the division of land is not taking place in order.</P>
    <P>In view of the great outcry there is for the production of food and the representations that have been made to me by farmers around Castlerea, I am satisfied that the division of the Castlerea estate or the lands around there would be of great help.  I am informed that the Land Commission found it hard to let some of this land because its fertility has been so reduced, and that the tillage carried out on it by the Land Commission was not very profitable.  I think that even at the cost of a little sacrifice the Minister would be well advised to hurry up the division of this land.</P>
    <P>There is also an outcry for land in the Knockcroghery area where the people are noted for the excellent way in which they cultivate their land as well as for their anxiety to produce all kinds of food including wheat, barley, oats and potatoes.  All the Deputies for the county have been requested to urge that the division of land there should be speeded up.  Some Deputy said that if big farmers are not able to fence their land it should be taken from them.  Deputies are aware of how difficult it is to fence land at present since it is practically impossible to get wire, and in many parts of the country there is no substitute for wire.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied from personal experience, in regard to the bogs that have been divided by the Land Commission, that parcelling them out in statute acre <Col N="1761" /> plots does not produce the best results. You may find one man who will cut a bank at the wrong spot where there is no outlet for the water.  He will cut there, and you may find ten other people who will not.  In one or two years' time you may have ten, 12 or 14 people held up in their effort to cut turf and all because of the default of this one man.  If the Land Commission took over the bogs themselves and set them at a yearly rent they would be able to ensure that a man who rented a bog would start to cut it where there was a proper outlet for the water.  People should get notice to the effect that if they did not comply with the rules and regulations of the Land Commission they would not get turf banks.  I say that because of what has come under my personal observation.</P>
    <P>I think that if my suggestion were adopted, it would be the better way of handling these turf banks.  I know bogs that were divided by the Land Commission nine or ten years ago, and I am certain that 50 per cent. of the people who would desire to cut turf on them find it impossible to do so for the reasons that I have mentioned.  I am also aware that, while they are paying a little rent for turbary to the Land Commission, they are also taking banks which are being let by private individuals.  The trouble there is that since the emergency when coal got scarce, there has been a great demand for turf banks.  We find that people who had already got allotments are not cutting turf on them but are taking banks from private owners, thereby depriving people who have no turbary rights of being able to cut a supply of turf for themselves.  If the suggestion which I have made were adopted I think it would help to remedy that situation.</P>
    <P>The bog roads made nine or ten years ago are very much neglected.  No repairs have been carried out on them so that people find it hard, except during a very dry season, to get out the turf.  Last season the people were so busily engaged in saving the harvest that at the end of it, when the weather broke, they were not able to get out the turf so that most of it remained <Col N="1762" /> on the bogs.  That was a loss not only to the individuals concerned but to the nation in general.</P>
    <P>The grants given for the repair of these bog roads may not be the concern of the Minister, but perhaps I may be allowed to make a short reference to them.  Unless there is a certain number of unemployed in an area, the grants are not given.  I have known that to happen in my area.  The result is that the grants were lost although these bog roads were very badly in need of repair.  If it is within the Minister's sphere, I would ask him to be sympathetic in trying to have these roads attended to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Sir John Esmonde Sir John Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refer to a certain class of tenant purchasers who have already been mentioned by several speakers.  A considerable amount of anxiety exists in their minds as to what exactly their position is under the present administration of the Land Acts by the Land Commission.  Before I come to the actual point in question, it may be well to point out to the Minister&mdash;I am sure he is aware of it&mdash;that he is administering a code dealing roughly with three different sets of purchasers under the various Land Acts.  He is administering the code as one code when perhaps it should be administered as three distinct codes, all being part of a large general code.  The first class of purchasers are those who had entered into arrangements with their landlords and had taken advantage of the land purchase facilities that existed prior to the passing of the Land Act of 1923.  This is the class with which I am particularly concerned. The second class is composed of those who were generally brought in under the 1923 Act, tenants already in occupation of their holdings, but who for one reason or another were not tenant purchasers.  The third class is composed of those who came into being under the various Land Acts and includes landless men, persons holding under fee farm grants and long leases, to whom the original code was never applicable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as these three different <Col N="1763" /> classes are concerned, of course the earliest, from the point of view of time and date, are those owners with whom I am concerned at the moment, those who were actually tenant purchasers at the time of the passing of the 1923 Land Act.  I think there were roughly about seven or eight or perhaps more Acts of Parliament which granted them facilities to purchase. I do not want to enter into any controversy about the land annuities or the halving of them, but the case which these tenant purchasers make is that, as a result of whatever legislation exists at the moment and of whatever administration is being carried out, their situation is likely to be very seriously jeopardised.</P>
    <P>I am not in the position to work out the calculation of what the position would be.  Some of them feel that, previously, there was a fund&mdash;not a Government fund&mdash;into which their annuities were payable from time to time, and, as a result of the original bargain which they made&mdash; there was no question of compulsion in it&mdash;after a certain length of time the debt would be eventually paid off and they would become the owners in fee simple of the holdings which, generation after generation, their families had worked and improved.  Their fear is that, because they are now brought into the general scope of the system of collection at present in operation, and because of certain sections in the Land Act of 1933, which have been referred to as those which abolished fixity of tenure, they will be overpaying the amount they originally contracted to pay.  I am not able to furnish the Minister with the figures and mechanical details, but I am sure he will appreciate the point.</P>
    <P>These people fear that, as a result of the administration of the code, in this way they will suffer.  They are people who, I suggest, should receive the most favourable treatment, as the original beneficiaries under the code. Some of them put it that the annuity which they are paying at present was never intended to be paid into the <Col N="1764" /> State, but was to go into the fund which provided the capital sum.  By paying it into that fund, they believe that they have now repaid the original advance.  The Minister would be doing a great deal of good if he would make an authoritative statement on the subject, in order to make these people realise&mdash;if it is a fact&mdash;that they are in no way prejudiced by the present administration of the code, and that they will come out of it at the proper time, having kept their bargain, without any additional burden placed on them as a result of the Act of 1933.</P>
    <P>The Minister will realise that those people who went through the land agitation two generations ago voluntarily agreed to pay a certain figure, and undertook to pay that figure by annual instalments, on the basis that they would have discharged their complete liability in a certain period.  They would have a distinct grievance against our native Government if, having entered into a bargain with representatives of another Government, and being prepared to carry out that bargain, they should find that, as a result of something our Government has done, they were now placed in a worse position. I think that is the last thing the Minister would wish to happen.</P>
    <P>The purchasers go back many years to the original Land Purchase Act and, from time to time, these people must be coming to the end of their particular payment periods, so the matter will be becoming of more importance from day to day.  It has been mentioned here by various speakers and a considerable amount of confusion of thought exists in many people's minds regarding it.  I would like to be frank with the Minister and tell him that I, personally, have looked into the matter and cannot make out exactly what the position is, except that there seems to be a case that, under the working of the code at present, these people are likely to suffer grave financial disadvantage.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, if this is a new point to the Minister, with which he is not ready to deal now in the authoritative way I would like him to deal with it&mdash;and I am sure he, as Minister for Lands, would wish to deal with it in that way <Col N="1765" />&mdash;he could make some statement later on the subject, explaining the exact position of these people.  That would allay a considerable amount of public anxiety as regards this matter.</P>
    <P>The question of the size of small holdings has been discussed here.  That concerns a new class of allottees, who are being given holdings, for which public money is being made available. I mentioned in the debate on agriculture that, where public money is being advanced for the provision of farm holdings for deserving members of the community&mdash;a system with which I am in thorough agreement&mdash;one of the principles which should underlie the operations of the Department is, besides ensuring that the person is suitable, to ensure that the size of the farm will be such as to provide the greatest benefit to the State, which is bearing the cost of providing the money to enable these people to receive and work the land.  The question of the most suitable size of a small holding is extremely important, under the circumstances.  This is a matter which I should like the Minister to look into.</P>
    <P>I have previously expressed my views during the debate on the cost of living and the agricultural position.  I have come to the conclusion that the most suitable type of farmer is the man who gets most out of the land, who makes a profit and who wins for the community some extra food.  I confess I am not one of those, as I do not get as much out of it as a smallholder does; but I think the small holding, adapted to be worked by the ordinary family&mdash;that is to say, by the farmer himself and, perhaps, one member of his family&mdash;will give the best advantage to the community.  The Land Commission can decide the most suitable size of holding according to that principle.  I know there are two lines of thought on that point.  Someone has mentioned the Land Commission's figure as 25 statute acres.  There will be disagreement on that point but, if the particular beneficiary is given suitable equipment and suitable credit, on a holding of 25 acres of really workable land, I think that is the proper economic basis to start on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1766" /> The matter is more important than people generally realise.  There are many more persons who have to be suited with land, as the agricultural labourer is gradually going out of existence as such.  He is turning into an owner of the soil and a small capitalist in his own way.  The difficulty exists of reconciling farmers' costings and profits, but they are generally recognised as providing only a poor living wage at the moment.  We certainly cannot go back again, even when prices go back, with the result that a large body of people who are at present employed on farms must, in order to solve our future economic problem, in turn become owners of farms themselves.  There is only a certain amount of land to go around and, if I had a say in the matter, I would come down on the side of the small holding.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any violent criticism to be directed at the Minister with regard to the administration of his Department.  We all realise he is working under considerable difficulties. It is well known to anybody who has anything to do with the Land Commission that his staff is robbed to man other branches during the emergency and the Minister is doing his best under the circumstances.  I would be glad if he takes note of the points I have mentioned and deal with the classes of persons to whom I have referred, persons who are increasing in number from day to day.  If he is not in a position to deal with that matter to-day, perhaps he will do so in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to a Parliamentary Question some time ago, the Minister for Lands informed me that the Land Commission had on hands in the County Mayo, undivided, approximately 12,000 acres, of which 6,000 acres are arable.  I should like him to explain why the Land Commission has some of these lands on hands since 1915. In one instance to which I drew the attention of his Department, there are three holdings in the townland of Kennewry and the tenants were migrated as far back as 1915.  It seems very queer that the Land Commission has kept these holdings on hand and <Col N="1767" /> has not done something with them; surely they could have found some scheme in which they could work the holdings or utilise them for the purpose of increasing the holdings of other tenants in the immediate vicinity.</P>
      <P>In another case not very far from my district, as far back as 1917 or 1918, there was a farm of about 60 to 80 statute acres bought and it has been let for grazing every year since then. At a rough calculation, the Land Commission must have recovered more than the money they paid to the owner. That seems very queer conduct on the part of the Land Commission, to hold land in a highly congested area when it could easily be split into holdings of an economic size, thus relieving congestion. Something similar is happening all over County Mayo.  The usual answer Deputies receive is that, owing to the emergency, the staff of the Land Commission is on loan to other Departments, principally the Department of Agriculture.  I suppose that is necessary in a period of emergency, but at the same time there must be a sufficient skeleton staff left to deal with cases such as I have referred to and thus prevent people getting the notion that the Land Commission has become nothing more than a big landlord.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose my townland is the one that suffers most from the point of view of uneconomic holdings.  If there was an average taken of the whole county, I suppose the valuation would scarcely reach £7.  Deputy Giles defended his own constituents pretty well.  I expect they are mostly big farmers.  I speak for a county which was densely populated back in the time of Cromwell, who forced the Irish people to hell or Connaught.  That dense population has remained there ever since on very poor quality land.  I have seen, in the Kilkelly district, men trying to make a living on six or seven acres of land of such wretched quality that, when sowing potatoes in the springtime, they have to hack the furrows between the ridges in order to get enough mould to cover the potatoes.  The same is true of most holdings along the western seaboard.  There are <Col N="1768" /> Deputies in the Minister's Party who can give him the same information.</P>
    <P>I come now to some of the estates in Mayo that have not yet been dealt with.  I communicated with the Minister's Department on several occasions in connection with certain estates.  One is the Peyton estate, near Castlebar, which is worked on the rundale system. I cannot understand why something is not done with that estate.  It is said that when some Mayo people are asked to emigrate, they seek to strike their own bargains; they want this holding or that farm and they will not go. Surely there must be some method which the Land Commission could devise, with all the machinery at its disposal, to overcome a difficulty like that.  I will quote one instance of the working of the rundale system on that particular estate, which is within sight of the county town of Castlebar.  One man owns seven statute acres and he tries to make a living out of that land.</P>
    <P>The seven acres are divided into 27 unfenced plots.  I am sure most Deputies have some idea of the rundale system.</P>
    <P>There are estates in the Louisburgh area which should have been dealt with long ago.  I suggest that there is a deplorable lack of efficiency on the part of the Land Commission in relation to the Peyton estate, near Castlebar, the O'Dowd estate at Louisburgh, and other estates in different parts of County Mayo.  I have called frequently to the Land Commission about these estates, and the usual answer is that because of understaffing at the moment they cannot do anything.  It would not require a full staff to divide an estate such as the Peyton estate.  In connection with that estate, there was a farm of 80 statute acres and the tenants offered to buy the land if the Land Commission would permit them, and divide it amongst themselves. Permission would not be granted.  I suggest that that is clearly pointing to inefficiency in the Minister's Department, inefficiency that should be set right with the least possible delay.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy O'Higgins who mentioned sanitation, and I was glad to hear him introduce that subject. He did not go far enough with the <Col N="1769" /> question of sanitation.  That question affects the rural districts all over Ireland.  It is unfortunately too common to see houses without proper sanitary accommodation.  The Deputy mentioned cow-houses and the use they have been put to on occasions.  That is quite true, and Deputies must be well aware of the existing conditions. When the Land Commission are building houses, I do not see why they could not instal proper sanitary accommodation and a system of hot and cold water.  The whole thing would not increase the cost of the dwelling by more than £20, in my opinion.  When the houses are being erected, that is the time to do it.  In all rural Ireland there would not be a dozen houses in each parish.</P>
    <P>This lack of sanitation is commented on in foreign countries.  Visitors from India, with whom I was in touch not so long ago, commented on it and said that Ireland in that respect was far behind India.  That is a pretty sharp indictment, and the Land Commission is to be blamed for that more than any other Government Department.  They might have devised some system of grants by which the raw material could be provided and the people could be allowed to make use of it on the same lines as the farm improvements scheme.  I ask the Minister to consider doing something like that.  If he does he will be doing a good day's work.  If he never did anything else during his period of office than provide suitable accommodation of that sort, he will have done a really good day's work.  It is for the Minister's Department to devise some scheme of proper sanitation for every rural dweller and also a system of hot and cold water.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to couple that with the erection of new houses <Col N="1770" /> by the Land Commission.  It would be a good day's work if they did it in connection with the building of new houses.  I do not think I am suggesting to the Minister that he should devise some plan by which grants would be available from his Department for the installing of these amenities in existing dwellings.  The slavery that women, in particular, in farmhouses, have to undergo for want of an easily provided system of hot and cold water is deplorable.  A good deal has been said about the sale of holdings.  I think Deputy Dillon said that it is as much as a person's life is worth to offer a holding for sale.  There is undoubtedly a hunger for land.  My experience is that that land hunger only exists in areas where the holdings are wretchedly small; where the size of the holding is not sufficient to enable a man to rear a family.  I know many dozens of holdings where large families have been raised on seven or eight statute acres.  There is no outlook for these families except emigration.  I think it was Deputy Corry said that such a state of affairs makes these people seek work on the roads and elsewhere, thus depriving labourers of employment. This land question cannot be handled in a very rapid manner.  But I would say that where farms, large or small, are for sale, the Minister should take them up and divide them and thus relieve congestion.  In one portion of my constituency where the holdings are about 30 statute acres, there is no land hunger.  The people are very contented. They have nice dwellings and they are working to a very high state of efficiency.  But where there are holdings for sale, or where old people die without leaving any heirs, the holdings should be taken over.  That would help to eliminate this hunger for land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the question of fixity of tenure, I think Deputy Moran said some time ago that until fixity of tenure was abolished there would be no prosperity amongst farmers.  I am not sure of his exact words, but I do not think I am misquoting him.  I should like to ask the Minister if that represents the policy of the Government. Was Deputy Moran speaking <Col N="1771" /> only for himself or was he speaking for the Government when he said that? Deputy Dillon dealt with the question of the three F's. very ably.  Until the question of fixity of tenure, free sale and fair rent is settled it is hard to expect a farmer to take an interest in his land or to be a good efficient unit in the community.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donnellan pleaded for the wiping out of annuities.  I am in thorough agreement with that.  We have borne the burden of an economic war which is reputed to have cost some £82,000,000 and anyone who says that we did not buy out our land during that period has not much sympathy with the vast majority of the people of the country.  I should like the Minister to clear up this matter of fixity of tenure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I am disappointed that the Government did not continue the good work that they were doing in acquiring all the large ranches.  Deputy Dillon said here on one occasion that it was a pity the ranches had been broken up; that the store cattle in the West were purchased and brought to these ranches and that that should continue.  God help this country if the ranches had not been broken up and we were depending on the ranchers to feed our population.  I am disappointed that the Government put a standstill on the acquisition of the ranches and their division amongst people who would make use of them.  On the question of the selection of tenants for these divided lands, on behalf of the people I represent in County Dublin, I have to object strongly to the way in which the last estate acquired in County Dublin was divided up.  That is the Kelson estate at Oldtown, Co. Dublin.  For years we have been agitating to get this estate divided amongst local people.  That went on for years, but finally the estate was acquired and divided.  But who received the biggest portion of the land? Two people from County Kerry.  I am casting no reflection on people from <Col N="1772" /> County Kerry.  As a matter of fact, I admire them.  Every time I met people from County Kerry I found them to be of a good class.</P>
      <P>But I do say that they have no claim to land in North County Dublin where there are competent local applicants who are in a position to take over the land and use it.  I defy contradiction when I say that there are no better tillage people than the farmers' sons in North County Dublin.  Why should any Kerry man be brought up and put on this land in Oldtown?  This is the only opportunity we have to protest against such things.  Where land is to be divided and there are suitable local applicants capable of making use of it for the production of food and the giving of employment, I do not see why any outsider should be brought in. I hold that the local people should have first claim.  The people in North Dublin are quieter than people in other parts of the country, where they would not allow a stranger to come in and get land.  I do not wish to stir up any agitation in connection with the matter, but I say that the people in North County Dublin are very quiet people when the land that they are in need of can be taken over in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with holdings given out by the Land Commission, I must back up what has been said by Deputy Giles.  I am in favour of bringing in migrants where there are no local applicants.  As a matter of fact, the Government have done very good work in that connection; but I cannot understand the idea of taking a small tenant farmer from an uneconomic holding in County Mayo or County Kerry or County Donegal, where those who came before him reared a family for the emigrant ship, and putting him on a holding in Meath where he raises a family for whom there is no future but the emigrant ship.  What other future could there be for a family on 20 acres?  It would be far better if the farms were double the size, when, of course, a smaller number would have to be given out, but so long as you take one man from an uneconomic holding and put him on another, the position is the same.  The other points <Col N="1773" /> with which I intended to deal have already been dealt with and I do not propose to say anything except to repeat that I protest in the strongest manner against the division of the Kelson estate in Oldtown, and, as the prospective occupants have not yet gone in, I appeal to the Minister to find land for these people in some other part of Ireland and leave the land of North County Dublin for the deserving people of North County Dublin.</P>

I am very much surprised that it is not Cork men who have secured that land, and I support the Deputy 100 per cent. in his protest. If it happened in my constituency, I must say that I would organise the people against it, because I am afraid the time is coming when the people must fight for what Almighty God has provided for them, the land.</P>

      <P>I am only giving warning, as Deputy Larkin says.  The Deputy always comes to my assistance when I am in trouble.  This is the place to settle the law so that it will suit the people.  I am satisfied that the Land Commission is doing practically nothing at the moment, and it is a strange state of affairs that ranches still exist.  I must admit that a certain amount has been done, but I have always held&mdash;Deputy Dillon does not seem to hold the same opinion&mdash;that the rancher has been the real enemy of the small farmer.  The rancher is the very individual who must be attacked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1774" /> Certain Ministers came down to Laoighis and appealed to the farmers to give further assistance to the effort to produce more food.  We were told that every farmer was to get out and do his part, as he is doing, and yet the Land Commission absolutely refused to divide lands in South Laoighis, in the districts of Killeshin, Arles and Ballickmoyler.  The Minister must be fairly familiar with these areas, because I am sure there are piles of correspondence in his Department relating to these lands.  The Land Commission allowed a stranger from the North of Ireland, or some other place, to come in, to stock the land and to work it, while people in the area who were equipped and competent to work the land were denied the opportunity of getting it. The Government would not come to their aid and put out the stranger so that the local people could get the land.  When the local people protested, and, in spite of the Land Commission, went out and ploughed the land, they were arrested and tried before the tribunal in Collins Barracks and sentenced to a year in Mountjoy.  That is what was done with people who in answer to the Government's call to produce more food for the nation, put a ranch under the plough.  I say that was most unfair.  The Government has stood over that action and the Minister's Department has approved of it by making no move in the matter.</P>
    <P>We have numerous areas in the same county where there are small holders, landless men and agricultural workers. All these people are very anxious to get land to till it and to produce food for man and beast.  Yet a gentleman like Davy Frame can come down and buy these farms over the heads of the local people, pulling down the mansions and making a good thing out of them, and then selling the lands in small lots when it is no good to anybody. Yet the Government are not in a position to make the Land Commission do its duty and have those farms acquired and given out to the people in the district.  It is a terrible state of affairs that individuals should be able to go around the country buying up every place they can get and depriving <Col N="1775" /> the agricultural worker, the small farmer and those prepared to work the land in these areas from getting land.  I was one of a deputation which approached the Minister in connection with certain estates which this gentleman took over in County Laoighis.  He is making a usual practice of it.  He is now going to Offaly, and I heard he was in County Westmeath lately, looking at what places he was going to buy.  I understand that he has been active in County Dublin as well.  He is a national hero for depriving the people of land.  Yet the Land Commission have taken absolutely no steps to see that such procedure is prohibited, or to step in and divide these lands amongst the people best entitled to them, the local residents.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable to see many of these mansions, such as the fine building at Brockley Park on the Cremorgan estate in County Laoighis, being tumbled to the ground, and this gentleman coming in and taking the land over the local people's heads.  The Minister is quite well aware of these facts.  He is also aware that the Land Commission are at present handling a farm near Rathdowney, called the Ross estate.  Whether his inspector was influenced, or whether it was due to stupidity, or the fact that he did not know the grievances which exist in the area, he brought in to Rathdowney, where there are people anxious to get land to work, strangers who had recommendations, I am given to understand, from prominent members of the Government. It is deplorable that the local people cannot be satisfied first.  I have no objection to a stranger being brought in.  There is no man who would extend a heartier céad míle fáilte to the stranger than I, but I would insist on the local people being satisfied before such a stranger is admitted.</P>
    <P>I have not heard anything in connection with the Ross estate, although I have written letters time and again to the Land Commission, requesting certain information about the manner in which those lands were set by the <Col N="1776" /> inspector who visited the district, and I hope that the Minister will make some reference to it in his reply.  If he does not care to make a reference to it here in the House, I suggest that he be good enough to ask his private secretary to drop me a line and let me know the position.</P>
    <P>While I am speaking on this issue I should like also to refer to the question of bog division by the Land Commission. Between the towns of Birr and Banagher there is a huge stretch of bog, and I understand that before the emergency the Land Commission were going to divide it.  In that connection, it would seem to me that the Department of the Land Commission has suffered from the emergency more than any other Department in the State.  No matter what suggestion you put before them, they always make the excuse of the emergency.  In my opinion, they are using the emergency simply to blind the public, and that the real fact is that they do not want to go on with the work.  Every letter that you get from them, in reply to any proposals or suggestions you make, is that they can do nothing because of the emergency.  Everything is blamed on the emergency.  If that is so, then why not close down the Department altogether for the period of the emergency? The Minister tells us that many of the Land Commission staff have gone over to other Departments. Some time ago, the Minister or his predecessor&mdash;I am not sure which&mdash;said that the vast majority of the people who had been dealing with Land Commission work had gone over to the Department of Supplies.  For goodness sake, what would Land Commission officials know about the administration of the Department of Supplies? Who ever heard before of sending officials of one Department over to deal with the affairs of another Department, and particularly the Department of Supplies, of which they knew nothing? I would not mind if there was anything to supply.  Surely to goodness, there are at least sufficient men with intelligence in this country, if the Land Commission really wanted them, to get along with the work, so that there would be no need for us to be <Col N="1777" /> eternally listening to the same old reply being drummed into our ears at all times: &ldquo;We cannot do anything; we cannot go ahead on account of the emergency.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputies have made reference here to the size of farms or the amount of land that is usually given by the Land Commission to applicants for land. Now, I am of the opinion that the granting of 20, 25 or 30 acres of land is only going to put a man in a condition of slavery for the rest of his life.  What use is 30 acres of land to a married man?  Is he to be expected to get a living out of it and rear a family on it?  And when his family is reared, what are his family going to do on 30 acres?  Probably, they will be looking for more land, and even if they get it they will be in just the same boat when their own families are reared.  As another Deputy has said, their only alternative will be the emigrant ship, because there will be no living for them on the land.  We are constantly hearing of the flight from the land.  There would even seem to be a hatred of the land, from some of the references that are made.  Every time that Deputy Larkin gets up here to speak in the House he asks: &ldquo;Why bring these people up from the country to work in the city?  Why not keep them down on the land and provide work for them?&rdquo;, and rightly so, but neither the Land Commission nor the Government is doing anything for these people and, as a result, they have no alternative but to come up here to the city and do Dublin men out of work, or else take the emigrant ship from Dun Laoghaire or Rosslare and go over to England to eke out an existence there because they are denied an opportunity of a decent life on their own land.</P>
    <P>I think that the giving of 20 or 30 acres is only putting these people into slavery.  Take the case of a man who gets 30 acres of land from the Land Commission.  Any economist will tell us&mdash;I am sure that Deputy Childers if he were speaking would tell us&mdash;that if a man has a horse it will take four acres of land to produce food for that horse, between hay, oats and other necessities for the whole year.  If he <Col N="1778" /> has two horses, it means that eight acres will be devoted to producing enough food or fodder for the two horses, which means that the farmer is working for the horses instead of the horses working for the farmer.  That is the position as I see it, and I am sure it is the position that the small farmers also see: that they are unable to live or exist on these holdings. Why, then, does not the Government take the necessary steps to cut out all this nonsense and give these people decent portions of land, so that their minds will be set at rest and they will be able to sit down to live in some kind of comfort and decency?  They will never be able to do that so long as the Land Commission are proceeding as they are at the present time.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I might be permitted to make a reference to the scales of pay which the Land Commission usually give to their workers.  The Land Commission workers are very badly and very poorly paid, and I think that some steps ought to be taken to improve the conditions of the workers employed by the Land Commission. I understand that they have got some increases.  I am told by workers in the Land Commission that they have received 33/- a week, and I should be glad if the Minister would give us some figures and let us know what increases these Land Commission workers have got, or if he is prepared to see that they will get a further increase.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to refer is with regard to a farm in my part of the constituency.  The Land Commission had been dealing with this farm for 14 years.  Year after year, requests were made to have this farm divided, but the Land Commission did not seem to take any notice of these requests.  They might send down an inspector when a general election was in the offing, and the people concerned would be told: &ldquo;Oh, you are going to have this land divided up at any time now,&rdquo; as a result of which the Government got all the votes they wanted, but once the election was over nothing happened, and the inspector never appeared again until the next election came along.  Eventually, I decided to <Col N="1779" /> take action in the matter.  I attended an auction where the lands were going to be set, and I defied anybody to take the lands.  I took the law into my own hands, as a matter of fact, and got away with it, but the result was that the Land Commission immediately bestirred themselves and divided the land.  As a matter of fact, I think they even took too much.  As I say, I took the law into my own hands there, but anything that this country ever got was not got through constitutional means, and I am afraid that if the Government do not act in accordance with the wishes of the people, the people will have to make them act; the people will be driven into it.  I know very well what the Minister is thinking about me, in his own mind, at the moment, and I can guess what he would like to do with me, but I am convinced that the statements I am making are correct.  They are quite in accordance with my own conscience, and I am satisfied that the lands to which I am referring would never have been divided if I had not taken the law into my own hands.  Two months after the action that I took, the lands were divided.</P>
    <P>Several complaints have come to me from time to time&mdash;I have referred them to the Minister&mdash;with regard to people in the County of Offaly who secured land elsewhere&mdash;probably, in Deputy Giles's constituency, County Meath&mdash;and I understand that the Land Commission undertook to provide them with an allowance to cover the cost of the removal of their livestock, furniture, agricultural implements, and so on.  I am informed that in some cases farmers had five or six journeys to make in the removal of their goods, but the Land Commission gave them only a sufficient allowance to cover the cost of one journey.  I think that when the Land Commission are transferring people from one place to another, the least they should do would be to give them an allowance to cover the total cost of the haulage of their live stock, furniture, agricultural implements, and so on, from one place to another, and not be putting <Col N="1780" /> these people further into debt.  I would ask the Minister to give this matter very sympathetic consideration, because, after all, those people may not be in a position to pay for the transport of their goods, particularly at the present time.</P>

      <P>Deputy Flanagan is not by any means such a naïve or ingenuous child of nature as he pretends. If he thinks that by taking the law into his own hands and getting people in his constituency to take the law into their own hands he got better conditions in regard to the division of lands in that constituency, he is labouring under a great mistake.  I have been an efficient law-breaker myself. I know the &ldquo;ins&rdquo; and &ldquo;outs&rdquo; of the minds of people like Deputy Flanagan.</P>

      <P>Deputy Roddy started off this debate by inquiring why the salaries paid to officials of the Land Commission on loan to other Departments were not shown on the Estimates. These salaries are properly shown in the Book of Estimates and, if the Deputy will look up the matter, he will find that we have not been lax in giving him the information he requires.  This debate has ranged from <Col N="1781" /> that immaterial point over a very wide field.  Deputies have visited many countries in trying to point out how poorly and inefficiently run the Land Commission was, how little it had the interest of the people at heart, and how ineffectual all its work was.  There was so much talk about the inefficiency and ineffectiveness of the Land Commission and, incidentally, so much talk about Denmark, that I began to wonder if Hamlet had not the Land Commission in mind when he said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Tis an unweeded garden</P>
      <P>That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature</P>
      <P>Possess it merely.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amongst the many matters raised in the debate were want of security of tenure, the three F's and the question of credit to farmers, all these things having a certain bearing on one another.  There is no truth in the statement that farmers have not security of tenure.  But it must be obvious to everybody that, if this nation is to survive&mdash;the fact that it has survived during the past few years under the conditions in which we have lived is proof of what I say&mdash;no man can have an absolute, all-embracing right, as against the people of the country, to his own land.  If he had, the Government could not compel people to till in the particular way they wanted them to do.  That could not be done if any farmer had the same right to his land that he would have to a chattel.  In the final issue, it must be acknowledged that the people of this country own the land and have the right to the produce of the land. There is absolute fixity of tenure for any man who is working his land in a proper manner.  If any man sets out to destroy land or to take it out of production, then that man is not entitled to any fixity of tenure.  Fixity of tenure is something that is ultra-legal in this country.  Fixity of tenure is really responsible for the fact that land here is not a good security for money.  Bankers will not readily lend money on the security of land, not because the land has not been properly vested in the applicants, not because they have not proper fixity of tenure, but because there is what <Col N="1782" /> Deputy Meighan called a &ldquo;sentimental feeling&rdquo; in regard to the ownership of land.  If a bank does lend money on the security of land, it is never able to realise its security.</P>
    <P>Free sale has been raised as a question here.  I think that the right of free sale has been preserved.  Some Deputies suggested, in relation to free sale, that the Land Commission might interfere in regard to certain sales which are now taking place.  They cannot have it both ways.  The Land Commission has a definite commitment to the people in regard to the ownership, distribution and user of land.  When the Land Commission divides up an estate and gives an allotment to any individual, it must not readily permit the allottee to sell the land whenever he likes to whomsoever he likes. Somebody said that the purpose of the Land Acts was to make the farmer an owner in fee simple.  The original Land Acts, down from 1870, dealt with farmers who were living on the land. The later Land Acts have been dealing with men who did not previously possess a tenancy.  The original Land Acts took the land from the landlords and transferred it to the farmers who had holdings on these estates.  There is a difference in the operation of the original Land Acts and the later Land Acts.  In giving land to any allottee, the Land Commission, acting for the Irish people, must have in mind that there is a duty imposed on the allottee properly to work that land and to enrich the nation.  The Land Commission has a right to demand that. Where allottees have neglected to work their land, have not lived on it, have made no proper use of it and have utilised it merely by way of renting it and adding to their income and then come to the Land Commission&mdash; supported by Deputies of many Parties&mdash;and ask the Land Commission for permission to sell the land, to cash-in on the free gift the nation has given them, the Land Commission has every right not only to refuse permission but to tell those allottees that it is time to hand back that land to the Land Commission so that it may be given to people who will work it. Again, an allottee may be a reasonably <Col N="1783" /> good tenant, but I put it to the House that the Land Commission, having divided land, must try to function in such a way as will prevent the reconsolidation of farms.  What is the use of expending money in purchasing farms, dividing them, making improvements and handing them over to particular individuals if, after a certain time, they are permitted to sell <Col N="1784" /> that land to a big farmer or to sell it back to the person from whom it was taken?</P>
