      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if in view of the increasing participation of the State in industrial and commercial life he has under consideration any tightening up of the present regulations governing the private connections of State officials with business organisations, with particular reference to officials. serving in the Departments of Industry and Commerce and Supplies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply given to a similar question by Deputy Larkin (Junior) on Tuesday, 28th March, 1944.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister considered the number of officials who may be financially interested in business concerns?  To a great extent, the enforcing of existing regulations will depend upon whether the number is large or small.  If a great proportion of the officials are financially interested in business concerns it will be absolutely impracticable to enforce existing regulations without disorganising the work of the Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesPPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he is aware of the relatively unfavourable position in which the gas industry has been placed in comparison with the Electricity Supply Board owing to the disparity between the quantities of coal allocated to these industries respectively; that, as a result, the production of gas has been restricted to 60 per cent. of normal output, whereas the Electricity Supply Board is enabled to maintain an almost normal output; and if, in view of the large amount of employment which the gas industry provides, he will take steps to ensure that the industry will be given some easement of its present disadvantageous position with regard to the allocation of gas-producing fuel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion in the question that the relatively favourable position of electricity supply as compared with gas supply is due to the manner in which coal is allocated is incorrect.  As indicated in the recent statement by the Electricity Supply Board the relaxation of the restrictions on electricity consumption is due to the high level of the inflow into the River Shannon.  Moreover the board was not in a position to maintain an almost normal output during the period of low rainfall.</P>
      <P>The gas industry is given a very high priority in so far as its coal requirements are concerned and gets all the gas-producing fuel which is available for the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say whether the coal situation at the moment is such as to hold out any hope that the hours of gas supply in Dublin and elsewhere might be extended in the near future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2071" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the coal situation is not such as to hold out any such hope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesPPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the improvement in regard to the electricity supply and the fact that there have been substantial increases in imported coal, would the Minister be prepared to give further consideration to the position of the gas industry?  I am sure the Minister will admit that it is a very large source of employment and that the use of coal by that industry is far more beneficial in creating employment than it is in the case of the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am as anxious as anyone could be to increase the hours of supply of gas, but there is, I think, little prospect that the coal situation will so improve in the near future as to permit of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesPPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister inquire into the position to see if it is not possible to allocate to the gas industry a better quality of coal now than they have been receiving for some time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If we get the better quality coal we will give it to the gas industry all right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesPPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand a substantial quantity of good coal has recently been imported but, of course, it has been of no benefit to the gas industry.  I understand that the Kilkenny Gas Company, for instance, have made very full representations to the Minister.  I invite the Minister now to make a public statement as to what consideration he has given to those representations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he is aware that the people living in the area of Newtownmountkennedy are in a grave position owing to the lack of fuel, as the owners of woods in the area are not prepared to sell trees to the local people; and if he will spare the residents concerned <Col N="2072" /> from having to endure fireless homes during the approaching winter, by taking steps to have some of the timber which is marked by the Forestry Department for sale in Dublin retained in the area and made available to the local merchants for sale there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The timber to which the Deputy refers would appear to be in private ownership and I am not in a position to take the action suggested. The timber is not marked for sale in Dublin and the owners are at liberty to sell it either locally or elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not correctly informed because the Forestry Department has been supplying the Dublin Corporation with timber from County Wicklow.  The people in this particular area are unable to get even one cwt and, under the Minister's Orders, they are not even allowed to get brushwood from the woods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Forestry Department are not cutting any timber in the Newtownmountkennedy area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>They are in the County Wicklow area.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>In Newtownmountkennedy there is no person licensed to sell either turf or timber.  The result is that the poor people in that particular area have no means of getting fuel, even brushwood, under the Minister's new Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of trees in private ownership in the Newtownmountkennedy area have been marked by the Forestry Department as suitable for firewood and they may be sold for firewood by the owners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>That wood has been already purchased by people in Dublin, for sale in Dublin, not in Newtownmountkennedy. That is my complaint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no restriction upon the owners of the timber in respect of the areas to which they may send the timber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2073" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>But the position is that the merchants in Dublin have bought the woods in Newtownmountkennedy and there is none for sale in the local area.  In the Kilcool area merchants have agreed to place at the disposal of the poor people so many tons per week.  In Newtownmountkennedy the position is quite the reverse.  The Dublin merchants are buying the wood and bringing it to Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it would be practicable to take powers to require the private owners of timber to sell that timber to particular individuals or in particular localities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's difficulty, but what is the alternative? There is neither turf nor timber in the area and no person has a licence for the sale of turf.  The county manager informed me that he has no power to place turf at the disposal of this area and the people there are without fuel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think if somebody is willing to accept a fuel merchant's licence in the area we can get him a supply of turf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>There are only two or three merchants, none of whom will accept a licence.  All means outside of Government intervention have been resorted to.  Representations have been made to the various firms, without success.  Now I am appealing to the Minister to make some wood available for these people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he will state whether, having regard to the approximate price of 180/- per cwt. paid by bacon curers for pigs at present, there is an equitable allocation between curer and retailer of the margin between 1/9½d. per lb. wholesale for bacon and the retail scale of prices fixed by his Department; and whether representations were made by curers to his Department for an adjustment of the wholesale price without increasing the existing retail scale; and, if so, what decision has been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the profit margins allowed to wholesalers and retailers of bacon at present are, in existing circumstances, the minimum with which they can carry on or, indeed, which it would be desirable to require them to accept.  Consequently I found myself unable to accede to representations which were recently made by the Irish Bacon Curers' Association for an increase in their prices at the expense of the margins allowed to wholesalers and retailers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the curers are experiencing a substantial loss at the present time as a result of the price that is in operation, and having regard to the price of 180/- paid for pigs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has fixed a minimum price for pigs and a maximum price for bacon, and is allowing the situation to settle itself within those limits.  Does the Deputy suggest <Col N="2075" /> that we should revert to the quota system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but is the Minister suggesting that there should be a reduction in the price of pigs?  Can he give me a categorical answer to the question that I put to him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting that the present practice is in accordance with the wishes of all Parties in the Dáil, as they have been expressed in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The course the Deputy suggests has been fully examined in the past and effect given thereto as far as practicable.  But it has to be borne in mind that returning officers at Dáil and local elections are personally responsible, under pain of heavy costs, for the conduct of the elections, and in appointing persons to assist them in the holding of elections they must be left discretion as to the competency of such persons.  Presiding officers at elections have specified statutory duties to perform and failure to carry out those duties properly might invalidate an election.  Any wilful or grossly negligent act would render the person concerned liable to prosecution in a court of summary jurisdiction and subject to a fine not exceeding £100.  It would not be possible therefore to lay down any regulation that unemployed persons, as such, must be given preference in appointments as presiding officers.  The same standard of responsibility does not apply to poll clerks as to presiding officers, and in the more recent instructional circulars issued to returning officers at times of elections they have been advised to give preference in the appointment of poll clerks to unployed persons who are members of the L.D.F., L.S.F. and A.R.P. services, who would be able effectively to carry out the duties of poll clerk.</P>

None of the four houses which were re-let is subsidisable under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932, and accordingly the rent to be charged is a matter for the local authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I may continue where Deputy McGilligan left off.  As well as amendment No. 37, we were discussing amendments Nos. 39 and 40. By doing so Deputy McGilligan was trying to make it as easy as possible to concentrate the debate.  Let us take amendment No. 39 which proposes:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (3), line 37, to insert after the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; the following words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;corporation, fund or bank (including the Central Bank)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The section, if so amended, would then read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;For the purpose of providing moneys for the sums advanced out of the Central Fund under this section the Minister for Finance may borrow from any person, corporation, fund or bank (including the Central Bank) any sum or sums....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The section, as it stands, would mean that moneys borrowed by way of debentures for the further development of the railways would be borrowed from some person: that is from private persons through public borrowing. The intention of amendment No. 39 is to make it possible to borrow, not only from private persons, but from a corporation, fund or a bank, including the Central Bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Deputy McGilligan was speaking last night he referred to the way in which money could be got much more cheaply for the purpose intended here through the Central Savings Committee Fund.  He referred to a statement made by an important member of the Central Savings Committee a year or two ago when that member, at a meeting of the committee, expressed surprise at the attitude of the Government <Col N="2087" /> towards the general savings movement. He pointed out that they were prevented from advertising it and from encouraging people to put money into Savings Certificates, and indicated that, in spite of the endeavour on the part of the Government to damp down moneys going into the Central Savings Fund, actually £500,000 a year was going into it.  He said that if it were encouraged, and if certain relaxations were given in regard to the amount that might be put into the Saving Certificates Fund £1,500,000 or £2,000,000 would be going to the Government through that fund every year at a cost to the Government that would be less than 2 per cent.  I understood Deputy McGilligan to say last night that the objection the Government had to money going to it in that particular way was that they were not able to use it: that they were getting to much money.  I think Deputy McGilligan completely disposed of the idea that, from the liquidity point of view, there is any danger in the Government taking money through the Savings Fund and using it for constructive purposes.  At any rate, he pointed out that, instead of going to private persons to get either the whole or any part of the £6,000,000 which may be required for additional debentures under this Bill and paying 3 per cent. or more for it, it could be got through the Savings Certificate machinery at a cost of less than 2 per cent.</P>
    <P>I want to indicate that, through the banks, money could be got quite as effectively and much more cheaply.  I want to suggest that if money is required, to the extent of £6,000,000 as temporary money, to put into the development of the railways that it could, and should, be got more cheaply through the banks than through private persons.  That could be done with advantage to the banks.  It would be a strengthening of the banking system, and would result in a substantial saving to the people who have to use the company.  I do not want to refer again to the enormous burden which is being put on the people of the country and on the users of transport by the provisions of this <Col N="2088" /> Bill regarding the redemption by 1960 of £9,800,000 substituted debenture stock.  In view of that burden, since it is necessary, apparently, to get additional money to build up the railways, every possible chance we have of lightening the financial burden of the company and, therefore, of the users of transport, should be availed of.  Reference has been made to the enormous amount of credit which is being used by the British Government for the prosecution of the war.  During the 12 months ended September of this year £2,000,000,000 of borrowing by the British Government has taken place.  That has cost them only about 1.8 per cent.  Let us take a look at the floating debt of Great Britain. At present, it amounts to £5,500,000,000 at 1½ per cent.  That is not going to be wiped out of existence.  It will remain as a consolidated debt owing by the Government to the banks and it will be retained at a rate of interest substantially the same as that to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>The people who depend on the railway system have had bombs enough falling on them&mdash;the bombs of ages&mdash; and the system has been so completely dislocated that it has to be treated in the way it is being treated in this Bill&mdash;by the Government taking it into their own hands and appointing a transport dictator to run it.  If the expense of running is to be as indicated by this Bill, we should see that the credit utilised for the reordering and rebuilding of the railway is got in the cheapest possible way.  Deputy McGilligan has indicated one way in which it can be got at less than 2 per cent.  I want to indicate how it can be got from the banks in a way which would be much more satisfactory, from the national economic point of view and from the point of view of the well-being of the company, than the way proposed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Let us say that £4,000,000 is to be expended on the development of the railway and that that sum is wanted. If that sum were borrowed from the banks, it would have a certain effect on the general financial position.  Let us consider what the effect would be if the £4,000,000 were borrowed from <Col N="2089" /> the public.  I do not know how much of the money proposed to be raised for reordering or reconditioning the railway would have to be exported to pay for imports of materials required for the purpose.  Let us assume that 50 per cent. of the £4,000,000 would be used to pay for imports and then let us consider what would be the difference between raising that £4,000,000 from the public and raising it from the banks.  If the £4,000,000 were raised from the public and £2,000,000 of it were used to pay for imports, there would be a loss to the banking system in this country of the £2,000,000 that had to be paid for imports.  That £2,000,000 would have an average earning capacity for the banks of 2 per cent.  I think that that is a fair average when we consider the average earnings of the banks on their present capital and, particularly, the income they are able to get on the moneys they are at present accumulating.  The loss to the banking system would be 2 per cent. on £2,000,000&mdash;£40,000.  The money which would leave the country for imports would be gathered by the company in cash or in cheques and the Banking Commission Report has indicated that about one-fifth or one-fourth of the amount of any particular deposit is held in cash in the people's pockets.</P>
    <P>When we consider how much the banks would save by the £2,000,000 leaving the country, we have to take it that four-fifths of that amount would be money that had been on deposit in the banks.  Money on deposit is paid for at the rate of 1 per cent.  While the banks would lose their income on £2,000,000&mdash;£40,000&mdash;they would save by reason of the fact that on £1,600,000 they would not have to pay the 1 per cent. they are paying on deposits at present.  That would mean a saving in the situation of £16,000, so that if the £4,000,000 were raised from private persons and half of it spent for the import of materials to rehabilitate the railways, there would be a loss to the banking system of £24,000 a year.</P>
    <P>If, instead of raising the money from private persons, it was taken from the banks, the position would be that, because of the expenditure of <Col N="2090" /> £2,000,000 to pay for imports, the banking system would still lose 2 per cent. on that amount.  There would be a loss element in the situation to the banks of £40,000.  The other £2,000,000, paid over from the banks, would be retained in this country.  A certain amount would be retained in cash in the hands of the public.  A certain amount would find its way into the banks by way of current account and the rest would find its way into the banks on deposit.</P>
    <P>The Banking Commission Report and general banking experience would tend to show that about one-fifth of the total amount of the £2,000,000 would remain as cash in the hands of the people, one-fifth of the remainder would pass into current accounts and four-fifths of it would go on deposit.  As £400,000 of the money lent by the banks to the Government would remain in the hands of the people as additional cash, the banks would have to transfer £400,000 to the Central Bank for the purpose of backing the additional money they would have to pay out, so that there would be an additional loss of 2 per cent. to the banks on that £400,000 of securities transferred from the banks to the Central Bank.  In respect of that item the banks would lose £8,000. The additional deposits that would find their way into the banks&mdash;four-fifths of the remainder, after taking into consideration the cash held in the people's hands&mdash;would amount to £1,280,000. As the banks pay 1 per cent., there would be an additional cost to the banks of £12,800.  If the money were borrowed from the banks, there would be a loss to the banks under three heads&mdash;£40,000 in respect of the imports, £8,000 in respect of the backing for the additional money in the people's hands and £12,800 in respect of the additional money left on deposit&mdash;a total of £60,800.</P>
    <P>As against that loss of £60,800, the banks would have an additional asset of £4,000,000 which they had loaned to the company or to the Government for the company.  If the banks were to get 2 per cent. on the £4,000,000, instead of paying 3 per cent. to the public, their income annually on that sum would be £80,000, or, taking into account the item of loss previously <Col N="2091" /> referred to, the difference between the £80,000 they were getting at 2 per cent. on £4,000,000 and the £60,800 they were losing, there would be a net advantage to the banks of £19,200.  I have shown that if the money was borrowed from the public the banks would lose £24,000 but, if borrowed from the banks at 2 per cent., they would gain £19,200 a year, and the company would be saved £40,000 a year.  That is on the basis that 50 per cent. of the money was spent on imports.  If only 25 per cent of it was spent on imports, then the net advantage to the banks of lending money at 2 per cent. would be £28,200 a year.  If all the money were borrowed from the public, in respect of the loss of 25 per cent. exported, there would be a loss to the banks of £12,000 a year, so that the gross difference in a case where only 25 per cent. of the £4,000,000 was used to pay for imports would be to the advantage of the banks to the extent of £42,000.</P>
    <P>I put these figures before the Minister as a challenge.  The banks would make a profit of 1½ per cent. if the money was lent to the company.  These figures support Deputy McGilligan's amendment, and show that there is a way to strengthen the banks' position and to ease the situation for the company and the country.  The additional debentures that are required have to be repaid in the way the Minister indicated, and these are ways in which that could be done with additional benefit to the general economic position. I do not think the House is justified in agreeing to the Minister's proposals and in turning down Deputy McGilligan's amendment without understanding this matter, and without hearing from the Government any suggestion that the money could be got more cheaply and more effectively by Savings Certificates on the one hand or from the banks on the other hand.</P>

      <P>I hope Deputy Mulcahy knows what he is talking about.  I confess that I do not.  I strongly suspect that the Deputy does not know either.  I hope he is able to establish <Col N="2092" /> some relationship between his observations and the section in the Bill. I cannot.  We are dealing with a section which provides for the raising of money by the State to make good a State guarantee if and when the State guarantee has to be made good. The section in the Bill is framed in accordance with the normal practice in legislation of this kind.  The subsection to which the amendment is proposed appeared in standard form in every Finance Bill since the establishment of the State.  It has nothing whatever to do with the raising of money for development.  I am sure Deputy McGilligan, as a lawyer, knows that the term &ldquo;person&rdquo; includes corporations.  Deputy Mulcahy read the section as if all the money was to be provided by private persons. There is no reference to private persons. Any corporation is a person. The Central Bank is a person for the purpose of definition.  The amendment is unnecessary, because it adds nothing to the legal significance of the word &ldquo;person&rdquo;.  This section relates entirely to one possible set of conditions. It relates to a situation in which the company is unable to meet interest on debentures and the State guarantee is called upon.  It provides that the Minister for Finance can meet that guarantee by borrowing.  That is all.  If the Deputy will study the various Finance Acts introduced from time to time he will find precisely similar conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This idea that you can get money cheaper by some peculiar device is one that we must dispose of.  Of course, it is true that the cheaper the company gets money the better it will be for the company.  I think we may take it that the management of the company will be familiar with all the ways of saving interest and will be acquainted with all the sources from which money can be borrowed.  The whole secret of the financial methods so successful in the case of the Dublin Transport Company was precisely that.  But that has nothing to do with this question.  I know that some people have the idea that theirs is an amazing discovery, that it is possible for a Government to force people to lend money on whatever <Col N="2093" /> terms the Government decides.  Deputy McGilligan spoke last night as if the idea were a new one.  There is nothing new in having forced loans and debasing the currency.  These ideas are as old as money itself.  Governments in financial difficulties resorted to those devices in the past and never pretended they had discovered something new. Most of them recognised that they were adopting a practice which was undesirable and discreditable, and they only resorted to it when they found there was no alternative.  I do not know what I can do to get Deputies opposite to read some elementary textbook on economics.</P>
    <P>The juvenile ideas expressed yesterday by Deputy McGilligan and by Deputy Mulcahy make me despair of getting them to understand the most fundamental principles of public policy. Deputy McGilligan is clearly unable to understand the difference between capital and credit.  Deputy Mulcahy has the idea that if we force the banks to lend money at a low rate of interest the money we are going to save will be to the advantage of the banks.  We could do that if we wanted to do so. The British Government did that for war purposes.  Deputy Mulcahy should study more closely the methods adopted by the British Government for war finance.  It involved forced loans at rates of interest determined by the Government.  Should we resort to that? Deputy McGilligan thinks it would be good policy to compel the banks which get money on deposit from individuals, and which pay interest at the rate of 1 per cent., to lend that money to Córas Iompair Eireann at the same rate of interest or at some lower rate than the market rate.  That is possible.  A much simpler device is to tax the banks to subsidise the company.  It is precisely the same thing.  It would have precisely the same effect as far as the company is concerned, and precisely the same effect on the country.  Other people would have to pay more for credit.</P>

      <P>Wait a moment; I do not want to get too far involved with the Deputy.  He has not even begun to understand it and I do not want to make him any more confused than he is.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to put this in words of one syllable so as to avoid <Col N="2095" /> getting it unduly confused and to avoid further interruptions.  In so far as it is true that a bank takes money on deposit and lends that money out at interest to persons who are anxious to borrow it and who are, in the opinion of the bank, credit-worthy, the difference between the rate of interest they charge and the rate of interest they pay represents the fund available to the bank to cover the cost of its banking operations and to make a profit.  If we compel them to lend money at a lower rate of interest than the market rate, they will have to make good the loss by charging more to other people or by cutting their expenses in some way.  I think that is a very simple proposition and one which is quite easily understood.</P>
      <P>There is not the slightest doubt that there is power in this Legislature to compel a bank, a corporation or any individual to lend money to the Government at no rate of interest at all.  I do not know if it would be regarded as good policy, but it is certainly in our power to do it.  We do by taxation compel them to give us money, not as a loan but as a gift, and we pay no interest on it.  The extent to which we do that is often the subject of debate here.  Most Deputies appear to be under the impression that we are imposing too heavy a burden on the people by way of taxation and that the burden should be reduced.  We can adopt this device of compelling people to lend us money.  Governments have often done it.  I do not say that the Government which did it survived very long, but it has been done in the past. I think it was bad government, bad policy, and, in the long run, led to the ruin of the countries which resorted to these methods and would lead to the ruin of this country as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we have the proposition that a company wants capital.  It does not want temporary borrowings.  In relation to the credit requirements of this company, we make provision in the Bill.  We permit them to get money on a bank overdraft to a limit of £500,000, but that has nothing to do with its capital.  The capital the company will require will be invested <Col N="2096" /> in fixed assets.  Deputy McGilligan appeared to have the idea that it was possible for the company to go into the banking business, to accept money on deposit and to use that money lodged with it on deposit for the purpose of long-term capital investment. We could put that in the Bill, but the company would get no money.  It may be true that if everybody who has money on deposit in the banks presented a demand for repayment simultaneously, they could not get it, but that does not influence the individual who puts money on deposit.  The individual knows that he can be repaid and deposits at a rate of interest of 1 per cent. because he wants the advantage of being able to get that money back at a week's notice.  If he is prepared to forgo that advantage, he will not put money on deposit in the bank, but will invest in gilt-edged securities or some other stock.  He gets a higher rate of interest, but cannot get his money back when he wants it.</P>
    <P>It is quite true that we could put this company into the banking business in theory and give it power to accept money on deposit on which it would pay 1 per cent.; but if that company is going to use the money to buy engines, railway stations, land and permanent things of that kind, so that everybody will know that there is not the slightest possibility of any individual getting his money back when he wants it, it will get very little money on deposit.  I wish Deputies would begin to understand the difference between capital and credit, between long-term investment and short-term borrowings&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In the case of this company, we are proposing to authorise <Col N="2097" /> it to get capital up to a limit of £20,000,000.  What is capital?  It is not credit; it is not temporary borrowing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wants to speak in terms of finance, yes; but capital is wealth saved from past production for the purpose of financing future production.  Again, let me put it in words of one syllable.  If I am a farmer and I grow a field of wheat, when I have cut and threshed it, I have a number of barrels of wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>How many does not matter.  I can consume all that wheat in feeding myself and my family, or I can put one or two barrels aside for the seeding of the field next year.  If I decide to retain some of the wheat as seed, what I retain as seed is capital. It is wealth saved from immediate consumption to facilitate future production. Is that simple?  If I consume all the wheat and find next spring that I have no wheat left in order to grow wheat that year, I have to borrow seed from somebody else.  If the person who has the wheat considers that I am credit-worthy, he may lend me sufficient for my purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If you borrow next year's seed on other assets, is it not capital?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  The Deputy can get this very involved if he likes, but I am trying to put it in the simplest form.  What we want for this company is wealth saved from current consumption to finance, or rather to facilitate, future production.  We want steel and bricks and timber and other materials of the kind shaped into railway engines, trucks and stations.  In so far as it may be necessary for the company to have immediately available cash or credit to meet short-term demands, it can borrow for that purpose.  It can borrow on the basis of short-term loans or a bank overdraft, but the £20,000,000 we are talking about will be invested by the company in permanent tangible <Col N="2098" /> assets which cannot be realised immediately. You cannot just sell a railway engine every time somebody wants his money back.  These people cannot get their money back.  That is the principle on which the company will be financed.</P>
      <P>A certain proportion of the capital represented by ordinary shares is not repayable at all and the balance is represented by debentures redeemable at a date fixed, and, except in accordance with the terms of the debentures, those who lend the money cannot get it back until that date.  They can get interest on the money and the company will be obliged to pay interest on the money in the meantime.  If the company is not obliged to pay that interest, people will not lend money.  That should be obvious to anybody who has any commercial experience at all.  It has nothing whatever to do with temporary borrowings.  Deputy Mulcahy has the idea that because we use the term &ldquo;redeemable debenture,&rdquo; these debentures are intended to finance the short-term cash requirements of the company.  They are not.  They are intended to provide permanent fixed assets which will earn revenue for the company in the years ahead.  Their short-term credit requirements can be met otherwise&mdash;by bank overdraft, probably.</P>
      <P>It will probably be desirable for the company to get its capital requirements financed by the banks.  It should be possible, I am sure, to procure long-term advances from the banks covered by debentures.  I think we can leave it to the management of the company to get the money it requires on long-term loans at the cheapest possible rate.  We are not going to compel people to lend the money at less than the market rate.  We think it is undesirable and would have reactions on the economy and credit of this country which would, in the long run, make it a very disastrous move.  I do not see that it arises here, anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me repeat that this section has nothing whatever to do with financing the company.  It is concerned only with the manner in which the Minister for Finance will raise the money to make good his guarantee, if he has <Col N="2099" /> to make good that guarantee.  We assume that the circumstances contemplated in this section will never arise, that the guarantee will not be called on; but if it is, the Minister for Finance has to make it good and pay out to the people to whom the money is due the amount he has guaranteed to them, and in order to enable him to do that, we authorise him to borrow from any person, which includes any corporation.  I cannot say that it includes the Central Bank. If Deputy McGilligan wants to give the company power to borrow from the Central Bank, he will have to do it by amendment of the Central Bank Act and not of this Bill.</P>

When I denied the truth of his version, the Minister said that he had the evidence submitted to the tribunal; that he had the report of the evidence given before the tribunal before him.  I should like to know if it is proper for the Minister to give his version from an official document which is not available to members of this House and is it in accordance with fair play for the Minister to deny to Deputies access to a document from which he gives what he suggests is a true version of the evidence given to the tribunal.

The Minister emphasised that, if what I suggested were done, as a set-off the banks would have to charge other people higher rates.  I want to put to the House what the results in certain cases would be. I said that if £4,000,000 were borrowed from the banks and 50 per cent. was spent on imports, the net result to the banking system would be an annual loss of £24,000.  If it were borrowed from the banks at 2½ per cent., it would save £20,000 a year to the company and the banks would make an extra profit of £39,200 a year.  If the banks loaned the money at 2 per cent., the savings of the company would be £40,000 a year.</P>

      <P>The Minister suggested that if what I said was put into operation, the banks would lose money.  He implied that the banks would lose money and, therefore, would have to charge additional prices to other people.  I want to give the Minister certain figures which will show him that he completely misunderstands what I said.  I want to show that the money could be lent by the banks at 2½ per cent. and the banks would gain £39,200 instead of losing £24,000.  I suggest they could lend money at 2 per cent. and would gain £19,200.  They could loan the money at 1½ per cent. and they would gain £8,000 a year, while the company would save £60,000 a year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the banks would lose then.  There is a rate at which the banks could not afford to lend money without losing.  I am indicating to the Minister that they could lend it at substantially below the figure he contemplates the public would subscribe at, that is, 3 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly, but there are implications.  The Minister contemplates that the railway company will pay private persons 3 per cent. profit and the fact that the substituted debenture stock has been created in his Bill and will be paid by the company at 3 per cent. is sufficient.  The Minister may leave out of his argument that the banks would lose money by lending £4,000,000 to the railway company at 2½ or 2, or even 1½ per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not teaching us anything, financially or otherwise.  He said the scheme is that the company will get money to finance itself, that part of it must be by redeemable debentures and the rest will be through other debentures, to which the Minister for Finance will attach his own particular conditions. We all know that.  But if I take the new money that is to be raised, I am quite certain the company will not persist in paying 3 per cent. to anybody if it can get money at 1 per cent.</P>
      <P>It is important to find out how the Minister will get this money, and at what rate he can get it.  I suggested three ways last night.  One was by the adoption of the modern device adopted all over the world in which new media of currency are being made from time to time as Governments require them, and they are being accepted.  When these are created in very large sums, there have to be certain measures taken to prevent inflation. I believe, when we are discussing anything from £5,000,000 to £16,000,000, we are saved from anybody raising a bogey about inflation in this country.  I remember the Minister for Finance talking in the Seanad last year about the money that flowed into this country from England. He said that if we took £14,000,000 or £15,000,000 and considered it in relation to our purchasing power here, it did not matter a thrauneen in respect of inflation.  So we can put the bogey of inflation aside when we are considering only £10,000,000.  If £10,000,000 were to be created, at least we can leave inflation aside as long as our purchasing power is at the level it stood at when the Minister for Finance spoke in the Seanad a little over a year ago.</P>
      <P>As to how that can be got, there is no longer any mystery.  People used to shudder at the thought of printing presses turning out new forms of currency that would be regarded as legal tender.  It has been done all over the world&mdash;it has been done here.</P>

How did it come about <Col N="2103" /> that in his Budget speech this year the Minister for Finance said we had twice as much money in circulation in this country as we had five years ago? Is that all that small change amounts to&mdash;that in a very badly off country an increase which is nearly 100 per cent. of the currency in circulation five years ago is possible?  That is for the purposes of small change?  Is that seriously meant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.  Any schoolboy will tell the Deputy that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Any schoolboy will tell me that?  Whether that schoolboy would get off just as lightly as the Minister is getting off is another matter.  The increase in money in circulation in this country is a matter of small change, according to the Minister. We have that on record.  In any event, it is possible to do that; it is even possible to do it up to the extent of doubling the money in circulation for small change, that is to say, for money that is actively in circulation. Of course, it would be easier to do it if a considerable amount of the new money created is not going to be in circulation&mdash;if the velocity of its circulation is to be reduced.  Small change passes rapidly from hand to hand.  The Minister says you may get to the point when you are clipping your currency.  We have got to that point at the moment.  While the Minister thinks he is really increasing the amount of money in circulation for small change, we have got to the point where the pound is worth about 10/6 in purchasing power, and we have got to clip currency.  There was a time when people were sent to jail for clipping currency, but now it is done quite openly.  Wages have just about half their purchasing power.  However, the thing can be done, and there is no question of inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, of course, says that the banks are going to suffer, and that in fact it amounts to forcing loans from the people at low rates; that, if we do get them at lower rates from the people through the banks, then the banks, losing on one thing, will charge <Col N="2104" /> more on another, and so your whole fabric of finance will be readjusted with somewhat the same results as before.  All this is based on the misapprehension that there is always a certain amount of money in circulation, and that if there is any change made in that it will divert the finance which institutions get.  Of course, we know that is not the case at all.  The Minister tells us that we should get an elementary textbook on economics. He did not mention what his textbook is.  I do not know if it bears a name, but I know that wherever he got it he has the idea that deposits are what the bank has.  That is what he got from the textbook.  I wish he would look at the balance sheet of a bank. I would have thought if there was anything a bank had it was the first item that generally appears on the assets side of a bank's balance sheet&mdash;cash.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deposits, according to the Minister a minute ago, are what the bank has.  Cash certainly represents what the bank has, and deposits are on the other side of the account. I put to the Minister that deposits are what the bank owes.  The Minister apparently thinks that, when somebody comes in looking for an advance from the bank, some bank messenger is sent down to the vaults to discover how much they have there, and that then they proceed to find out whether that is as much as will give the customer his advance; that in some way or another you have a relationship between what is either notionally or accurately and positively passed over the counter and what is somewhere hidden in the bank's hoardings.  The Minister referred to somebody performing some operation in the neighbourhood of the statue of Queen Victoria.  If there were a statue of Queen Anne erected, the Minister should be put on the right-hand side even of Queen Anne, he is so completely out of date in his views.  I find it very difficult to argue with a man who starts off with the view that bank deposits are something the bank has, <Col N="2105" /> something the bank possesses&mdash;assets. In the interval he discovers that deposits are liabilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's great point works up to this, that you <Col N="2106" /> are going to force loans out of individuals or banks.  I did say last night that it was possible to create money. So it is.  It is possible to have this new business handled by the banks. If they are making their profits on the business already in their hands, they should not be perturbed at getting new business at a lower rate of profit or no profit.  We are not disturbing them in the old profit they used to get on the old business.  We are not disturbing their old fabric to build up their institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next point&mdash;I understand that Deputy Mulcahy referred to it to-day&mdash; is the vast amount of money there is in the banking system, which people are prepared to leave there and never to draw 1 per cent. of it.  What is done with that money?  Is it harnessed up to industry in any way?  If so, at what rate is it lent to industry?  At something above 1 per cent. presumably. Apparently the Minister's idea is all this nonsense about savings being wealth.  I think he said that wealth is what you have saved from current expenditure&mdash;that that represents the only sort of savings that can form capital.  The old idea was that the banks got money from certain depositors and lent that out, and they were supposed to build a lucrative business on that.  Everybody knows that there are millions of unused money in this country, and the belief is prevalent in certain circles at the moment that the banks pay 1 per cent. to people to induce them to keep the money idle.  It is very much like what we here sneered at in the people in America who burned coffee and wheat to keep them from circulating as commodities. The banks here, as in other countries, are accused of paying a certain amount of money to people in order to prevent their money getting into circulation.  Whether they have that purpose or not, the fact is that there is a vast amount of money idle in the banks.  We ask that that should be used.  We do not say that we will diminish the return that is made to the people who own it.  We say: give them their 1 per cent., and, when you have given them their 1 per cent., if the railway company, through the Minister <Col N="2107" /> for Finance, can use that money better, the people who own the money are not doing any worse than they were before. They are still getting their 1 per cent., so they are not being damnified in any way.  If that money can be put into circulation and used for the purposes of the railway business.  I do not see that it does any harm.</P>
    <P>The Minister makes some distinction between credit and capital.  I should like to have that explained to me. Capital, apparently, is money with which you purchase physical assets. Can they not be purchased with credit?  I should imagine they can. In any event, if some man requires capital, can capital not be got from somebody who possesses it, on credit? Surely it can.  There is a credit background to the whole thing.  However, as I said last night, it is very hard to argue this matter with people who think that investments simply come out of savings; that you cannot get any investments put in the railway business because all the avenues of investment are already open, far too much open, to a small amount of capital; that if you divert capital from some other industry at the moment then you are despoiling that industry of so much, and you must divert it from a channel already open to it and into which it is already flowing before you can get it into the railway.  That, in the circumstances of this country, is complete nonsense.  It is not the situation.  The Minister's phrase&mdash;the only thing he can use as a background for railway finance&mdash;is &ldquo;wealth saved from current consumption&rdquo;.  I took that phrase down.  The Minister's idea seems to be that the only way you can provide money for putting into new railway stock is by getting someone to stop consuming as much as they ordinarily would and to mortify himself to some extent.  That is the only way, and you then pass over all that multiplication of savings for reinvestment. Apparently, the Minister believes that and believes that the thousands of millions of pounds spent on the war are got by that process of preventing people from spending on consumption so many thousands of <Col N="2108" /> millions of pounds and that that is the only way in which the money could be got.  Of course, if the Minister were an Englishman, he would by now have his eyes open to the fact that a debt has been piled up of £500,000,000, even with no interest charges, to represent the advances that have been made. All that is created credit.  I read in this House many months ago&mdash;and I propose to put it on record again&mdash; from the columns of a very orthodox and sober English financial journal, <i>The Economist</i>, of September 4th, 1943.  In an article headed &ldquo;The Future of Banking&rdquo;, they give this phrase dealing with conditions in England:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;What has been happening, in short, is that the State has been forced to multiply the means of payment in existence.  This newly-created credit has lodged in the hands of individuals and business firms&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>credit, not capital, on the Minister's view&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;who use it as their circulating capital instead of borrowing from the banks.  The banks are left to hold, in the form of deposits, this greatly inflated corpus of credit, while the mere fact of its existence deprives them of the possibility of employing it in the classical way.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I recommend to the Minister:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In other words, the textbook definition of a bank is now badly out of date.  A bank used to be&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I think the Minister still thinks that is correct&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;an institution which collected savings by offering to pay interest on them, and used them to make loans to industry and trade.  A bank nowadays is an institution which holds the credit-money of the community, created by Treasury financing, and uses it to finance the Government deficit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the Minister would ponder over that for a while, he would advance about 30 or 40 years in his views on finance, but until he makes that advance there is not much in doing more than proposing this particular amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a section dealing with the Minister's liability to pay interest charges on debenture stock, if the company defaults.  I want to suggest to the Minister that that responsibility need never devolve upon him and the community may not in fact be required to pay any interest, if the Minister will adopt another method of financing the company in its efforts to get money in the form of debenture stock.  Deputy Mulcahy suggests, although his amendment does not provide for it, that the banks ought to be required to lend money at a certain nominal charge, that they could profitably do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan's amendment does that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to Deputy Mulcahy that, if the company is going to issue debentures at 3 per cent., the banks know that they are likely to issue money at 3 per cent. and they will think it profitable to buy the debentures at 3 per cent. rather than lend money at 2 per cent.  I am not interested in the method of financing through the banks and still less by an issue of public credit.  If the Minister has any faith at all in his Transport Bill and any faith in the ability of this company to earn a profit and redeem its debentures, there is no reason, transport being so vital to the wellbeing of the nation, why this transport company should be compelled to go into the open market and pay interest charges to people who have a natural interest in selling money at the highest possible price.  Anyone with banking experience knows perfectly well that the banks live on selling money at the highest possible price.  Every situation <Col N="2111" /> which enables a bank to sell money at the highest interest charges is a situation which is greedily availed of by the banks.</P>
      <P>There are people who deal in stock exchange transactions and who could make money available always, if substantial rates of interest were paid.  Let any one propose to start a factory for the manufacture of boots, to be sold at a maximum of 1 per cent. dividend, these boots being supplied to the needy, deserving people in the State, and he will not raise a halfpenny for his boot factory; but let someone suggest erecting a casino at Dollymount or Dun Laoghaire, offering to pay a rate of interest of 10 per cent., and all the money he wants will be available for that casino.  There always is a collection of people available, whether in the form of banks or private individuals, which believes in selling money at the highest rate of interest, and they will only make that money available at the highest rate of interest.</P>
      <P>I regard transport as an essential service, something that should be taken over, owned and controlled by the State, run on a non-profit-making basis, so that the community will not be held to ransom because, in its modern complex life, people must travel from place to place.  I regard the provision of transport on a non-profit-making basis as being as important as the provision of roads on which people walk, at least without others making a profit out of those who walk on the roads.  It is as important as the provision of electricity or water on a non-profit-making basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Transport seems to be as vital to the nation as these other services.  Yet in this Bill we provide that the company may go to the community and ask for debenture stock at 3 per cent.  I do not see why they should have to go to the community for money which will be a liability on the users of transport to the extent of 3 per cent. per annum. The Minister says this company will be required to provide a redemption fund for the purpose of redeeming its debentures, commencing in 1955.  In any case these debentures must be <Col N="2112" /> redeemed by 1960 unless there is a change in legislation in the meantime. The Minister in reply to a query from me a couple of days ago said that he had no doubt of the ability of the company to redeem the debentures and to provide for interest on the debenture stock.  I put it to the Minister, if he is satisfied that this company can create a redemption fund and pay interest on its debenture stock, that the Minister then might adopt a modern method of financing the company, namely, issuing to the company credit in the name of the State with the security of the State behind it so as to enable the company to get such capital as it requires for development purposes, that capital being amortised by payments from the company&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I shall tell the Minister in a second.  Then it might dawn on the Minister that there may be something in this scheme of getting money for the company without having to pay this annual ransom.  At the present time, before any of our banks can issue a £1 note it must get sufficient security and deposit it with the Currency Commission, now the Central Bank.  What is the security that it gets?  There is no gold in the country.  Silver is not regarded as a security and is not acceptable by the Central Bank as a security.  Yet, before an Irish bank can issue an Irish £1 note it has got to deposit some security with the Central Bank.  The security that will be accepted is what is known as a British security, sterling assets.  Any Irish bank can go into the Central Bank with British securities and these may consist of British Government loans which they deposit there against the issue of notes.  But the Irish bank has no assets in the form of capital goods, no security in the form of Irish securities which have a tangible value.  The security generally is pieces of scrip acknowledging a liability on the part of the British Government to repay somebody that sum of money whenever the British Government can see its way to do so, under the terms applicable to the debt which the British Government contracted, usually for the purpose of financing the war.</P>

It is only when these are deposited with the Central Bank that the Irish bank can get its £100,000 worth of notes issued.  Let me put it this way.  What does this £100,000 worth of scrip represent?  For a very considerable time Britain has had no gold backing for her notes. She has ceased to have any type of metallic backing.  They are simply printing notes and they are backed on the security of Britain's ultimate capacity to redeem these notes, to create goods&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If a nation such as Britain&mdash;Germany and the others are doing it as well&mdash;can create credits with a Government guarantee for the purpose of financing destruction on that colossal scale that we see to-day, surely we can create credit in this country for the purpose of extending and developing a transport service which is vital to the needs of the community?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have suggested that every other Government in the world can apparently issue State credits for financing schemes of destruction. Surely it is as possible for us here, as it is for them in the changing circumstances, to issue some credits for the purpose of creating national assets in the form of an efficient national transport system in the country?  If <Col N="2116" /> the Minister cannot discover where that is done the sooner he gets in touch with some of our representatives abroad the better it will be for an enlightened system of finance in this country.  So far as this transport system is concerned, it is being operated by a company.  I would prefer to see it owned and operated by the State.  But, if it is going to be operated by a private monopoly, so long as that monopoly can mulct the people in the form of high transport charges, I want to see every possible excuse removed from the company for doing so.  If the company is likely to be a success, as the Minister thinks it is, then he ought to have no hesitation in creating the necessary State credits, getting the company to repay what it borrows from the State out of the redemption fund which he appears to be perfectly satisfied the company can create, maintain and utilise for the purpose of repaying its debentures.  I do not think the company should, necessarily, be forced to go into the open market and borrow money at a ransom, but that the State should make credit available for the company if it is satisfied that the company is efficiently run and, in that way, relieve the company of the obligation to pay interest to those who live on interest and, at the same time, make travelling cheaper for the Irish public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to express the opinion that any idea that cannot be expressed in simple words which the average intelligent man can understand must have something wrong with it.  We are proposing to put State credit behind this company.  Let me tell the House what I mean by that. We assume that the public would be prepared to lend money to this company at a lower rate of interest if the State guarantee repayment of the money than they would be if the State did not give that guarantee.  That is what I mean by putting State credit behind the company.  The public will have more confidence in the prospect of getting their money back and interest paid upon the money when the State guarantees it than when it does not.  That is easily understandable.  We <Col N="2117" /> are proposing to give this company the benefit of the State's credit and, by doing so, enable it to raise money at a lower rate of interest than it would otherwise have to pay.</P>
      <P>What is the rate of interest at which money will be lent?  It is not determined by somebody sitting down in an office.  It is determined by a multitude of circumstances and it can be ascertained at any time by reference to the stock market quotations.  On any particular day one can find out the price of gilt-edged money.  One can turn to the paper and find out what gilt-edged securities are selling at.  At the present time the public are prepared to lend money on gilt-edged securities at something above 3 per cent.  That is a fact. Nobody has decided that.  It has just reached that situation by reason of the operation of all the circumstances to which I have referred.</P>
      <P>We know from facts that are obvious to every one of us that there is a great deal of money available now for investment. People have been compelled to save, involuntarily.  We would all like to buy more tea, more sugar, more butter, more clothes, if we could get them.  We cannot get them.  The State has taken action by its rationing schemes to prevent our getting them. We are, therefore, compelled to save, involuntarily, just as the British people are compelled to save.  A great deal of that money which has been saved involuntarily is available for investment either in Savings Certificates, in the National Savings Bank, by means of making deposits with ordinary deposit banks or by the purchase of shares or a multitude of other ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of these circumstances, it is quite true that at the present time there is far more money available than there is use for.  The stagnation of commercial enterprise occasioned by the war has, of course, involved the surrender to the banks by industrial and commercial firms of the credits previously available.  They do not require credit on the same scale now and, therefore, you have this situation which has been described by Deputies as &ldquo;the banks bursting with money.&rdquo; That is not a situation that the banks <Col N="2118" /> want.  They want to lend that money if they can get credit-worthy borrowers for it.  Stagnation of commercial enterprise has prevented them from lending money on the previous scale.  At the same time additional saving, mainly involuntary, has been going on.  A situation will arise after the war in which we hope there will be a complete change.  We hope that the revival of commercial and industrial enterprise will mean that the demand on the banks for accommodation will be increased and that the public will be able to utilise their own money in their own businesses to a greater extent than is possible at the present time.</P>
    <P>In the case of this company there will be two classes of debenture stock. The substituted debenture stock will carry interest at the rate of 3 per cent.  The fixation of 3 per cent. rate of interest in respect of that stock was not determined by any consideration except this, that the owners of that stock at the moment are entitled to 4 per cent. and it is desirable to effect a reduction in the interest charges to be borne by the company.  We went, therefore, to the owners of the stock and proposed to them that, if they would accept 1 per cent. less, we would give them in return for that sacrifice of 25 per cent. of their income the added security of a Government guarantee.  The owners of stock, by a majority vote, agreed to that proposition. That is why that proposition is in the Bill and that is why 3 per cent. is mentioned in relation to these stocks.</P>
    <P>In relation to the new debenture stocks there is no attempt to determine now the rate of interest at which they will be issued.  We are proposing to lay down as a condition of their issue that the State guarantee will not extend beyond 3 per cent.  We are asking the Dáil to consider to what extent it will authorise the Executive to pledge the State's credit and we are proposing that the Dáil should authorise the Executive to pledge the State's credit in respect of issues of debenture stock by this company to an extent not exceeding 3 per cent. interest upon them.  If, in fact, the market conditions are such that the company has <Col N="2119" /> to pay 3¼ per cent. or 3¼ per cent. in order to get the money, the State guarantee will only apply as far as 3 per cent.  That is not an unusual practice.  Under the Trade Loans Guarantee Act loans were given by the banks to industrial concerns here at varying rates of interest but the interest due by the borrowers was guaranteed by the State only as to 2½ per cent.  That was a result of an arrangement made with the banks.  The actual interest paid by the borrower might have been and usually was substantially higher than 2½ per cent., but, in the event of the borrower defaulting, the State was liable only in respect of a 2½ per cent. guarantee.  The same situation will arise here.  If, in fact, the company has to pay more than 3 per cent., the State guarantee applies only to 3 per cent.  If the situation is as favourable as some seem to anticipate and if the company can get money at less than 3 per cent., then it will borrow at less than 3 per cent.  In fact, it is because good financial management enables interest charges to be kept at a minimum that the Dublin United Transport Company was able to effect the substantial improvement in its financial position since 1935.  The same financial management will, we hope, be available to this company and will certainly be directed to ensuring that the company will not pay for money one penny more than the circumstances require.  When Deputy Norton talks about creating State credit, I take it he has in mind the idea of manufacturing money, of debasing the currency.</P>

It decreases the value of the money available for the purchase of goods which are available and, therefore, increases prices and, in fact, means that money is worth so much less to everybody who has it.  It has precisely the same effect as a forced loan from every citizen.  In fact, of course, as I pointed out to Deputy McGilligan, printed money is only the small change of commerce.  If the Deputy wants to know how much money is utilised in commerce he will have to make a calculation based upon the bank clearances of cheques. It is a figure published every week or month by the Central Bank, contained in the Central Bank's quarterly bulletin.  Every Deputy knows that 99 per cent. of the commercial transactions of this country are financed by cheque, not financed by the transfer of currency at all.</P>

      <P>I think that the principle, propounded by eminent economists, is accepted now: that every loan creates a deposit.  There is, undoubtedly, an inflationary tendency going on all the time, but that is not, necessarily, harmful.  Deputy McGilligan made the usual nonsensical remark <Col N="2122" /> about the £ sterling being only 18/6, but what was it worth in 1933 or 1833? Was it worth 20/-, or was it worth very much less or more?  There is, undoubtedly, as I have said, an inflationary tendency going on all the time.  So far as the increase in money is offset by increased production and the purchasing power of the people remains equal to the supply of goods, that tendency is helpful, but so far as increased purchasing power is not offset by increased supplies, that inflationary tendency is definitely hurtful and detrimental to the interests of the countries concerned.</P>
      <P>So far as we are concerned, we want to put this company into the position that it can get a loan at the best possible terms and under the best possible conditions, and it is for that reason that we are proposing to put the credit of the State behind the company, in respect of both the principal and interest on the money borrowed.</P>

      <P>I wish the Minister would try to drop this method of getting back to the present situation in connection with the amount offered for money, created, or piled up, and which is seeking expansion at the moment. There is a war situation at the moment, but we are not discussing that, and, as I pointed out last night, there is money in the banks that should be floating about instead of, so to speak, being piled up on people's shelves.  In this connection, perhaps I might refer to the Banking Commission Report, from which it would appear that, in or about 1936, there was something like the sum of £90,000,000 of idle money on time deposit.  Of that £90,000,000, it was stated that it was safe to say that one-third represented pure &ldquo;savings bank&rdquo; money, which would not, normally, be in a joint-stock bank at all&mdash;in other words, money that was on the shelf, so to speak.  That was the situation in or about the year 1936: there was plenty of idle money in this country.  In addition to that we know, with regard to the people representing the Central Savings Committee, that in March, 1942, the reverend chairman of that committee said that these people had been forbidden to buy these Savings <Col N="2123" /> Certificates for the past five or six years&mdash;that is, from 1926 to 1942.  The reverend chairman said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As you know, we have been forbidden to advertise the Savings Certificates or to encourage people directly to buy them for the past five or six years.  Nevertheless, despite this silence on our part, a steady £500,000 is invested to advertise, and were the restrictions as to individual amounts loosened, we could, in a year or two, secure an annual saving of £1,500,000 to £2,000,000 in the certificates. That is, that amount of money would be placed at the disposal of the State at a rate which must be considerably less than 2 per cent, if not less than 1 per cent.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In other words, from £1,500,000 to £2,000,000 a year would be placed at the disposal of the State, at a rate of interest of, probably, less than 1 per cent.  Now, let us get away from that, and consider what the rev. chairman said, which was to the effect that if advertising were allowed, and the limit of individual holdings increased, there was no reasonable doubt but that we could get a yearly net sum of £1,000,000 or more, at considerably less than 2 per cent., If not less than 1 per cent.  The rev. chairman said that if the restrictions were done away with, we could in a year or two secure an annual saving of from £1,500,000 to £2,000,000 in the certificates.</P>

      <P>Yes, but how many of them are entitled to get it at call, or at a week's notice?  They have security there, and that is what makes them lend the money, as, I am sure, the Minister knows.  The reverend chairman of that committee discussed that fact, and then went on to say that for years past, these people have left <Col N="2124" /> that money lying there idle, and that there is a steady increase there in savings year by year, until the Government stopped it.  Now, these people are satisfied to get even 1 per cent., or less, on that money, and that money will be available to the Government to put into railway stock, and, possibly, that will be done.  Surely, it is not thought that all these people will leap into the bank on the one day to collect their money, but, even in the case of such a thing happening, the State guarantees that these people will be paid, but how will the concerns affected pay?  I take it that they will print notes, and they are doing it every day.</P>

      <P>Yes, I understand, but we are here talking about the question of general finances, and, again, the Minister talks about these guaranteed debentures and says, in effect. &ldquo;We will give a guaranteed percentage, provided that you reduce the guarantee from 4 per cent. to 3 per cent.&rdquo;  I want to get rid of that whole matter.  I do not like the way it is being done, and in the background of the terms of the guarantee given by the Minister will always be the question: How can he get the money?  In view of the vital needs of transport in this country, it is certainly an important question, how money can be got at 3 per cent.  In the background of this whole question is the matter of how he can get this money and at what rate.  Leaving aside the question that new money has to be provided, we are thinking of the way in which to deal with the matter, and my approach to this delicate question of creating new money might be shown by reading a sentence from <i>The Economist</i>, which is to the following effect:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Since 1913, something like £3,000,000,000 of bank credit has been created and has lodged in the deposits of the banks.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Has not the English £ note depreciated to any appreciable extent?  Has it not depreciated to the extent of the £3,000,000,000 of bank credit?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The quotation goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Who owns these deposits?  How has the distribution of the total&mdash;for example, between individuals and business firms&mdash;altered?  These are questions to which it would be most valuable to have the answers.  One thing, however, is clear.  The deposits now on the books of the banks have not originated from anything that can properly be called saving.  Three-quarters of them have come into existence since 1913, and their origin lies in Government finances.  Whatever may have been true in the past, it is almost wholly misleading to-day to regard bank deposits as the fruit of voluntary abstinence on the part of anybody.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is now the view of the writer in <i>The Economist</i> only, and any student of economics will appreciate that, but the Minister comes in here, and, in effect, says that such deposits must be regarded as the fruit of voluntary abstinence on the part of the people. Now, let us come up to 1931.  The Minister says, in effect, that money has been created <i>ex nihilo.</i>  Does he know what that means?&mdash;&ldquo;Out of nothing&rdquo;. If the Minister understands that, does he think that in Great Britain they have been creating money out of nothing and spending it out of nothing, while still avoiding inflation? If that is so, can we not do it also? After all, this is a matter of general finance for the whole community, and here we are only dealing with a small matter, so far as the needs of the general community are concerned&mdash; although, undoubtedly, it is a very important matter&mdash;and that is the question of transport.  Seriously, I do not think that any Minister in any backward country, whether Lichtenstein or any other country, would be capable of saying what the Minister said here to-day.  With regard to the Minister's third point, that if you print money you debase the coinage, the position is that all over the world they have been printing money.</P>

It has been stepped up terribly in this country since 1939. The economic war, of course, helped to reduce the purchasing power of the £ here.

If the Minister does not believe that, <Col N="2127" /> then I suggest to him that he ought to study the results of the cost-of-living figures prepared in his own Department. We are dealing here with something in the neighbourhood of £5,000,000.  The joint stock banks will probably create that amount in any half year.  The Minister's idea of the joint stock banks is that they will never lend money except the money is in their tills, or is represented by property. If the Minister has that view it is hardly worth while arguing with him.  It is a theory that was discarded many years ago.  The Minister is aghast at the idea of a national government using the national printing press to get money for national purposes.  But every bank becomes a printing press through its cheque-book system every day of the week and nobody bothers about it.  The Minister must know, if he has read anything at all on the matter, that the banks think they are safe if they only lend out ten times what they have in the way of cash.  If they are able to meet one-tenth in the case of a sudden run, that is regarded as good banking practice.  In respect of the other nine-tenths, not represented by cash, they are using, or we are using for them, cheque-books, and nobody bothers about it.</P>

      <P>I do not know the circumstances under which the Government discouraged people from lending money to the National Savings Bank in 1936.  If the Deputy wants to pursue that matter he had better take it up with the Minister for Finance.  I can consider a multitude of circumstances in which the Government would decide that it would be good national policy to discourage people from lending money to the Government in order to force their savings being utilised for the financing of industry or of loans to local authorities. On the general question of the ability of the British Government to pay for the war out of savings, I wonder why it is that they consider it necessary to have income-tax at the rate of 10/- in the £.</P>

There would be some attempt to regulate the market so that the issues in which the Government is interested will be successful.  That would be a function of the Minister for Finance.  I can easily understand the Minister for Finance deciding that, in some particular year, other issues which are likely to appear on the market are such that Government borrowing should be discouraged.</P>

      <P>In line 4, to delete the word &ldquo;six&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;four&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this section is to authorise the company to pay dividends at the rate of 3 per cent. in respect of its redeemable stock and 6 per cent. in respect of its common stock.  Under Section 18, the company will have power to issue common stock up to a maximum of £4,000,000.  A situation will, therefore, arise in which the company will have common stock to the extent of £4,000,000 and debenture stock to the extent of £16,000,000. The State proposes to guarantee dividends up to a maximum of 3 per cent. on debenture stock but, in respect of the common stock, the company is to be empowered to pay dividends up to a maximum of 6 per cent.  I have already indicated the views of this Party in regard to transport as a national activity.  We regard transport as vital to the life of the nation, as something indispensable to ordinary citizens, pursuing their ordinary avocations, as something which ought not to be a source of enrichment to those who invest their money in it. Transport being vital to the life of the country, it should not be made a source of profit-making by investors whose main concern is to get dividends rather than provide a public service. Every dividend paid by this company either to debenture or common stockholders will be paid at the price of levying a tribute on the travelling public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not believe the public should be levied for the provision of such an essential service as this is.  This Bill <Col N="2131" /> provides for the creation of a private capitalist monopoly in respect of transport.  The object of this amendment is to make sure that the public will be liable to pay as little as possible for its transport service.  Under the Bill, the company is given power to pay a dividend up to 6 per cent. on its common stock, so that we may have a situation in which the company will be able to pay dividends of, approximately, £250,000 on common stock nominally worth £4,000,000 and the travelling public will, of course, pay the £250,000 in dividends to the common stockholders.  If a situation of that kind should arise, in which the company would pay 6 per cent. on its £4,000,000 of common stock, it would be nothing short of an outrage on the travelling public.  The Great Southern Railways Company, which is the big partner in this merger, has not paid any dividend on its ordinary stock for the past ten or 12 years.  It is quite unlikely that, left to its own management and without State assistance, which is now being provided, it would ever pay any dividend on its common stock.  If the public are to be asked to pay dividends on the common stock in future, we think that the dividends should be limited to 4 per cent., being 1 per cent. above the maximum rate of interest payable on the debenture stock.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, of course, no proper comparison between the 3 per cent. payable on the debenture stock and the maximum divided of 6 per cent. which may be paid on the common stock.  The 3 per cent. is guaranteed to investors in the debenture stock.  They will be paid irrespective of whether the company makes a profit or not. There is no guarantee that the 6 per cent. will be paid, or that any dividend will be paid, to the common stockholders. So far as the normal practice of commercial undertakings is a guide, a limitation of 6 per cent. upon ordinary stock would be regarded as restrictive.  If I understood the Deputy properly, however, he is of opinion that it is wrong in principle to pay any dividend on the common stock of the company.  I think that he would like <Col N="2132" /> to propose that but, for some reason, he was induced to make a compromise and he proposes, instead of the proposal in the Bill, 4 per cent.  We could provide in the Bill that these people's property should be entirely confiscated and that they should get no return on their investment.  The Government did not think that that would be good policy and we do not propose it.  We shall resist any such proposal if it is made here.  I think that the limitation of 6 per cent. on any dividend that may be paid on the common stock is a reasonable one, in all the circumstances.  We are not taking any positive steps to ensure that the owners of these stocks will get any dividends.  It is possible that there will be years in which they will not get a dividend but the legislative provision is that they will not, under any circumstances, get more than 6 per cent.  Very few people would invest their savings in any commercial enterprise if there was an overriding limitation of 6 per cent. in respect of the dividends payable.</P>

The Minister need not read many economic text books; if he reads the ordinary reports of commercial companies, he will find that what he states is not correct.  In 1939, the average dividend paid by a cross section of companies here was 6 per cent.  We are dealing in this case with a peculiar company.  We are not dealing with a company which is taking the ordinary risks of commercial activity.  We are dealing with a company which has got a monopoly, given it by the legislative Chamber, and which is in a far different position from that of the ordinary commercial undertaking, particularly, companies now operating which entered into new fields of activity in the years before the war, fields of activity which were completely unknown to them and in which they ran, possibly, grave risks.  They ran those risks and their return is represented by an average dividend of 6 per cent.</P>
      <P>There are companies paying 12 per cent. and 15 per cent. but I am taking a rough cross-section and the figure works out at 6 per cent.  Here we have a group of ordinary shareholders who are in a most peculiar position. It is possible that, certain conditions occurring, those people, holding £4,000,000 worth of common stock, will become owners of a very valuable concern after a period of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, they will be operating a concern which has been given a monopoly.  The Minister stated the other day that a monopoly was not given because there will be competition from private lorries and private cars.  A great deal of what he said did not really make sense.  Whether or not private cars and private lorries operate, there is a residuum of transport, which is not catered for by private lorries or by private cars, which must be carried by road or rail transport.  We have a different position now from what we had some years ago when the railways had to meet the competition of road transport. Road and rail transport will have a monopoly which will be able to earn dividends on the ordinary shares.  It is <Col N="2134" /> suggested that a limit of 4 per cent. is slightly below what ordinary shareholders in commercial undertakings receive and is unfair to the shareholders. Over a period these shareholders never got 1 per cent.  We put the point of view previously, but not in the form in which the Minister expressed it, that it would be in the interests of the country, in so far as earning capacity is concerned, that this should be a nationalised concern.  Unfortunately we have not changed our point of view as rapidly as that of the Minister.  We are condemned for what the Minister at one time thought.  We are not suggesting confiscation.</P>
    <P>We suggest that in the legislation now being framed there should be some protection for the ordinary public.  The Minister pointed to one argument in favour of the peculiar constitution of the board of directors, whereby we have a chairman, as well as certain directors appointed by shareholders that these, influenced by a desire to see a profit on their investments, will take a more keen interest in the concern than outside directors appointed by the Government.  If that is the position we are facing, and if the limit is 6 per cent., is it not ordinary human nature on the part of the directors to see that the earnings are driven up to the point at which they could pay 6 per cent.?  As we give them that power I do not see why they should not take advantage of it. Deputy Norton pointed out that to pay 6 per cent. on £4,000,000 represents £250,000 which will have to be paid by the travelling public.  If we give the company a new and a reorganised concern, and put them in the position of operating because of a Government guarantee, which makes possible new financial conditions, and in addition give them a monopoly over all effective road and rail transport, surely we are not unfair when we suggest that the limit should be 4 per cent.</P>

      <P>Deputy Larkin said that investment in the ordinary shares of companies averaged 6 per cent. We are not proposing that shareholders will get 6 per cent.  We are proposing that they will get a maximum of 6 per cent.</P>

      <P>On the contrary, we propose to limit the maximum to 6 per cent.  If one year they get nothing, and next year they get 6 per cent., the average will be 3 per cent.  I should say that the average, if they get any dividends, will be substantially below 6 per cent.  Córas Iompar Éireann will not have any greater monopoly than the Great Southern Railways have now or had at any time since 1933.  In so far as the Great Southern Railways were granted a monopoly of road and rail transport under the 1933 Act, that monopoly is not being extended in any way.  The position is that monopoly during these years did not enable the Great Southern Railways to exploit the situation to the extent of paying a dividend to the ordinary shareholders.  The mere fact that there is monopoly does not mean that the company is going to earn revenue.  Obviously, there are factors which may affect earning capacity to a very considerable extent, factors which were there before the war and which can be there after the war.  I hope to see the company earning a revenue that will permit the payment of interest on the common stock.  It has yet to demonstrate that it will do so.</P>

The fact is that the possession of a similar monopoly by the Great Southern Railways did not permit the earning of revenue to pay dividends on ordinary stock.  The reason why it is proposed to prescribe a maximum rate of dividend on shares is to ensure that the benefit of the redemption of the debenture capital and the improved earning capacity, if there is improved earning capacity, will redound to the citizens of the country, and not to the shareholders.</P>

      <P>Deputy Larkin said that this was a peculiar company.  I think it was.  It was indicated that the Great Southern Railways, from 1932 to 1938, lost £669,000, and yet found it possible to pay dividends amounting to nearly £1,500,000, and between 1939 and 1942, when, according to the minority report of Dr. Kennedy, the company lost £1,000,000, and made no trading gain, they paid out nearly £250,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not wrong. They figure in the reports in the last few years.  We know how it was done. They paid out of money which was handed over after the last war for arrears of maintenance, but which was not spent on repairs and maintenance. It was spent on dividends.  Then there was a small subvention from the 1924 Act, which was spent while the going was good, so that the concern went to rack and ruin.  The Minister in his speech referred to the chairman's statement about the rolling stock being obsolescent.  The Minister knows what the chairman said in May, that the railway was making a loss, and would continue to make a loss unless a reorganisation was successfully carried through, and he could not guarantee that it would be ever successful.  He also said that the financial position of the company was very serious, and he anticipated that the revenue for the present year would not meet losses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In June, he went on to say: &ldquo;The present earnings even during the war are insufficient to pay working expenses. <Col N="2137" /> Even the increased rates will not cover the deficiency in full.&rdquo;  As late as October, the chairman returned to the attack and said: &ldquo;Rolling stock is obsolete.  New buildings, plant and machinery are required and reorganisation of the permanent way, stations and yards will require considerable sums of money.&rdquo;  Finally, he said that &ldquo;the public will not subscribe a &lsquo;bob&rsquo; to the concern.&rdquo;  He had in front of him during all these speeches, as any man speaking of fixed assets must have had, mainly the debenture holders, because they were the people who could cash in whatever value there was in the physical assets.  The ordinary stockholders got a dividend, according to the tribunal's report, up to 1931.  Then there is a blank until they got, in 1943, a payment out of the extra charges which were put on. From 1931 to 1941, they did not draw one shilling and we are now proposing to set up again this Humpty-Dumpty business and allow it to pay 6 per cent.</P>
    <P>What are the peculiar circumstances then attaching to the future of this company?  They are these: The company is now in the grand position that it is far better than ever before and as a monopoly it undoubtedly has chances now which the old company never had.  It has an extra chance given to it by its being linked up to a stronger financial organisation, the Dublin transport organisation, and the fact that it has Dublin transport under its control as well.  It has now special ways of freezing out competitors which it had not got in the old days, but, apart from all that, it is now being set up in this way, that the debenture holders, whether the company earns money or not, are to be paid 3 per cent. and the stock is to be redeemed.  When all that is done in 1960&mdash;and the Minister says he hopes it will be done earlier than 1960&mdash;at the public expense and at the expense of the transport users, this almost obsolete concern, refashioned, remade and given new permanent way and rolling stock, is to be handed over to people who have not seen a shilling in the way of dividend since 1931.  We are going to say to them: &ldquo;You now have a property clear of debenture debt and we will allow it 6 per cent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2138" /> I do not think that is a fair proposition. I do not think any of these people over expected such treatment.  Most of them were reconciled to the view, when they saw the inside workings of the company revealed, that their capital was long since gone and they really have not had a financial interest in the company for years.  The Minister recognised that in 1933 when he cut them down by nine-tenths, so that a man had £10 in the company where he previously had £100, and, even since that, the people who hold a fraction of their old-time holding have not got a dividend, except in one year.  Now we are asking the public to say in relation to these people that they will allow them to get 6 per cent.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin said he gave a cross section of companies for a particular year and that the average of these companies in that year was 6 per cent. He did not mean that the average earning of any one of these over the year was 6 per cent., but that, taking them as a group, for a particular year there was a 6 per cent. earning, and that at a time when profits were supposed to be very definitely restricted under Emergency Orders and they could not get more than a certain amount.  These are trading concerns, and this is a monopoly with a Government guarantee, the avowed objective of the Minister being that, before 1960, the Government guarantee would have worked so as to wipe out all capital other than the common stock, the holders of which are to slide out as possessors of a grand property.  It is our property.  It will be either the taxpayers' or the transport users' property in the main, and I do not think it right to hand it over to £3,500,000 worth of common stock holders.</P>

      <P>For practical purposes, the common stock basis is to be the substituted basis this Bill provides. I do not appreciate the force of the Minister's remark that to fix too low an interest ceiling here would be to prevent people investing money in the railway company.  So far as capital on the basis of common stock is concerned, it is in the company already and there is no constructive call going to be made on any capital in relation to the common stock in the immediate future.  In so far as the present shareholders of the common stock are concerned, on page 15 of the Report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into stock and shares dealings, information is given as to the amount of guaranteed preference, preference and ordinary stock which changed hands between 3rd January, 1943, and 20th November, 1943.  The figures show that 27.6 per cent. of the guaranteed preference stock changed hands during that period.  There may be some duplication in these figures, but if the duplication is ignored 27.6 per cent. of the guaranteed preference stock and 29.3 per cent. of the preference stock changed hands.  Of the ordinary stock, <Col N="2140" /> 21.5 per cent. changed hands.  Taking the ordinary stock purchased between 3rd January, 1943, and 23rd October, 1943, 13.9 per cent. of the total common stock changed hands, and between 25th October and 20th November, 1943, 7.6 per cent. changed hands.  In any of these figures, there may be a certain amount of duplication, but 27.6 per cent. of the guaranteed preference, 29.3 per cent. of the preference, and 21.5 per cent. of the ordinary stock changed hands as between 3rd January, 1943, and 20th November, 1943.  Half the total guaranteed preference stocks are to be common stock in future. When we take into consideration the preference and the ordinary stock, of the new common stock 27 per cent. of the holdings changed hands during that period.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, allowing for duplication.  On 19th September, the Minister, in a Parliamentary reply, gave the highest quotations for ordinary, preference and guaranteed stock in June of each year.  The highest price paid for ordinary stock in June, 1944, was 51 and for preference 51, so that a 6 per cent. dividend on the common stock is going to mean 12 per cent. in respect of purchases made by people in June, 1944, at 51.  No quotation was available for 1943 or 1942, but the quotation for 1941 and 1940 is 8, and a dividend of 6 per cent. on the common stock is going to mean a dividend of 60 per cent. on the amount of money invested by people who bought the ordinary stock in 1941 or 1942 at 8.  The guaranteed stock was purchased in June, 1943, at 28½.  The preference was quoted in 1942-43 at 18 and at 14 and, in respect of money that is put into this stock, and that is not constructive in any way, it is putting it very mildly to say that the payment of interest will be at the rate of 6 per cent.  It will be very substantially more.  On that particular point alone, without any reference to the earning capacity of the stock in the past, I think there is no very great injustice being done to anybody by accepting <Col N="2141" /> Deputy Norton's amendment.  But when we take into consideration that the payment of revenue on this stock will come down on top of the extraordinary extraction of money from the travelling public to redeem the enormous amount of substituted debenture stock provided for here, then there is an overwhelming case for accepting Deputy Norton's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering the equity of this amendment one has to refer to the value of the common stock of the company.  When you want to ascertain the value of the common stock, probably as good a method as any is to go back to March of last year and see what the chairman thought of the undertaking.  A reference to his speech shows that he thought very little of the permanent way and the rolling stock and he indicated that 50 per cent. of the railway lines in the country were earning no revenue whatever. Then you have the Minister looking at the thing very objectively and telling us that it was simply junk. Evidence given at the railway tribunal put its value in the form of scrap at £4,000,000, and it was even doubtful if it would be bought for that purpose. That is the position.</P>
      <P>We have reference under this Bill to £4,000,000 of common stock.  If that common stock were valued at stock exchange quotations, or on the ability of the undertaking to earn a dividend, the amount would not be £4,000,000; it would scarcely be £400,000.  What is happening under this Bill?  We are going to leave the common stock at £4,000,000.  In other words, we are going to permit the company to create a share position in which it has at present £3,500,000 in common stock and it may, if it wishes, increase it to £4,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the existing common stock under this Bill at £3,500,000.  The company is really being allowed to water its capital for the purpose of earning a dividend of 6 per cent.  I do not think these shares are worth anything like £3,500,000, especially bearing in mind that they did not earn a dividend for 13 years.  One can hardly imagine shares that have not paid dividends <Col N="2142" /> for 13 years being of any great value now.  One cannot imagine any person buying them.  Yet we are regarding these shares as value at £3,500,000 and we are saying to the stockholders, the people who hold common stock in this junk company: &ldquo;You can pay yourselves dividends at the rate of 6 per cent. and you can get them out of the travelling public.&rdquo;  I think that is a bit thick from the point of view of the travelling public.  The shares are not worth anything like the value attached to them in this Bill and these shares are being watered for the purpose of enabling the directors and the common stockholders to put their hands as deeply as they can into the pockets of the travelling public.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, when this debenture stock is paid off, the common stock holders will become the owners of the company.  The Minister may say that that means nothing, that the travelling public will have a very big say in what will happen.  If you reach the point when a group of people holding common stock to the extent of £3,500,000 or £4,000,000 own a railway undertaking, on which debentures to the extent of £16,000,000 have been paid off, you get a situation then in which common stock capable of earning a 6 per cent. dividend, is a very valuable investment.  And if the debentures at 3 per cent. can hold their own at par on the stock exchange, what is the position going to be in respect of common stock on which it will be possible for the company to pay 6 per cent.?  As Deputy Mulcahy points out, some of the common stock could have been bought for a song 12 or 15 months ago.</P>

      <P>The Minister said in 1933 that the stock was worth £10 for every £100 share, and more recently he told us that the railway company had not improved its position.  The chairman said so in March, and the Minister said so in May and June of last year. If that is the position, what is the case for allowing the company to have £3,500,000 in common stock on which you will have to pay a dividend of 6 per cent.?  That dividend will cost the travelling public £250,000 a year.  If the travelling public have to pay that amount each year to common stockholders in this junk company, which has not paid a dividend for 13 years, then the travelling public will have a right to say that this House did very little to safeguard their interests.</P>
      <P>I do not know what the value of the common stockholders' shares is.  I would like someone to evaluate them. I would venture to say that in the normal course of events you would not sell these shares like hot cakes.  In the normal course the stockholders might not get a dividend for another 13 years, unless something special happened.  If the State is now intervening to make the shares more valuable in the future than in the past, then the State is entitled to set a maximum to the rate of interest payable, and that maximum should be less than 6 per cent.</P>
      <P>It is possible under the present proposals for the common stockholders, having what might be described as a wasted and almost worthless asset, to milk the travelling public to the extent of £250,000 a year.  That is an outrageous provision for these common stockholders, and there is no set of circumstances concerning their investment that justifies the House in permitting them to get away with £250,000 per annum, which will be possible under the Bill, at the expense of those compelled to utilise our transport system.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mulcahy referred <Col N="2144" /> to the fact that some holders of preference shares purchased them at less than their nominal value.  That fact is an indication that the public do not anticipate that the 6 per cent. is going to be paid with the regularity which Deputy Norton appears to anticipate. The reason for that is that the public know what Deputy Norton and some other Deputies have apparently not yet appreciated, that there is still a transport problem to be solved&mdash;that that problem has not yet been solved. We are setting up this organisation with new facilities and powers in the hope that it will be able to solve the problem.  We trust it will succeed. Our trust is that it will succeed to the point of enabling a dividend to be paid upon the common stock of the company, but it may not succeed.  That element of risk is there, and it is because the public know that element of risk is there that they have not put a value on those shares on the assumption that there is a dividend to be paid regularly at the maximum rate.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave asked how this 6 per cent. was arrived at.  It is not easy to answer that question.  It is in my view the point at which it is fair to put a maximum limit on the dividends payable.</P>

      <P>Oh, certainly.  It is intended to represent an over-riding maximum.  I cannot attempt to forecast at what stage the Great Southern Railways Company will begin to pay dividends on ordinary stock, or whether at that stage it will be able to pay more than 1 per cent. or 2 per cent. or 3 per cent.  I certainly anticipate that the average dividend earned by those shareholders over a period of time will be substantially less than the maximum.  The 6 per cent. is there to ensure, if and when the transport problem is successfully solved, and the Great Southern Railways Company can provide transport facilities at a profit to itself, that, except to the limit required to pay 6 per cent. to the common stockholders, the benefit of that increase in revenue will be experienced by the users of the transport system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2145" /> When introducing this Bill, I asked the House not to consider it apart from the 1933 Act.  I think Deputies are too easily inclined to forget the provisions of that 1933 Act.  It is easy to be contemptuous of those ordinary shareholders of the company, and to criticise them for their neglect of the company's interests.  I am not going to defend the management of the Great Southern Railways Company.  When I became Minister in 1932, I was left, as a legacy by my predecessor, a transport problem, and the kernel of that problem was to get the management of the Great Southern Railways Company to realise the mess their concern was in.  In the legislation of 1933 we took a crack at those ordinary shareholders that was probably unprecedented in the legislative history of any country.  By our Act here, without their consent, or without consulting them, we cut the nominal value of their holdings by 90 per cent.  Many of those shareholders were the individuals or the descendants of individuals who had invested substantial sums in railway shares, in the belief that they were the best security in which to the up their savings.  Many of them represented the widows and dependents of persons who had saved money and put that money into railway shares, believing that by doing so they were securing the economic safety of their dependents.</P>
    <P>When considering the provisions of this Bill I want the House to remember that each of those £100 ordinary shares of the Great Southern Railways Company represents an original investment of £1,000, and that the effect of this provision is to ensure that those people, whose original investment was £1,000, cannot secure more than a ½ per cent. at any time in the future upon that investment.  I think it would be completely unfair of this House to forget entirely the past legislation and to consider this Bill as the first attempt we have made to interfere with the capital structure of the Great Southern Railways Company.  It is not the first attempt.  The two Bills must be taken together, and, taking them together, I say it would be grossly unfair to those individuals if we were at this stage to put a further imposition upon them <Col N="2146" /> having regard to the action we took in 1933.</P>

      <P>I endeavoured last night, after the Minister had repeated himself in using the words &ldquo;surplus revenue&rdquo;, to get for the House his definition of &ldquo;surplus revenue&rdquo;.  He talked about the surplus revenue that would be available for the payment of dividends on common stock.  The Minister has described the position of the Great Southern Railways Company as being almost worthless, but any ordinary intelligent person, any ordinary clerk reading the balance sheet, the abridged statement, as it is called, could not possibly come to that conclusion. Would the Minister give us his definition of surplus revenue from this angle: Is surplus revenue what would be left after the payment of fixed charges, after the full amount has been set aside for the development work which the Minister and the chairman had in mind, and for any other charges on the company?  Are we to understand that what is left after setting aside those necessary amounts&mdash; I do not know what they are likely to be&mdash;is called surplus revenue?  Last year, we see here in this balance sheet that the amazing sum of £700,000 was set aside for the renewal of ways and works and the reconstruction of the rolling stock.  I presume that that sum has not been spent.  It could not possibly have been spent in the year 1943 because the material and machinery required were not available.  But, notwithstanding that huge increase of £700,000 over the previous year, and after making allowance for the payment of the 3 per cent. on the ordinary stock, we have a balance of £60,856. If the chairman&mdash;or whoever is responsible for fixing the payment of dividends on the ordinary stock&mdash;wanted to, he could have paid 9 per cent. to the shareholders for the year 1943.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what is in the mind of the Minister or of the chairman who is his nominee as to the amounts, if any, which should be set aside, after this scheme comes into operation on 1st January next year, for the renewal of ways and works and the reconstruction of rolling stock.  What other charges has he in mind that must be <Col N="2147" /> met before he comes to arrive at the figure representing surplus revenue? If we knew what he had in mind, or if we had a definition from him as to what he believes to be the proper interpretation of &ldquo;surplus revenue&rdquo;, we could come to some conclusion&mdash;it would be only in rough-and-ready figures&mdash;as to what should be left after providing for those fixed charges, the renewal of ways and works, providing decent rates of wages for the workers who are now very badly paid, and so on.  We could arrive at some conclusion as to what the chairman-dictator of this company would be able to do in the shape of making reasonable provision for the payment of interest on the common stock of the company.  I am at a loss to understand what the Minister means by surplus revenue, and we cannot understand what is going to be done by the chairman or what the Minister has in mind until he gives us an understandable definition of those words.</P>

    <Col N="2149" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>On a previous occasion, I remarked, in the course of the discussion on the Government policy towards these forms of social service, that it seems to have been the experience that, if only we kept hammering long enough, we eventually got the Government to see a little reason in the matter and achieved several improvements. We have achieved that in the case of allowances to soldiers' dependents, in the case of food vouchers and now we are promised an improvement in regard to the supply of boots for children of necessitous parents.  It seems to me that the motion we are considering now is something of the same character, that we are trying to set before the Government a human standard they have fallen very far short of, but which, in the course of time, they may eventually reach.</P>
      <P>We have heard the Minister on a number of occasions expound the viewpoint of the Government in relation to any suggestion for an increase in old age pensions or the easing of the application of the means test in regard to them.  Of course, it always reverts itself into a question of money, into a question of the percentage of aged people in our population, the poverty of the country and the effect of putting so great a burden on its resources.  It seems to me that there is another approach we might consider.  Amongst the ordinary decent men and women there are certain standards which we should hold, regardless as to what the cost may be.  If we are not in a position at the moment to keep those standards fully, we should go as near to them as we can and should take into consideration what can be done to put us in a position of achieving those standards. When we come to deal with the treatment meted out to old age pensioners, we are dealing with a human problem in which there are involved standards obligatory on any man or woman who has a conscience or who has any understanding of the principles about which we hear so much at present&mdash;the principles of social justice and equity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem we are faced with in regard to old age pensioners is not a <Col N="2150" /> problem confined to those who reach 70 years of age, but a problem of the lives of those people.  During all the days of their lives, they are affected by the conditions under which they have had to live.  When they reach old age, they are carrying, not merely the burden of old age and physical infirmity, but the burden of the system of society under which they have been forced to live.</P>
    <P>Let us take the average life of the ordinary man or woman in this country. They leave school and generally have the unfortunate experience of spending some time unemployed, a burden on their families, running around the streets and very often getting into trouble.  Eventually, they are lucky enough to find a job, which usually pays such a low rate of wages that, instead of contributing to the upkeep of the family, they cannot meet the ordinary commitments which should be met with regard to clothes, food, shelter, and so on.  Even though employed and giving service, they are still a burden on the family.</P>
    <P>Because of our peculiar conditions, that burden continues very often until these people, not only reach adult age, but even until they take on family responsibilities.  They still continue to live under costs and charges not adequate to maintain a single person.  If they are lucky enough to attain to a higher standard of wages, they still have to maintain a family on a wage that is barely sufficient even in normal times, as Deputy O'Higgins pointed out, to meet ordinary everyday commitments.  How many of them, because of our failure to live up to the standard that we talk glibly about, must, in addition to family commitments, bear the burden of maintaining their parents or their brothers or sisters or other people who have given service to the community over their lifetime and whose claims on the community are still denied?  That burden very often comes on during the early years of married life and is very often carried into middle age.  The result often is that a man who has been in constant employment for all the years of his working life never has had an opportunity to put by anything for <Col N="2151" /> his sustenance in his old age.  He has had to overcome, possibly, periods of unemployment, when debts have accumulated and have taken years to pay off.  He has had to meet the expenses of the education of children, supporting them until they obtained means of livelihood and very often has had the added burden of aged parents or invalided brothers or sisters.  He has no margin to work upon and so, when he in turn comes to old age, he is completely bereft of any resources to fall back upon.  Those people have given a lifetime of service to the community, yet because we required them to work under difficulties which prevented them from putting by resources for old age they are completely at the mercy of the community and their service to the community and claim upon it is measured at the rate of 10/- a week, plus this 2/6 at the discretion of the home assistance officer, less any paltry income which can be calculated by the investigation officer.</P>
    <P>It can be readily realised that there is an item of finance involved but surely, if there is any one issue on which we can leave aside political differences, it is on the issue of our responsibility to those who have carried on the community before us, who have carried on the national life and who, in their turn, are now dependent on our recognition of their services.  Whatever else may be stinted or whatever other sacrifice may be called for, we should recognise that these people, in the last few years of their lives, are entitled to a modicum of comfort, security, protection and freedom from the harassing they are subject to now by our system of red tape and bureaucratic treatment.</P>
    <P>In the motion it is suggested that we should accept as a standard that the old age pension should be not less than £1 per week.  I do not want to traverse the ground covered by Deputy O'Higgins, because he has approached the question from a much wider viewpoint. We are dealing not merely with the question of the amount needed to recompense old age pensioners for the rise in the cost of living; we have also the feeling that even under normal <Col N="2152" /> conditions £1 per week is not an outrageous sum to ask or to expect for these old people.  When we come to deal with the provision in regard to calculation of income, we are dealing with the very basis on which a great deal of the misery and unhappiness which fall to the lot of these aged people has its source.  First of all we have the fact that the present system of calculation, involving, as it does, a minute and detailed inquiry, and embracing almost every item of income that can possibly arise, raises an immediate difficulty, and one which the Minister on a number of occasions promised to consider, namely, that the existence of the present regulations governing the calculation of income has become an obstacle not only to personal thrift on the part of the individuals concerned, but has become an obstacle to the introduction of what is now recognised as a proper and established feature of ordinary industrial life&mdash;the provision of superannuation and pension schemes to which a contribution can be made from the profits of industry.  Only a few weeks ago I had experience of a case in which this question of the introduction of a pension scheme was raised with a certain company.  Quite rightly from their point of view, they asked why they should be required to contribute towards the financial relief of the Government.  They pointed out that if there was a system whereby they and their employees could operate a scheme under which the full benefits would be given to their employees when they retired, they would join in it, but they could not see their way to do so under present circumstances.  That matter has been brought to the attention of the Minister on various occasions by a number of organisations, by the Trade Union Congress, and by a number of individuals speaking in this House from time to time.  I feel that if the provisions in regard to the calculation of income were amended to some degree in order to allow liberty of action in respect of superannuation schemes, that would bring into existence many schemes of that kind, and not only make it possible for many thousands of industrial workers and workers in commerce to make provision for their old <Col N="2153" /> age, but would generally help to develop those qualities of thrift for which the Minister has such high regard. Surely, even within the bounds of the present regulations, it should be possible for the Minister to issue instructions to his subordinate officers that, in their approach to the applicants for old age pensions, they should at least treat them as human beings, and that where a line-ball question arises, the doubt would be determined in favour of the applicant rather than in favour of the Exchequer.  We have had cases such as that mentioned in the House recently in which an applicant who had no known source of income, who was not employed, had no money put away or no weekly income, yet managed to secure by some extraordinary means one or two meals a day.</P>
    <P>These two meals were calculated by the investigation officer to be worth so much per day, per week and per month until a figure was arrived at which made him ineligible for a pension. When we have a situation like that and when that situation is persisted in even against repeated representations of the old age pension committee, we find that provisions which were inserted for the protection of the Exchequer and of public money are being extended to a point where not only are they becoming absurd, but are becoming intolerable and should be checked.</P>
    <P>In the debate in the House on this motion yesterday, reference was made to what has taken place in other countries.  I do not think we should follow that line particularly, because it is not a very happy line for us to pursue.  The examples placed before us were so far removed from even a conception of what we have at present that they do not bear any sense of reality to what we are discussing. We should take some positive or definite action.  Not only private individuals and political groups, but leaders of the Government here have frequently expressed their belief in the principles of social justice, of equity and of ordinary fair dealing between man and man, and at least in regard to this one item we should expect the Government to put these principles <Col N="2154" /> into practice.  I feel that the Minister will find it impossible to argue that the sentiments expressed in the motion are not sentiments to which expression should be given here and, in so far as the argument will resolve itself solely into a question of how the finances are to be provided, I suggest that he would, because of the sentiments expressed in the motion, make it an instruction to his Department that steps be immediately taken to find in what way the resources of the country can be so drawn upon as to meet what we feel is the responsibility placed upon us as representatives of the community to give protection and security to these aged people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh) Seán T. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>It would probably suit the convenience of the House, and of those who are interested in the motion in a special way, if I intervened before the debate develops further, especially as our time is rather limited.  I should like to say at the outset that I believe there is not a subject of this character which could be raised in the House that would get more sincere and general sympathy from all sides than this question of the treatment of old age pensioners.  In reply to Deputy Larkin, I can say that there is no question of Party politics involved in the matter at all.  It has not come into it so far as I have heard the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People have, of course, blamed the Government for not being more generous, but I do not believe that any Deputy attempted to make what might be called Party political propaganda out of the motion.  Deputy Keyes complained that the motion was on the Order Paper for a very long time, and I think he rather sought to put the blame on the Government for the fact that the motion was so long on the Order Paper without being dealt with. I do not think the blame attaches particularly to the Government; we are all equally responsible.  The business of the House is aranged in a certain way and it so happened that this motion could not be reached until now. After all, Deputy Keyes, as one of those people who arrange the business of the House through the Committee on Procedure <Col N="2155" /> and Privileges, knows that we are bound by certain Standing Orders and that under these Standing Orders a certain time is allotted for the discussion of certain items.  Under that arrangement this motion was not reached until last night.  That was not the fault of the Government any more than the fault of anybody else.</P>
    <P>Apart from that I do not think old age pensioners lost anything in the year or 18 months during which this motion appeared on the Order Paper. I think it may be generally accepted that if an improvement of any character is to be made in the social service of old age pensions, it cannot be made while taxation is at the very high rate it is at present, and that will continue until the war ends.  I do not think anybody will deny that. As far as old age pensioners are concerned, I think, as I have said, that there would be general sympathy for the most generous treatment possible by the State.  Members on this side of the House as well as members of the Opposition would like to see that put in operation and would like to sponsor and help it along.  But, this is the awkward thing regarding old age pensioners&mdash;they are a very numerous body and even a small increase, let us say, a shilling a week, to the 146,000 old age pensioners, would cost a very considerable sum and probably the old age pensioners would not thank you for a shilling a week.  If any improvement were to be made, they would probably not be satisfied with a shilling a week and the House probably would say that it was a mean improvement. At any rate, they would want double that sum and that would cost a very considerable additional amount. At present the all-in cost of old age pensions, in round figures, is £3,900,000.  That is a large sum of money.  The number of persons over 70 is on the increase and, therefore, the number of old age pensioners is on the increase.  At the end of June the number of old age pensioners was 146,000.  The total number of persons over 70 years of age, calculated by the Statistics Department a month or so ago, was 202,000.  The number is increasing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2156" /> That is a difficulty facing the man who is responsible for finding the money, whether the present Minister for Finance or another.  He has to consider the problem in all its bearings. He has to find the money, which is a difficult job at all times.  He has to look at the hard facts of the situation, and the hard facts are that any improvement, even a modest improvement of a shilling a week increase, would cost more money than I, as Minister for Finance, would like to be asked to find in addition to the very heavy taxation we are all bearing at present.</P>

      <P>Yes.  The total would be £5,500,000.  I would have to get £1,700,000 additional and if I put 1/- extra on the income-tax I would get £1,400,000.  I suggest to the House that if Deputy Keyes were Minister for Finance or if Deputy Dr. O'Higgins were Minister for Finance, they would think seriously before they would put an additional 1/- on income-tax already at 7/6, even for the benefit of the old age pensioners.  That would be necessary in order to get the greater part of the money that would be required to meet the improvement suggested in part of the motion.  I need not go over the terms of the motion; they are familiar to you all; but to do all that is recommended in the motion would cost, in round figures, anything between £12,250,000 and £12,500,000.  We are at present spending on this service £3,900,000.  Taking it at £12,500,000 and deducting the present cost of, <Col N="2158" /> roughly, £4,000,000, it would involve an additional cost of £8,500,000 per annum.  Is there any sane man in this House who would attempt, even for such a good service, to put £8,500,000 on to the present £50,000,000 Budget? There is not one.</P>

      <P>The motion involves an extra £8,500,000.  Where would you get it?  I notice that one or two of the Labour members, in speaking, did not back up the terms of the motion as on the Order Paper.  Like Deputy Murphy, they were sensible and realistic enough to know that what is contained in the motion might be an ideal but that they could not expect to see it realised even after the war and they did not ask for it.  They asked for an improvement in the situation and I would like to see that but I do not see any hope while the war lasts and while taxation remains at the extraordinarily high level at which it is at present and has been practically since the war started.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to a question that was asked some time last year, I think, figures were given in the House here as to the increase in cost that would accrue if old age pensions were increased by certain amounts, and it might interest the House to have these figures put on record, as some Deputies might like to see these figures again.  As at 30th September, 1943, the number of pensioners in this country, under the Old Age Pensions Acts, was 147,000, made up of 140,700 old age pensioners and 6,300 blind pensioners.  Now, an increase in the weekly pension of these old age pensioners, including blind pensioners, of 1/-, would amount to a total annual cost of £385,900.  An increase of 2/- per week would amount to an annual cost of £771,800.  An increase of 3/- per week would amount to £1,157,600.  An increase of 4/- per week would amount to £1,543,500, and an increase of 5/- per week would amount to an annual cost of £1,929,400&mdash;that is, leaving the age at 70, as it is at present.  Now, that is our difficulty, and it is the difficulty that will face any Minister for Finance. <Col N="2159" /> There are people who suggest that extra provision should be made for such people.  Perhaps, we ought to thank God that there are so many people over 70 years of age who are still living in this country, but in view of those figures, any Minister for Finance, no matter how willing he may be to increase these pensions, no matter how generous he may be, or how anxious to do what some would regard to-day as being mere justice to that class of the community, he would find it a tough problem to find this money.  At any rate, while the present burden of taxation rests on the community, I do not see how we can provide this further amount.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keyes, in moving this motion yesterday, said that, as a result of the emergency we were able to find something like £8,000,000 or £9,000,000 for the purpose of defence.  When saying that, I do not know whether the Deputy realises that this provision would cost in or about £8,500,000, and he did not point out how we could find that money for old age pensions.  I have always found Deputy Keyes to be a very reasonable man, and I think he would agree that if we could not find that amount of money, in addition to present taxation, at the present moment, and even if, after the war, the amount that is now being made available for the defence of our country could be made available for other purposes, it could not be done.  Supposing, however, that it could be done.  Does not everybody here realise that there would be large and clamorous demands for that money to be used in many other ways&mdash;good and useful ways nationally, from the point of view of social services of this kind, but that would mean that the money could not be devoted to this purpose?</P>
    <P>Reference was made by Deputy Keyes also to what has been done in other countries, and he made comparisons that were not very favourable to our own country.  So far as that is concerned, I agree with Deputy O'Higgins when he said that you cannot properly make comparisons between any two countries&mdash;whether between our own country and another <Col N="2160" /> country, or between any other two countries in the world, since the conditions are not exactly alike in any two countries; and in order to make comparisons, you should have conditions somewhat similar.  This much, however, is true&mdash;and I do not want to be taken as saying that it is a fair comparison, &mdash;that there is a pension paid in England, graduating down from 10/- to 1/- per week, on the same basis as we pay the old age pensions here, and that is on a non-contributory basis.  From 1940, old age pensioners in receipt of 10/- per week are paid an additional sum, in the same way as old age pensioners are paid a small additional sum here, in rural districts, through the local authorities, and there is very strict supervision and examination with regard to the means of these people, but there is no pension paid in England in that way except a contributory pension, and that is at a higher rate than the present pension payable to old age pensioners and their dependents. Again, as I have pointed out, that is on a contributory basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I could give a number of examples to show that we have improved the means test to the benefit of the old age pensioners.  I admit that they are very small items, and that very small changes have been <Col N="2161" /> made, but so far as such changes have been made here there is a definite improvement, which is to the benefit of the old age pensioners.  For instance, there is one small item, which I shall not go into in detail but I should like to refer to it, as Deputy Donnellan mentioned it yesterday, and that is the case of an old age pensioner who has £80 in the bank.  According to Deputy Donnellan, the pension of such an old age pensioner was reduced to little or nothing because he had that £80 in the bank, although he had nothing else except that £80.  Well, our law here, in that regard, is not so severe as the law in England.  We take £25 off what the person has in the bank, and up to the year, 1932, they used to calculate what remained in the bank at 10 per cent., whereas, now, it is only 5 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, if a man has money in the bank, should not that be taken into consideration, since he is drawing interest upon it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I admit that, perhaps, that is a small item, but I wish to point out that the facts are not as Deputy Donnellan stated.  Then, with regard to the case mentioned by Deputy Larkin, of a man being charged for his meals, and a deduction being made where he got meals, here and there, from friends or relations, I think that that is an extravagant case. I do not think that any official would be guilty of taking such things into consideration, but if Deputy Larkin can give me particulars of such cases, I should be glad to have them, but I must say that I doubt that such a thing could have happened,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what Deputy O'Higgins mentioned yesterday, that the cost of living has almost doubled, but we have tried to meet that situation, so far as old age pensioners <Col N="2162" /> are concerned, to a small extent; not to the full extent mathematically calculated in relation to the figures by which the cost of living is increased.</P>
      <P>Practically every class in the community, including the old age pensioners, has had to make sacrifices during this time of emergency.  I do not want to be taking up too much of the time of the House, because I know there are many Deputies who would like to speak on this subject.  I do want to say, seriously, that I would like to see the situation improved for the old age pensioners.  Nothing would give me greater pleasure as a T.D. than to be able to help in that direction, but there is no hope whatever&mdash; and there is no use in putting a tooth in it&mdash;of doing anything while the present high taxation lasts.  I would say that, in present circumstances, the demand made in the motion is extravagant. It may be, as was suggested by some speakers, that they did not intend that a sum of £8,500,000 or £8,250,000 should be added to our present burden of taxation.  There is no way, however, of getting the money except through taxation.  If the speakers intended to put a demand of that kind forward as a headline for the Minister for Finance and the Government as something to be borne in mind for a suitable occasion, I do not object to its being taken in that way, but to suggest, or to argue that anything of the kind is possible during the emergency, and while we have the present high rate of taxation, is not fair.  It is not fair to put figures of that kind in people's minds, to raise their hopes about things that cannot be given to them in present circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have some figures which show what it would cost to do some of the things set out in this motion.  One proposal is to reduce the age to 65.  I do not see that there is any possibility of doing that in present circumstances.  I doubt if it will be possible to do it after the war.  Personally, I would like to do it, but I could not make any promise, and I could not pledge the Government to do it.  I would not be honest with the House if I were to hold out any hope <Col N="2163" /> whatever that, even after the war, there will be a chance of reducing the qualifying age for old age pensions to 65.  Before doing that we would need to know what our financial position would be after the war, and what position we would be in to meet the heavy demands that will be made on us for reconstruction and post-war services of all kinds.  We have plans for the expenditure of extraordinarily large sums of money to meet the situation that may arise after the war.  Some of the plans have already been published, the cost of which total in or about £100,000,000.  Announcements about other plans, when completed, will be made later.  When all that is taken into consideration it will be seen that extraordinarily big demands will be made on every class in the community to provide money for reconstruction and other kinds of works considered necessary.  At the same time there will be demands for improved social services.</P>
    <P>The very fact that in Great Britain a revolutionary reorganisation of the whole social system has been announced, and is likely to be discussed in the British Parliament, is bound to have its reactions here and to set people's minds thinking on similar lines.  The Government is bound to be asked from all sides of the House, and by different classes of the community, if it has any such schemes in mind. Therefore, we will have on the one hand very heavy expenditure on reconstruction of all kinds: on housing, water supplies, electricity to the homes, not only in urban but in rural areas, and in addition we will be asked to provide money for the social services. We have risen, financially speaking, to the heavy demands that have been put upon us as a people.</P>
    <P>It is really wonderful how we have been able to meet the very heavy additional expenditure that the emergency has put upon us.  After the emergency, in order to allow the country to develop industrially, we hope to be able to reduce taxation considerably, nevertheless we will probably be able to rise to the occasion and provide <Col N="2164" /> money for big improvements in essential social services.  As long, however, as we have to face up to the burden of £50,000,000 a year, I think there is no use in asking us to do what is demanded in this motion, even for such an excellent service as that of old age pensions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that the Minister's speech has been somewhat disappointing.  We did expect that, as usual, he would indicate that the main trouble behind the question was where the money was to come from.  I did, however, think that it would be possible for him to announce at least some modification of the means test which is weighing so heavily on the shoulders of people who have reached the age of 70 years.  Personally, I expected that he would more or less implement the sympathetic assurance he gave the House during the last session so far as certain grades of pensioners are concerned.  The people that I refer to are those in receipt of small pensions from industrial firms.  The pensions are reduced when the recipients reach the age of 70 years.  That reduction is made on the understanding that it is then a State responsibility to take them over. The tendency of industry at the present time, as the Minister knows, is to displace men when they have reached the age of 65.  A number of firms, I am happy to say, have instituted, or are in the process of doing so, a certain form of voluntary pension, small though it be.  Its effect, however, has been vitiated entirely by the statutory regulation that, on a certain date, the pensioner can have only a certain maximum income.  I would like to repeat what I said earlier by way of interjection&mdash;I think the Minister will find that I am correct in this&mdash;that while we are operating a British Act here, the modification to which he referred was in a downward direction.  The original maximum income was in the region of £47.  At the present time it is round about £39 15s., so that the potential pensioner suffers a loss of in or about 2/- a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins made a good point last night when he said that, in <Col N="2165" /> approaching a question of this kind, we should have some standard of what is required for bare subsistence in the case, say, of a single individual.  The Deputy deplored the absence of statistics of that kind which, if available, would be of great use to Deputies in discussing a motion of this character.</P>
    <P>It is true we have some rough standards, though they are not of the very best type.  We have the case of St. Kevin's Institution, in this city, where the cost of keeping a patient is about 30/- a week.  We have the case of Grangegorman Mental Hospital where the all-in cost is, approximately, £2 2s. per week.  We know how standards operate in the institutions concerned.  There are about 146,000 persons within the ambit of the old age pensions code.  The income of those people is not more than 16/- per week. That is arrived at after an intensive form of investigation by the Minister's officers.  Seeing that the cost of living is 71 per cent. greater than it was in 1939, I suggest that the comparable figure with 16/- should be to-day 27/-. Even then, the individual concerned would not have a ready market in which to get the articles he required. The form in which an increase of 2/6 has been given to the old age pensioners exemplifies the hardship which these old people are undergoing at present. They have been given 2/6, or vouchers to that value, to meet an increased cost of 11/-.  I am sure the Minister will rightly admit that there is need for immediate revision of standards so far as these old persons are concerned.  There must be, roughly, 140,000 people on the borderline of destitution, from the figures I have given.  If we are to accept the position outlined by the Minister they must remain there because there is no money available to meet their requirements. So long as the country realises that position, this debate will have served some purpose.  But that is poor comfort to the unfortunate people concerned.</P>
    <P>I expected that the Minister would, at least, have indicated a modification of the means test.  Time and again, on questions raised in respect of the <Col N="2166" /> means test from these benches, we have been told that there is no evidence of hardship arising from its operation.  Conditions in the city are different from those in the provinces. We say that there is definite hardship so far as 2,000 of our people are concerned in the City of Dublin.  Every Thursday morning, between 30 and 50 people come before the old age pensions committee in William Street. These are people who have received intimation that they are not eligible for pensions.  They come to the committee by way of appeal and the committee endeavours to help them.  Even after all the help that can be given, it is found that the applications, if not completely turned down, are so dealt with that the scale of pension granted ranges from 2/- to 8/- or 9/-.  I do not blame the officers concerned with the administration of the means test.  They are carrying out a statutory duty but, after so many years, it would be well worth the Minister's while to have an examination of the requirements and bring them more into conformity with present conditions.  A case came before us nine months ago of an individual who was seeking a blind pension.  The means test immediately entered into the question, as in the case of an old age pension.  This individual was presumed to be in receipt of a couple of coppers&mdash;that is how it was described &mdash;for odd jobs he was doing.  He was deemed by the investigating officer to have exceeded the limit allowed by the Act.  The officer's only evidence of income in this case was that, since the man was alive and, apparently, capable of keeping himself alive, he was, presumably, in receipt of 16/- a week and ineligible for the pension. The Minister may say that is an extravagant and isolated case.  I refer to that case to show how the officers interpret the regulations and rules.  The same thing happens in other cases.  In many cases human dignity is violated so far as those old people are concerned.</P>
    <P>As against my colleague, who says that there should be a means test, I say that there should be no means test so far as a service of that kind is concerned. We have an excellent example, in the case of children's allowances. <Col N="2167" /> This scheme of allowances is operating satisfactorily and nobody is questioning the wisdom of excluding the means test.  A good deal of irksome annoyance would be saved to the intended beneficiary if the same rule were adopted in the case of these pensions. Incidentally, I may mention that the operation of the means test in these cases costs the State not less than £30,000 per annum.  The Minister asks: &ldquo;Where is the money to come from?&rdquo;  The same question was asked when the question of introducing children's allowances was raised here but the Bill was introduced later.  The same applies in regard to practically every social service introduced in this House.  An important consideration enters into the question of this particular social service in view of the social security plan brought before the British House of Commons yesterday. We have to-day the announcement that complementary legislation will be introduced into the Northern Parliament. Here is a clear indication that the gap which already exists in the case of education, police and many social services as between the northern end of our country and this end will be widened, to the detriment of any possibility there might be of an early reunion of our country.  There is no question as to where the extra money is to come from so far as social security is concerned.  This is a very pressing and very human matter.  The Minister <Col N="2168" /> was right when he said that, probably, no matter provokes so much interest in the House as this question does.  It is not the special preserve of any Party here.  We are all anxious to do justice to a section of our people who should be assured of security in their old age.  An example is furnished by New Zealand.  New Zealand found itself in a period of stagnation.  It reorganised its services and, on the basis of high wages and reorganisation of its resources, it is in a position to give the very excellent social services which obtain there and which have served as a foundation for the present British security plan.  The Minister referred to the question of national reconstruction. In that respect, there is room for improvement so far as our primary industry is concerned.  If really improved methods are introduced in our primary and secondary industries, it will increase the national wealth, as it has done elsewhere.  It is along these lines that money will be found for services of this particular character.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 42:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (1).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 42 and 43 deal with substantially the same matter.  While the achieving of the object sought in <Col N="2171" /> amendment No. 42 would not be altogether satisfactory, it at least provides an opportunity of raising the whole question of what accounts and statistical information the company must provide.  In an amendment to Section 9, I sought to require the Minister to lay on the Table of the House any regulations which he was entitled to prescribe for the administration of this measure, and one of the regulations which the Minister is entitled to make is one which enables him to prescribe the form of accounts which the company will keep and any statistical information relating to fares or other activities of the company.  I then wanted, and still want, to ensure that the Minister will lay on the Table of the House a copy of the regulation he makes prescribing the type of accounts and statistical information which the company will provide.  This is a national undertaking.  Its capital will be £20,000,000, and the community is interested in its activities inasmuch as it is being tied up to guaranteeing interest at the rate of 3 per cent. on the debenture stock, which amounts to £16,000,000.  It is only reasonable, therefore, that the community should be entitled to know the manner in which the company will keep its accounts, the statistical information it is required to furnish and generally to be made aware, in the most comprehensive manner possible, of the activities of the company.</P>
    <P>This amendment, which, as I said, is not quite satisfactory, provides a means of raising the issue and the alternative amendment, amendment No. 43, seeks to ensure that the Minister will be obliged to consult not merely the company as to the manner in which the information will be provided but the transport advisory committee.  I can scarcely imagine the Minister being able to raise any valid objection to tabling in the House, for consideration by the House, if necessary, the regulation he makes prescribing the form of accounts which the company must present to him as Minister.  If the Minister requires the company to present these accounts in a way which satisfies the House, no harm is done and there is no likelihood of the matter <Col N="2172" /> being discussed in the House or of the Minister's action being questioned.  If, on the other hand, it is felt that the Minister is not asking the company to provide adequate information for the benefit of the public, the only handicap the amendment would impose on him is to require him to consult the transport advisory committee in order to ascertain what, in the opinion of the Minister, the company and the committee, is the most desirable form of information to be provided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, I think, is inclined to exaggerate the importance of this provision.  The purpose of the section as drafted is to enable the Minister for Industry and Commerce to alter, if necessary, the form of the annual accounts required to be prepared and submitted by the company. There is a similar provision in Section 69 of the Railways Act, 1924.  The Act of 1911, which is referred to in sub-section (1) of this section, deals with the manner in which all railway companies shall furnish their accounts and returns not merely to the Minister for Industry and Commerce but also to their auditors, to the registrar of companies and to any of their shareholders who may apply for copies.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this section is to enable the Minister to require Córas Iompair Eireann to prepare its accounts on more modern lines than has been the practice heretofore, adapting them, as it were, to the circumstances of a general transport company. The Act of 1911 was framed at a time when the only public transport undertakings were railway undertakings. Córas Iompair Eireann will be a general transport undertaking and it will be appreciated that the form in which the accounts were prepared heretofore would be antiquated in relation to modern conditions.  The intention is to require the company to produce its accounts in a form comparable with those produced by other commercial undertakings and in a manner that will be more easily understood by people who may not be quite familiar with the details of railway undertakings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy's suggestion to consult <Col N="2173" /> the advisory committee is not one with which I could agree.  I think that body would be a most inappropriate one to be brought into consultation in this matter.  Nor do I think that the regulations made in this connection should be tabled.  These regulations will be made from time to time, but in any event they will be in such a form as to be of little value for the purpose of discussion in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I think there is at the back of Deputy Norton's mind some fear that the purpose of this section is to conceal in some way information in relation to the activities of the company which the Dáil or the auditors or the registrar and the shareholders should have.  The intention is quite the reverse.  The intention is to get away from an out-moded system and have the accounts presented in a proper form, in accordance with modern practice, and in as informative a fashion as possible, both from the point of view of the Minister, representing public policy, and the shareholders, who are naturally interested in the welfare of the undertaking.</P>
    <P>In fact, the power to prescribe the form of accounts which the Great Southern Railways Company must furnish exists in the 1924 Act, and the regulations, which are not subject to review in the Dáil, could be altered at any time.  We are not taking any new power, but in order to make it quite clear that the specific requirements attaching to this company will be different from those attached to all railway companies, it is necessary to have a section in this form enacted.  We can alter the regulations under the 1911 Act in relation to all railway companies, but this company will be different from all others in so far as it will be a transport company of an omnibus kind, and the accounts should be in a form appropriate to that kind of company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The accounts of the new transport company will be somewhat different, we understand from the Minister, from the accounts furnished in the past.  The section sets out that the accounts shall be compiled in such manner as may be <Col N="2174" /> prescribed by the Minister, after consultation with the company.  But a new position will arise in connection with this, because there is the amalgamation with the Dublin United Transport Company, and I would like to urge on the Minister and the House the importance of having those accounts shown in a separate manner. Whatever argument may be made for the inclusion of the Dublin United Transport Company in this new company, at least nobody can deny that it will be bringing into the new company a regular income and, I think, a rate of profit relatively far in excess of that of the old Great Southern Railway.</P>
      <P>As a citizen of Dublin, and as a representative of the citizens, I am nervous of a situation arising in which the citizens, due to the fact that they are not organised, as in such matters all citizens should be, will be asked to pay fares at an exorbitant rate.  Nobody here, not even the Minister, can categorically say what is going to happen in the future.  In these circumstances I think we ought to take what sensible steps we can to see that no situation will arise in which the fares will be exorbitantly raised.  The Dáil should decide that what I might call the purely bus and tram section of the new transport company will have its accounts separated, so that it can be clearly seen whether the citizens of Dublin are paying too much for the privilege of amalgamation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that connection in the past the citizens have had some rather unfortunate experiences.  I do not wish to go into those very deeply, but I should like to mention what happened on the Dalkey line.  I think I am correct in saying that when there was the competition of other bus companies, before the amalgamation, it was possible to travel to Dalkey and back by tram for sevenpence&mdash;that was the cost of the return ticket.  To-day it costs ¼ to travel to Dalkey by bus.  When the trams come back next week it will cost ½.  That is just one example of what happens when competition is taken away&mdash;and all competition will be taken away under the new proposals. <Col N="2175" /> The railway line to Dalkey will be under exactly the same ownership as the trams or buses which will in future travel to Dalkey.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am drawing attention to the unhappy experiences of the past.  The citizens of Dublin have on occasions been charged a high rate.  I wish to make the point that the accounts of what is now the Dublin United Transport Company should be kept separately from the accounts of the other company.  They should be shown in a separate manner in the balance sheet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is a suggestion to prevent the new company getting any benefit out of the amalgamation. If they have to keep the two undertakings in water-tight compartments, they will not be able to effect the economies and alterations in the method of working which the amalgamation would otherwise permit. I consider it would be perfectly unjustifiable for the Dáil to impose such unnecessary expense on the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I fail entirely to see the Minister's point.  Before the war the railway companies were in the habit of publishing traffic returns every week and, I think, passenger receipts.  I do not see why the accounts should not be published separately.  In fact, they will have to be kept separately, otherwise there will be no check on what receipts were obtained <Col N="2176" /> from the various bus lines.  I am afraid it looks as if the public&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be no difficulty in getting information concerning the different services.  If the Deputy wants separate accounts for the Dublin United Transport Company, it will mean that the work in the repair shops, and the staffs, must be segregated between the two undertakings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The importance of this section and of the amendments put down in Deputy Norton's name and my own cannot be exaggerated.  The attitude adopted by the Minister in a previous discussion relating to this matter, and his refusal to meet these reasonable amendments, compel me to believe that he wishes to conceal information which members of this House are entitled to get, especially in view of the drastic powers contained in this and other sections of the Bill.  I ask Deputies who are interested in this matter to realise that, once the Bill in its present form is passed by this House, we will not be allowed to ask one question here concerning the financial administration of this concern. The reason why I suspect that the Minister and his nominee, the present chairman, are anxious to conceal information previously available is this: Look at the accounts for the year 1941, the year prior to the coming into office of the present chairman. They contain 20 pages of interesting information concerning financial administration, personnel and all the essential details in connection with the <Col N="2177" /> working of every section of the railway service, including the omnibus, the road, freight and cartage sections. They also contain a certificate from every one of the chief officers, the chief mechanical engineer, the shareholders' auditors, and the company's auditors, that well-known London firm, Price, Waterhouse &amp; Co.  They also bear the signature of the chairman and secretary.  In other words, there is a certificate from the chairman and secretary representing the board, and from the chief executive officers, in regard to the condition of the company's rolling stock, permanent way and everything else.  It is all very valuable information.  Now look at the accounts for 1943, containing two pages, and described on page 2 as an abridged statement of financial accounts and statistical returns, depriving the taxpayers of the future or the common stockholders, or anyone else who is interested, of very valuable information.</P>
      <P>Another practice has been discontinued by the present chairman, presumably with the consent of the Minister, and a good deal of discussion here in this House in regard to gambling on the stock exchange might have been unnecessary if the practice had been continued.  Anybody who knows as much as the Minister does about this whole business is aware that it was the practice of the board of the company to publish what were known as weekly traffic returns, giving detailed particulars of the tonnage and the gross traffic receipts from year to year.  The present chairman, for some reason that I do not understand, suspended the publication of those traffic returns as from a certain date.  Members of the public, shareholders in the company, and anybody else who was interested, particularly those who gamble in railway shares on the stock exchange, had access to the weekly traffic returns published over a long period of years.  Everybody had the same amount of information.  The publication was suspended for some reason which the Minister may, if he wishes, give the House, but we do not know the reason up to now.  Those weekly traffic returns are still furnished to headquarters, as far as I know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2178" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They are still published periodically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>For some long time past the weekly traffic returns have not been published.  I should like the Minister to give me information as to when they were last published.  I know they are made up.  They have to be made up from figures submitted by every section of the Great Southern Railways Company.  In the making up of those figures hundreds of officials of the company are involved.  They could convey to their friends, if they wished, the information contained in those weekly traffic returns.  That applies especially to the people at headquarters.  But why should the public, the common stockholders, or any other section of our citizens, be deprived of that information, after the coming into existence of this organisation, seeing that every section of the taxpayers may possibly be involved in its financial affairs?  If it fails, they will be involved, because they will have to provide the money to make up the deficit.  They should be furnished with all those particulars, and this House should not pass this section in the form in which it is inserted in the Bill at the moment unless some undertaking to that effect is given by the Minister to the members of the House.  If we pass it in its present form, we may put in whatever Parliamentary Questions we like after 1st January next and we will be told that the matter has nothing to do with the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister might see fit to consult the advisory council or committee which is being set up under the terms of this Bill.  I do not know what that body is going to be consulted about, but if they are to be a representative body of intelligent people they will have to be consulted about something; otherwise they will have no function at all.  This is a matter upon which I think they might be consulted. In my opinion this is a question upon which a regulation should be made.  I think regulations in connection with this particular aspect of the organisation should be laid upon the Table of the House, in order to give an opportunity to members of the Dáil, <Col N="2179" /> after 1st January next, to deal with the form prescribed by the Minister for the presentation of the company's accounts.  I hope the Minister will not stand up and say that the reason why all this information which was given up to the end of 1941 is not given now is that there is a shortage of newsprint. He need not give that explanation to me at any rate, because I know perfectly well that there was plenty of newsprint available to enable every portion of the speech made by the Minister in this House on the Second Reading of this Bill to be circulated all over the country.</P>
    <P>There is another small point concerning this matter to which I wish to refer. This copy of the accounts which I received appears to be different from the one which the Minister had in his possession here in the House a few nights ago.  This is an abridged statement of financial accounts and statistical returns.  Apparently there is a second set of accounts which can only be secured by shareholders on application to the secretary of the company. Naturally, it costs more to print two sets of accounts than it would cost to print one set of accounts giving whatever information should reasonably be given to the taxpayers of the country after this Bill comes into operation. I again appeal to the Minister to reconsider what he has said regarding his refusal to consult the advisory council in connection with the manner in which accounts should be presented by the company to all those who are interested in its future well-being.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The abridged accounts were published in that form for the convenience of people who wanted them in that form.  It was pointed out in the annual report that the official accounts and the statistical returns in full would be supplied on application to any shareholders of the company. These additional accounts which I have mentioned have been issued as usual. There is no alteration in the regulations. The weekly statistics were published by the company voluntarily. There was no statutory obligation to publish them.  Anybody familiar with <Col N="2180" /> those returns would fully understand that they could give no indication of any kind as to the financial position of the company at any time.  The suspension of the publication of the weekly accounts was adopted as a measure of economy.</P>

      <P>This section gives no more power than the Minister for Industry and Commerce has under existing legislation, except to the extent that the existing regulations applied to all railway companies and not merely to Córas Iompair Eireann, the new company constituted by this Bill.  The purpose of this section is to ensure that he will have full power to require the submission of returns and accounts in a proper commercial form, in a form proper to a general transport undertaking which is not merely a railway undertaking, which were the only types of undertakings extant when the 1911 Act was passed.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister see any real difficulty in consenting to tabling in the House a copy of the regulations which he makes, indicating the manner in which he requires the company to furnish their accounts and statistical information?  If the Minister is acting correctly in the matter, then he need not bother his head about the regulation he has made.  If, however, the Minister is not requiring the company to provide the information which the House requires and deems <Col N="2181" /> necessary, the matter can be discussed in the House and the Minister can make whatever explanation he desires, and the House can pass judgment as to whether the Minister is wise or unwise in the manner in which he has acted.</P>

      <P>I have no objection whatever to answering in the House questions as to why the regulations take a particular form, and I have no objection to giving the Dáil full information as to the form in which the regulations have been made, but I think it an undesirable precedent, in relation to matters of that kind, that the Dáil should have the power to annual them.  That is what Deputy Norton proposes.  Every Deputy interested will know precisely what the regulations are, and will be able to see them published, and see the accounts prepared in accordance with them; but it is entirely different to say that these regulations should be submitted to the Dáil, and be capable of being annulled by the Dáil in accordance with the usual procedure.  That is the form adopted only where questions of policy arise, which are a matter of giving a Minister power to make regulations in order to avoid a great deal of unnecessary details in legislation.  In this case, it is a matter of administration only.  The proposal, from the point of view of legislation, is that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, as the protector of the public interest, should have the power to prescribe the form in which this company shall prepare returns, not merely for submission to him, but for its auditors, and for submission to the registrar of companies. That is the proposal here, and it is the intention that that function should be discharged as a purely administrative one.  The Minister is taking power to amend the regulations at any time he thinks such amendment is necessary or desirable.</P>

      <P>I am of the opinion&mdash;I am gambling my opinion now&mdash;that if the weekly traffic returns published over the last 20 years had been published during the year 1943, this gambling on the stock exchange would not have occurred and there would not have been all this hullabaloo.</P>

      <P>I have a fairly good idea of the amount of time it takes to make up the information at the ordinary <Col N="2183" /> stations on the Great Southern Railways, to summarise the information at the stations concerned and send it to headquarters.  I do not know of any station in the country where a reduction of the clerical staff has resulted from the failure of the company to make up and publish this information. There may be some reactions in the section at headquarters, but to say that it is anything in the nature of a great saving is a big joke.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not say that.  I want Deputy Davin to get it into his head that Córas Iompar Éireann, as well as being a railway company will be a general transport concern and, in certain respects, road transport may be as important financially, if not in respect of the employment it gives and other aspects, as the railway undertaking. The regulations of the 1911 Act applied to railways only.  This is an undertaking which is not a railway company only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>One could understand <Col N="2184" /> the Minister's reluctance on this matter if he would take one of the two alternatives&mdash;either to lay the regulations on the Table of the House or to consult the transport advisory council.  He is not quite correct when he says that it is a purely administrative function to prescribe regulations and that no question of policy is involved.  Policy may not be directly involved, but policy is affected.  We have a similar situation in regard to other vital statistics prescribed and collected by officials.  We have to remember that it will not be the Minister as an individual who will be laying down the prescribed regulations, although it will be done over his hand.  The work will be done by his officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the case of the vital statistics of our country where there are very important lapses in the making up of these statistical analyses, as compared with other countries.  We have the same with regard to other information, where the technical man who prescribes the form of statistics or accounts approaches it from the purely technical viewpoint and forgets altogether that statistics do affect policy. I would be more concerned with the second alternative, namely, to consult the transport advisory council, because of the fact that, in a later section of the Bill, the duties of this council are set down as being to consider, report and advise on any matter referred to it by the Minister.  The Minister has gone to some pains to set out that one of these persons shall be a person experienced in commercial and industrial affairs, that a second shall be, in the opinion of the Minister, experienced in labour matters and that a third shall be experienced in transport. It is quite conceivable that the Minister's officials may prescribe the form of accounts&mdash;accounts on which this advisory council will subsequently have to consider and advise the Minister in relation to matter referred to it&mdash;and that these three persons experienced in three forms of commercial and industrial undertakings will find, from their own particular knowledge and experience, that the accounts do not meet their requirements, in so far as the question of policy arises.  I do <Col N="2185" /> not see any reason why the Minister should hesitate to consult with those whose expert knowledge he is later going to call upon and whose expert knowledge must be based on the accounts furnished to them by the railway company in such matters as come before them.  I think the Minister would be well advised, even from his own point of view, apart from the feeling of any group in the House, to see that in the prescribing of the accounts, the experience and knowledge of those who will constitute the advisory committee will be utilised to see that not merely all the information required is made available but, more important still, that it is made available in such an analysed form as the Minister requires and in relation to the matters on which they would be required to advise the Minister.</P>
    <P>The other point raised by Deputy Dockrell is one that should also be borne in mind.  It is quite true that we are going to deal with a single company. No longer will the Dublin Transport Company or the Great Southern Railways Company exist; we shall have a single transport unit, but it is important for the citizens of Dublin to know what is to be the outcome of the amalgamation as far as they are concerned.  The Minister's reply that it would be necessary to present a completely different set of accounts and that this would involve difficulties is all by the way. The Minister knows that when buses are made or repaired in a joint way, the cost of the making or the repair will be entered against the particular section of the system from which the bus comes.</P>
    <P>There is one important feature which is a point which the Minister has glossed over many times and that is that the Dublin United Transport Company&mdash;I am speaking now of it not in relation to its corporate identity but merely as the transport system of Dublin&mdash;starting in 1936 had a net profit of £91,000, in 1937 of £78,000, in 1938 of £83,000, in 1939 of £100,000, and in 1943 of £333,000.  The Minister is not going to fool the public or pull the wool over their eyes by saying that that increase from £100,000 to <Col N="2186" /> £300,000 was solely the outcome of very good management and wise financial administration.  We, in Dublin are concerned to know whether the methods which have been utilised in Dublin during the years that that surplus has grown from £100,000 to £300,000 are going to continue and, if they are going to continue, where the benefit is going to accrue.  If it is merely going to be a question of Dublin being the milch-cow for the whole national transport system, on the basis of the conditions we have had to put up with in Dublin for the past three or four years, we ought to know it with our eyes open.  There should not be any possibility of that particular form of extraction from the citizens of Dublin being covered up by having the accounts so prescribed as to lose the identity of the Dublin section of the system.  The separation of the accounts in the manner desired does not present any difficulty.  It merely means that up to a certain point the ordinary income and out-goings of each activation of the company are scheduled and set aside before being put into the common pool.  Certainly the Dublin citizens are entitled to know whether they are being requested to pay an excessive price for their transport in order to ensure that the reorganisation is going to be a success, a thing which the Minister sometimes seems to doubt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the advisory committee, it would be a completely inappropriate body to bring in on this matter.  It would be no part of its function to advise on the administrative affairs of the company.  The Deputy need not be afraid that the committee will be in any way prejudiced in the discharge of its functions by the form in which the accounts are prescribed, because we propose that the committee should have all the powers of the High Court to require the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents and to get any information whether it is prescribed in the accounts or not.  I could not agree that there is any case to be made for the keeping of separate accounts for the Dublin area any more than there would be for the Cork <Col N="2187" /> area.  We are now establishing a national organisation and once that is established a new situation has been created.  I think it would be completely wrong to do as Deputy Larkin suggests, to put this obligation on the company with all the inconvenience that that would involve merely to give opponents of the national organisation certain ammunition to use.</P>

      <P>There is no case for the advisory committee unless the Minister refers it to them, so the advisory committee has no function in the <Col N="2188" /> world unless the Minister calls on them and says that he wants them to do this. I think there is nothing that would be more important for the transport advisory committee to consider, or at any rate to be in a position to consider, than the relative costs of the various types of services.  The transport advisory committee should be in a position to advise that the accounts should be presented in such a way that we shall see to what extent the road services are paying for the rail services, and to what extent the passenger services in the City of Dublin are paying for the road services throughout the country.  How we can have an assurance, particularly under monopoly control, that the most efficient and the cheapest transport is being given to the country except we can examine these things, I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am assuming that, and we have every reason, after what has been done and what has been said, for assuming that.  It has been pointed out before that, contrary to the explicit recommendation of the Transport Tribunal, £1,100,000 has been taken from the City of Dublin for the repayment of debentures.  There was £682,000 taken for the repayment of debentures which had formed part of the company's borrowings from 30 to 40 years.  That money has been recouped out of the payments of the citizens of Dublin for their transport since 1939.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it would be very disastrous to the confidence of the people generally in the administration of their transport, knowing that it was possible for such a thing to happen in Dublin, if they felt that there was no need for finding to what extent that might happen in future or to what extent high charges paid by the passengers of the City of Dublin, largely working people, might be utilised in order to maintain the road system or the rail system in other parts of the country. I do not think there can be an efficient <Col N="2189" /> preview of the way in which transport is organised and the return transport is giving the country unless we have a system of statistics that go to show to what extent money is being paid towards one part of the system by the running of another part.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 44:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2190" /> Before Section 27 to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  The company shall, not later than twenty-one days before the ordinary meeting of the company to be held in any year (other than the year 1945), forward, on the request of any holder of stock of the company, to that holder a copy of the accounts (prepared in such form as the Minister may direct for the purpose of this section) of the company for the immediately preceding year.</P>
    <P>(2)  So much of sub-section (3) of Section 1 of the Railway Companies (Accounts and Returns) Act, 1911, as requires an incorporated railway company to forward a copy of the accounts and returns to any share holder or debenture holder of the company who applies for a copy shall not apply to the company.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to enable a form of accounts to be prepared for the shareholders on more commercial lines than those prescribed by the Railways Act, 1911.  That Act, as I explained before, applies to companies generally and is being retained to enable the Government to secure uniform financial and statistical information for transport policy purposes. Section 25 of the Bill, which has just been passed, provides that the information to be furnished under the 1911 Act by the new company may be amended.  The amendment is to ensure that these accounts may be and will be furnished to the shareholders of the company in accordance with the form prescribed.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 45:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (4) and substitute therefor the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4) A director, officer, official or employee of the company shall not be eligible for election as auditor and any firm of auditors in which a director, official, officer or employee of the company has any interest by way of partnership, shareholding or <Col N="2191" /> otherwise shall not be eligible for election as auditors.</P>
    <P>Section 27 provides for the appointment by the company, at its annual meeting, of an auditor or auditors who will audit, the accounts of the company. Sub-section (4) of the section provides that director or officer of the company shall not be eligible for election as auditor.  The object of the amendment, however, is to ensure that a firm of auditors in which a director, officer or official of the company has an interest shall likewise be ineligible for election as auditor.  That would create the position then that not only will a director or officer of the company not be eligible for election as auditor, but that a firm of auditors will not be eligible for election if an officer, a director or an official of the company has an interest in that firm.  I think the Minister will see quite clearly that the object of the amendment is to prevent any suggestion that anybody who is a director, officer or official of the company can arrange matters in such a way that his friends in the auditing line can have anything to do with the accounts of the company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we should accept this amendment.  It seems to me to convey an implication against the integrity of the accountants' profession.  I do not know if that was intended, but that is what is conveyed to me.  The election of auditors is a matter for the company, and I do not think we should limit their discretion any more than is done in the Companies Act.</P>

If the Minister goes so far as to say that a director or officer of the company will not be eligible for election as auditor, it seems to me to be necessary corollary to that that if a director or officer of the company has an interest in a firm of accountants, that firm ought likewise be debarred from auditing the accounts of the company.</P>

That cleanly, is undesirable, and this amendment seeks to ensure that it cannot possibly happen.  The Minister admits that it is not desirable to have a director or an officer of the company who may be in a position to audit the accounts of the company, but it would appear that he is prepared to look calmly, in the case of this company, at the possibility of directors of officials of the company auditing its accounts.

      <P>Even if that were so, is it not justification that under the Minister's provision neither the chairman nor any of the directors or officials of the company shall be eligible for election as auditors?  Suppose that a director should be appointed, who is also an accountant: is it not possible for his firm of accountants to be appointed to the position of auditors of the company's affairs?

      <P>I move amendment No. 47:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (1).</P>
      <P>This amendment was put down for the purpose of preventing any further facilities or encouragement being given for the continuance of this out-of-date proxy voting system. I do not know if the Minister is aware of the power that is wielded by a very small number of individuals who have been privileged to use this method of voting. It is a method that is used by the management of the Great Southern Railways Company and, presumably, by the Dublin United Transport Company. I know, and I am sure the Minister knows, that some of the existing directors of this company go around on a canvassing tour collecting proxies from convents, banks and other institutions. Naturally, they get them very easily from banks and other institutions. These proxies give them the power to carry their own point of view at a shareholders' meeting when their authority is challenged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was reported in the press in recent times that, when the shareholders of the Great Southern Railways Company challenged the authority of the existing directors to do certain things which, in their opinion, were not the interests of the company, the chairman of the company pulled out proxies from a box&mdash;on some occasions they would not all fit in his pocket&mdash;and planked them down on the table.  With these millions of proxies, he simply declared that the motion moved by the common or ordinary stockholders was defeated. This section, as it stands, proposes to extend the existing objectionable system. I hope that the Minister will either give a good reason for the insertion <Col N="2198" /> of sub-section (1) or agree to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy somewhat misunderstands the position. There are no provisions in relation to this company in the matter of proxy voting that do not apply to all companies.  By Section 7 of the Bill, which incorporates the Companies Acts, we have already provided for proxy voting in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Acts.  One schedule of the Companies Consolidation Act of 1845 has, however, not been incorporated for other reasons, and it is that schedule that provides for the appointment of proxies under power of attorney.  It is, therefore, necessary to insert this section here to enable the same provision as exists in the Companies Consolidation Act relating to the appointment of proxies under power of attorney to apply in the case of this company.</P>
      <P>The general power for the appointment of proxies is covered by the incorporation of the Companies Acts in the Bill, and it is merely a matter of drefting that the sixth schedule of the Companies Consolidation Act of 1845 could not be incorporated, and that special provision has to be made in this section fir the appointment of proxies under power of attorney.  We are not proposing, in relation to this company, any provision in that regard that does not apply to all companies coming under the Companies Consolidation Act of 1845.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At some stage the question of the revision of that Act will arise, and, possibly, legislation will be proposed for that purpose.  I think it would be a matter of very dubious wisdom to propose that the power of appointment of, and representation by, proxies should be abolished because it might lead, in certain cases, to very undesirable decisions being made on behalf of shareholders of a company, by a minority of those shaerholders who found it convenient to be present at the annual meeting.  I think that in the regulation of companies it is clearly desirable that every shareholder should have the the right of expressing his views by his vote at the annual meeting. even <Col N="2199" /> when he cannot be present, and that, of course, is the purpose behind the power to appoint proxies.  However, we are not, as I have said, proposing in relation to this company anything that does not apply to every other company under the Companies Acts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from the Minister's statement that the power would still remain for individual shareholders to appoint proxies even if this section of the Bill were deleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>That does raise a principle which the Minister appears not to realise&mdash;the principle of proxy voting by corporate bodies in relation to this new company.  The Minister's defence, as in the case of the previous section, is that we should not seek to alter general company law in dealing with a particular company.  But we are dealing here with a company of a peculiar nature and having a peculiar interest for this legislative body, because we are the parents of this company and we are undertaking responsibilities on behalf of the citizens in bringing it into being.  It would be a bad principle if we were to have a situation arising similar to that which arose in the past in the case of the two companies now being amalgamated &mdash;the possibility of two, three or half a dozen shareholders, or directors, exercising, by the proxy votes of corporate bodies, an overwhelming voting power a the annual meeting.  There is no desire on the part of the mover of the amendment to exclude or limit in any way the right of the individual shareholder or any shareholder to have his views expressed by proxy vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objection is to proxy votes being exercised on behalf of a corporate body.  In the past, the influence and weight carried by the proxy votes given by corporate bodies to shareholders at annual meetings has been the determining factor at these meetings. They have determined policy for the company and they determined personnel so far as the board of directors was concerned.  As a matter of fact, <Col N="2200" /> these proxy votes are the root cause of our present legislation.  The inability of the management of the company to take advantage of the aid given in legislative form from time to time by the Government in order that the company might adapt itself to changing situations has brought the company to its present pass.  We have had this sorry result in the past because of the system of proxy voting on the part of corporate bodies and this concentration of voting power in the hands of a small number of individuals. In dealing with the company in which large public interests are directly involved&mdash;not only is the question of Government guarantees but the question of public policy as a whole is involved&mdash;it is a good thing to ensure that this system of block voting will not be permitted to continue, as in the past, to such an extent that the effective voting power at the annual meetings can be concentrated in a small number of hands.</P>
    <P>It will not interfere, as the Minister pointed out, with the rights of the individual shareholder.  It will not interfere even with the rights of the corporate bodies because, with the exception of certain religious bodies, the other&mdash;banks and insurance companies&mdash;always be represented at the annual meetings.  There is no difficulty about the matter.  This collection of proxy votes given by the corporate bodies and concentrated in the hands of a number of individuals, mainly directors&mdash;sometimes solicited and sought in a sort of &ldquo;general election&rdquo; campaign&mdash;has been in many ways a bad influence on the general life of the country for the past ten or 15 years. We should pay attention to the views expressed on a number of occasions by ordinary shareholders.  Those who had gone to the trouble of attending the annual meeting to expressed their views, perhaps in a constructive way, with regard to the management of the company were overborne by the silent votes of shareholders not present at the meeting.  That may be a situation which can be allowed to continue under the company law as a whole until such time as we come to deal with the amendment of that law, but here we <Col N="2201" /> are dealing with a company which we are bringing into existence now and in which public policy and, possibly, public finance, are involved.  I think that the Minister should ensure that public policy and public finance will not be at the mercy of those silent votes, sought for, canvassed and exercised by individuals who, in the past, have shown themselves incapable of carrying on the management of the undertaking of which they were given control.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not follow that argument.  We are constituting this company.  The company will consist of the holders of the common stock. That may be a good thing or a bad thing but it is what we have decided upon.  These individuals may be wise or foolish, in our judgment, but we have decided to constitute them the company. I do not know how many of them there will be&mdash;whether 3,000, 4,000 or 5,000.  Conceivably, we might say that they must meet in person at the annual meeting of the company to discharge the business which falls to be done.  But company law says that shareholders may be represented there by proxy&mdash;that they may give another person the right to vote on their behalf on any issue that arises.  That is what company law permits in regard to other companies and what I propose it should permit in the case of this company. That is a far a safer arrangement than taking the risk that only a minority of shareholder will turn up and that they may arrive at decisions contrary to the wishes of the majority, or decisions detrimental to the interests of the company, in the view of the majority.  The Deputy may object on the ground that the majority of the shareholders in the past chose to give their proxies to the directors of the company.  Acting on their own judgment, they chose to do that.  It may be held that those directors were not always worthy of the confidence the shareholders placed in them, but in the type shareholders must be given the right to decide who will represent them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That does not really arise on this section because power of representation <Col N="2202" /> by proxy at the annual meeting is provided for by the Companies Clauses Consolidation Act, which is incorporated in this Bill.  It was a mere drafting difficulty which made it impossible to incorporate, at the same time, the power to appoint proxies under power of attorney.  Even if we were discussing the general question of company law, we should be very slow, indeed, to provide that a shareholder should only be able to exercise his vote in person at the annual meeting of a company.  That would be an undesirable practice to establish having regard to the risk it would involve.  I think that these is noting undemocratic or unsound in principle in the theory of giving shareholders the right of representation at company meetings, the right to act through a representative, because that is, in fact, what the appointment of proxies amounts to.</P>

I am assured that the present directors are selected at private meetings of the directors of the banks.  My objection to this whole business in that one of those directors named in the proxy forms can go down to a shareholders meetings and, irrespective of the arguments put up against a particular policy, can pull out of his pocket or out of a box a bundle of proxies and carry the meeting against the wise of single shareholders.</P>

      <P>The representatives of different unions are there and they can listen to the arguments.  Particular individuals went around to convents&mdash;I know perfectly well that directors of railways and of the transport company have gone to converts&mdash;and by that undemocratic method secured the signatures of Reverend Mothers when these nuns has no more idea of what was going to happen than the man in the moon.  At a meeting the business is explained and Mr. So-and-so gets signatures representing so many shares.  No matter how sensible proposals against the existing board may be, the latter have the necessary proxies and can out-vote anybody else. It is because I believe that the Bank of Ireland has a controlling influence in the nomination of directors and in the proxies that are sent out year by year, that I am opposed to any further facilities being given for the continuance of this out-of-date system.  I should like to know if the Minister, in view of some words that he used when speaking earlier, was indicating that the Government has under consideration certain proposals for the amendment of the Act of 1845.  Am I to understand that the Minister is giving <Col N="2204" /> consideration to an amendment of that Act?</P>

      <P>That is the point we are anxious to get at.  We are not interfering with a corporate body.  The Minister referred to trade unions, but at least they get an agenda and resolutions beforehand.  Even in the largest unions. there is a form of discussion amongst the members before authority is given to exercise the card vote. What opportunity is given in the case of banks acting as trustees, who control railway companies?  The funds they represent are considerable because the banks give power to whoever they select.  That is a very considerable power.  I have never attended such meetings, but from what I learned from those who were present I understand that it is a common feature to have three large blocks of proxy votes, and these can control the business.  The Minister may be right in saying that we are not dealing with company law here.  This is not company law as I understand it.  When dealing with an ordinary commercial company in which people invest money there is a legal enactment by which the proper transaction of business is secured.  Here we are dealing with public interests of a financial and political nature.  Surely it is not right to allow such a situation to develop as happened at the annual meeting three months ago.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 48:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (1) and substitute the following two new subsections:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The directors of the company may close the register of the transfers of common stock for a period not exceeding 21 days previous to each ordinary meeting and each meeting of the directors of the company at which it is proposed to consider the declaration of an interim dividend.</P>
      <P>(2)  The directors of the company may close the register of transfers of debenture stock of a particular issue for a period not exceeding 21 days previous to any day on which interest on that debenture stock is payable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provision has been made for the closing of the registers of the transfers of common stock for the period of 21 days previous to each ordinary meeting. I do not know if it will ever happen that the company will be in a position to consider the declaration of an interim dividend, but, as a necessary provision in case such a situation <Col N="2207" /> should arise, it is desirable that the company should have power to close the registers for 21 days prior to the holding of the meeting at which the question of the declaration of an interim dividend might be considered.. Similarly, there is at present no provision for the closing of Debenture books and it is considered opportune to have that position clearly defined in the case of debenture stock as well as in the case of common stock.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 49:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2) line 42, to delete the words &ldquo;some daily newspaper published in Dublin&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;in every daily newspaper published in Dublin and Cork&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not understand why power is sought to give some daily newspaper in Dublin a special privilege.</P>

      <P>That is the usual provision, but in practice the advertisement appears in all papers.  If the Deputy attaches importance to the matter, I will not fight him on it.  The practice would be in accordance with his wishes.  I am dubious about the wisdom of prescribing &ldquo;every daily newspaper published in Dublin and Cork&rdquo;, because, while we probably would know the daily newspapers published, it might happen in certain circumstances that somebody might claim to have a daily newspaper about which we did not know.  I should imagine that is the reason the section is worded as it is.  However, if the Deputy will leave the matter over, I will accept his point in principle, subject to its consideration by the Parliamentary draftsman. What the Deputy means is that the advertisement should appear in all the known daily papers, but that particular form of wording might not be suitable.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 50:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2208" /> In sub-section (1), to delete paragraph (b) and insert the following new paragraphs:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(b) three directors appointed by the Minister, and</P>
    <P>(c) three directors (in this Chapter and in the Fourth Schedule to this Act, referred to as &ldquo;stockholders directors&rdquo;) as is provided by the said Fourth Schedule.</P>
    <P>This section is one to which the members of this group are violently opposed.  I do not know if any sound argument, can be put forward as to why the chairman is put practically in the position, if not in fact in the position, of a dictator.  It is quite true that the section makes provision for the appointment of a person &ldquo;under this Act referred to as the chairman&rdquo; and that the appointment of other directors known as stockholders' directors, is also provided for.  Under the provisions of the different sub-section, it is quite clear that although the other six shareholders' directors are given the title of directors, in the opinion of this group, they have no power other than that of office boys.</P>
    <P>Anybody who read the early industrial history of Italy during the period after Mussolini came into power may be able to find argument to justify this proposal.  I have recently been reading the Report of the Vocational Organisation Commission, which gave very interesting information regarding industrial organisation in almost every country in the world, and I could read extracts from sections of that report dealing with the history of industrial organisation in Italy to justify, if I wanted to do so, the putting forward of a proposal of this kind.</P>
    <P>The Minister in a previous discussion put forward certain arguments in favour of the appointment of stockholders' directors, but this group is not satisfied that there is any necessity for the appointment of stockholders' directors, especially when these people are not given any power except the right to draw very generous fees at the end of each year.  I hope it is pertinent to point out that the stockholders' directors who have occupied the position of directors since Mr. <Col N="2209" /> Reynolds was elected chairman are the very same men, with one exception, one director having died, whom the Minister holds responsible for the mismanagement and bankruptcy of this concern.  If these are the people responsible for the bankruptcy of the transport industry, I do not think it should be made possible for them to retain their positions on the board. The amendment enables the Minister to appoint a majority of the members of the board.</P>
    <P>The Minister did make the point on Second Reading that he thought it was impossible for him to ensure that the transport policy of the Government be put into operation by any more than one person; in other words, he seems to think that it is only through the agency of the chairman, with the powers given to him in these clauses, that the transport policy of the Government could be put into operation. He repeatedly stated that from his experience and the experience of the Government in relation to the management of other concerns&mdash;I presume the Sugar Company, the Agricultural Credit Corporation, the Turf Development Board and other boards on which Government nominees have been put &mdash;he has some reasons for believing, although he did not give them to the House, that these concerns have not been as well conducted as the Minister and the Government would wish.</P>

      <P>I do not know anything about the internal working of the Electricity Supply Board, but there seems to be general agreement in the country that they have been doing their job fairly satisfactorily.  I think it is <Col N="2210" /> true, and I say it without meaning to be provocative, that a number of the persons appointed to the boards of concerns such as those I have mentioned were appointed not altogether because of their qualifications or experience in the commercial world, but because of their political affiliations with the Government Party of the day. That applies with equal force to the previous Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in relation to the appointment of nominees to the boards of State-subsidised concerns.  If you have a chairman who knows his job, who knows how to handle the finances of a concern and he assisted, as the amendment proposes, by three other persons nominated by the Government who believe in the same policy, I do not see the difficulty in carrying out Government policy.  The idea of having directors representing the stockholders of the company who are said to be responsible for the mismanagement and bankruptcy of the transport industry in the past is something which should by cut out, but not alone is it not being cut out under the terms of the section but the same provision is being made for the future as exists at present.  It is possible under the section for shareholders to appoint a director who recently came under public notice in another place.</P>
