      <P>I am aware of the existence of the body to which the Deputy's question refers.  In conformity with the customary practice of neutral states, recognition has not been given during the course of hostilities to any new State or régime which owes its existence to the changing fortunes of the war.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he will state the number of British airmen who were released from internment in the State in recent months, with a view to saving <Col N="1082" /> the cost of their maintenance; also the number of German airmen released from internment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There were no releases with the object of saving the cost of maintenance.  Releases took place on the basis indicated in my reply to the Deputy on the 3rd November last.  I am not prepared to go further into detail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is strongly rumoured throughout the country that a number of British internees have been released and I would be very glad if the Taoiseach would confirm or deny that in order to clear up these rumours.  If British internees have been released, why not release a similar number of German internees, if we are neutral?</P>

I said: &ldquo;Releases took place on the basis indicated in my reply to the Deputy on the 3rd November last.&rdquo;  If he looks up that reply, he will see what the basis was.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that there are two prices fixed for beet pulp of the 1944-45 beet crop, viz., £5 5s. 0d. per ton to farmers who take back their pulp and £7 per ton for surplus pulp; whether he has approved of this change; and, if so, if he will see that the difference in price, 35/- per ton, is given back to the grower who leaves his pulp for sale; and whether he will have a clause inserted in the beet contracts to that effect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take these three questions together.  As the Deputy is aware, Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann, Teo., which was set up under the Sugar Manufacture Act, 1933, is a limited liability company operating under the Companies Acts. The board of directors has full responsibility for the management of the affairs of the company.  Consequently, I cannot answer Parliamentary questions relating to the company's affairs, including the relations between the company and the Beet Growers' Association or the contracts entered into between the company and the growers.  As regards the price and other conditions applicable to sugar beet grown in 1944, a Government's decision was taken approving of the terms to be offered by the company to the growers, and these terms were made the subject of an official announcement <Col N="1084" /> in accordance with the procedure followed in previous years. I was made aware of the views of the Beet Growers' Association regarding the price for beet in 1944 and kindred matters, which had been conveyed by the association to the company before the question was raised with the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the question of the price of beet for the 1944-45 crop was not even discussed with the sugar company by the Beet Growers' Association; that the Beet Growers' Association requested a round-table conference as between the Beet Growers' Association, the sugar company, and the Department of Finance in order to fix the price for beet; that that was only refused on the 19th January and the price was announced on the 21st without giving the Beet Growers' Association even an opportunity of putting their case before the sugar company?  In view of that, does the Minister approve of that action or is that the manner in which a price should be fixed during a time of emergency as between food producers and those who handle the raw products afterwards?  In view of the unsatisfactory nature of the Minister's reply, I propose to raise the matter on the adjournment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to understand from the Minister's reply that the Government are taking responsibility for fixing the price of the raw material, namely, the beet, but they are not prepared to take any responsibility with regard to the price fixed by the company for the by-product?  Is that the Government's position in the matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Beet Growers' Association got no opportunity to discuss this matter with the sugar company or with the Department of Agriculture?

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he has received representations that some of the months selected for the carrying out of public works should be left free for tillage and ancillary operations; and, in particular, that the months of April, May and June should be substituted for January, February and March; and if he will cause inquiry to be made for the purpose of ascertaining whether and to what extent the present arrangements interfere with tillage and seashore activities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Employment Period Orders render ineligible each year large numbers of <Col N="1086" /> rural workers for the receipt of unemployment assistance between the second week of March and the end of October and the maximum activity on employment schemes is, therefore, confined to the period mid-November to mid-March.</P>
      <P>Exhaustive inquiries into the matter raised by the Deputy were made some years ago, when it was found that it was only in a small number of cases in Connemara that employment schemes were interfering to any appreciable degree with agricultural operations. Since then general instructions have been issued each year to close down works when they are in danger of interfering with the requirements of agriculture, and to release individual workers who wish to attend to their holdings.  For these reasons I do not consider further inquiries are necessary, but I shall keep the matter under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he is aware that the quality of flour produced to-day is not suitable for home baking and if he will take steps to have the quality of flour improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish flour millers are making every effort to produce the best possible type of flour of the permitted extraction from the cereals which are available.  Tests which are being made show that it is not correct that the quality of flour produced to-day is unsuitable for home baking, but it appears that the change over from the brown flour to the new flour presented some difficulties to home bakers due to inexperience in the use of the flour which, apparently, requires different treatment to either 100 per cent. flour or pre-war flour.  If these tests, when completed, disclose any material factors which are likely to assist the home baker, the information will be made available to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a general complaint exists as regards the standard of this new flour, which has been issued in the past three months?  I am of the opinion, from what I have heard, that the only people who have benefited from the change over are the members of the medical association.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the flour released for home baking contains a much higher percentage of home-grown wheat than the flour supplied to the millers?  Is it not a wrong principle to encourage the production of bread by bakers as against bread produced in the home? Would the Minister not consider that the home bakers&mdash;the people baking their own bread in the home&mdash;are entitled to at least as good flour as is supplied to the bakeries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It has always been the practice to produce a bakers' flour with a high percentage of hard wheats.  I do not think that a shop flour could be produced in the same way.  It has always been the practice to produce shop flour mainly from soft wheats. At the present time the percentage <Col N="1088" /> of hard wheats going into any type of flour is determined by the supply position. The new flour requires different treatment in home baking to either pre-war or 100 per cent. flour; and, particularly, it is necessary to exercise more discretion in the use of baking powders, as anything of an alkaline nature tends to produce unsatisfactory results.  I may say that it was a very long time in Great Britain before the millers were producing a satisfactory flour of a similar character to that which we are trying to produce here now and before uniformity of standard was achieved.  I think our millers are not in a position in which they have adjusted their machinery fully to produce the most satisfactory type of flour; but the tests that are proceeding will help to alleviate the difficulties.  If those tests reveal that there is advice which should be given to the public in the use of the flour for home baking, that advice will be made public as widely as possible.</P>

      <P>I am aware that difficulties are being experienced in securing wood fuel in sufficient quantities to meet the abnormal demand associated with the present fuel position. This may be due to a scarcity of suitable timber adjacent to the city and to transport difficulties.  It is probable that the number of railway wagons and canal barges available for the transportation of wood fuel will increase in the present season, due to the passing of the peak demands on transport facilities for grain, beet and turf traffics.  I can, however, hold out little prospect of increased allocations of petrol for the transportation of wood fuel by road.  Adequate stocks of good quality turf are, however, available to meet reasonable requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>For the reason that I have given.  The company proceeded with the manufacture of a large number of plants which could have been fitted, but if that were done it would mean that a number of the vehicles would have to be withdrawn from service. The traffics did not permit of that.  Under the arrangement made, a fitting programme was agreed upon which satisfied me that the company were carrying out the regulation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out that the withdrawal of the petrol allowance to other transport operators occurred only where it appeared that no arrangements had been made to equip their vehicles with gas producer plants?  In every case where transport operators produced evidence that orders had been placed for the plants, or that the plants were in process of manufacture, the petrol facilities were continued.  The same treatment was given to the Great Southern Railways Company except that in their case, because of the magnitude of the scale of their operations, it was necessary to ensure that their fitting programme did not cause any interruption in transport facilities.  They, of course, had to make a larger number of plants than other operators would require. These plants have now, I understand, been manufactured, and the company are in every respect carrying out the requirements of the regulation.  The company have been granted no exemption <Col N="1092" /> whatever from the conditions attached to other operators.</P>

      <P>Surely the Minister is evading the question.  He has already said that all the lorries owned by the Great Southern Railways Company were not in service.  I suggested that, if that were so, it would facilitate the company in taking lorries in and having them fitted with gas producers.</P>

      <P>I have received the representations referred to by the Deputy.

All millers are permitted, when cleaning a bulk of wheat for milling, to remove screenings, seeds and dust to the extent of 1½ per cent. of the total weight of the bulk.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder does the Minister understand the situation?  The 1½ per cent. refuse that is removed is infinitesimal in comparison to the quantity of meal that is being ground. It does not remove the dross.  The Minister possibly knows that threshing mills are not allowed to screen wheat with a rotary screen, with the result that there is a good deal of outside matter&mdash;refuse and that sort of thing&mdash; in the wheat.  As the season advances the position in regard to this is getting more serious.  I do not want to engage in a discussion with the Minister across the House about this, but I should like to discuss it with him or <Col N="1095" /> his representatives.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to reply to Questions Nos. 17 and 18 together. Workmen who are otherwise eligible for weekly compensation under the British Workmen's Compensation Act, <Col N="1096" /> 1925, are debarred by Section 16 of that statute from receiving compensation if they cease to reside in Great Britain unless the injury in respect of which compensation is being paid is likely to be of a permanent nature. If the injury is certified by a medical referee to be of a permanent nature a workman may continue to receive compensation while residing outside Great Britain provided he fulfils certain conditions.  In view of the effect of British legislation in this matter in relation to Irish workers proceeding to temporary employment in that country, I considered it desirable to make arrangements, which have been in operation for some time past, under which workmen who are granted travel permits have been furnished with a notice explaining the position under British law as to payment of workmen's compensation should they return to Ireland.</P>
      <P>Negotiations are in progress with the appropriate authorities in Great Britain with a view to enabling weekly payment of workmen's compensation in respect of temporary incapacity to be continued, should the workman cease to reside in Great Britain.  I am not in a position, however, to indicate when the result of these negotiations will be known.</P>

      <P>I am fully aware of the hardship imposed on Irish workers by reason of this provision in British law. The reason why that provision was inserted in the law when passed in 1925 will be obvious.  I have represented to the British Government that present circumstances are abnormal in so far as workers are proceeding there for temporary employment who may not be permitted, under the British regulations, to remain there, and, consequently, to continue to receive the compensation which their injuries would entitle them to have.  I cannot say that it is possible to expedite negotiations in the matter, nor can I indicate what the results of the negotiations are likely to be, but I can inform the Dáil that we have made representations on these lines to the British authorities.</P>

      <P>The granting of an emergency bonus to any particular officer or employee or class of officers or employees is a matter for the responsible local authority in the first instance. Any such proposals made by local authorities during the past year have been approved by me where the increases proposed were within the limits applied to lower-paid civil servants, Gárdaí and national teachers, in which cases the bonus was payable to whole-time officers in receipt of a total remuneration of not more than £397 16s. a year, and part-time officers with a total remuneration not exceeding £261 a year.  Dispensary medical officers are part-time officers of the local authority and practically all of them have been in receipt of remuneration exceeding the limit of £261 a year. There were other classes of officials, mostly whole-time officers of local bodies, who also did not receive any emergency bonus since they were in receipt of total remuneration exceeding £397 16s. a year.</P>
      <P>Under the Government decision of 20th January, 1944, the total remuneration in respect of which bonus increases may be granted to Government employees has been raised to £500 in the case of whole-time officers and to £365 in the case of part-time employees. I have received no proposals for the grant of bonuses to dispensary medical officers since the publication of that decision which raises the limit of total remuneration for part-time employees from £261 to £365 a year.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that the £30,000 grant to the Infant Aid Society is inadequate to meet their requirements; that the increase in the price of milk has resulted in a reduced supply of highest grade quality milk being distributed by the society; and if, in order to allow the full advantage of the society's work to be achieved, he will increase the grant to allow them to purchase the quantity of highest grade milk required.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully aware that the Infant Aid Society performs very useful work for the corporation in the distribution of milk to necessitous children on behalf of the corporation. The State grant of £30,000 for that purpose is a very generous one and has been payable over a number of years without any proportionate contribution from the corporation.  Normally the entire cost of this service should not fall on State funds.  In the case of child welfare and other kindred services the local authority bears a proportionate share.  The full State grant of £90,000 for the supply of milk to necessitous children, of which Dublin receives £30,000, was allocated amongst local authorities at the commencement of the financial year.  Any expenditure by the Infant Aid Society on behalf of the corporation in supplying milk to children in Dublin in excess of the amount of the State grant would be more appropriately met by the corporation.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's suggestion that an increase in price has resulted in a reduction in the amount of milk being distributed, I think it well to point out that, since the price began to increase, milk is also supplied under the food allowance scheme administered by the Department of Industry and Commerce to children of recipients of unemployment assistance, widows' and orphans' pensions and certain other classes.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will make arrangements whereby persons who are summoned as jurors at the Circuit Courts will be paid adequate travelling and subsistence allowances in respect of the time and expenses incurred when attending these courts, especially in view of the fact that most of the people summoned on such juries are small farmers who can ill afford to lose the time spent on jury service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The duty of citizens to serve on juries in criminal trials without reward or recoupment of expenses is a very old feature of our judicial system.  It does, no doubt, involve occasional hardships to individuals, but I am not satisfied that these are so frequent or so serious as to call for the change suggested in the question. In the particular case of County Wexford, the minimum rateable qualification for jury service is £20 for a house or £40 for house and lands taken together, and each individual juror is called on for service only about once in every three years.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister consider it good policy to have small farmers going to these courts and having to stop in hotels and lose their time when they could be cultivating the land?  Under the old régime it was considered an honour to be a juryman, and it was well-off people who served on juries.  The class of people to whom I refer cannot afford to lose time attending as jurors at the Circuit Courts in Wexford.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that some jurors in County Wexford have to spend three days away from home, although they may be only called to serve on a jury for one day? Is the Minister aware that some of these jurors reside such a long distance from Wexford that with the present travelling facilities it is impossible for them to attend court in time unless they spend a night away from home, and if they serve on a jury they cannot get home until the next day?  That means staying out three days.  I think <Col N="1112" /> the Minister's answer to my query on a former occasion was that jurors were summoned only from the vicinity of the town.  I ask the Minister to make further inquiries, as I think he will find it to be the fact that a number of jurors have in fact been summoned to recent courts from considerable distances and that they were unable to get home until the next day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think something has been done during the emergency.  In reference to Deputy O'Leary's question, I do not think that really small farmers are asked to serve.  A valuation of £40 on house and land represents a reasonably sized farm.  As to the point raised by Deputy Esmonde, steps have been taken since the emergency arose to limit the number of jurymen to seven, and there is power to restrict the area from which they are summoned.  There is no reason why they should not be able to get home if a case is not finished in one day.  In civil cases jurors are not now necessary in the Circuit Courts.  That is during the emergency.  I think the steps which have been taken should prove satisfactory.  I do not think there is any necessity to make any change such as is suggested by the Deputy.  I shall have inquiries made as to what happened in County Wexford. The authorities try to draw jurors from such a restricted area as will give the jurors a reasonable chance to get home the same evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the selection of allottees for parcels of untenanted land to be divided, the primary object of the Land Commission is the relief of congestion.  Subject to that criterion they consider applicants under the categories specified in Section 31 of the Land Act, 1923, as extended by Section 33 of the Land Act, 1933, to which as the statutory basis I would refer the Deputy.  There is no specified statutory order of preference, but (subject to the statutory condition that the Land Commission must be satisfied as to the competence and intention of all allottees to work <Col N="1121" /> the land) broadly speaking the applicants who are considered to have the strongest claim to allotment are&mdash;former herds or other employees on the lands acquired, former evicted tenants or their representatives, local uneconomic landholders, migrants who give up their holdings elsewhere for the relief of congestion, trustees for communal purposes, such as sportsfields, school gardens, turbary, pasturage, etc., local applicants for accommodation and cottage plots, local landless men.  In practice any large scheme of division is likely to include persons or bodies coming under each of these categories.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if his attention has been called by county councils and other representative bodies to the urgent necessity of again renewing the policy of acquiring land in view of the wholesale speculation on land by financiers; and if he will pay particular attention to the acquisition of land in congested districts where the land so acquired could be divided amongst uneconomic holders who are not seeking residence or outhouses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>The present curtailment of the acquisition of untenanted land for division by the Land Commission is not dictated by policy, but by the hard necessity of emergency circumstances. The matter cannot be regarded merely by itself, but must be related to other relevant factors, particularly the provision of adequate trained staff.  The Land Commission are fully alive to the importance of the relief of congestion and are endeavouring <Col N="1122" /> to secure relief by migration as far as conditions permit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask, under what circumstances can a private Deputy become possessed of an Order made by the Government? Under the Emergency Powers Act, a Rent Restriction Order was made recently.  I certainly did not get a copy of it and I understand that, so far as the public are concerned, it was <Col N="1130" /> sold out at 11 o'clock in the morning. Having regard to the fact that it is in effect a complete Act of Parliament and that, if it were an Act of Parliament, it would probably have received considerable amendment at the hands of the members of this House, I think it would be most desirable that an Order of that importance, and all Orders of that importance, should be circulated to private members. Those of us who were in the country at the time the Order was issued were placed in an inferior position with regard to getting possession of it compared to a person who had early access to the Government's Stationery Office in Dublin.  It is possible for us to exercise the rights that are left to us under the Emergency Powers Act to call for a repeal of any particular Order such as this, if we wanted to do so.  I am not speaking about the terms of the Order itself but of the principle that is involved.  As these Orders are coming out from the printing press as fast as they can be printed, we may come up against some very drastic Order in the future to which a considerable number of members of this House, possibly a majority, might object.  I think it is against all the fundamentals of democracy, and certainly against the spirit of the terms of the Emergency Powers Act, 1939, that individual members should be placed at that disadvantage.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this Bill is to make further and better provision for the enrolment, certification, control and <Col N="1137" /> training of midwives and for other purposes relating to midwives and the practice of midwifery.  The existing law in these matters is contained in the Midwives (Ireland) Act, 1918, the Central Midwives Board Order, 1923, and the Midwives Act, 1931.  The Act of 1918 provided for the constitution and establishment of a Central Midwives Board for Ireland and gave the board statutory powers in relation to the training of midwives and their registration in the roll of midwives to be kept by the board.  The board were empowered to regulate and supervise the practice of midwifery, to take disciplinary measures in regard to midwives. A specified fee was to be paid to the board by every woman presenting herself for examination and certificate&mdash;such fees to be devoted by the board for payment of expenses.  If in any year the income derived from fees was insufficient to cover the expenses of the board they were empowered to apportion the deficit between the councils of the several counties and county boroughs in proportion to rateable valuations, and the councils were required to pay the amounts so apportioned. Each county and county borough council was given supervisory powers relating to midwives practising within their district.  They could investigate charges and had power to suspend midwives from practice in certain cases.  The councils were known as local supervising authorities for the purposes of the Act and each council could act by themselves or through their medical officer.</P>
    <P>As the statutory powers of the Central Midwives Board extended to the whole of Ireland it was necessary when Saorstát Eireann was established to provide for the exercise of their functions within the new State.  This was done by means of an Order made in pursuance of the Adaptation of Enactments Act, 1922, entitled the Central Midwives Board Order, 1923.  The Order provided for the establishment of a Central Midwives Board for Saorstát Eireann and conferred on the board all the jurisdictions, powers and duties of the Central Midwives Board for Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Midwives Act, 1931, gave power <Col N="1138" /> to the Central Midwives Board to issue badges to midwives.  It also prohibited unqualified or unauthorised persons from attending women in childbirth.</P>
    <P>From time to time the Central Midwives Board have made representations for the amendment of the provisions of these enactments to meet administrative difficulties experienced by the board.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(a)  The Act of 1918 required the local supervising authorities to pay to the board the moneys apportioned to them within six months from the date of the receipt of the precepts or warrants for the amounts payable, or within such further period as might be agreed upon.  Under this arrangement a period of at least six months might elapse before the board were paid the amount of the deficit shown in their accounts at the end of the year.  The outstanding liabilities which went to make up the deficit might have been incurred early in the year.  It can be readily understood that an embarrassing financial situation might thus arise. The board suggested that statutory provision should be made to enable the board to be placed in funds to meet expenditure pending the receipt of the amounts assessed on the local supervising authorities.</P>
    <P>(b)  The Act of 1918 required each woman presenting herself for examination and certificate to pay to the board such fee as the board with the approval of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health might from time to time determine but not exceeding the sum of one guinea.  When this provision was made the period of training was six months and candidates for admission to the roll of midwives were required to pass only one examination. The period of training is now two years and there are two examinations. It is suggested that the board should be empowered to charge a fee for each examination.</P>
    <P>(c)  By the Act of 1918, the board were given power to decide upon the removal from the roll of midwives of the name of a midwife for disobeying the rules and regulations <Col N="1139" /> for the time being laid down by the board, or for other misconduct.  The board were not, however, empowered to require witnesses to appear before them to give evidence in any proceedings for the removal of the name of a midwife from the roll.  For the effective performance of the functions of the board it is essential that they should have this power and also that the procedure for the removal of a name from the roll should be specified in detail.</P>
    <P>(d)  When a local supervising authority, after investigation, establishes a <i>prima facie</i> case of malpractice, negligence or other misconduct on the part of a midwife practising within their district they are empowered to report the same to the Central Midwives Board but they have no power to suspend the midwife from practice pending the decision of the board and they have no means of preventing the midwife from practising even though they may have reported her for a serious offence.  It is very necessary that the local supervising authority should be given this power.</P>
    <P>(e)  The Central Midwives Board also consider that they should be empowered to grant certificates of competency to teach midwifery.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When steps were being taken to draft a Bill embodying the amendments suggested by the Central Midwives Board, it was found difficult to provide amending provisions to harmonise with those of the Act of 1918 on account of the great contrast in terminology. It was therefore decided to draft a consolidating Bill to re-enact the provisions of the previous Acts and to provide for the suggested amendments.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before the House provides for the establishment of a board to be styled and known as the Central Midwives Board, consisting of eleven members, seven to be appointed by the Minister, four of whom shall be midwives ordinarily resident within the State selected by the Minister after consultation with representative nursing organisations, and one at least of <Col N="1140" /> the remaining three to be appointed by the Minister shall be a registered medical practitioner.  The other four members of the board are to be registered medical practitioners ordinarily resident within the State elected by the registered medical practitioners so resident.</P>
    <P>Appointments and elections are required to be made quinquennially, as is the case with the existing board, and the election years are so fixed as to provide for continuity in the election periods provided for in the existing enactments and those proposed under the Bill.  The members of the present board who are in office when the Act comes into operation will continue in office as members of the new board, and as the last appointment and election to the existing board will take place at the beginning of 1944 the first election year for the purposes of the new Act will be 1949.  It is provided that a member of the board may resign his membership, while the Minister is given power to remove a member from office.  The appointment and term of office of the chairman of the board are also provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The board are required, subject to the consent of the Minister, to appoint such officers and servants as they may from time to time think proper and to pay them such remuneration and allowances as they may from time to time determine.  The power given to the board to grant retiring allowances or gratuities to any of their officers and servants leaving their service is a new provision.</P>
    <P>The board must submit to the Minister a report of their proceedings each year and furnish to him and publish after the end of each year a statement of their receipts and expenditure, including liabilities, certified as correct by the Minister acting through a local government auditor.  When this statement shows a balance against the board they are required, with the consent of the Minister, to apportion such balance between the local supervising authorities in proportion to rateable valuations, and post to each such authority a notice specifying the <Col N="1141" /> amount assigned to them.  Each local supervising authority is required to pay one-fourth of the amount so assigned within one month, and the balance within three months, after the receipt of the notice.  These time limits are fixed with a view to obviating the delay in payment of deficits to which I have referred earlier in this statement.</P>
    <P>The only other point in connection with the finances of the board to which I propose to refer is the new power given to them by Section 20 of the Bill to set aside moneys for a fund to meet contingencies.  It is considered desirable to provide such a fund.  Various situations may arise involving substantial expenditure which could not be held over and dealt with in the annual deficit of the board.</P>
    <P>The board are required to maintain and publish a roll of midwives and to keep the entries in the roll correct. The secretary to the board is charged with the custody and correction of the roll.  Registration in the roll of midwives is governed by Section 24 of the Bill, under which the board are required to register in the roll every woman who: (a) applies for registration in the prescribed manner; (b) has completed the prescribed course of training; (c) has passed the prescribed examinations; (d) satisfies the board that she is of good character, and (e) pays the prescribed fee.</P>
    <P>The board are also empowered to register a woman who has been trained in any other country provided that they are satisfied that the training and examination undergone in such country is of a standard not lower than that adopted by the board, and that the authorities in such other country certify or are prepared to certify women registered under the new Act on reciprocal terms.  The board are prohibited from registering any woman in the roll of midwives whom they consider to be physically or mentally unfit to attend women in childbirth.</P>
    <P>By Section 25 of the Bill the board are given power to remove the name of a midwife from the roll of midwives in accordance with rules to be made under the Act, and such rules must in <Col N="1142" /> particular make provision that where it is proposed to remove a name from the roll, proceedings in that behalf shall be instituted before the board, and that in such proceedings the defendant shall have an opportunity of answering the allegations made against her.  The grounds upon which a name may be removed from the roll are:&mdash; (a) infamous misconduct or professional misconduct; or (b) conviction in the State of treason, or of a felony or misdemeanour, or outside the State of a crime or offence which would be a felony or misdemeanour if committed in the State; or (c) conviction of an offence under the Act; or (d) disobedience to the rules of the board; or (e) physical or mental unfitness to attend women in childbirth.</P>
    <P>The board may take evidence on oath in any such proceedings, and require any person to attend and give evidence in relation to any matter arising in the proceedings, and to produce documents.  The board may, in lieu of removing the name of a midwife from the roll, caution or reprimand the midwife, or suspend her from practice for a period not exceeding 12 months.  A midwife may appeal to the High Court or to the Minister from a decision of the board to remove her name from the roll of midwives or to suspend her from practice.</P>
    <P>Section 30 of the Bill gives power to the board to restore to the roll of midwives, for any reason which they consider sufficient, the name of any midwife which has been removed therefrom. In addition to the power of the board to suspend a midwife from practice in lieu of removing her name from the roll, they are empowered by Section 33 of the Bill, where proceedings have been instituted for the removal of the name of a midwife from the roll, to suspend the midwife from practice pending the decision in such proceedings.</P>
    <P>Section 35 of the Bill contains the new power proposed to be given to the local supervisory authority to suspend a midwife from practice where, after investigating a charge against her of disobeying the rules of the board or of other misconduct, they report a <i>prima facie</i> case against her to the board.  A <Col N="1143" /> local supervisory authority is also empowered by Section 36 to suspend a midwife from practice where they are of opinion that this course is necessary in order to prevent the spread of infection, and by Section 37 to suspend from practice any midwife against whom proceedings have been instituted in the District Court for an offence under the Act.  A local supervising authority is required to exercise general supervision over the midwives practising in their district.</P>
    <P>On the question of the education and training of midwives the Bill sets out the powers of the board in detail.  The board may make provision for the courses of training and examinations to be taken by candidates for registration in the roll of midwives and for the approval by the board of lecturers and teachers in institutions in which the courses of training may be taken and for the conditions of admission to examinations. The board may, under Section 40, make provision for optional courses of training and examinations for midwives and for the granting of certificates and diplomas to midwives taking such courses and passing such examinations.  This section will meet the wishes of the Central Midwives Board in regard to the grant of certificates of competency to teach midwifery, but their power under the section is not limited to the granting of such certificates.</P>
    <P>Section 48 of the Bill extends the powers of the board by enabling them to require midwives to attend from time to time such courses of instruction as may be approved by the board or provided or arranged by them.  This is a new power and it will enable the board to require midwives to attend post-graduate courses.</P>
    <P>By Section 32 of the Bill the board are required to issue a certificate to every midwife whose name has been entered on the roll of midwives.  Where the name is removed from the roll the certificate must be surrendered to the board.  The board must return the certificate to the midwife if her name is restored to the roll.  Where the midwife dies, the person having the <Col N="1144" /> custody of the certificate must return it to the board.  Similar provisions are contained in Section 45 as regards badges issued to midwives.  The section also contains an express prohibition against the unauthorised wearing of a midwife's badge, or the wearing of a coloured imitation of a midwife's badge, or the lending of a midwife's badge.</P>
    <P>Section 42 of the Bill permits a midwife to add to her name the designation &ldquo;State Certified Midwife&rdquo;.  This is a new provision.  The next section provides that it shall not be lawful for any person other than a woman registered in the roll of midwives to take or use the name or title of midwife either alone or in combination with any other words.  A prohibition is contained in Section 49 of the Bill against the attendance on women in childbirth of unqualified or unauthorised persons.</P>
    <P>A midwife is required by Section 46 of the Bill to give notice to a local supervising authority where she proposes to start practising in their district and also to give notice annually thereafter of her intention to continue practising in the district.  If she attends a woman in childbirth outside the district of the local supervising authority she must give notice of such attendance to the local supervising authority in whose district she attended the woman.  The midwife must also inform every local supervising authority within whose district she is practising of any change in her name or address.</P>
    <P>Where a midwife attends at a childbirth in which any emergency occurs, she is required by Section 47 to call a registered medical practitioner to her assistance, and if the patient is one upon whom the midwife is attending in the course of her duties as midwife of a dispensary district she shall call to her assistance the medical officer of such district if he is available.  Where the medical officer of a dispensary district attends a person eligible for medical assistance under the Public Assistance Act, 1939, in response to a call from a midwife in pursuance of this section no fee is payable to him by the local supervising authority in <Col N="1145" /> respect of his services.  An appropriate fee may be paid by the local supervising authority in any other case.  This section differs slightly from Section 22 of the Act of 1918, under which no fee could be paid to any medical practitioner called in by a midwife in an emergency to attend upon a patient who was entitled to medical relief under the Medical Charities Act.</P>
    <P>The Bill concludes with transitory provisions essential to provide for continuity of administration between the existing board and the board provided for in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the Bill carries out the purposes outlined by the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;the securing of better attendance at childbirth, better training of midwives and more efficient supervision&mdash;every person in the House, and outside, will be strongly behind it.  The greater portion of the Bill is undoubtedly designed to achieve these purposes and, so far as it is so designed, it should get the support of all, but very frequently when a Bill emanates from a great Department, it starts out to do one thing and then there is a little clause here and a little section there which end by doing possibly the very opposite.  A person reading this Bill hurriedly would be inclined to approve of it without reservation.  A person reading the Bill closely would see that the Bill, apparently designed to save women and children, is more specifically designed to save pounds and shillings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 47 lays it down in a mandatory way to midwives that, if they require medical assistance, they shall call in the dispensary doctor, and then the words &ldquo;if available&rdquo; are added. Most of us here are familiar with dispensary districts.  Let us take rural dispensary districts.  A rural dispensary district may stretch from end to end over a distance of eight miles, and, in many parts of the country, over a far greater distance.  There is a maternity case at the extreme end of the district. The nearest doctor may be just 100 yards away, while the dispensary doctor may be seven miles back.  The Bill makes it obligatory on a midwife, if she requires assistance, to requisition <Col N="1146" /> the local dispensary doctor, if available.  It is not known whether he is available or not until he is sent for and the Bill in this respect applies to the destitute poor.  It is not a question of motor cars, of somebody running out a car and driving 5, 6 or 7 miles, but a question of somebody going on foot, on a bicycle or in a donkey and cart; and by the time the word comes back that the dispensary doctor is not available, hours have passed and possibly, if not probably, a life or two lost.</P>
    <P>I am reading this section as it will be read by the ordinary midwife. Lawyers or experienced parliamentarians might argue that the paragraph is not so very rigid, that &ldquo;if available&rdquo; can mean &ldquo;if conveniently available&rdquo; or &ldquo;if immediately available,&rdquo; and that a certain amount of discretionary power is left to the midwife.  As the ordinary person will read that paragraph, there is an obligation on the midwife to ascertain if the dispensary doctor is available, and only when she hears that he is not can she get assistance from any other quarter, and all that risk is taken with human lives to save a fee of perhaps three guineas three times a year in a rural district.</P>
    <P>I think the Bill would be improved by the removal of that section and that the situation could be met by an instruction to midwives, who are officers serving under the Department of Local Government, that there would be a responsibility on them to explain to and satisfy the county manager that there was adequate reason for requisitioning the services of a doctor other than the dispensary doctor.  But, as the section stands, it will be read by nervous, inexperienced people&mdash;inexperienced in the reading and interpretation of Acts of Parliament&mdash;and it will be rigidly carried out by narrow-minded auditors and the dread of a surcharge by the auditor will lead to hours of delay in getting medical assistance for a woman in labour.  I feel perfectly certain that the Parliamentary Secretary is not in favour of the section and that it was injected into the Bill by finance-minded officers in his Department.  The Bill would be improved, lives would be saved, the lot of the midwife would <Col N="1147" /> be made less anxious and skilled assistance would be more readily available to the afflicted poor, if the section were dropped.</P>
    <P>I know the background of this. There were certain abuses in the past, particularly in the City of Dublin, where dispensary midwives requisitioned the nearest doctor, and not always in an emergency, and fees had to be paid in a great number of cases, where another salaried officer was available for the job and his services were not requisitioned.  The fact that there were some slight abuses in one part of the country which involved in all a few hundred pounds is no justification for worsening the lot of patients in childbirth and making more anxious the lot of the midwife away in a remote part of the country, up against a difficult case and generally by night.</P>
    <P>If that nurse is to do her work efficiently and competently, we must be conscious of the fact that human beings are afflicted with nerves, and the less anxiety that presses on a midwife, the better she will do her job, and it will be an ease to both nurse and patient to feel that, if anything arises, they can command the services of the nearest doctor.  A matter of £5 or £10 a year in a dispensary district when we are dealing with the lives of women and children should not be magnified to the extent which it is magnified here.  If we were dealing with brood mares, if we were dealing with cows, there would not be the same tendency to make the job more difficult and relief less speedy for the sake of a possible saving of a couple of guineas per annum.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary knows better than I that in the country the districts are large and straggling, and that very often one doctor's dispensary district goes to within 100 yards of the next town.  His place of residence may be miles away.  A midwife up against a difficult case, a critical situation, where minutes if not seconds may make all the difference, will feel bound to send a cyclist or pedestrian perhaps six miles or seven miles, by night, to get the local dispensary doctor.  That is a mistake.  That is defeating <Col N="1148" /> the objects of the Bill.  I think it is entirely unwise.  I am encouraged in making these remarks because I feel that what I am saying will support the Parliamentary Secretary within his own Department in convincing others that this is not a Bill intended to save pounds or shillings or pence; it is a Bill designed to save human life, and there has to be a sense of proportion and a sense of realism injected into most of our Government Departments. If it is to be a Public Health Bill, or if it is a Medical Aid Bill, then the voices that must speak loudest inside that Department are the voices of those primarily charged as experts in that particular field.  Their opinions and their voices and their views must not and should not be subordinated to the views of expert financial accountants.</P>
    <P>We have in the same section of this Bill another provision aimed at saving or gathering in one or two or three guineas per annum.  It provides that where a nurse, in an emergency, in a case that is not a destitute case according to the Acts, requisitions the services of a doctor in order to save two lives, that automatically is evidence of the liability of the husband, and that that statement itself should be sufficient evidence to get a rule of court that the husband must pay the fee. Every one of us knows that there is a big mass of our population in between the lower line of destitution and the upper line of those capable of paying a reasonable professional fee; that there are great numbers of people who are not, in the legal sense of the phrase, destitute people, people entitled to a dispensary ticket, but who are nevertheless not in a position to pay a professional fee.  A midwife is called out on any such case and she finds that it is an emergency case; she must have medical aid.  She requisitions the nearest doctor, and under this section the manager is bound automatically to collect from the husband.  That may be a seven or ten acre farmer.  That may be a struggling tradesman.  That may be some very tiny shopkeeper&mdash; somebody who is just above the destitution mark, and not entitled to a dispensary ticket.  The doctor is paid by the manager and the section entitles <Col N="1149" /> the manager to collect from the husband. Even the hands of a court are tied by this particular section.  Auditors will come from the Minister's Department, and they will ensure that, if there is not a ticket to account for the case, the money must be collected. In the past, points such as that were left to the discretion of the board of health, nine or ten sensible, honest, local people, who knew the local circumstances, and who would say to their secretary: &ldquo;Ah, well, so-and-so may not be a dispensary case, but he is not a person who can pay a fee.&rdquo;  If this Bill stands as it is at the moment, the auditor will ensure that every effort is made to collect in 100 per cent. of the cases.  I think that is unwise. I think it is merely a utilisation of a very good Bill by financial fanatics. The amount of money involved, as the Parliamentary Secretary knows, is not worth talking about.  If we are to do good, do not let us always endeavour to do good through the medium of irritations, and particularly of, comparatively speaking, worthless irritations.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other matters in the Bill that I do not understand, and to which the Parliamentary Secretary did not refer.  Under an earlier section of the Bill the board is constituted, a board of quite clearly responsible people: so many members of the nursing profession, so many nominated by the Minister either from the nursing profession or from the medical profession, or both; and so many elected by the medical practitioners.  Yet, Section 6 (d); without any explanation, reads: &ldquo;The Minister may remove any member of the board.&rdquo;  Now, they are elected or appointed only for 12 months, and surely if such a situation arises&mdash;I do not know what is the idea at the back of the section&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>What set of circumstances would arise in the meantime to make it necessary or desirable for <Col N="1150" /> the Minister to remove them?  If they should be removed&mdash;no one of us is perfect&mdash;I would suggest that the removal should be done by the board itself.  It takes from the Bill to present a picture that those 11 people are only, as it were, time-serving creatures dependent on the pleasure of an individual; that if they do not carry out the will of an individual they are removable; that their tenure of office is not worth a day's purchase.  I am not reading all those sinister things into the Bill at all, but that bald little section standing by itself is in my opinion entirely superfluous, and it is distinctly unwise to have it in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have one further word to say: this is one of a number of Bills and regulations that are going to increase the strain on the midwives of this country.  It is going to subject them to more supervision.  That is all to the good.  That is in the interests of the public.  It is going to subject them to far tighter control.  It is going to make their livelihood far more precarious. It is going to have them operating under the fear of being removed from the register at any time.  It will undoubtedly increase the number of rules under which they live, and, to that extent, increase their duties. Now, war or no war, the payment that is given to that body of women, Irish midwives, is a scandal to any State&mdash; salaries ranging from £40 a year or 15/- a week upwards, for qualified professional people, subject to all kinds of restrictions, subject to all kinds of supervisory control; salaries that were fixed in many cases in the last century, and in all cases prior to the rapidly increased cost of living arising from the emergency; salaries that were fixed, as the Parliamentary Secretary knows, at a time when most destitute cases were attended by handy women and when the midwife got the bulk of private cases and a very small percentage of the destitute cases.  Since then, we ensured, by legislation, and properly so, that no handy woman would attend a person in childbirth.  We increased the work of the midwives.  We passed legislation and regulation, one after the other, to ensure that their attendance would <Col N="1151" /> be prompt, that it would be continuous, that they would carry out a system of notification within 24 hours, and that they would keep their records written up.  The Central Midwives Board made many highly desirable regulations which increased the cost of the midwife's calling.  It laid down that she should have so many white coats, so many sets of overalls, and that they were to be regularly laundered. Her salary for four weeks would not purchase the outfit or even the replacement of one of the articles which she is compelled to have.  Yet the salary has remained the same.</P>
    <P>I know that there are many midwives practising in this country at present who are practising on the verge of starvation.  Since Christmas I visited a midwife who was in trouble and I could see the stamp of starvation on her face.  I would debase my professional signature before I would sign the type of report that I should sign in that case if the woman was in her health.  I have heard it said: &ldquo;There is only a birth-rate of 15 per year in that district.  We are paying at the rate of £3 for each case.&rdquo;  That is not the point.  If the poor of that district are entitled to have a midwife, it is not her fault that the birth-rate is so low.  She should have a livelihood.  If the birth-rate is so low as that, what is the prospect of private practice?  In the next district the salary may be the same and the birth-rate may be 200 per year.  Do you hear any of the same set of officials saying: &ldquo;We only pay 15/- a case in the next district?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Every place where the Minister's Department appoints a midwife the salary should go up as the birth-rate falls.  A low birth-rate is an indication of the poverty of the midwife.  There are districts not far from Dublin where there is not as much as £10 a year to be earned in private practice.  If we are to overhaul the whole service of midwifery in the country&mdash;and I am glad to see it being done&mdash;if we are going to see that the standard of qualification is higher, that the degree of competency is increased, that the work is carried out under much stricter conditions, <Col N="1152" /> then one of the things that should occur to any of us is to ensure that a reasonable salary is paid to highly-qualified people for a very responsible and a very anxious type of duties.</P>

      <P>Will the Deputy allow me for a moment?  This Bill does not deal with the payment of midwives.  I do not know how far the Minister is responsible for their salaries.  It is quite in order to make an incidental reference to the remuneration as Deputy O'Higgins has done.  It should not, however, be the burthen of the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand.  The only point I really wanted to make was that the fact that this Bill increases the length of training is an obvious reason for dealing with the matter.  Just one other point.  The fact which is known to everybody, as it was published in the public Press of this country, that one local authority was not able to obtain a midwife for a certain district, I think in Tipperary, because she could not live on the salary she was to get in that particular district, indicates how serious that problem is.  I really wanted to refer to two points from the point of view of saving money to the board, the supervising authority and, possibly, on occasion, to the midwives themselves.  If the Parliamentary Secretary will look at Section 22 (d) provision is made there for recovering sums which may be apportioned to any supervising authority and that amount may be recovered as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction.  There is just a possibility that that would lead to excessive costs, entirely unnecessarily.  I put it this way to the Parliamentary Secretary.  The wording &ldquo;in any court of competent jurisdiction&rdquo; obviously means that if the sum exceeded £300 the action would have to be brought in the High Court.  If the sum exceeds £25 and is under £300, it would have to be brought in the Circuit Court. There is already a provision in regard to other matters that, no matter what <Col N="1153" /> the size of the sum is, where a local authority is recovering money off ordinary persons the action may be brought in the District Court irrespective of the amount of money involved. For instance, where a board of health, or the county manager as representing a board of health, seeks to recover money from the estate, we will say, of a person who dies in a county home and who is discovered to be in possession of certain assets, if the sum is £70 or £80 or £90, the local authority can bring that action in the District Court in excess of the usual jurisdiction. As this is a sum fixed by the board and apportioned on the local authority and there cannot be any doubt about the amount, or the rights or wrongs of the payment, I suggest that under that section the action could be brought in the lowest possible court which has jurisdiction in cases of simple contract and where the lowest possible costs would be involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also think that that same point might apply to the question of appeals where a person is removed and the right of appeal arises under Section 28 of the Bill.  That section sets out that the person concerned may either appeal from the decision of the board to the High Court or to the Minister, but not to both, within three months of the notification.  Obviously again there the appeal from the decision of the board to the High Court, if the person concerned chooses to take that line of action, will be a very costly affair both to the board and to the person concerned.  If I take first the case of a midwife who may feel that she has a grievance and has a just cause of appeal against the decision of the board, she would not be in very affluent circumstances and to my mind would find it extraordinarily difficult to obtain the necessary amount of money to bring an appeal of that sort to the High Court.  I think there would not be any reasonable objection to altering the words &ldquo;High Court&rdquo; to &ldquo;Circuit Court&rdquo;.  The judges of the Circuit Court are of sufficient standing to be able to deal with an appeal of that nature.  It would have the advantage that the costs to the person concerned would be very much less, because the <Col N="1154" /> case would be heard in her own district and would be taken within a reasonable time.  It would also be an advantage to the board.  In the case of an appeal to the High Court, if the decision was in favour of the board and costs were allowed to them, the board and the State or the local ratepayers would be involved in the expense of a High Court action with no possible hope of ever recovering one penny, even though they had been granted costs.  I mention these two points because I honestly think that those two sections are made rather unwieldy by the fact that, in one case, there should be no necessity at all for having to bring an action for the recovery of the statutory payments due under the Bill, while in the other one, I think that the Circuit Court would be far enough to go to give a person a chance to appeal.</P>

      <P>I would like to add to what Deputy O'Higgins has said in regard to the employment of a doctor. The section says that the medical practitioner must be the medical officer of the dispensary district, if available. One could understand that being insisted on if every dispensary doctor lived in the centre of his dispensary area; but everyone knows that that is not the case.  In many cases, the dispensary doctor lives at the extreme end of a very long area, perhaps eight or nine miles in length.  A good deal of harm could be done before a doctor of that kind could be got to the place where he was needed.  I suggest to the Minister that he should give the nurse permission to call upon the nearest doctor to the particular case.  Time and time again we have had cases in which doctors were summoned over a long distance, and unfortunately did not arrive in time.  After all, it is very important to try to save the life of a child and of a mother, and every facility should be afforded to the nurse to get the nearest medical attendance. You, Sir, have told Deputy Linehan that the question of nurses' salaries is not a matter for the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree it should not be so, but the question of payment is very important.  In the first place, as Deputy Linehan pointed out, the fact that these people will have to undergo longer training now makes it more necessary that they get a decent salary.  Secondly, there will be such a lot of stipulations in regard to costumes and other attendant matters that more money will be required.  The pay which nurses are receiving in hospitals and as maternity nurses is a scandal all over the country to-day, and the sooner the Minister for Local Government and Public Health does something about it the better.</P>
      <P>Time and time again, various public bodies, when they had the authority, sent up recommendations for increases in nurses' salaries, and they were invariably turned down by the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary.  I suggest that, if we are to have a proper nursing service in this country, it is absolutey necessary that they be paid a decent wage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Bill is not only desirable but has been too long delayed.  The sympathetic criticism of the Leader of the Opposition is based upon factual knowledge gained through his professional status.  I wish to deal with the case more from the point of view of social control and social welfare, and I am particularly interested in Section 25.  I know the difficulties that men and women in the profession have to contend with in local administration and I think it is their business to give all the help and advice they can give to the House and the Minister; but I am particularly concerned about the application of the section to midwives in areas such as Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  I know of the gross abuses going on in and about the metropolitan area, and I think we are all too kind to the people who offend against this Section 25.  It seems to me that there is a means of escape <Col N="1156" /> for people who are guilty of &ldquo;infamous misconduct.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 25 says that if a midwife has been guilty of conduct which, in the opinion of the board, is infamous misconduct or professional misconduct, her name may be removed from the roll.  When we realise what is happening every day in this city&mdash;I do not want to go very far in speaking of this: I did say something on another occasion and I was told that legislation was being brought in&mdash;it is easy to understand that this legislation has been too long delayed, in the attempt to deal with this cancer in the body politic.  There are people, supposed to be professional women, in this area and the conduct which is carried on by them is well known in the public records of the criminal courts.  I have a case in mind where there were five illegitimate births in one house which were not notified to the authority.  The unfortunate creature who was the victim of the conditions under which she lives was brought to this house on three occasions, where she was delivered, and there was no record of the children. There were twins on two occasions and a single child on another.  A single woman and a married man were concerned. There is no record in the courts or anywhere else of the births of those particular children.  Of course, they did not live very long.  They were removed from the particular place where they were brought into life, and within a few short months they had passed into death.  That is only one of the cases which could be mentioned: there may be a larger list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A woman in such a case as that takes it upon herself to treat in a professional way another woman and then, by a lack of attention to the ordinary conditions that ought to govern professional life, by the total omission of registration and by connivance&mdash;criminal connivance, if you like to call it so&mdash;for the purpose of getting rid of the responsibility of this or any other type of woman who gets herself into trouble, is relieving the girl of the guilt and of the responsibility of bringing up the child and also is allowing a vicious character to <Col N="1157" /> escape his responsibilities.  It has been pointed out here that the ordinary person&mdash;a man married to a woman&mdash; might not be in a position to pay the professional fee; but what about a case such as this, which might be multiplied, where a gentleman who carried on that particular form of life destruction and soul destruction could escape all commitments?  By paying a certain sum of money to a type of woman like this, who had neither professional honour nor sex honour, nor any decency at all, he is allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>This Bill deals with very meritorious work.  It is the most important work that any professional man or woman could be engaged in: it is a question of new life.  I do not wish to labour this point, for fear somebody might abuse it elsewhere, but we in Dublin know that, if for no other reason than that, the Government and the Minister in charge of this Bill should receive the thanks of this House.  The only thing is: how far we can help in making it watertight, thus preventing escape for any person who abuses the professional status.</P>
    <P>There are things we have to deal with here, without giving publicity to them, for many reasons; but we know of the cases which have been dealt with in the criminal courts, where the evidence given would shock humanity.</P>
    <P>If Section 25 of the Bill is enforced by a properly constituted board, it will be the greatest blessing ever conferred upon this city or any city of the same type.  We are only concerned with our own nation, but we all know that, all over the world, there has been outrageous exposure of child murder. Unfortunately, possibly we have to take our share of the guilt in this city. It would be well if the Parliamentary Secretary, in carrying this Bill through with the approval of the House, could immediately enforce its provisions.  I cannot see where there is sufficient power in this Bill, although I have read it through.  It deals with the question of the midwife dying, but what about the patient dying and what about the new-born child dying?</P>
    <P>There is no mandatory provision in the Bill, so far as I can see.  There <Col N="1158" /> must be a record of the midwife dying &mdash;obviously, for the purpose of filling the vacancy; but I do not see any section where the midwife is bound in law, and under penalties that could not be evaded, to record the proceedings of every case which she handles. Whether a child is born alive or dead, it should be insisted on that an official record of the birth be kept.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but the point is that it is not in this Bill.  As regards some of the cases that I have quoted, eminent medical men in this city have admitted the weakness there is in the matter of the registration of these children.  There is no registration of the transfer of a child to a foster-mother, and there was no registration of death in two of the cases that I have quoted.  Obviously, therefore, there must be some gap wherein the type of person that I have referred to can operate.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he ought to tighten up matters in that respect so that no means of manoeuvring will be left to this criminal type of person to operate, the type of person who has lost all sense of sex decency as well as of professional decency.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on bringing forward this much too long delayed measure.  The criticism that has been offered by the Opposition is not criticism.  It is sympathetic advice, and I hope it will be accepted in that spirit.  I believe that it is the desire of every member of the House to help the Department in this matter, and to make this measure one of the greatest blessings that has ever been conferred on the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the provinces where women cannot earn a decent livelihood at their professional work, that question, I think, could be easily solved if authority were given to the county councils.  In the larger counties provision might be made for the employment of three or four women who would always be available with, of course, proper means of transport, when their services were required.  Why argue about the expenditure of the few paltry <Col N="1159" /> pounds that would be needed to make such a service available?  It is quite possible that if some of those children got proper attention at birth they might become shining and brilliant specimens of our race.  They were denied that opportunity because in the areas in which they happened to be born the services of specialists were not available.  Why should the provinces be denied the excellent means we have in a city like this?</P>
    <P>Some of those difficult cases have to come to Dublin, but for the expenditure of a few pounds a specialist service could be provided in provincial centres.  If necessary, why not have a mobile hospital, if you like, with a doctor and nurse?  It is impossible for women with professional attainments to live under the conditions that prevail in many of the country areas.  In those areas, too, there is no means of sterilising clothing.  Many of the midwives serving in the country are highly trained, and their professional status demands that they should get proper recognition in the matter of remuneration. There is to-day a much closer affinity between the doctor and the midwife than there used to be in the old days.  I do not know any doctor who would hestitate to recommend proper and adequate recognition for those women who render such valuable service to the community.</P>
    <P>I welcome the statement that was made by Deputy O'Higgins.  It was a most valuable contribution to this debate, and I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will take cognisance of what he said.  We here are the voice of the people who elected us.  I hope, therefore, that the particular blot and stain on our provincial areas, to which reference has been made, will be completely wiped out, and that the conduct of those creatures who have been guilty of crimes against their own sex and their own profession will not only be checked but that it will be obliterated from the mind of man.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The general tenor of this Bill is, I think, acceptable to all sections of the House.  Parts of it will undoubtedly receive high commendation from all Deputies.  The purpose <Col N="1160" /> of the Bill, in so far as it tends to raise the professional status of a very important section of the community, is highly commended by the Labour Party as such.  The secondary purpose of the Bill should be, I think, to decrease, to some extent, the incidence of infantile mortality.  For these two reasons I think the Bill should have an easy passage through the House. Everyone recognises the importance of a midwife and will acclaim any measures taken to give the members of that profession a rightful place in the community.  The incidence of infantile mortality, particularly in cities like Dublin, was in the past a disgrace to civilisation.</P>
      <P>At one period it ranked probably the highest in Europe, vying, I think, with some places in India.  With a proper professional status for the midwife, and with proper safeguards such as are being taken in this Bill as to their efficiency and general knowledge, and with general control and supervision of them, we would, I think, be taking the first step anyway towards improving the chances of life for the vast mass of children, particularly of the poor in the big cities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one part of the Bill which I should like to see extended and which, I think, deserves greater consideration and more amplification.  It appears merely as a subsidiary part of the Bill.  In the way it is framed it may not have any significance actually at all.  Section 50, which permits the local supervising authority&mdash;in most cases, I suppose that will be the county council&mdash;to contribute to the cost of the training of candidates for the midwife's service will, I am sure, become an increasingly important part of the Bill if it is implemented in the proper spirit.  This has relation to a great difficulty in the nursing profession in this country.  Everyone knows that, so far as many of the daughters of working class men are concerned, it is almost impossible for them, owing to the cost of maintenance, and even though such girls may have a natural aptitude for nursing, to become a nurse in Irish hospitals, or to pay the fees required.  The result is that some of the best nursing talent in the country, those who would in time become the <Col N="1161" /> best midwives, are exported.  They are induced to leave the country by the better conditions and the higher wages that obtain in England, Scotland and Wales.  Here, I think, there is provision made, if it is availed of by these local authorities, to contribute towards assisting such naturally talented young girls in working-class homes to become trained as midwives.  That should enable us to increase the number of efficient members of this profession. It would be a great boon to the working classes and it would be welcomed, I am sure, by the midwives generally. It would enable us to attract the best type from the working classes who are anxious to enter the nursing profession and it would also enable us to keep those daughters of our race at home instead of having to export them.  For these reasons, that it raises the status of the profession, that it will tend towards decreasing the incidence of infantile mortality, and because it makes provision for helping the training of midwives where the individuals are unable to do so out of their own resources, I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion on the Bill has been helpful and it has been approached in a spirit that ought to help in the improvement of the measure, if it is possible to improve it.  There is nothing of a contentious nature in the measure as it stands and nothing of a contentious nature has been raised in the course of the discussion.  At the same time, I think I might inform the House that amendment along some of the lines indicated in the discussions is scarcely feasible.  I might, perhaps, begin by eliminating the only question that might be, to some extent, contentious, on the ground that it is not appropriate to the Bill, and that is the question of the remuneration of midwives. It does not arise under this Bill, and we cannot discuss it or deal adequately with it here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill deals not only with midwives in the employment of local authorities, but with persons engaged in the practice of midwifery, regardless of whether they are in the employment of local authorities, in private practice, or working under the control of nursing <Col N="1162" /> organisations or other corporations. Deputy O'Higgins raises a question on Section 16.  That section gives the Minister power, at any time, by Order, to remove any member of the board from office.  The Deputy takes exception to that section, but I rather think that he must not have fully considered the implication of leaving such a section out of the measure.  In the first place, it is the Minister who appoints the board.  Having accepted that principle, it seems logical to contend that if, in any circumstances, a member of the board should be removed, the Minister is the appropriate person to remove him.</P>
    <P>There are many circumstances under which it might not only be desirable but necessary to remove a member of a board.  Deputy O'Higgins will be the first, I am sure, when his attention is directed to some of these circumstances, to admit the necessity for Section 16.  A member of a board might become of unsound mind; he might become bankrupt; he might be imprisoned; he might leave the country&mdash; members of some hospital boards have been out of the country for years; they have nominally remained as members of the board, because the Minister or the appointing authority had no power to remove them.  I think these examples are sufficient to satisfy Deputy O'Higgins and the House that such power is a necessary part of the machinery.  It is merely machinery power, and it is only intended to meet such contingencies as I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I do not think Deputy O'Higgins was terribly concerned about that section, but he was concerned about Section 47. Section 47 does create some difficulty; in fact, considerable difficulty.  Deputy O'Higgins and other Deputies, I think, would like to give the midwife an unlimited discretion in case of emergency in the matter of calling in a doctor to her assistance.  At first glance that would appear to be a desirable arrangement, but it does not at all fit in with our existing code under the Public Assistance Acts.  Deputy O'Higgins talks about the need for having the best possible assistance available to <Col N="1163" /> the destitute poor, and with that sentiment we are all in full agreement.  But, under the public assistance code, the dispensary medical officer is responsible for maternity cases in his district in much the same way as he is responsible for any other type of case where a person is entitled to public assistance. The dispensary midwife is a subordinate officer of the dispensary medical officer.  A woman in childbirth can, if she so desires, have the services of the dispensary medical officer in the first instance in preference to the services of the midwife.</P>
    <P>Under that code, if the dispensary medical officer is summoned to attend a woman in childbirth, a poor person who would be entitled to public assistance, he goes there and, if he is satisfied that the case will probably pursue a normal course, he sends for the midwife and leaves her in charge.  If any emergency arises later on she sends for him.  When we relate that position under the public assistance code to the possible conditions that would obtain if we give the midwife the uncontrolled right to select a doctor when she anticipates difficulties, I think that we might well reach a state of confusion in our administration that would be far from satisfactory from the point of view of the persons most intimately affected, namely, the sick poor.</P>
    <P>Deputies may know, especially medical Deputies who have been in the dispensary service, that it sometimes happens that the relationship between the local midwife and the dispensary doctor is not of the best.  We realise that the dispensary doctor in the exercise of his duty may from time to time find it necessary to reprimand a midwife for the manner in which she discharges her duty.  I have known men to do it.  In my own experience I have known unpleasant relations to exist between the dispensary doctor and the midwife.  If, under this Bill, we give a dispensary midwife in a public assistance case the right publicly to call in a doctor, other than the dispensary doctor, or to declare that the dispensary doctor is not a fit and proper person to attend a critical case, I think we will be bringing <Col N="1164" /> a share of trouble upon ourselves. That is a discretion we ought not to put into the hands of the dispensary midwife.  I am sure Deputy O'Higgins would be satisfied if he were assured that in no case of urgency or emergency would a woman in childbirth be left without the services of a doctor, if she required them.  That is what we are all aiming at.  The question is how we are to achieve that objective.</P>
    <P>I do not think Section 47 will seriously handicap us in that regard.  If the dispensary doctor is available there is onus on the midwife to call him in in a dispensary case, but if he is away, as in the case quoted during the debate, eight or nine miles, or if in fact he is not available the midwife will be at liberty then to call in another doctor.  Determination of the question whether she had taken reasonable steps to ensure whether or not he was available will be a matter for the local supervising authority.  I feel sure that in such circumstances they would take a commonsense view.  If the midwife faced by an emergency sent to the doctor's residence an urgent message that he was wanted and, if he was not there, and she then called in the nearest available doctor, I do not think the local supervising authority or any responsible Minister would find fault with her for acting in that way.</P>
    <P>This section has given rise to considerable discussion with the Central Midwives Board but from a somewhat different angle.  Section 47 (1) reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where a midwife attends at a childbirth in which any emergency specified in rules made under this Act occurs, she shall....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The section as drafted puts the onus on the Central Midwives Board of taking consequential disciplinary action if a midwife fails to call in the dispensary medical officer.  I think a very strong case could be made against placing the Central Midwives Board in that position.  It is proposed to amend that section in this way:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Provided that nothing in the section will restrict the Minister's right to insist upon the dispensary medical officer being called in in <Col N="1165" /> accordance with regulations made under the Public Assistance Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We cannot give such power under this Bill as would deprive the Minister of the power he has under the Public Assistance Act.  I propose to move an amendment along these lines on the Committee Stage when we can, if necessary, discuss the matter again.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins made a point regarding the determination of who might be entitled to public assistance and who might not.  The determination of the right to public assistance is entirely a matter for the local authority.  While most local authorities have established some kind of uniform approach to such cases there is no statutory limit set to the receipt of public assistance.  The local authorities have full discretion, having fully considered the circumstances of each case on its merits, as to whether or not a person is entitled to public assistance.  The law does not put any restriction upon them and the Minister has no statutory power to put any restriction on them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Linehan raised a point on Section 22 as to the recovery of debt from a supervisory authority.  I will look into the question of the appropriate court in such cases.  On first examination it does appear as if it might involve hardship.  It is a recommendation of the Central Midwives Board.  Perhaps it would be convenient to the Central Midwives Board to have a case heard by the High Court.</P>

Coming to Deputy Larkin's views on Section 25, I quite appreciate, the force of his arguments to-day, but many of the abuses, which he did not feel free to discuss openly for obvious <Col N="1167" /> reasons, can be dealt with under the existing law.  The trouble is that for some reason or other the existing statutory provisions do not appear to be fully enforced.  Whether that is the fault of the people who know things and who do not come forward to put the law into operation or whether it is due to some other cause, I am not in a position to say, but this Bill does substantially improve the position, from two points of view, in relation to the matters the Deputy has in mind.</P>

      <P>Under the existing law the local authority has not power to suspend a midwife from practice, even pending the investigation of certain charges that may be made against her. The Bill provides for that authority now.  When this Bill becomes law, the local authority can take the initiative by suspending her pending an inquiry into the charges made.  The next point is this, and it is important: the Central Midwives Board while they had power to hold inquiries and to take certain disciplinary action in certain circumstances, had no power to compel the attendance of witnesses or the production of documents at a hearing.  In that way they were completely handicapped in any proper trial when charges such as those we have in mind were made. Now the fact that we are arming them with the necessary statutory authority to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of any documents that may be available, should go a long way towards remedying the abuses that have been mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last reference that it is necessary to make arises out of Deputy Connolly's contribution with particular reference to Section 50.  Section 50, as Deputy Connolly properly points out, gives the local supervising authority statutory authority to contribute to the cost of training of candidates for midwives' certificates.  Such a provision is welcomed by Deputy Connolly speaking for the class of the community he represents and such a provision, I am sure, is welcomed by every Party in the House, but beyond <Col N="1168" /> giving the local authority statutory power to initiate what might be a very valuable service, there is nothing further that can be done in the legislation. We cannot make it mandatory on a local authority to subsidise candidates for training as midwives.  We give them statutory power to do it subject to the Minister's approval.  If local authorities consider it a useful activity, presumably they will take advantage of the provision and the only restriction on the action of a local authority under Section 50, in subsidising candidates for training as midwives, will be such as might be involved in the Minister's sanction.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 5, to delete Section 8 (3), and substitute the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3) Where the Minister is satisfied that the holder of an office has failed to perform satisfactorily the duties of such office and is of opinion that he is unfit to hold such office, the Minister may&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1169" /> (a)  send by registered post to such holder at the principal office of the vocational education committee under which he holds such office a notice stating the said opinion, and</P>
    <P>(b)  on the day on which he sends the notice, send by registered post a copy thereof to the said vocational education committee,</P>
    <P>and if the Minister, after the expiration of 14 days from the day on which he sends the notice and the copy thereof and after consideration of the representations (if any) made to him by such holder or the vocational education committee, remains of the said opinion, he may by Order remove such holder from such office.</P>
    <P>This amendment is introduced to meet points that were made on the Committee Stage regarding the power of the Minister to remove from office.  It was suggested that the length of time afforded to enable representations to be made was not sufficiently long.  The point was also made that the Minister should make reasonably certain that notice of the character referred to in this section, being intimated to the holder of the office, should also be made known to the vocational education committee.  The amendment proposes that the notice will be sent by registered post to such holder of an office at the principal office of the vocational education committee under which he holds such office, and, on the day on which he sends such notice, a copy thereof will be sent to the vocational education committee, and if the Minister, after the expiration of 14 days from the day on which he sends the notice and the copy thereof, and after consideration of the representations, if any, made to him by such holder or the vocational education committee, remains of the said opinion, he may by Order remove such holder from such office.  I think that, even in the present circumstances, when it is difficult to establish communications and a longer time than seven days is needed, 14 days should be ample to allow the officer in question, or the committee acting on his behalf, sufficient time to send in whatever representations may be necessary. <Col N="1170" /> The Minister will have opportunity, I take it, within that period, to consider such representations carefully before he takes action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has carried out the undertaking which he gave on the Committee Stage, to the extent that he promised.  However, it is a great pity, as I am sure many Deputies feel, that the Minister did not see fit, in the interval which elapsed since the very extensive discussion on this section, to delete the whole section.  I am quite sure that he is being inundated with a regular avalanche of representations from all quarters as to the uneasiness that is felt in the service about this Bill, particularly this section.  The amendment that he has proposed to sub-section (3) does remove some of the worst aspects of the original draft; that much can be said for it; but it is the best part of a bad section, and it is, I suppose, not too late now to ask the Minister whether he is still adamant in regard to this whole section, which is the cause of all the disturbance, whether, as a compromise, for instance, he would not undertake to delete this section in the Seanad, and substitute for it Section 27 of the Vocational Education Act of 1930.  He has not yet, I think, made clear to the House, despite the number of times we have asked him, why he wishes to have this Section 8 in the Bill.  In the Agriculture (Amendment) Bill, no such powers are taken by the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture does not feel that there is any necessity to discipline the officers under his command to the extent that the Minister for Education sees fit or fears it might be necessary to do so under his Ministry. I think that we can do nothing but to accept the amendment as it stands, if the Minister is going to retain Section 8.  I would still ask him to consider the fairness and justice of deleting the whole section and substituting for it Section 27 of the Vocational Education Act of 1930.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. F. Lynch Mr. F. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the Minister's amendment improves Section 8 of the Bill as introduced, but I agree with Deputy Connolly that it would have <Col N="1171" /> been more advisable to have withdrawn that section altogether.  The case that the Minister made against all the points made from various parts of the House in dealing with the section on the Committee Stage was not, I think, a true case I think it was on this section that he cited, as an instance, the slowness with which the Department moves in dealing drastically with officers.  He cited especially the case of teachers in national schools who for many years are allowed to continue, going from one inspector to another, before their inefficiency meets with dismissal.  That may be so, and in fact I think that, in the past at any rate&mdash;I do not know whether it is the case now&mdash;that was so.  For many years a teacher was given chance after chance before being dismissed.  But we are not dealing with teachers only under this Bill.  If the vocational education officers referred to in Section 8 were teachers only, one might be satisfied that there would be a great deal of inspection before, eventually, the Minister, to use the words of the section, would become &ldquo;satisfied&rdquo; that the holder of the office had failed to perform satisfactorily the duties of the office.  But this applies also, I take it, to the ordinary administrative staff of vocational education authorities and these would not, I assume, be subject to inspection annually by the inspectors of the Department in the same way as teachers would be and, therefore, to make the case that he would have reports year after year in the case of these officers, as he has in the case of national teachers, is not, I think, correct.  It is difficult to understand, at any rate in the case of those who are not teachers, why the Minister should not agree to have some kind of inquiry before taking the drastic step of dismissal with regard to an officer of a vocational education authority.  I should like the Minister to reconsider that matter when the Bill goes to the Seanad, if such a proposal is made there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJosephBroderi" hpid="Mr. Broderick Mr. Broderick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment merely lengthens the time which must expire after the sending of the notice <Col N="1172" /> and the removal from office from seven to 14 days.  I would strongly support the request made by Deputy Connolly and Deputy Lynch that the Minister should seriously consider the deletion of Section 8 altogether.  The Minister under this section is taking power to remove a vocational teacher from office merely on the report, I presume, of the inspector and, on inquiry by himself, notification is sent to the holder of the office.  After the expiration of 14 days the person is removed from office without any chance of an inquiry into his alleged incapacity, inability or neglect of duties.  I think that is very unfair and is a very arbitrary way of dealing with teachers.  The Minister must remember that the livelihood of these men is involved.  They may be removed from office at an age when they are entirely unsuited to any other occupation.  All these things must be taken into consideration.  The least that any man is entitled to is an opportunity to put his case before an inquiry. Would I be unkind if I were to say that he is being removed from office on the reports of an inspector who has had an opportunity of stating the case to the Minister and who is, if you like, acting the part of the Crown Prosecutor in the absence of the accused?  I think this section is an outrage and that instead of proving of any benefit to the service it will create an atmosphere of suspicion and of doubt.  Independent-minded teachers will hardly subscribe to it. Men of the &ldquo;yes&rdquo; mentality will subscribe to anything the inspector wishes but some of the best teachers we have known, some of the teachers who got the best results, were not men who always conformed to the orthodox view as enunciated by inspectors or even by the Department.  Any man who is accused ought to get an opportunity of making his case at an inquiry. The conditions governing local government administration are entirely different from those which we have to consider in this case.  In the case of local government administration, the Minister is responsible for the public services and, if any individual or body interferes with, hampers or brings into disrepute activities carried on in connection with these <Col N="1173" /> services, the Minister must have power, in the public interest, to intervene and see that the service is carried on.</P>
      <P>There is no comparison between that and the question of deciding upon the competency of a teacher.  These men have been trained and they have taken a lifelong interest in their subject. They should not be removable from their positions on the report of an inspector, without any chance of defending themselves and without any opportunity of putting their case before a committee of inquiry and stating the reason for their actions.  That is a negation of fundamental rights, and I strongly support Deputy Connolly and Deputy Lynch in their request to the Minister that, before he brings the Bill before the Seanad, he will seriously consider what the effects of an arbitrary act like that would be on an individual or on the service as a whole, bearing in mind the terrible injustice it would be if one of these men were removed from office without knowing why he was removed.</P>

      <P>We have had a good deal of discussion on this matter.  I do not know whether or not Deputies are familiar with the procedure regarding the removal of teachers.  I do not think that Deputy Broderick can be conversant with it when he assumes that a teacher can be removed from office without even knowing the reasons for his removal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJosephBroderi" hpid="Mr. Broderick Mr. Broderick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Because that is not proposed, it does not follow that a teacher will not get every opportunity of defending himself.  The position in the <Col N="1174" /> other branches of the service is as I have already explained.  Before a decision is reached to remove a teacher because of continued inefficiency and unsatisfactory service, a second inspector is called in.  The matter being of the greatest importance to the teacher, we do not depend on the report of a single inspector.  When a vital decision of that kind is being made, we ask for the report of a senior inspector.  In the second place, the committee will act as a shield in this case.  In the case of a teacher in a secondary or primary school, there is the protection of the managers, but there is no committee of public representatives who might be regarded by those teachers as a shield.</P>
      <P>Any reports, adverse or otherwise, regarding teachers made by inspectors under this scheme are made known to the committee.  The committee has an opportunity of considering those reports.  I think I am safe in saying that, before an inspector recommends that a committee should seriously consider discharging a teacher, preliminary reports will have been furnished.  The inspector, in normal circumstances, gives due notice to a teacher that he is not satisfied with his work and that he proposes to hold a formal inspection upon it at a later date.  Should his opinion be confirmed and should he be satisfied that the work is not satisfactory, he may report the matter to the committee if he considers it of sufficient seriousness. Normally, I take it, a certain time would elapse which would enable the teacher to improve.  If the matter came up again for review, the inspector might say that he had now sufficient experience of the teacher's work to enable him to decide with assurance that he should not be retained.  Even then, the normal procedure would be that the teacher would be given a further inspection by an inspector of senior rank, thus ensuring that he would not be condemned on the report of one inspector.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of the national teachers&mdash;and there are 15,000 of them&mdash;there are no such regulations. Under the national education system, the procedure has been as outlined by me for a very long period.  There is a greater degree of independence attaching to vocational teachers and to the vocational education service generally, but in my opinion, if only by reason of that independence, a greater measure of responsibility attaches to them, and I am not satisfied that in cases of the inefficiency of teachers it is necessary, where the reports are there in my hands and are made available to the committee, through the yearly reports which are made to them under the scheme, to have a further inquiry.  If there is any case of reasonable doubt, an inquiry would be held.  I have already said that, apart from the question of the efficiency of the teachers, there would be an inquiry in the case of removal from office for any other reason&mdash;that, normally, there would be an inquiry.</P>
      <P>I do not think, however, that the Minister should be bound, in the way that the original Act binds him, to hold a formal local inquiry of a legal nature, where he is satisfied over a period of time that a teacher is inefficient and where the committee is fully aware of the circumstances.  I suggest that under this amendment the committee will have full opportunity for making representations, and it is most unlikely that the case will be an entirely new one and that there will not have been preliminary discussions and a report regarding it.  The efficiency of the teaching service is of the greatest importance. After all, the teachers are more important in the life of the State than almost any other body&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Minister will take all the circumstances into consideration and will only proceed to such drastic action when he feels that there is really no other solution.</P>

      <P>I have already pointed out that if there is any doubt in the case of a teacher we have a special service of inspectors who report on the efficiency of their work from year to year, and that that is not the case in connection with other public servants. In the case of other public servants, some case of misconduct or incapacity might arise which would necessitate an inquiry and, as I say, normally, an inquiry would be held.  I do not say that an inquiry should not be held in some cases where the inefficiency of a teacher is in question, but I do not think that the Minister should be bound by law to hold a local public inquiry in all these cases.  I think he should be given discretion to act where he is satisfied that the case is beyond remedy.</P>

      <P>I think it is a pity that the Minister did not listen to some of the cases that were put up during the Second Stage and the Committee Stage of the Bill, and apart from Section 8, which we have dealt with, I think it is a pity that he did not listen, especially in regard to the suggestions that were made here by Deputy Cosgrave and others with regard to adding years of service to some of these men when they are compulsorily retired at the age of 65.  The vocational teachers are in an entirely different position for the most part from the national teacher&mdash;certainly from the national teacher and, to some extent, from the secondary teacher, in this, that very many of them are advanced in years before they become vocational education officers.  This is especially so in the case of men who are qualified tradesmen, who have been working at their trades for a number of years and who are eventually brought into the local vocational education school to give instruction in their particular trade.  Many of these would be in the late thirties, and possibly the forties and fifties, when they enter the service of the vocational education authority and, therefore, when the compulsory retire ment provided in the Bill is enforced they would have so few years of service that the pension of which they would be in receipt would be negligible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister should make provision for empowering a vocational education authority &mdash; subject, of course, in each individual case to his sanction&mdash;to add years to the service of some of these men when they are being compulsorily retired at the age of 65 or at whatever may be the prescribed age.  That would ease the <Col N="1180" /> matter to some extent.  Alternatively, vocational committees should be given discretion in certain cases to keep some of these officers on for three or five years beyond the maximum age.  If something of that kind is not done, considerable hardship will be caused to individuals who have given very loyal service to local authorities and especially to the types I have mentioned&mdash;tradesmen and craftsmen who have been taken into the service of vocational education authorities in middle age.</P>

      <P>This Bill is one on which I have not spoken previously.  I have made no comment whatever on it simply because I know nothing about these Vocational Education Bills, and, not being a teacher or interested in the teachers, I have not very much to say on it.  However, I have received a communication in connection with the Bill and before leaving the House this evening, I should like to get an assurance from the Minister on the point which I propose to raise arising out of that communication.  If I get that assurance, I shall be very well satisfied. A communication was sent to me within the last five or six days to the effect that a member of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;his name I shall not disclose, but I am prepared to hand the letter to the Minister&mdash;stated to a Limerick vocational education teacher that this dismissal provision is intended for teachers who may be members of active organisations which are unfriendly to Fianna Fáil.  I should like the Minister to give us an assurance that political influences will not operate in this connection.  If the statement was made, I think it a downright disgrace that any member of the House should commit himself to the statement that political influences would be used to take the bread and butter out of the mouth of any teacher.</P>

      <P>I quite agree, but I should like the Minister to give the <Col N="1181" /> House a guarantee that the principle enunciated in the statement which I allege was made by a Deputy will not, so far as the Minister can see to it, be put into effect.  I shall be satisfied if I get that assurance, but from the information I have before me, I cannot let the matter pass without comment.  I shall hand the letter, which states that a member of his Party said in Limerick that such provisions were intended only for teachers who were not on friendly terms with Fianna Fáil, to the Minister, if he wishes.  If the Minister gives me an assurance that it is not so I am prepared to accept his word.</P>

      <P>I am very glad the Minister is not responsible for the statements of individuals on any side.  He has quite enough responsibility without that.  I join in the appeal, however, which has been made by other speakers with regard to the point which has engaged our attention on this Bill, that is, as to what is the necessity for the departure from the existing practice in relation to vocational teachers and as to what failure has been found in the legislation governing these teachers that the Minister finds it now necessary to resort to Section 8 whereby they are to be denied the right of an inquiry? The Minister stated, in answer to Deputy Lynch and Deputy Broderick, that they can have an inquiry, and I think he said that a second inspector can be called in, if the report of one inspector is not relied on.  If that assurance could be given, it would be something to the good, because there is the constant danger of an inspector falling foul of a particular vocational officer&mdash;and not perhaps on the very best of grounds.  If that statement by the Minister could be put in print in the Bill, setting out that a second inspector's report would be called for before the original report is used as a means of determining a man's service, there would be some security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I still support the appeal made by Deputy Connolly and others that the Minister should revert to the position under the section of the 1930 Act, which provides ample power in regard to the removal of officers.  It seems to me to be a reflection upon his vocational officers&mdash;I have had some experience <Col N="1182" /> on a vocational committee for some years and have made rather a study of the matter generally&mdash;which is not justified or warranted.  I believe the Minister has ample machinery already and that these officials should not be put in the position of insecurity in which this section puts them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Broderick has said that when they have advanced in years and are utterly unfitted for any other vocation or calling, they are left to the tender mercies of a report by an inspector, which goes back to the Minister, who, at the end of 14 days, may determine that they are to be no longer kept in the service.  These people should have the right of an inquiry. That is not too much to ask where a man's living is at stake, and before the Bill becomes law I urge the Minister to reconsider the deletion of that objectionable section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Education has always held a very important place in our public life.  It is on account of the peculiar eminence given to education in this country that the Vocational Education (Amendment) Bill has passed so far on its journey through the House with the best of intentions on both sides.  We have dealt with the Minister in a very gentle fashion indeed&mdash;with kid gloves, as a matter of fact.  We have tried our utmost to get him to see our point of view, but I think we have failed lamentably.  It appears to me to be rather a waste of time to continue appealing to the Minister with regard to the objectionable points in the Bill.  I have asked the Minister on every possible occasion the reason for the insertion in the Bill of Section 8.  He has not yet replied to me.  He has given no answer to that question.  Evidently, there is no answer to it.  When you ask any responsible person a set question a number of times, and fail to obtain a reply, I think it may be taken by all those who are logically-minded that he has no answer to it.  There is no defence. One would imagine that the type of man who goes into the vocational education service is somewhat different from that which goes into the service of the Department of Agriculture and the agricultural committees: that there has to be a separate form of <Col N="1183" /> discipline for those two bodies of men. That really should not be so.  They are much the same type, with the same educational qualifications and the same training.  They do different work, it is true, but in each case their work contributes to the great aim of raising the educational standard in the country, improving the technical training of the students, and generally endeavouring to raise the standard of productivity in the country.</P>
      <P>There is that similarity between them, and I think there should be the same standard for both of them. Evidently that is not so.  For some mysterious reason, which the Minister will not divulge to us, he must insert this Section 8, which is causing all the trouble, which has led to dissatisfaction throughout the service, which has led to a period of uneasiness, and which has resulted in quite a volume of publicity and literature in regard to this Bill.  This section must remain, for what reason we do not know; apparently the Minister has his own views upon the matter, and will not take the House into his confidence. He will not divulge the reason; at least he has not done so up to now, and there is no indication that he will do so.  Therefore, despite all the friendly and constructive efforts of the Vocational Officers' Organisation to get some compromise with the Minister on the section, if it could not be removed altogether, we must admit our failure and go on to the other aspects of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to those other aspects, too, we have not been able to impress the Minister with our case.  We have made a long and complete statement of it, and I do not intend to reiterate it here, but I should like to make a constructive suggestion which might appeal to the Minister&mdash;I hope it will &mdash;in reference to Section 6, which deals with retiral at a given age.  There appears to be a precedent for it.  I brought it up formerly, but could not have it included in the Bill as such. However, I think it might be approached from another angle.  I think it might be possible that the Minister would agree, with the approval of the Minister for Local Government, <Col N="1184" /> to circularise vocational education committees, authorising them, when they are awarding pensions to officers retiring under this Section 6, who have less than the 40 years' service which entitles them to the full pension, to take into account the periods of service under other branches of the Department of Education; to take into consideration also broken service under either the old technical instruction branch or the Vocational Education Board, and to take into consideration service as Irish teachers under the Gaelic League.  In many cases it might be possible in that way to increase the pension by the amount appropriate to such service.</P>
    <P>Of course, there might be limitations to that; there might be conditions attached to it, so that, for instance, if the total pension after making allowance for such service is less than the maximum pension allowed under the Local Government Act, 1925&mdash;which is two-thirds of the salary and emoluments&mdash;years could be added, for the purpose of computing pensions, equal to say one-third of the actual service, subject to a maximum of ten years, or whatever number of years the Minister may determine.  It might be possible by some such means as that to enable us to overcome some of the objections to that section of the Bill dealing with retirement.</P>
    <P>Those are the only points which I consider it necessary to mention now. We regret very much that the Minister has not been able to adopt the point of view of the vocational officers.  If he had done so, I think he would have promoted efficiency and good-feeling in the service.  He would have shown that the vocational education officers are a body of growing importance in the country.  He would have improved their status in the community.  He would have given them a sense of security and a feeling of independence which would have redounded not only to the advantage of the profession as a whole and of vocational education but of the Minister himself, as one who saw eye to eye with the officers who are working under him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether <Col N="1185" /> there is any real foundation for the assertion that Deputy Flanagan has made.  If there is, I am very much surprised. I should like to assure him that there is no foundation for the suggestion that, as between one vocational education officer and another, there is any question of treating them differently by reason of their political views.</P>
      <P>From the speeches we have heard, one would get the impression that this Bill is something entirely novel, when the position really is that, had it been introduced contemporaneously with the Local Government Act of 1931, or shortly afterwards, there would probably have been no discussion about those clauses which have given rise to what Deputy Connolly considers dissatisfaction. The point I should like to emphasise is that vocational education officers in general are not, in my opinion, legally, under the provisions of the original Act, entitled to better conditions of service in the positions in which they now are than in the service from which they were taken when that Act became law.  In other words, they are not entitled under statute to better conditions of service than obtain generally in the Local Government service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of superannuation is largely one for the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  He sanctions the awards of superannuation, and, both in regard to superannuation and in regard to other matters such as the retiral age, the House will recognise the difficulty that any Minister for Local Government and Public Health would find in having one code for one particular section of the local government service and another code for the others.  It is not merely a question of uniformity, although that is of the greatest importance from the point of view of the administration of local government, but there is also the question of doing what is best and what is proper in the interests of education.  I have taken a good deal of interest in the vocational education service since I became Minister, and I am satisfied that these provisions will lead to greater efficiency in the service.  With the experience <Col N="1186" /> the officers have had for many years past since the service began to grow and through their dealings with the Department, I fail to see how they can assume or how for a moment they can have in their minds the idea that there is some intention here of dealing unfairly or unjustly with them.</P>
    <P>If a committee fails to act against an officer who is not giving satisfactory service, as may very well happen, then in my opinion the Minister should step in.  He should not step in until he is satisfied that the committee, having all the facts before them, have refused to take the action that would be expected from them as the authority and as the employers of the officer. As I have said, where there is any reasonable doubt in the matter, even at that stage the Minister can hold an inquiry.  The difference between us is that I am not prepared to make it mandatory upon the Minister to hold an inquiry in all cases.  When the Minister for Local Government, as I have interjected, holds an inquiry it is really for the purpose of bringing certain facts, certain evidence, before the public.  In the case of teachers, that evidence as a rule will be available through the inspectors' reports. If there is any doubt in the matter, then it can be settled by means of an inquiry.</P>
    <P>As regards the added years, the Minister for Local Government is deeply concerned with the question of superannuation.  As I have already said, superannuation is likely to increase very considerably in the coming years when the effects of the retiral age are making themselves felt.  Committees may feel reluctant to give the added years unless they are satisfied that there are very good grounds for doing so.  I think myself that, in the case of unquestioned national service or good service as an organiser or teacher for the Gaelic League in the old days, committees would normally be inclined to recommend additional years.  The special cases I was interested in and to which I referred were those where an officer had less than, we will say, 25 years' service when he reached the retiral age.  I <Col N="1187" /> felt that as regards those who had well over 30 years' service they could not be described as being cases of hardship and that it was only cases where exceptional circumstances could be adduced in support that the Minister for Local Government was likely to consider for specially increased pensions. If the door is opened the difficulty of the Minister will be appreciated. He is likely to be bombarded by all classes of officers for added years for pension purposes.  In the case of those who have short service, less than 25 years, let us say&mdash;25 years, in normal circumstances, would not have entitled them to superannuation &mdash;the present Bill makes it possible for those who have over ten years' service to get superannuation, not 25 years as was formerly the case. Although they are getting that concession, I recognise that it may be argued&mdash;I am not saying how much substance there is in the argument&mdash; that, by virtue of the fact that a retiral age has been fixed, they are being placed at a disadvantage.  I do not think anybody would suggest that it was ever intended that teachers or vocational education officers generally should continue to work until, through actual physical decrepitude, they were no longer able to attend at their offices or schools.  That was not the intention. But I have consulted with the Minister for Local Government and he agrees that, in the case of officers who have less than 25 years' service at the retiral age, it may be possible to consider favourably, if applications or proposals are made to him for added years, the sanctioning of such proposals for a maximum of, say, five years, if the age limit is fixed at 65.</P>
    <P>There is also the case of those vocational education officers who have spent some time as primary teachers or as secondary teachers.  If they had continued as primary or secondary teachers, they would have secured a pension.  I know cases myself of teachers in the other branches of the service who transferred to the vocational education service and are thereby going to lose.  Their number of years pensionable service under the vocational schemes is comparatively <Col N="1188" /> short, perhaps shorter than their service as secondary or primary teachers.  I think that these teachers&mdash;they may be chief executive officers of course&mdash;and these officers are entitled to special consideration. The Minister for Local Government agrees that they are and that it should be possible to consider their cases favourably and, if proposals are put up to him to grant them added years in virtue of their service as primary or secondary teachers, he may be prepared to sanction added years, but not beyond a maximum of ten years.</P>
    <P>As to these suggestions of the Minister for Local Government, they are more than suggestions; I think we may take them as a definite promise that in cases where proposals of this nature are made added years will be sanctioned. Of course there is no promise that the maximum years will be granted in every case; but where committees put up proposals they will be considered, having regard to the fact that in the two categories I have mentioned the maximum will be five years and ten years, respectively.  I do not think, therefore, in view of my consultations with my colleague, that it is necessary to put a formal provision in the Bill.  It was not intended that this Bill should deal with superannuation matters.  If there are certain cases that are not included in the categories I have referred to, and which I regard as substantial, we can look into them specially or, when the Minister for Local Government is introducing his Superannuation Bill, the matter could be looked at again.  But I think they cover the cases fairly well.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Eireann is of opinion that a grant from the Exchequer averaging £3 per annum should be paid on every acre of land under tillage in order to promote increased and efficient food production, and to enable the produce to reach the consumer at a reasonable price; and requests the Government to introduce legislation accordingly.</P>
      <P>In a motion of the importance and far-reaching nature of the one which is before the House now, I feel that Deputies are entitled and have reason to expect a fair and frank explanation of the effect which it is likely to have on agricultural policy and of the manner in which it is to be financed and administered.  I propose to give the House as briefly as possible, such an explanation.  I expect Deputies to receive this motion in the spirit in which it is offered and to give it careful consideration and that it will not be treated in the manner in which another motion sponsored by this Party was treated.  I hope that old and experienced Deputies will not lose their tempers and their heads as they did on the occasion on which that motion was before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1190" /> The purpose of this motion is permanently to expand the volume of agricultural production.  One of the most tragic features of the economic life of this country is that, in spite of all the legislation which has been passed to deal with agriculture, in spite of all the agricultural schemes which have been introduced from year to year, in spite of the efforts which have been made by the Department of Agriculture, under the British régime and our own native Government, there has been a steady decline in the volume of production and in the number of people engaged in work on the land.  That decline has been progressive down through the years.  There has been, first of all, a decline in the acreage under tillage.  We find that, in 1851, in this country, there were 3,500,000 acres under tillage; in 1870 there were 2,750,000; in 1921, 1,800,000; in 1931, 1,400,000; in 1938, 1,498,000.</P>
    <P>Heretofore, before the establishment of this Government and of our native institutions, it was customary for the mighty orators of the Parliamentary Party and for the resolute young leaders of the revolutionary movement of Sinn Féin, to attribute all the evils of this country to British rule.  Yet we find to-day, after 20 years of native Government, that there has been no really definite improvement in agricultural conditions, no substantial increase in the acreage under tillage up to the outbreak of war, and a real decline in the total volume of production. We who are promoting this motion hold that, if the volume of agricultural production is to be increased, there must be a permanent expansion of the acreage under tillage.</P>
    <P>We assert that, notwithstanding the many theories which may be advocated in regard to improved methods of grassland management and more modern and official methods of seeding and improving grass lands.  Tillage is essential in order to provide the main requirements of the human population. It is essential, even in the post-war period, that the human population should have produced in this country the greater part, if not all, of their requirements in food.  It is also essential, if we are to have a secure system <Col N="1191" /> of agriculture, that our live stock should depend mainly upon the food produced within this country.  We cannot produce sufficient food, both for human consumption and for the upkeep of the animal population, unless we have a fairly extensive area under tillage.  Improved grassland may provide an increased amount of food units for the upkeep of sheep and cattle, but for human food, for the winter feeding of live stock and for the pig and poultry industries, tillage is absolutely essential.</P>
    <P>A good deal has been published recently in the Press in regard to the advantages which Denmark enjoys over this country in the matter of food production.  Comparisons between Denmark and Éire have been made to our disadvantage.  The very learned paper read by Dr. Beddy has focussed attention on this matter.  That paper has been used by various people for various purposes, just as the Scriptures are so used.  Some people have tried to read into it an indictment of the farmers.  I read into it an indictment of Governmental policy, as pursued not only by the present Government, but by their predecessors, and also by their predecessors&mdash;the British régime.  Up to the outbreak of war, the policy was &mdash;except for the period of the last war &mdash;to allow the area under tillage to be governed by the law of chance.  It was assumed that it should be left to the farmer to produce from his farm whatever he thought best.  That is quite right, but there is also a duty on the Government to see that it pays the farmer best to do what is in the best interests of the community.  It would be a remarkable coincidence if the interests of the individual farmer coincided with the interests of the community. The reason why tillage declined in this country was because the farmer found from practical experience that he could make a greater profit by utilising his land mainly for pasture and reducing tillage to the minimum. Now, it may be said that the farmer should have been more patriotic, that he should have put the interests of the community before his own interests; <Col N="1192" /> but the farmer, just the same as any other business man who puts the interests of the community before his own interests, invariably winds up by finding himself a burden on the community, inasmuch as he becomes a bankrupt, and has to be maintained at the public expense.  Every practical man who owns land must endeavour to work that land so as to reap the higher profit.  There are people who will contend that, at all times and in all cases, there was a higher profit to be derived from tillage than from permanent pasture. If that were true, it would be as much as to suggest that the owners of land in this country were imbeciles: that they adopted a policy which did not pay them.  I do not think that suggestion could be sustained.  The average farmer is a shrewd, practical man.</P>
    <P>Dr. Beddy, in commenting upon the low output in this country as compared with Denmark, on the decline in our rural population and in rural production in Ireland, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is our climatic advantages which primarily are the cause of our relative economic and social disadvantages, since they permit us, though do not compel us, to adopt a system of agriculture which has led to a declining population, to a heavy emigration, to a low agricultural productivity, to restricted activity in agriculture, in industry, in commerce, and in foreign trade, and to a lack of opportunity for profitable domestic investment of our capital resources.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The <i>Irish Times,</i> in commenting on that statement in its issue of January 28th last, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;What evidence can be adduced to support that apparently paradoxical conclusion?  Does it rest on a balanced and impartial survey of all the facts which are pertinent to the state of agriculture in Denmark and in our Twenty-Six Counties?  If so, does it not present a body of problems beside which other questions pertinent to post-war reconstruction shrink into comparative insignificance?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that is a very serious statement. It is made in good faith by a <Col N="1193" /> paper which, I think, is advancing steadily in the direction of a realisation of the best interests of this nation. That paper has certainly made considerable progress, and is bidding fair to be more national in its outlook than some of our faded green orthodox nationalists.  I welcome that serious approach on the part of the <i>Irish Times</i> to this problem.  If we compare agricultural conditions in Denmark with this country, what do we find is the outstanding feature of Danish agriculture as compared with ours?  First of all, we find, taking the total output of each 100 or 1,000 acres, that Danish agricultural output is 50 per cent. higher than the output of this State. That may be a conservative estimate, but it is the estimate given by Dr. Beddy.  Some people claim that Danish output is more than double ours, but I think, taking everything into consideration, that Dr. Beddy's examination of this question was very careful.</P>
    <P>We find, in addition, that Danish national income is 45 per cent. higher than the national income of this country.  The population per square mile of Denmark is 224 as against 112 here.  The agricultural population of Denmark is 70 per 1,000 acres as against 55 here.  If the working agricultural population of this country was to be increased to the Danish standard, and if we were to employ as many on the land of this country as are employed on it in Denmark, there would be 174,000 additional workers employed in our agricultural industry.  We talk about the unemployment problem; we talk about the fact that we have 100,000 people unemployed and that we will have a large number coming here in the post-war period.  If we could only advance our agriculture to the stage that it has been advanced in Denmark, we could provide additional employment in agriculture alone for 174,000 workers. That is only a small part of the advantages which this country would derive from an expansion in agricultural production.</P>
    <P>We know that in Denmark industrial development has progressed by leaps and bounds.  That is natural because, where you have a big agricultural population earning a fairly substantial <Col N="1194" /> income and consuming a considerable amount of industrial goods, industry is certain to prosper.  The retail and wholesale business in Denmark is infinitely greater than here.  The number of people employed in all branches of life in Denmark is greater than here, and that is not achieved by imposing upon the Danish agricultural population a low standard of living.  As a matter of fact, the standard of living, of the agricultural population in Denmark is considerably higher in many respects than the standard of living of our agricultural population.</P>
    <P>We may ask ourselves what is the reason why Denmark enjoys such an advantage over this country, why the output of its agricultural industry is much higher than ours.  Many reasons have been advanced by people who have studied this matter.  The educational fanatics claim that it is due to the superior education of the Danish farmers and agricultural workers. They may enjoy some advantages over our farmers and agricultural workers in regard to education, but I would not say they enjoy very far-reaching advantages.  It has been said that Danish progress is due largely to co-operation. Co-operation may have contributed to a certain extent to the advance which Denmark has made, but it goes only a small distance along the way.  If we compare Danish conditions with ours, it will be found that the outstanding feature of Danish agriculture is that they have in that country over 60 per cent. of the land under tillage, whereas here we have less than 15 per cent.  It is solely as a result of that difference in agricultural practice as between Denmark and this country that the output of the Danes is so much higher than our agricultural output.</P>
    <P>It may be asked how is it that the Danish farmers, without any tillage subsidy, without any compulsion, adopted a system of farming which has led to such an extensive system of production. The reason, of course, is that the Danish climate and soil contributed to compel the farmer to adopt that system.  There is absolutely no means by which the Danish farmer can carry his stock over the winter unless he cultivates a considerable amount of his <Col N="1195" /> land and stores the produce for winter feeding.  Here it is possible, and profitable, to adopt an alternative system. Our winters being milder, it is not necessary to till very extensively, to house-feed live stock so extensively, and we have found that in normal years it pays better to utilise the greater portion of the land for permanent pasture and devote only a small portion to tillage.  It is obvious, if you want to get the maximum amount of production out of the land, that the plough must be taken over every arable field. That is true no matter whether you adopt the growing of ordinary tillage crops or adopt a system of cultivating grass, which is advocated at the present time.  You must have tillage and, since the ordinary economic laws do not tend to encourage the farmer to till, it is necessary for the community to take some action to induce the farmer to till the amount of land necessary in order to get the maximum production out of the soil.  I am not advocating that we should increase the area under tillage to the extent that prevails in Denmark. I believe a much lower percentage would suffice for our needs, having regard to the special system of economy which we would find profitable here, and having regard to the more favourable condition of our soil and climate for grass production.  But we must have, at least in normal years, one-third of our arable land under tillage. If we achieve that, we shall achieve a very substantial increase in production over a period of years, as a long-term policy.</P>
    <P>Let us not confuse the tillage policy during this emergency with a long-term agricultural policy.  Tillage as carried out during an emergency&mdash;during the last war and during the present war&mdash; is not the best system of tillage farming; it is a haphazard, inefficient system, and it must be so since you have the position in which land, which was in the ordinary course used for permanent pasture, and farmers who were adapted and trained to the system of grass farming, have to be adjusted suddenly to tillage.  You could not get efficient tillage in one or two years; you must have a long-term policy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1196" /> If we agree, and I am sure we all must agree, that an increase in the area under tillage is desirable, then the next question to consider is how that increase is to be brought about. I assume we all agree that we ought not to have the low percentage of tillage that we had in the past 20 years. We have to change that and adopt a more intensive system of farming. The question is: How do we propose to bring about an increase in the area under tillage?  Suggestions have been put forward repeatedly in this connection. When the Fine Gael Party, under another name, were in power, they advocated mixed farming; they advocated an increase in tillage, but their method of promoting increased tillage was by repeating the doggerel: &ldquo;Keep one more cow, keep one more sow, and till one extra acre.&rdquo;  That did not achieve very effective results, particularly when the farmers joined in the refrain: &ldquo;But tell us how we keep the cow when the bailiff comes to take her.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The area under tillage declined very considerably under the Cumann na nGaedheal régime.  Then a pro-tillage party came into power that thought to increase tillage by the very radical method of destroying the live-stock industry.  They said.  &ldquo;If we destroy the live-stock industry by making it unprofitable for farmers to keep store cattle or fat cattle, and if we subsidise the slaughter of calves, we will force them to till more whether they like it or not.&rdquo;  After seven or eight years of that policy of Fianna Fáil, on the eve of the Great War, it was found that the area under tillage was at least 400,000 acres less than what it was when this State was established.</P>
    <P>One suggestion for increasing the area under tillage was to continue the methods adopted during the emergency&mdash;compulsion. Compulsion may be a good policy in war-time, and it may be possible to carry it through effectively, but in normal times of peace it is a policy that cannot be justified in a democratic country, where the majority of people are engaged on the land.  It would not be practical politics.  Another suggestion in order to ensure that land would be <Col N="1197" /> properly worked was nationalisation. We have that plan very strenuously advocated in Great Britain at present, and there seems to be a great danger that it will be adopted.</P>
    <P>The effect would be to convert the independent and enterprising farmer into a servile, streamlined civil servant.  I think the House will join with me in shuddering at such a prospect. Nationalisation of land is a policy which would reduce the population to a condition of abject slavery. Land is the most important form of private property in this or in any other country, and its ownership is the greatest bulwark against Socialism, Communism or nationalisation.  If a Government were to succeed in the nationalisation of land it would be only a short time until all property, even shirts on the backs of the citizens, would become State property.</P>
    <P>Another suggestion frequently put forward in favour of an increase in the area under tillage is the division of land into small holdings.  We know that on a small holding there is a greater percentage of tillage than on large holdings, because the family that has to live out of a small holding must put a bigger percentage of land under tillage.  Does anybody think that the wholesale breaking up of land, or the wholesale destruction of security of tenure would make for better government or for progress?  At present we have two sets of reformers, one set claiming that we will never have any sound economic policy until the land is divided into small sized holdings, while another set of economists claims that we can never make progress until we have all land taken over and divided into large holdings.  If these two sets of reformers are set to work upon land settlement here they will in a short time reduce agriculture to a state of chaos.  I was going to say &ldquo;bloody&rdquo;, meaning bloody in its literal and Parliamentary sense, because if the right to private property is attacked wholesale, or if it is sought to divide every farm over 30 acres into small sized holdings, or to create larger farms by confiscation, that would produce chaos and anarchy and, at the finish, the farmers would either commit <Col N="1198" /> murder or suicide or spend their time chasing around apple trees.</P>

      <P>I am simply dealing with suggestions that have been made for the purpose of bringing about increased tillage.  It has also been suggested that we should increase the volume of output.  That proposal was made from thousands of platforms&mdash; mainly Fianna Fáil platforms.  Repeatedly we hear it stated that the breaking up of ranches would provide a solution of our agricultural problems. One suggestion frequently put forward which should command a considerable amount of respect is that we can promote tillage by guaranteeing farmers an economic price for tillage products. That is sound up to a certain point. But we have to remember that two-thirds of these products will be required for animal feeding, and that farmers cannot be guaranteed an economic price for tillage products that they require for feeding on their farms.  If we were to attempt to do that it would create chaos by inducing farmers to sell tillage products off the farms, and then there would be a glut of such products on the market.  There may be in the Fianna Fáil Party now &mdash;and there were at one time&mdash;people who claimed that tillage could be promoted by excluding all imports of all animal feeding-stuffs.  There might be something to be said for that if we had no export trade.  As long as it is possible to import animal feeding-stuffs, and to convert them into animal products for re-export, it would be sheer madness on the part of a Government to interfere with the importation of such feeding-stuffs.</P>
      <P>There is no practical alternative to the proposition submitted in the motion, that the way to promote increased tillage is by giving farmers a reasonable inducement to do so; that we should, as it were, tip the scale in support of tillage by paying a bounty on every acre under cultivation.  That policy was introduced in Great Britain at the outset of the present emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the policy that has been <Col N="1199" /> mainly responsible for an expansion in the agricultural output of Great Britain of over 70 per cent.  The British Government realised that it would not be a sound policy to guarantee the farmer a price for tillage purposes sufficiently high to induce him to sell every article of tillage produced off his farm.  They realised that it would be necessary, in order to sustain extensive production on the land, for the farmer to carry as much live stock as possible and to feed a considerable proportion of his produce to the live stock.  Therefore they decided that the only way that the farmer could be encouraged and enabled to extend the area under tillage and to produce the maximum from his land was by the payment of an acreage subsidy. Consequently we have the payment of £10 for every acre of land under potatoes in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, a subsidy of £3 for every acre under wheat, for every acre under rye and, I think, for every acre under flax, and we have also a subsidy for every acre of old pasture land ploughed up.</P>
    <P>I am not one of those who suggest that we should always copy what is done in Great Britain but, in this connection at any rate, it seems to me that the policy of subsidisation of tillage has been a remarkable success. It has led, as I say, to an expansion in agricultural production of over 70 per cent.  If we could only get an expansion of our total agricultural production of half that amount, what an increase it would represent in the national income!  People talk about the cost of this scheme.  It will cost a considerable amount and it is a revolutionary change.  It is a change in agricultural policy, a proposal designed to prevent the agricultural industry from drifting slowly and steadily down to complete exhaustion, but whatever it costs, it is worth the money.  Now, the question is on whom will this cost fall?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>My answer to Deputy Morrissey and to all other Deputies in this House is that it will fall on no <Col N="1200" /> one because an expansion of agricultural production of 50 per cent., as has been found possible elsewhere, would at the present value of agricultural produce amount to an increase in our agricultural income of £40,000,000 per year.  If, even at the outset, this scheme were to cost £10,000,000, that would be only one-fourth of the wealth which it would produce for the country.</P>
      <P>There are people who approach this question from another angle.  They say that it is a measure designed to confer an enormous monetary advantage upon the farming community who are, they claim, doing quite well out of the war. I deny that.  The benefits of this measure will be universal.  They will reach the farmer but they will also reach the agricultural workers who will be employed on the land.  They will reach the urban population and every section of the community because an expansion in agricultural activity must naturally lead to an increase in trade and business and to a bigger circulation of money in the country.</P>

      <P>Deputy Morrissey is inclined to follow the line taken on the motion which was before this House on a former occasion to withdraw the privilege of exemption of income-tax from members of this House.  He thinks that he can side-track this motion by irrelevant interruptions.  There is, of course, a definite limit to the amount of subsidy which you can pay on any product.  First of all, the farmer produces goods on his land for profit, but if the subsidy were made so large that the farmer could live without producing anything on his land, of course, production would stop.  It must be kept at a definite limit.  You might as well ask why the British Government did not increase the subsidy to £30,000,000.  They did not, because the scheme would nullify itself if they were to increase the subsidy to such a large amount that it had no relation to the cost of the finished product.  Take wheat, for instance.  Suppose you fixed a price for wheat sufficient to enable every farmer, even on the poorest land <Col N="1201" /> to grow the crop, you would require to fix the price at £4 or £5 per barrel. That would mean that the farmer on the rich land would reap an enormous benefit.</P>
      <P>We have to take into consideration, in this connection, the vast variation in the conditions of soil in this country. We in Wicklow are expected to grow wheat on the sides of the Wicklow mountains, as I have already pointed out to the House.  The farmer on the poorer land would reap a relatively small reward from a high price for wheat, whereas the farmer on the rich land would reap an excessive profit.  In order to equalise the benefits, it is necessary that a certain percentage of the reward that the farmer receives should be paid to him on an acreage basis.  Thus the farmer on the poorer land growing four or five barrels to the acre would get his £3 per acre just the same as the farmer on the rich land growing 20 or over 20 barrels to the acre.  I think that is common sense, but of course there is no use in expecting that common sense will penetrate into the mind of Deputy Morrissey. He is too long in politics possibly. Because it is common sense it was the policy adopted by Great Britain in regard to wheat and other tillage matters.  They were in a graver emergency and were forced, therefore, to use their brains more actively than we were.  They adopted a policy of subsidisation of tillage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think, perhaps, I have spoken long enough on this matter.  As I stated at the outset, this is a far-reaching measure.  It is designed to bring about a revolutionary change in agricultural policy and to arrest the decay and decline in our agricultural industry.  It is designed to provide increased employment for workers on the land, It is designed to provide increased circulation of money throughout the length and breadth of the country.  There are people in this country who are prejudiced against subsidies of every kind, who say subsidies are no use, but simply a way of feeding the dog on his own tail.  Why do not these people plead for the abolition of all subsidies? What are our social services but subsidies for non-production?  Even the <Col N="1202" /> old age pension is a subsidy to an aged person to retire from active work.  All through our administrative and governmental machine we have subsidies for everything but they are mainly subsidies for non-production.  We have, on the other hand, a considerable number of subsidies for production.  We have had them even in the agricultural industry over a long period.  What is the premium paid for the best type of bulls or the best type of live stock but a subsidy, an inducement offered by the State to the farmer to keep the best type of live stock?  The reason for giving that inducement is that the ordinary laws of commerce would not of themselves induce the farmer to keep the best type.  The subsidy for the best type of live stock is on the same footing as a subsidy for extensive tillage.</P>
    <P>It might be asked how this measure would be adopted, for instance, to whom would the subsidy be paid in the event of a farmer taking land by conacre for tillage.  In that event, of course, it would certainly be paid to the man who actually tills the land. The objection might be raised in regard to a subsidy for tillage that the large farmer would derive greater benefit from it than the smaller farmer. There is no substance however in that, because a subsidy for tillage is a subsidy for labour.  It is a subsidy for employment on the land, and the people who would benefit from such a subsidy first of all are the additional workers who would be employed upon the land if such a policy were put into operation.</P>
    <P>It may be said that I am dealing with a situation which does not exist during this emergency.  It is time that we got out of the attitude of regarding this emergency as something altogether apart from the conditions which will prevail when it has ceased, and regarding the post-war period as something in the far distant future for which we can plan in our easy-chairs. I hold that we must plan for the future and that the future begins now.  This is a constructive effort to plan for a definite expansion in agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamFrancisODonne" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. I have read as much literature on <Col N="1203" /> farming as most people, but I say that one must learn farming on the farm. At the present moment farmers are compelled to put 10 per cent. of their arable land under wheat.  There is no way out of it.  Perhaps they may be forced to till more.  I am not looking for compensation for the consequential damages as a result of wheat growing, but if this war continues for five or six years the evil effects on the land as a result of wheat growing in Ireland will be felt, as they were felt after the 20 years' wheat growing that was started in 1853.  During the Russian war wheat went to 3/- a stone.  It did not go down to less than about 2/6. When the American Civil War started, the price of wheat again increased. From 1853 to 1873 wheat averaged 2/6 or 2/8 a stone.  Every field in Ireland grew wheat eight and ten times in those two decades.  The result was that in 1973 the land was so depleted that there was nothing for the people but the emigrant ship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the intensive wheat growing, the land would grow nothing but what we call squitch grass or wild daisies.  Wheat destroys the land and that can be tested.  If one allows cattle or sheep into a field, part of which has grown wheat, part of which has grown oats and part of which has grown barley, the last part that the animals will go into is that part that has grown wheat.  Rabbits would not eat it. Scientists tell us that wheat is akin to squitch grass.  In fact, in Canada, they have gone as far as to hybridise the kernel of the squitch grass with wheat and the squitch grass was poisoned.  After 1873, after 20 years' wheat growing, it was the fact that the land was rested for ten years and the introduction of artificial manure and the starting of the creameries that gave the land of Ireland the first respite it got.  There is no use in any professor telling me about his analysis of the land.  It can be tested by putting the animals into it and they will show which is the best land.  Wheat is a very bad crop for the land.  Oats and barley are not quite so bad.  Wheat draws an overdraft on the bank of nature and the bill will be presented <Col N="1204" /> for payment, as it was in 1873, and there is no reserve to meet it.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of modern thought in regard to farming.  Sir George Stephens has written some glorious works about it.  Sir Arthur Young failed in three farms in England.  After being in Ireland for eight or ten years he started writing to the papers and telling us what to do.  There is a great deal of modern humbug about humus and clover. There is nothing in it.  Humus must be supplied by the dung from the cows and the stables.  Sir Arthur Young was taken to England and knighted.  Now his ideas about lea farming are being quoted to us.  It is a lot of humbug.  The farmers two generations ago in Ireland must have been the best farmers in the world. The planters were brought over and were given long leases.  Where are they now?  They are gone, the great majority of them, and those who were driven out of their homes are here.  We have not much to learn from any of those people.  We are a land of flocks and herds.  Giraldus Cambrensis said that the climate of this country was too humid for constant wheat growing. In West Cork, this proposal as regards supplying all our own stuff is going to fail, but if this little subsidy were given it would be a great thing and it would make tillage pay pretty well in the present emergency.</P>
    <P>A fact in connection with Denmark which I have not heard touched upon is that the rate for carriage to the port of export is very small.  The sooner it is realised that that has an important bearing on farming the better.  The railway rates in this country from the remoter parts to the port of export are prohibitive.  Another matter which I mentioned before in this House is the drudgery involved in the drawing of water by farmers.  On half the farmsteads of the country a tremendous amount of time and energy is wasted in the drawing of water. Fifteen or eighteen county councils have voted for a national water supply and if that were brought in with the drainage scheme it would be a great advantage.  Deputy Morrissey asks why not give a subsidy of £6, instead of £3, <Col N="1205" /> as we propose in this motion.  The Deputy was tolerably well answered by Deputy Cogan.  This bounty has been given in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland with great effect.  If the same were done here, production would be increased.  But we shall never see more than 30 per cent. or 35 per cent. of the land of Ireland tilled.  Even with that, if you continue with 10 per cent. wheat-growing, the same thing will happen over again: the land will be ruined and, if the farmer has a few pounds left, he will need it for arti ficial manure to compensate for the depredation caused by wheat-growing.</P>

It was assumed that the next motion on the Order Paper would follow the motion on which we have voted, but up parently the motion in the name of Deputy Benson is being withdrawn with the result that we rather prematurely reach the next motion.

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Eireann is of opinion that, in order to preserve the independence of Deputies, it is not desirable that they should be in danger of being regarded as salaried servants of the State; that, in order to enable every citizen, rich or poor, to discharge the duties of a Deputy, if elected by the people to represent them, each Deputy should receive an allowance sufficient to defray the expenses <Col N="1212" /> of his work as a Deputy and that in order effectively to secure this object a Select Committee of Dáil Eireann should be appointed to ascertain the average expenses of the average Deputy and to recommend an annual payment sufficient to defray those expenses.</P>
    <P>I put down this motion yesterday and I am prepared to go on with it, although those who put down motions six months ago do not seem to be so prepared.  I believe that the matter is one of urgency and of considerable public importance.  I might say that I put down this motion because of a motion put down by Clann na Talmhan shortly before the Adjournment. Deputies in this House will remember that, shortly after Clann na Talmhan came in here, they felt they were going to make the welkin ring, and one of the most popular things they could suggest was that all Deputies' allowances should be made subject to income-tax. I believe that the impres sion they sought to create down the country was that they were in favour of having an arrangement whereunder Deputies would get a smaller remuneration than they now enjoy.  I am giving them an opportunity now of putting that pious aspiration into practice. One of their associates recently said he was not going to make a pauper of himself coming to Dáil Eireann for less than £480 a year.  As I understand the Clann na Talmhan motion, if that Deputy's Parliamentary allowance had been made subject to income-tax he would have to come here for approximately £360 a year. He said he is not going to make a pauper of himself by doing that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>He voted against the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say at once in justification of the Deputy to whom I refer that he straightforwardly voted against the Clann na Talmhan motion. Therefore, if my words, so far, suggested that he is guilty of an inconsistency, I want to correct that impression. He voted against the Clann na Talmhan motion, and stood against it in his own constituency.  I am giving the remaining members of Clann <Col N="1213" /> na Talmhan an opportunity of going on record here in Dáil Eireann, and before their constituents, as to what they want.  Do they think Deputies in this House are getting too much to pay their expenses, and, if they do, will they help me to revise that amount? The purpose of this resolution is to get a committee set up by Dáil Eireann which will inquire into every Deputy's allowance, and, if the Deputies in this House are getting more than they ought to get by way of expenses, to reduce their Parliamentary allowance. I have put that down for this reason, that the previous discussion on the Clann na Talmhan motion created, as far as I could judge from the public reaction throughout the country, the impression that every Deputy in this House was a salaried servant of the Government.  I do not want any salary from the Government.  I want to be an independent Deputy in this House, beholden to nobody but my constituents; to speak my mind without let or hindrance, not caring whether I please anybody; not beholden to anybody, and not susceptible to any penalties to be imposed upon me by the Government by way of reduction of my salary or emoluments.  I do not want to regard myself in any sense as a salaried servant of the Executive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do, however, want to ensure that every man in this country, be he rich or poor, will be enabled to come to this House and discharge the duties of an elected Deputy if he secures the suffrages of a quota of voters in any constituency in Ireland.  Unless the Parliamentary allowance is sufficient to defray the reasonable expenses of a Deputy in coming to this House, Parliament in this country is going to be turned into a preserve of the well-to-do. If Parliament in this country is turned into a preserve of the well-to-do, it cannot long survive.  I regard Parliament as one of the greatest bulwarks of human liberty that any society could possibly have.  I note with satisfaction that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lemass, borrowed an article that I published in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of last Sunday, and repeated it almost verbatim.  I congratulate him on his perspicacity and on his feat of memory. <Col N="1214" /> Both do him credit.  I rejoice that someone so widely separated from me in most of our political convictions should find himself in complete accord with me in the importance which he attaches to Parliamentary institutions in this country.</P>
    <P>I confess that it was a shock to me to-night to find one of his colleagues &mdash;I have no hesitation in saying it&mdash; turning the proceedings of this House into a disgusting farce.  I disagreed with Deputy Cogan.  I could not agree or disagree with Deputy O'Donnell, because no man on God's earth could know what he said.  There was neither head nor tail to what he said. But he is an elected Deputy here, and Deputy Cogan is the deputy leader of the Party, and, if they get up and move a motion, it is the duty of the Minister for Agriculture to get up and answer whatever arguments they put forward, be they good or bad, be they intelligible or unintelligible.  But, for the first time in my 11 years' experience of this House&mdash;I have been told that Deputy Lemass as Minister for Industry and Commerce was guilty of the same discourtesy on a previous occasion, but I do not remember that &mdash;I have seen responsible members of a Party publicly insulted by a Minister of State.  If that were to continue, I do not think it would very much matter what class of persons were permitted to come here as elected Deputies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, might I ask if this is a motion of censure on the Minister for Agriculture by Deputy Dillon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  If that outrageous conduct were allowed to continue on the part of a Minister it would not very much matter who came here.  I trust that the scandal we have just witnessed here will galvanise all sides of the House into a resolution that no Minister will again be allowed to perpetrate such a discourtesy and such an outrage on the Parliament of this country.  Pestilential outbreak of blight as I believe the present Taoiseach to be on the country, I do <Col N="1215" /> not believe he would stand for that.  I think he has sufficient of the Parliamentarian in him to forbid the repetition of that outrage, and I believe the bulk of the Deputies in this House will combine to prevent the repetition of such incidents.  I have faith and confidence in Parliament in this country, and I want Parliament to be open to every man and woman whom the electors of this country desire to send here.  I want the people of this country to feel that in maintaining Parliament and in defending its dignity and independence they are defending their own liberty, without which it were better that we should all die.  Now if this House and its Deputies are to be exposed perennially to the misrepresentation that we are all here because we are enjoying a soft job at an excessive salary, the public at large must inevitably lose all confidence in us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say deliberately that when this Select Committee is set up, if it sends for me to give evidence before it I shall be constrained to tell it that I lose money as a result of being a member of Dáil Eireann and that if I were called upon to lose much more than I am losing at present I could not afford to remain a Deputy.  Dáil Eireann might get along very well without me, but there may be other Deputies similarly situated without whom Dáil Eireann could not get on very well, and if you make the financial burden of public representation in this country too heavy for such persons they may withdraw from the counsels of the nation, and we will be left with nothing in this Chamber but carpetbaggers who are drawing salaries from their regular jobs and underpaying persons whom they employ to do substitute for them, and adding to their income by the Parliamentary allowance they get here.  It may be that my case is exceptional.  If that is so, then of course it is quite clear that my case should not rule the whole Dáil.  But what I want is this: let there be a Select Committee of ourselves set up to take evidence from any Deputy who cares to give it; let us there ascertain what are the average expenses of the average Deputy and let us determine <Col N="1216" /> to give all Deputies a Parliamentary allowance equal to these expenses. That done, I cannot see how any reasonable citizen of this State can suggest that such an allowance should be made subject to income-tax.</P>
    <P>I think it right, inasmuch as it is manifest that this motion links up with the motion moved by Clann na Talmhan, to dwell for a moment on the proposal about levying income-tax on Deputies' allowances.  I can see the force of that proposal if you regard the £480 a year we receive as a salary.  I said that during the previous debate, and I want to repeat it now.  But no greater disservice can be done to public life in this country than an attempt by an individual or a Party to mislead the public, to deceive them, and to work up indignation about a state of affairs which in fact does not exist.  I suggest that the effect of the activities of Clann na Talmhan has been to suggest to the public mind that what Deputies are doing is exempting their entire income from income-tax and that when we vote for another shilling on the income-tax we do it with complete immunity, by suffering no part of the burden ourselves.  That is the most grotesque nonsense.</P>
    <P>Any Deputy here who is working in his shop, as I am, or at his profession, as others are, or at his vocation, whatever it may be, has an income.  Every time we put a shilling on the income-tax we put that shilling on our own income.  If somebody coming to Dáil Eireann was earning so small a wage in his lawful avocation that he was not liable to income-tax, he could perfectly easily demonstrate that the £480 which he gets for coming to Dáil Eireann is the expenses of his business in life and thereby could exempt that £480 per year from the incidence of income-tax in the general way.  Every one of us in this Assembly who pays income-tax at all suffers with the rest of the community for every addition that we make to the income-tax of the community as a whole.  I do not think it is desirable that that £480 a year should be looked upon as a salary at all.  Deputy Cogan said here that £480 a year is much too much.</P>

      <P>We will find the record. That was Deputy Cogan's song two months ago when there was no chance of his motion being passed.  But this motion is going to be passed, or I am a Dutchman.  I wonder what song Deputy Cogan will sing now.  Is he going to sing for £120 off his parliamentary allowance?  If he is an honest man he should.  That is what he wanted the country to believe he was going to do. I am going to give him the chance to sing the song.  If he sings it loud enough, with the help of God we will take £120 off his allowance and off everybody else's allowance.</P>
      <P>If he thinks that is right and just, between now and the time this committee makes its report I will give him that chance.  If my experience is unique in that the £480 is not recompensing me for the incidental loss of being a Deputy, if other Deputies find it is more than enough, let it be reduced and let the country know that all any individual Deputy gets for coming to Dáil Eireann and doing the work he has to do is a sum sufficient to recoup him for the loss he suffers as a result of devoting his time to Parliamentary work here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is right, in dealing with a motion of this kind, to recapitulate briefly for the information not only of Deputies but the people of the country the kind of work that is done by a Deputy.  A great many people down the country seem to think, and indeed <Col N="1218" /> are encouraged by those who ought to be informed to believe, that the only thing a Deputy does when elected to Dáil Eireann is to come and sit in Leinster House and that he very rarely does that.  I think any experienced Deputy will have no hesitation in saying that the least onerous part of his duties is sitting or speaking in Dáil Eireann.  If you come in here and get up to make a speech on an important Bill, that may represent a fortnight's work.  If you get up to make a speech or to take part in the Committee Stage of a Bill and if you want to make any impression on the House at all, it involves a considerable amount of research and preparation and study. Many Deputies have come in here in their salad days and thought that they could prance up and down and get away with it.  If Deputies for the first month or two months are given a soft time, they may come to the conclusion that they are hardened old warriors and ought to know their way, and when they prance up and down without any preparation they get a shock &mdash;somebody up-ends them.  They discover that if you want to talk in Dáil Eireann you must know what you are talking about or you must have a very tough hide to face the consequences of talking when you do not know what you are talking about.</P>
    <P>But, quite apart from the deliberative work done here, there is work done on behalf of constituents.  Mind you, I am by no means a Deputy who receives a large number of letters, compared with some other Deputies, but I wrote and posted 82 letters on last Monday week, though I have one of the smallest constituencies in Dáil Eireann and I am an Independent Deputy.  I imagine that Deputies belonging to the Government Party and the principal Opposition would probably receive a very much larger number of letters, on the ground that it might be felt they would have more pull than I have or better contacts than I have.</P>
    <P>All these letters must be dealt with and must be answered; and before you can answer the average letter from a constituent, you have to make a trip to Ballsbridge or the Custom House <Col N="1219" /> or Kildare Street.  If you have the misfortune to get into the toils of the Department of Industry and Commerce, you may travel all over the town before you find the office you want&mdash;it may be in Kildare Street, in the Castle, in Lord Edward Street or in Upper O'Connell Street.  If you get a letter about sugar, coal and paraffin oil, it may cost you 1/9 on the tram to go round amongst the offices, not to count the time waiting to see the individuals you have to interview. In order to make the proper representation in each of these cases, you have to go into a busy office of the Department with some kind of preparation. You cannot go in and look a fool, with no kind of argument prepared: you have to come in ready to transact business with dispatch, so as not to place an intolerable burden on the never-failing courtesy of the over-worked public servants of this country.</P>
    <P>I could elaborate at great length on the various other types of duties which have to be discharged.  Take my own case.  I preside over the Committee of Public Accounts, on which there are 12 or 14 members.  That means that those Deputies, in addition to doing their work in Dáil Eireann, have to attend that Committee once a week at least, and sometimes twice a week, and in preparation for it they must study the Appropriation Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General's Report.  I do not say that they all always do.  You get good members of a committee and bad members but, by and large, the work of the Committee of Public Accounts does involve a considerable amount of attention.</P>
    <P>I do not believe there is a single experienced Deputy of this House who would not have the same story to tell &mdash;that, in one way or another, from the moment he comes to Dublin to attend a meeting of Dáil Eireann until the moment he leaves, he is at it hammer and tongs.  Many of them, over and above what they do when they are actually here, are kept busy in their constituencies in one way or another. I remember one colleague of mine, now in Heaven&mdash;<i>requiescat in pace</i>&mdash;who <Col N="1220" /> told me on one occasion that his work in Dáil Eireann was truly killing him; and he was a man who rarely spoke here.</P>
    <P>I knew that man to be in almost vigorous health, but when he would arrive home from this House every week, as regular as the clock at 7 or 8 o'clock at night there would be nine or ten people outside his house waiting to interview him.  From that time, until he came back to Dáil Eireann again, he would be summoned hither and thither and, if he did not go to the people, the people came to him.  I do not know whether the scarcity of bicycle tyres has reduced that in recent years.  Certainly, that was the case before the war, when motor cars and bicycle tyres were readily available.</P>
    <P>I can imagine a lot of people scoffing and saying that Deputies are not so hard worked as I make out they are. Well, there is the picture.  I remember another Deputy&mdash;I will not mention his name, as I have no leave to do so&mdash; telling me on one occasion that, for curiosity, he took down a year's correspondence and made up his work for his constituents on the basis of solicitor's costs and, if a solicitor had done all the jobs he had done, it would run into, I think, £1,000.  If Deputies would reflect for a moment&mdash;that is those who do their work and answer the letters&mdash;and if they have ever seen a bill of solicitor's costs, they will fully realise that, if all the work were costed on that basis, it would cost £1,000.  I am not arguing that we should get £1,000.  All I am arguing is that Deputies' work calls for conscientious men and, if they are not conscientious men, whose fault is it that they are here?</P>
    <P>If the electors choose to elect duds, what can we do about it?  They do not want us to come down to them and say: &ldquo;You cannot elect that man, because he is a dud.&rdquo;  They know a dud better than we do and, if they prefer a dud to a good one, then they have the God-given right to do so.</P>

      <P>If my observations wounded the Deputy, I trust he will be persuaded that I was not thinking of him&mdash;at the moment, in any case There is another reason why I move this motion.  I did it as part of a general campaign that I think is necessary for the preservation of freedom in this country, to secure that our people will not be misled into habitually decrying and defaming their own representatives. Here we are: we may not be much good, but we are the best the Irish people can choose.  Whatever anybody says about us, before the world we are the best the Irish people can choose.  I am no admirer of the present Government and I would be glad to have evil report of them, but I am bound to say this&mdash;that the last two general elections in this country were the freest general elections that ever were conducted in any democratic country in the world.  Anybody could be heard, anybody could go forward, every citizen of this country was as free as the air to vote for whomever he liked, and every citizen of this State had full and ample opportunity on the hustings and in the Press, taken as a whole, to get a fair picture of the views put forward by every individual who was a candidate in the general election.</P>
      <P>With those facilities the Irish people chose us.  If we are a rotten lot of self-seeking idle parasites on the body politic, then the people of this country are not fit for self-government and the sooner we are reconquered the better. That would be the verdict of the world. If it is true that the Irish people, in a perfectly free election, can choose nothing but 136 duds, then we are clearly not fit to have independence at all and someone else should come in to run this country.  I do not take that view.  I am at the moment in a minority&mdash;at least, in a superficial minority of one&mdash;but I believe that a great many Deputies agree with me in this&mdash;if they had the guts to say so&mdash; but we cannot go into that now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having seen the deliberative assemblies of very many countries in the world, I want to say that the standard of debate, the standard of conduct, and <Col N="1222" /> the standard of industry in Dáil Eireann will compare favourably with any legislative assembly in the world. The truth is that the standard of debate in this House is so high, compared with other legislative assemblies, that we are inclined to be unduly harsh on a degree of mediocrity that would be regarded as very creditable in very many other deliberative assemblies. We are not perfect: God forbid we should ever claim to be; we are very much conscious of our own imperfections and, so long as we are that, we are fit to represent the people.  If we ever get the ridiculous assumption that we are superior to everyone else, we are unfit to discharge the duties of office.  We are fairly representative of the Irish people.  It may be that none but a berserk people could choose Eamon de Valera as Taoiseach, but they have a right to do it.  If they want to choose him and his Government&mdash;rotten or inefficient as they may be&mdash;they are very reasonable members of any deliberative assembly where they care to appear.  I think that the Fianna Fáil Government is a deplorable Government, but that does not alter the fact that it is the choice of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that all the Deputies are corrupt time-servers.  I do not believe that the elected representatives of the people are deserving of censure in their every activity, and I think that it is a very great menace to the liberty of our people that our people should be encouraged to believe these things.  I say that, deriving from the motion put down by Clann na Talmhan and defeated in this House, there may be created in the country the belief that there was only one thing that brought Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael together and that was the defence of their own salaries.  The shrewd old Labour Party saw that danger, too, and they all went trotting off into the Lobby with Clann na Talmhan, not one of them believing in the Clann na Talmham motion, but saying to themselves: &ldquo;If we vote with the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Parties, it will be said that the only thing to bring us into the Lobby together is defence of our salaries&rdquo; and, <Col N="1223" /> watching the mob, they trotted off with Clann na Talmhan.</P>
    <P>Well, I suppose men can sometimes persuade themselves that such things are politically justified.  Actions of that kind are not very nice to look at. But it is important&mdash;and the Labour Party is right in believing&mdash;that certain simple elements in our community might be misled by the suggestion that the only thing which brought all Parties together in this House was in defence of their salaries.  Now, Deputies who make that suggestion, and there are Deputies in this House who do make it, may collar a few ignorant &ldquo;yobs&rdquo; down the country to vote for them at the next election.</P>

If, in order to get votes, Deputies are prepared to stoop to the degradation of defaming the legislative assembly of this country, they are doing something which they may some day gravely rue. I remember that the Leader of Clann na Talmhan, when he found my views unacceptable to his patriotic soul, gathered up his papers and rushed in righteous indignation from the Chamber because, he said, it caused him acute anguish to imagine that my words would be published outside our native land lest scandal should be given.  Did he think of that solicitude about giving scandal outside our native land when, by his actions, he sought to create the impression at home and abroad that the only thing that would bring the Opposition and the Government together was a dirty scramble for salaries that they should not get?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which often provides a very useful nucleus on which to build.  No one can accuse me of having got elected by my uncles, cousins or aunts in the County of Monaghan. I had support from the ground up, and if Deputy Donnellan can show as much in East Galway I will be quite prepared to agree with him.  But let us not go into the question of individual Deputies.  Presumably, we are all concerned to ensure that the world will know that this is a legislative assembly chosen freely by the Irish people, and that it does not feel called upon to hang its head in the presence of any other legislative assembly in the world.</P>
      <P>I am trying to make it perfectly clear that the Deputies of this House are not a group of self-seekers desirous of using their legislative powers in order to secure preferential exemptions for themselves, and to relieve their own backs of burdens that they see fit to put on the ordinary people of the country.  I do not want any salary for the work that I am doing here.  Possibly, I might be able to do it without any allowance, but if allowances were to be withdrawn altogether this House would be made the prerogative only of the well-to-do.  I want to see rich and poor, simple and sophisticated, free to enter this House if the electors of this country choose to send them here.  In order to get that, I want them to get adequate allowances.</P>
      <P>In order to secure that, I move the motion standing in my name.  I hope, and I am emboldened to hope from previous statements made by the Taoiseach, that the Government will support the motion and will give it favourable consideration.  I am not without hope that the principal Opposition Party will support it.  I hope that the Labour Party will give us their help in securing that this inquiry will be instituted, and, of course, I have no doubt but that the sea-green incorruptibles in Clann na Talmhan will be in the van to give it their backing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked three questions to-day relating to the price of beet and beet pulp and I got from the Minister for Finance a most extraordinary reply.  In one question I asked the Minister was he aware that the price of beet for the 1944-45 crop was fixed without any consultation with the representatives of the producers of beet, and if he approved of this action.  The Minister, in the course of his reply, said that he was made aware of the views of the Beet Growers' Association regarding the price for beet in 1944, and kindred matters, which had been conveyed by the association to the company before the question was raised with the Government.  It will show the manner in which those prices are fixed when I tell the House that there was no discussion whatever this year between the Beet Growers' Association and the Sugar Company with regard to the price of beet.</P>
      <P>What happened was that at the annual meeting of the Association last August a decision was come to, namely, that we should request the Government to have a round table conference on the price of beet this year, the conference to be composed of representatives of the Government, representatives of the Sugar Company and representatives of the Beet Growers' Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1227" /> That decision was forwarded to the Government very early in September and a formal acknowledgment was received.  We received no further communication and, on the 6th January, the secretary of the association wrote again asking for a reply to his communication and also asking when would the conference be held.  We received a reply on the 19th January telling us that such a conference could not be arranged and that we could communicate our views through the Sugar Company. On the evening of the 21st January the prices were announced over the wireless.</P>
    <P>The Beet Growers' Association is elected by the free postal votes of every beet grower in this country, and it represents the £80,000 farmers who grow beet.  This is a time of emergency and sugar is rationed in this country.  If it is the opinion of the Government that the producers of beet should not be invited into a conference when the price of that commodity is being fixed, and so have their views considered, then I am convinced that that accounts to a large extent for sugar having to be rationed here.  So far as the members of the Beet Growers' Association, as representatives of the beet growers, are concerned, I do not agree that we should on any occasion present our case to the Sugar Company and allow them to put whatever face they like on it and convey their impressions to the Government.</P>
    <P>I wonder did the Sugar Company pretend to the Minister that they had met the Beet Growers' Association? I accept the Minister's word that they did.  The Minister told me: &ldquo;I was made aware of the views of the Beet Growers' Association regarding the price for beet in 1944 and kindred matters, which had been conveyed by the association to the company before the question was raised with the Government.&rdquo; If the Sugar Company conveyed views to the Minister as regards what the Beet Growers' Association wanted for beet this year, I wonder where they got those views?  They did not get them from the members of the association.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1228" /> The Minister states that this company is a limited liability company, and that the directors have full responsibility for the management of the affairs of the company.  In January, 1943, the secretary of the Beet Growers' Association wrote to the Sugar Company asking them what arrangements they were making in connection with the sale of surplus pulp during last season.  The reply from the secretary of the company stated that the pulp was being handed over to the Beet Growers' Association as usual for disposal and that the price would be the same as in the previous year, £5 5/- per ton.  We made our arrangements accordingly.  In September we received a letter from the Sugar Company stating that the price would be £7 instead of £5 5/-.  We made several attempts to meet the Sugar Company, but failed to do so until close on two months ago, when we went to them and asked were they going to honour the letter that the secretary had written to us.  The manager of the firm turned round, as cool as you like, and said: &ldquo;That man had no authority to write that letter.&rdquo;  We refused to have any further dealings with them until a full board meeting was called.  The full board met the following week and they had to hand over to the Beet Growers' Association something like £15,000 to be refunded to the farmers from whom they were endeavouring to rob it.</P>
    <P>That is the firm to whom the beet growers are to go with their case, so as to have it conveyed to the Department. It is no wonder there is rationing of sugar in this country to-day.  All I say in regard to industrial development here is, may God protect this country from the types of industrialists who are no better than three-card trick men.  That is the position at the moment.  The Sugar Company take very good care this year to change the price of the pulp from £5 5s. to £7, a difference of 35/- a ton.  I asked the Minister to-day whether he approved of the change in price and, if he did approve, would he see to it that the a difference in price, 35/- per ton, representing something like £15,000, would be given back to the farmers.  Apparently the Sugar Company did not fix <Col N="1229" /> the price of the beet.  The price of the beet was not announced to the public by the Sugar Company; it was announced by the Minister for Finance, and the change from £5 5s. to £7 was also announced by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I think I am entitled to ask the Minister for Finance if he intends to allow the robbery of £15,000 by the Sugar Company, or whether he would insist on a clause being put into the contract, so that the 35/- per ton is given to those who buy pulp, or handed back to the growers of beet. I consider that a period like this, when we have to depend absolutely on the production of the necessaries of life by our people, is not a time for bargaining or arguing.  The producers of food for this nation should have been consulted by the Government, and the price should not be fixed by the Sugar Company and a managing director of the type who endeavoured to rob £15,000 from the pockets of the farmers, without scruple and without excuse.  That is my case.  I should be glad to hear from the Minister if the Sugar Company saw the Beet Growers' Association so that they could put their case to him, and, if not, if he is now prepared to consider the arguments of the beet growers at a round table conference, to fix the price of beet, so that our people will have sugar next year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Deputy Corry in protesting against the treatment meted out to the Beet Growers' Association.  I differ with Deputy Corry in this respect, that I am not so much inclined to blame the Board of the Sugar Company as the Government. The resolution the Deputy referred to was passed a considerable time ago and the Minister for Agriculture was aware of it.  Shortly before the price was announced a deputation discussed the matter with him.  Nothing was done about it.  That was a disgraceful way to treat beet growers. The Minister told the House that he was made aware of the views of the beet growers.  When we discussed the matter with the Sugar Board last year, we were informed by them that they had no responsibility, but would <Col N="1230" /> convey the views of the beet growers to the proper quarters.  That happened 12 months ago.  Are the primary producers to be treated in that manner?  They were denied the right to discuss price and conditions with the responsible Minister before the price was fixed.  There is an arbitrary method of fixing prices and treating an important section of the community with contempt.  The price is fixed in a purely arbitrary way.  Costings are not taken into account and no opportunity for discussion is given with the responsible Minister or with the officials of his Department.  When the price is fixed the growers' views are ignored.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Minister that the Beet Growers' Association is anxious to be reasonable as far as the price of beet is concerned.  They have never demanded an unreasonable price.  They never believed in asking an exaggerated price.  They always felt that the wisest policy was to ask a price that was reasonable and fair in all circumstances. There was always the possibility of having their demands met in that way.  In present conditions they felt they were entitled to make representations to the Minister.  The position has definitely worsened for growers, inasmuch as the cost of labour has increased.  The cost of casual labour will be considerably increased because labour is scarce and difficult to secure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of production generally has risen, including machine parts, plough parts, kerosene for tractors, and horseshoes. Under the last contract, growers anxious to secure pulp, in addition to what they were entitled to get, could secure it at £5 5s. 0d. per ton, but under the proposed contract the price has been raised to £7; so that conditions under which beet has to be grown have worsened by that amount.  An adjustment in price to cover that item is not an unreasonable demand to make.  The position seems all the more extraordinary seeing that the Government saw fit to increase the price of sugar by 1d. per lb.  At 1d. per lb. the price of sugar, in terms of beet, represents 26/- per ton.  Is there any justification for that increase by the <Col N="1231" /> Sugar Company when there is no increase in the cost of raw material for the production of sugar?  Is it fair to the primary producers of the raw material to give a substantial increase to the Sugar Company without making an effort to share even a small proportion of it to cover the increased cost of production of sugar beet?</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry informed the House that the secretary of the Beet Growers' Association was informed that the Government refused a proposal for a round table conference.  The price was announced two days later, although the Minister for Agriculture, when he received the deputation, assured them that he would give the matter consideration, and that the points raised would be fully considered. The secretary of the association did not hear anything from the Minister since, but the company proceeded to print contract forms and, I suppose, are circulating them.</P>
    <P>In view of the appeals made to the agricultural community at the present time, and the necessity for such appeals for patriotic reasons, I think it is grossly unfair and contemptible to treat an important section of the community, as far as food production is concerned, in that manner.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the whole question.  Evidently he was misinformed when he stated that he was made aware of the beet growers' views, seeing that they did not get the opportunity to express any views.</P>

I know from past experience that Deputy Hughes can be rough and ruthless when he likes, but he did not choose to be so to-night.  I must protest in the strongest way against the language of Deputy Corry in this <Col N="1232" /> debate.  It is not the first time I had to protest in this House, but evidently the Deputy has not learned the lesson. I protest again.  I think it is shocking that a man in a responsible position, such as the Deputy is in, should use the language he used towards officials of an important public institution like Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann and towards the distinguished man who is manager of that concern, when he talked of &ldquo;robbing the farmers&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>There was no such thing as &ldquo;robbing the farmers&rdquo; in any matter relating to Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann when dealing with the Beet Growers' Association.  First of all, it is a fact that I was informed by Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann that there had been talks between the representatives of the Beet Growers' Association and the company.  There was a meeting&mdash;call it what kind of meeting you like.  A deputation from the Beet Growers' Association called on the Sugar Company Directors on the 13th January and discussed various matters with them relating to the business of the two bodies.  Arising out of that, certain representations were made to me on behalf of the beet growers with regard to the price of beet, the price of pulp and the average sugar content on which the price should be arranged.  These matters were discussed with the board.</P>

      <P>I listened long enough to Deputy Corry, much too long.  I wish that he would learn to be a little more measured in his language; it would do his case a great deal more good.  Language such as he used only tends to get people's backs up.  I say to the Beet Growers' Association if they are looking for a representative from this side of the House: &ldquo;Do not send Deputy Corry&rdquo;.  Do not send him to me, anyhow, if he is going to use that kind of language.  I, as Minister for Finance, am responsible for a number of things in connection with the Sugar Company&mdash;the acquisition of shares, the sale of shares, the guarantee on debentures, the nomination of directors and the presentation of accounts.  All other matters relating to the business of Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann should be discussed with the company and not with the Minister. Up to now the Government has never received any personal representations from the Beet Growers' Association. It has never been the practice and we are not going to change what has been the practice now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">

      <P>On that I have my own views and my own information, too.  They told us definitely that we would not get the acreage.  They told us we would never get the acreage but we got twice as much.  We got twice as much, thank God, from the sensible farmers of the country and that gave us all the sugar that was required.  This is a matter of business but apparently Deputy Corry has an objection to bargaining. Did anyone ever know a farmer not to bargain to try to get a better price?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>They bargained&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Shut up for once and give somebody else a chance.  I am sorry for being so rude but Deputy Corry got his chance and he will have several other chances of raising this matter, and I am sure he will avail of them, but I hope he will do so in more measured language than he used this evening.  This is a matter of business between the Sugar Company and the beet growers.  The Sugar Company consult the Government and convey to the Government such information as they think may be useful to the Government. They did that with me in this case and the matter was discussed by the Government.  Of course this matter is very important; the price of sugar is very important.  Deputy Hughes does not know why the price of sugar should be raised this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Deputy know the position of the Sugar Company as a result of the price for beet being increased? The Sugar Company has not made any profits.  It has not put anything to reserve or has not put anything by for depreciation comparable to what it should put in the last year because there were no profits.  That is the position and that is why the price of sugar has had to be increased.  Sugar production should be a paying proposition in this country and the fact that it is not, is not due to any lack of good management.  I do not think that Deputy Hughes will suggest that the business is not capably managed but the manufacture of sugar did not pay, and even with this increase of one penny per lb. in price to the consumer <Col N="1235" /> it will not pay.  That is the position. It is not right, then, to let the statement go that there was no reason for raising the price of sugar.  As a matter of fact the additional penny will not pay the Sugar Company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister estimated how much the additional penny will bring in?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have got the figures, but I have not them by me at the moment.  If the Deputy puts down a question, I shall get the figures for him.  Even the increase of 1d. per lb. will not make sugar manufacture a paying proposition.  The Minister has not been able to get the 5 per cent. he should get on the shares of the taxpayers of this country invested in that concern.  Deputy Hughes says that he or the growers never believed in asking an unreasonable or exaggerated price.  I believe they did both.  I believe they did it last year and this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>We did not get an opportunity this year of asking anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>As I say, Deputy Hughes knows that the Beet Growers' Association were never heard by the Government.  Why should they be <Col N="1236" /> heard this year?  I am satisfied that the Board of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann will hear the Beet Growers' Association as often as they wish to be heard on that matter.  I can assure Deputies who are interested in this matter that the board of directors have fought for the beet growers with me, and with the Government through me, and through the Minister for Agriculture, on many occasions.</P>
      <P>They put up their case in a very convincing way but then the consumer of sugar has to be considered as well as the beet growers.  I, as Minister for Finance, having to think of both sides of the case, try to arrive at a reasonable price for the beet grower, a price which will not work out unreasonably for the sugar consumer.  I think the beet growers this year and last year are getting a fair deal.  I say they are getting more than a fair deal with regard to the price of pulp.  Pulp is worth more than £7 per ton to any man who feeds it to cattle.  So I am told by farmers who grow beet and who use large quantities of pulp, more than they receive in their allowance. I do not think there is time to say anything further on this matter except that I do think that Deputy Corry spoiled whatever case he had by the offensive language he used.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Thursday, 17th February.</P>

      <P>The information asked for by the Deputy is set out in a tabular statement hereunder regarding which the following comments are desirable:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Unemployment insurance, widows' and orphans' pensions and national health insurance have, of necessity, been set out separately though they must, of course, be read as part of the statement as a whole.  The distinctive grouping is due to two main reasons: (1) that statutory funds are involved and that, in addition to State and other contributions, an element of interest on investments is present which could not readily be fitted into the framework of the tabular statement; (2) that the accounts of the National Health Insurance Fund are prepared in relation to the calendar and not the financial year and the figures could, therefore, not readily be merged with those entirely related to the financial year.</P>
      <P>The amounts set out are exclusive of administrative charges.</P>
