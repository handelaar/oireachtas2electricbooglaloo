      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he will take steps to acquire a number of motor tyres and have them issued to doctors and clergy who need them in discharge of their duties; and what steps, if any, he proposes to take to see that motor tyres are made available in all cases of necessity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The rubber supply position has necessitated the suspension of the manufacture <Col N="1511" /> of tyres for light motor vehicles and consequently new tyres for such vehicles can no longer be provided. Arrangements are at present in operation whereby the Irish Dunlop Company will supply remoulded tyres required for immediate use on vehicles engaged on essential services, provided the owners of such vehicles are in a position to forward to the company sound casings suitable for remoulding. It is open to persons not in possession of suitable casings to obtain them from owners of laid-up vehicles.  I am not aware that any widespread difficulty is being experienced by owners of vehicles engaged on essential services in acquiring serviceable secondhand tyres or tyres suitable for remoulding.</P>
      <P>The compulsory acquisition of tyres on laid-up vehicles is a step which would give rise to considerable difficulty, and I consider that such a scheme should only be brought into operation in circumstances of compelling necessity and would not at present be justified.</P>

      <P>An application by Ailtirí na hAiséirghe for permission to publish a new fortnightly paper has been refused.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £11,185 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1944, for Wound and Disability Pensions, Further Pensions and Married Pensions, Allowances and Gratuities (No. 26 of 1923, No. 12 of 1927, No. 24 of 1932, No. 15 of 1937, No. 2 of 1941 and No. 14 of 1943); Military Service Pensions, Allowances and Gratuities (No. 48 of 1924, No. 26 of 1932, No. 43 of 1934, and No. 33 of 1938); Pensions, Allowances and Gratuities (No. 37 of 1936); Payments in respect of Compensation for Members of the Local Defence Force (No. 28 of 1939); and for sundry Contributions and Expenses in respect thereof, etc.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the present Supplementary Estimate for the Financial Year 1943-44 is to provide funds for the payment of pensions authorised by the Army Pensions Act of 1943.  That Act was passed on 27th April, 1943.  It was, therefore, too late to be covered by the annual Estimates for 1943-44, and consequently a Supplementary Estimate is now necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act of 1943 provides increased rates of wound pensions, pensions for disability due to disease, allowances for the widows and orphans and other dependents of deceased personnel, and special allowances for Easter Week men.  The financial provision to cover these amendments and extensions of the Army Pensions Acts is contained in sub-heads E, F and O, of the present Supplementary Estimate.  Sub-head E requires an additional gross sum of £5,298 to meet wound and disability pensions.  It is expected, however, that there will be savings to the extent of about £3,500 under the sub-head, so that the net sum required will be only £1,798.  The savings are due to the fact <Col N="1522" /> that we have less awards under the Acts of 1932 and 1937 than we had anticipated on framing the annual Estimate.</P>
    <P>As regards allowances payable to the widows, orphans and other dependants of deceased officers and men (sub-head F), the gross sum required is £2,000. Here again, however, there are substantial savings under the sub-head, so that the net sum required is only the token figure of £10.  The savings have accrued under the Acts of 1923 and 1937, and are mainly attributable to the death of beneficiaries.  The special allowances for Easter Week men will cost this year about £2,370.</P>
    <P>The Department is taking advantage of this Supplementary Estimate to rearrange its expenditure under the various sub-heads to reflect more exactly its financial commitments for the year.  Thus, under sub-head I, which covers Military Service Pensions, it will require an extra £14,000, due to the fact that the average rate of pensions payable since the Estimate was framed was higher than expected.</P>
    <P>As regards the salary sub-heads (C and Q) the sum of £1,700 under sub-head C is due to an increase of staff costing £800, and to gratuities paid to two members of the Referee and Advisory Committee when their full time employment ceased: and under sub-head Q gratuities paid to the three members of the Military Service Registration Board when the work of the board had been completed and the service of its members terminated.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head K £1,000 is required to defray the expenses of applicants under the Army Pensions Acts, and witnesses under the Military Service Pensions Acts attending before the statutory bodies administering the Acts.  Finally under sub-head P an extra-statutory grant of £30 is provided to rectify an error of administration. The total gross sum required under the eight sub-heads is, therefore. £27,248.  Portion of that sum to the extent of £16,063 will be found from other sub-heads, leaving a nett sum of £11,185, which the Dáil is asked to vote.</P>

      <P>There is one matter which I should like to put before the Minister.  I mentioned it on the Vote for the Minister's Department. There is a good deal of dissatisfaction in regard to the provision made for persons who are invalided out of the Army due to their having contracted T.B. while in the Army or as a result of an accident having occurred to them while in the Army. I mentioned a particular case to the Minister where a man was involved in an accident and the Army medical authorities attributed the fact that he later contracted T.B. to the accident. Ultimately he died from T.B. and no contribution whatever was made for hospital or medical expenses and, as far as I am aware, at any rate, up to a few months ago, no payment of any kind was made to his dependents. I ask the Minister to consider this whole question, because the net result of it is that people regard the Army as being rather callous in their treatment of men who contract tuberculosis. I am aware that the Minister has not sufficient sanatoria or other provisions to deal with the problem, but I think that, in cases where an actual accident occurs, he should consider carefully the expedition of payments or gratuities either to the person concerned or to his dependents. As far as I can see, there is far too much delay and there is general dissatisfaction as to the manner in which the inspection of cases and the granting of gratuities or other payments are carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to reinforce what has been said with respect to expedition in the granting of pensions and allowances paid to dependents. I know of some cases that have been pending for 12 and 18 months while the people are in need of the money.  There was one case <Col N="1524" /> where a soldier died of disease contracted in the Army and his dependents are looking for payment.  The latest letter I have received from the Minister's Department says that the case will be considered as soon as the board has reported.  The particular case I have in mind has been going on for over 12 months.  There is another case of a similar nature.  Some dissatisfaction is expressed as to the way in which these matters have been dealt with.  I do not know whether the Minister has to wait for the board to report or by what means these decisions are arrived at, but several cases have come to my knowledge in connection with which a good deal of dissatisfaction was expressed as to delay.  I ask the Minister, if it is at all in his power, to speed up the boards or the committees that consider these cases, in order to bring some relief to the people who are waiting for expenses incurred.  I know of cases where even funeral expenses have not been paid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Sir John Esmonde Sir John Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know whether this Estimate provides any money for cases of ordinary accidents which occurred to members of the Defence Forces while in the employment of the State?  I have in mind the case of a man proceeding on duty in a motor lorry which overturns, or of a soldier who, while working on a railway embankment, falls and injures himself.  Does the Estimate provide for that type of injury?  The actual words used are &ldquo;wound or disability&rdquo;, but these matters crop up from time to time.  In the case I have mentioned, of the soldier who, in the course of his duties as a soldier, was working on a railway embankment and who slipped and fell to the roadway. as a result of which he met his death &mdash;the case is not quite recent&mdash;there was a considerable amount of difficulty in obtaining even an <i>ex gratia</i> payment. If my memory serves me correctly, the man in question was the sole support of his mother.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the other case, which I brought to the notice of the Minister some time ago, of the leader of the L.D.F. who co-operated with the <Col N="1525" /> regular Army in making a mine safe on the coast of Wexford.  There was considerable confusion and difficulty in that case also, and eventually the applicant was refused any disability award of any kind, although it would seem to the ordinary lay mind that he was as much on active service as any of the soldiers engaged in dismantling the mine.  There is then the case of the soldier who meets with an accident while being transported in an Army lorry.</P>
    <P>These cases crop up from time to time, and, for some reason or other, they do not seem to get as ready consideration as the more spectacular cases of soldiers who are injured by bullets or explosives.  I put forward these suggestions not in any critical spirit, but with a view to helping to maintain the feeling which should exist, that anyone who is prepared to leave his ordinary employment to serve as a temporary soldier, or otherwise co-operates in defending the State, should expect to receive, in return, full consideration when he meets with accidents of this kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know, arising out of sub-head O&mdash;Special Allowances to Persons who served in Easter Week&mdash;if the Minister is aware that there is very grave dissatisfaction amongst a number of men who are suffering great hardships through unemployment at present and who have certificates of service for that period and are wearing their decorations? These service certificates and decorations do not carry with them anything in the way of a grant.  It was stated by a deputation which saw a few members of the House some nights ago that a grant to these men in the present bad times would be very welcome.  I appeal to the Minister to review these cases, to call in their certificates and to see if something cannot be done for these men who gave service during Easter Week which did not come under the heading of active service, in the sense of very strong action and not service in the movement generally.  It was because of the hardships borne by these men that the deputation came to the House and asked that we should <Col N="1526" /> plead with the Minister to give them a grant.  They drew attention to very high officials, enjoying big salaries, who were awarded pensions.</P>
      <P>You can see some of these men wearing, with pride, their decorations, but these decorations carry no money award with them and, because of the present bad times, this deputation, representing the men from 1916 to 1922 &mdash;I am not sure if they represented men of the post-1922 period&mdash;asked me to raise the matter on a Bill whicn they thought was about to be introduced and to urge that the time had come for doing justice to them and for relieving them of the hardships they are going through.  Some of them lost their jobs because of their service in 1916.  They never got them back and are now casual workers seeking work wherever they can get it.  I know the Minister has had many difficult cases to handle and probably this is a very big problem, but it provides an opportunity of reminding the Minister of the hardships which these men who served the country to the best of their ability are suffering and of asking that they should not be forgotten.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to the matter raised by Deputy L. Cosgrave, that is, the discharge of soldiers who contract tuberculosis while in the Army.  It is a position which has been very unsatisfactory for quite a long time.  With the large numbers in the Army at present, and the intensive training which they have undergone in recent years, we are bound to have a large number of men contracting tuberculosis in the future.  It seems to me that the Army authorities or the Government have not done all they might have done in the matter of the provision of sanatoria within the Army for the treatment of those who contract tuberculosis.  Every Deputy knows a number of them who are thrown back into his constituency when very far advanced in tuberculosis.  They are given no gratuity and are not provided with pensions, but are sent home to their families.  The county medical officer finds them out in a few weeks or months, and has them transferred to the local sanatorium, if accommodation <Col N="1527" /> is available.  If not, they are allowed to remain with their families, who run the risk of contracting the disease.</P>
      <P>I urge that, with the large numbers in the Army at present, and the known possibility of increased numbers contracting tuberculosis on account of the strenuous life they have lived and must live while the emergency exists, sufficient sanatoria should be provided out of State funds for the treatment of these men.  The present position is most unfair to the local authorities who have to provide for the tuberculosis patients in their own areas.  They have not got accommodation even for those patients, and it is most unfair to the families of these soldiers and to the soldiers themselves.  I suggest that if they are to be discharged from the Army, they should be kept, before discharge, in the Army hospitals, until such time as they have been given pensions, if they are entitled to them, and should not be sent home in a very low state of health and with no means whatever of maintaining themselves.  It is absolutely callous the way these men are being treated, and the position has existed so long now that some provision should be made for their treatment in Army hospitals.</P>

      <P>Under the Wounds and Disability Pensions Act, 1943, gratuities are provided for the dependents of soldiers in certain circumstances. I want to raise the question of a certain type of soldier&mdash;the soldier who happens to be illegitimate.  If the mother of such a soldier otherwise qualifies for a gratuity, will the Minister tell the House whether or not such a woman will be told that she is not a mother within the meaning of this legislation?  So far as the other points which have been raised are concerned, as to the treatment of soldiers discharged in bad health from the Army, I am sure the Minister will deal with the matter in his reply.</P>

      <P>There is another type of case to which I should like to direct the attention of the Minister, that is, the case of the young man <Col N="1528" /> who enters the Army with the consent of his employer and on the understanding that his employment will be available for him when he returns, who contracts illness other than tuberculosis during his service, of such a nature as to bring about his discharge on medical grounds from the Army. He returns to his employer and the employer, on account of the nature of his discharge, because his employable capacity is reduced and, more particularly, as the individual will be associated with machinery, decides that he cannot with safety employ him.  The individual then finds himself with loss of his employment and without any compensation.  Such a case has come under my notice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to bring before the Minister the question of the Enniscorthy men who came out in 1916.  Enniscorthy was the one town in which anyone came out in 1916 in support of the Rising in Dublin.  Some genuine cases have been turned down by the Minister of men who were in uniform and carried arms in 1916 and did the same service as men already granted pensions: These men were told that they were not persons to whom the Act applied.  According to the Act, any man who came out in 1916 was entitled to a pension.  Some of these men in Enniscorthy got a medal for their service and, if they were entitled to a medal, I think they were entitled to a pension, because that proved that they had given service. Some of these were leading men in the movement right along from 1914 when the Irish Volunteers were established. On behalf of these men, and on behalf of the Old Comrades' Association and the Old I.R.A., it is my duty to ask the Minister, if he cannot see his way to grant them a pension, to grant them a gratuity.  Some of them were working-class men who lost their employment by taking the action they took.  In that town of Enniscorthy there were some men who were sentenced to death.  That is proof that all these men had given service. This matter has created a great grievance in Enniscorthy and in the rural areas from which men took part. Their applications are genuine. <Col N="1529" /> Others who, through political pull, have been awarded pensions, had not as good a case as the men turned down.  In a question to the Minister I submitted the names of 40 men who are prepared to prove to the Minister that their cases were genuine.  If the Minister will reconsider these cases favourably he will satisfy a very discontented body of men who gave good service.</P>
      <P>Now, with regard to the Army, in Enniscorthy there are also men who have been discharged from the Army as unfit on medical grounds.  Some of them tell me that they had to fill in a form when they joined the Army stating that they would not claim any compensation.  Other men lost their lives, some of them in the Wicklow explosion and, so far as I know, their dependents have received no compensation whatsoever.  I think it is a very bad policy to expect young men to join the Army and ask them to fill in a form that they will not make any claim against the State if they meet with an accident or lose their health.  I hope the Minister will give serious consideration to these two classes of cases, especially the case of the men who were responsible for a Government being in power here to-day. Without these people we would not have our own Government in our own country.  It was the men who came out in 1916 and who made sacrifices who are responsible for the fact that there is a Government functioning in this country at the present time.</P>

      <P>There are two points on which I should like the Minister to give us some information.  At question time to-day, in reply to Deputy Flanagan, the Minister for Justice, replying for the Minister for Defence, said&mdash;if I interpreted the answer correctly&mdash;that there was no provision made for the expenses of applicants who appear before the Pensions Board.  Deputy Flanagan was asking the Minister to take some steps to refund the expenses incurred by unsuccessful applicants and the reply was that there was no provision made for the expenses of applicants.  From sub-head K of the Supplementary Estimate <Col N="1530" /> it would appear that there was provision made for the expenses of applicants because we are asked for the additional sum required to defray the expenses of applicants and their witnesses.  There appears to be a contradictory position there because, if the reply to the question was correct and there was no provision made for the expenses of applicants, how is it that we are asked to vote an additional sum for the expenses of applicants? I ask the Minister to clear up that point because it might give rise to misunderstanding.</P>
      <P>I was not quite clear as to what the Minister gave as his reason for the biggest item in this Estimate, an additional sum of £14,000 to meet the cost of pensions under sub-head I.  I understood the Minister to say that it was because the rate of pension granted during the past year was higher than expected.  Does that mean that pensions granted in the past year to applicants who were given pensions for the first time were at a higher rate than was anticipated?  I cannot see how that could arise because, obviously, these applications must have been before the Pensions Board for a long time and it would be reasonable to assume that the original Estimate of the Department would be a fairly correct estimate of what the applicants were to get if they were awarded a pension.  The jump of £14,000 seems rather excessive in view of the total Estimate.  I should like the Minister to clear up these two points because his opening explanation did not leave them very clear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if provision is made in the Estimate for the cases of discharged soldiers suffering from tuberculosis. In asking that question, I have in mind the case of a widow with two sons.  One of these sons, who is 22 or 23 years of age, joined the Army in 1940 after being medically examined. He was discharged from the Army about six months ago as medically unfit, due to his contracting tuberculosis.  I feel that in a case like that, when a young man responded to the call and did his duty and contracted <Col N="1531" /> a disease of this nature, special consideration should be given to it and he should not be sent home to depend upon his mother or his brother and sister to keep him.  I feel that that case deserves attention from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>A lot of questions have been raised about this matter and I would like the Minister to indicate publicly, by a statement issued from his Department, the action of his Department in relation to persons who have been invalided out of the Army because of T.B. or any other disease.  I know a number of cases in Cork where there is a considerable amount of doubt, notwithstanding the fact that these men signed a declaration that, in the event of disability of any kind or character, they would not seek compensation. These are men who went out of good jobs and who have become debilitated in one way or another&mdash; both officers and men.</P>
      <P>It would ease the mind of a whole lot of people if such a statement were made and it would give Deputies some little rest from the number of applicants who keep calling and writing. I felt that these cases were met by one or other of the regulations governing these matters, but I feel now that it would be very wise on the part of the Minister to publish a statement which would reach the ears and eyes of persons who feel that they are suffering under an injustice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Anthony that there should be some definite statement from the Minister in connection with persons invalided out of the Army.  Time and time again, those connected with public bodies come across cases of men who have contracted T.B. in the Army, or where T.B. has been aggravated by their Army service.  It is an extraordinary state of affairs that a person, before being taken into the Army, has to sign a form declaring that, in the event of such and such happening, there would be no claim on the Department. After all, if a man is prepared to come forward and serve his country in the <Col N="1532" /> hour of need and, during the course of such service, contracts a disease like T.B., surely the Minister, the Department and the Government generally should not be so callous as to throw that man out on the roadside and do nothing about him.  Such a man is usually a burden on the county council.  Surely this matter should be attended to by the Government and should be a national charge.  The Minister should make some definite statement on the situation.</P>
      <P>I was not clear as to what the Minister meant when he was describing sub-head O&mdash;Special Allowances to persons who served in Easter Week.  I would like the Minister to give us more information as to what that particular money is for.  I, like others, want to protest against the delay in dealing with claims made by Old I.R.A. people for pensions.  All over the country there is dissatisfaction in consequence of the fact that such a lengthy period is taken to deal with cases of this kind.  In a great many cases, it is known generally that men have had service in the I.R.A., service during Easter Week, but, because of the fact that no officer can be got to come forward and give evidence in connection with that service, nothing has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard of a case where a man definitely gave service in Easter Week, but because the officer who was over him at that particular time now differs with him in politics, that man had been left without a pension.  That may be the case in various parts of the country, and it is an unfortunate state of affairs. There might be others who would be prepared and in a position to give evidence on that man's behalf, and such evidence ought to be accepted. Time and time again, those of us who have represented Wexford over a period of years have referred to the position in Enniscorthy town.  As the Minister knows, the I.R.A. in Enniscorthy turned out <i>en masse</i> in Easter Week and took control of the town.  I do not think there was any other place outside Dublin where such a thing took place.  It is a sad state of affairs to think that a lot of these men who took part in the Rising in Enniscorthy in <Col N="1533" /> 1916 are still dissatisfied with the treatment meted out to them by this Government and the last Government.</P>
    <P>I could recite cases of men whom I know to have been engaged actively in Easter Week and who have been turned down.  Many of them believe that they have service equal to, if not superior to, that of some of the people who have already received pensions. Some time ago, when I raised this matter here, the Minister promised to give special consideration to the cases I mentioned.  I am wondering what has been done in that connection.  I do know that the cases of a couple of the persons whose names I gave at that time have been brought up again for re-examination.  Three cases have been sent to me recently.  One is that of a man named Rafter of Ballindaggin, outside the town of Enniscorthy.  Anyone who knows Enniscorthy knows that the name of Rafter stands out above every other name.  This man's brother is the man who led the insurrection in 1916 in Enniscorthy&mdash;a man who sacrificed everything in the interests of his country.  His brother is seeking a pension for the service he rendered in Easter Week and during the Black and Tan period.  His service is known to everybody.  Officers have tendered evidence on his behalf and he is still without any definite word from the Government as to his position.</P>
    <P>There is another man who was attached to the garrison during Easter Week, named Somers.  This man prepared all the ammunition necessary for Easter Week and for the periods which followed but, because he had not what the Minister considers to be an absolute engagement, his claim for pension has been turned down, although I understand that men who prepared munitions in Dublin and elsewhere have been given pensions. I would ask the Minister to give special attention to the claims of those who fought for their country and who created the situation which enables us to be here to-day.  Everybody knows what the people in Enniscorthy did and a special inquiry should be made. If the evidence is not forthcoming through the orthodox channel, the Minister should endeavour to obtain <Col N="1534" /> it through some other channel.  Everybody knows that the people in Enniscorthy who have been turned down were people actively engaged in fighting to bring about the independence of the country.  I hope that the Minister will give special attention now to their claims.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. F. Lynch Mr. F. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I also would like to refer to the very unseemly delay that has occurred in dealing finally with these pensions under the 1934 Act.  That Act operates as from October, 1934, and it seems to me that, with nine years passed away, it would be time to have dealt with all the applications that have come before it.  A year or two ago, a Referee had been operating on this whole-time, and suddenly, for some reason or another, he ceased to carry on the work whole-time and resumed his Circuit work, only dealing with this matter of military service applications in his spare time.  That prolonged this question unnecessarily. If there had not been all that delay, there would not have been all these various applications to the High Court now, asking for reviews of one case or another.  There was a great lack of expedition in dealing with these applications under the 1934 Act.  I was glad to note that the Minister said recently that it was intended that the Referee should resume whole-time consideration of the remaining applications.  I hope that that is so and that, by doing so and if necessary re-engaging the assessors who were with him&mdash;the I.R.A. representatives who were members of the Advisory Committee&mdash;the tribunal will sit until they finish the job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the extraordinarily slow dealing with these applications, there is a huge number of persons who are dissatisfied with the result.  That is very natural.  We all know that, whether a person had a claim or not, he would feel that he was wronged.  Undoubtedly, there is a huge number of applications to the Minister to have their cases referred back.  These cases ought to be referred back quickly and the applicants informed of that, or else they ought to be told that since they have put forward no new evidence to <Col N="1535" /> show why they should be sent back, that they were not being sent back. The position is that they have been left in the air for a very long period.  The board also ought to sit and deal with those cases which are being referred back.  There are quite a number that ought legitimately be referred back because for some reason or another the board took a very narrow view in some cases.  I will mention one case without giving any names.  The attack on Rathmore police barracks in the County Kerry was deemed to be a major engagement.  During the attack there were some bombs thrown through the windows of the barrack.  The men who did that then fell back and fought, some of them with shot-guns and others with rifles.  There were two men engaged in throwing the bombs through the barrack windows.  One of them is a Chief Superintendent in the Gárda Síochána at the moment.  The other is an ordinary small farmer who does some work as a building contractor. This man, living there in Rathmore, has been refused a pension even though the Chief Superintendent, who was his companion in throwing the bombs, vouched for the fact that he accompanied him in doing so, and then subsequently fell back about 50 yards and fought with a shot-gun which was the only weapon he had. The Minister has been asked to refer back that case, but I do not know what has happened about it.  I met a good many of those fellows in the County Kerry and asked them to put the facts on affidavits, to send them to the Minister and ask him to have their cases referred back.  There is a huge number of such cases, especially in the Kerry No. 2 area.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that cases of the kind are to be found all over the country.  Neither have I any doubt that what some Deputy has said has happened in certain cases: that some of the local officers were so narrow, because of political differences 25 years afterwards, that they refused to vouch for the comrades who fought side by side with them in the campaign. That is hardly conceivable, but I believe it has been done.  At <Col N="1536" /> any rate, whether through malice or otherwise, there has been a great deal of laxity by some of these brigade councils that were to act as verifying officers.  They have fallen down, I think, very badly on their job in giving proper verification to the board. It is well to remember that the fault is not altogether that of the board. I am not really finding fault with the board because I think that things have been put badly before it.  Any Circuit Court judge will naturally have to weigh the evidence that is submitted to him, and if it is not put before him in a convincing way well, naturally, he will treat the case as if it were before him in court.  If he is not convinced he will turn down the case.  A great deal of the fault is due, as I have said, to the brigade committees in failing properly to verify the activities of their comrades.  I do not altogether hold with statements made to the effect that some of those lads, when they had looked after themselves and their pals, took very little care as regards the remainder of their comrades. I believe, however, there is some truth in that with regard to certain areas.</P>
    <P>I do not come from Wexford, but I would like to support what was said by Deputy Corish and his colleague, Deputy O'Leary, on behalf of the 1916 men from Enniscorthy.  My first meeting with the Wexford men who had been sentenced to penal servitude was in December, 1916, when they had been transferred to Lewes Prison, some from Portland and some from Dartmoor. There is no doubt whatever but that the men who went out in Enniscorthy and in Galway did, one might say, a bigger thing than those of us who went out in Dublin because they were a small bunch of men in the country, away from the stimulus that we had here at headquarters.  I should like to see the Minister give special consideration to their cases.  As I have said, I met most of those men who were out in Enniscorthy, in 1916, in Lewes Prison.  Among them was the present Irish Minister in Washington, Mr. Bob Brennan, the late Mr. Seán Etchingham and others.  Others of the Enniscorthy men were interned in Frongoch. They were actually out in company <Col N="1537" /> with the men who had been sentenced to penal servitude.  Their coming out ought to be regarded as Easter Week service for them.</P>
    <P>I was a member of the board which dealt with pensions under the 1924 Act.  That Act dealt only with persons who had pre-Truce service and service in the National Army.  Persons who had taken no part in the Civil War were not dealt with.  Their time did not come until later when I.R.A. applicants were being dealt with.  At that period, of course, no excuse was left for leaving out pre-Truce men who had remained neutral in the Civil War. But the men that we had to deal with under the 1924 Act were those who had pre-Truce service and service in the National Army during the Civil War.  We set a headline before us of not giving active service for Easter Week, 1916, except in three areas: active service in the City of Dublin, active service in Galway with the late Liam Mellowes, and active service in Enniscorthy.  Deputies may take it, therefore, that those of us who sat on the board under the 1924 Act accepted the fact that those men who turned out in Enniscorthy, in Easter Week, 1916, would be deemed to have had active service for that week.  I think, therefore, that some little tribute might be paid to the small number of those men who survive 28 years after Easter Week, 1916.  I think those men are entitled to have something done for them under the existing Act.  I think that in any of those cases, where a substantial case can be put up, the Minister ought to refer them back to the Referee for reconsideration.  I hope some steps will be taken to speed up the consideration of these applications and that the Circuit Court judge to whom is allotted the duty of acting as Referee will be taken from his circuit and told to sit down with Messrs.  Robinson and McCoy and the Finance people and finish the job once and for all.</P>
    <P>I am not going to say what I said here eight years ago with regard to that body.  Possibly it is perfectly irrelevant to say it now, but I think it was a mistake ever to have any board other than the type of board that we <Col N="1538" /> had under the 1924 Act; that is, a chairman from the Bench&mdash;we had a district justice&mdash;and two representatives of the pre-Truce I.R.A.  We had two 1916 men&mdash;the late Mr. Duggan and myself were the ordinary members of the board.  I suggested in 1936 to the then Minister, Deputy Aiken, that he should have the same type of board; that he should have two pre-Truce men, who had fought with him in the Civil War, taken his side in the Civil War, and I said that so far as we were concerned we would not oppose such an amendment if he brought it in to the Military Service Pensions Act.  I said then, and I hold still, that putting representatives of the Department of Defence, Finance Branch, on that board could have no meaning except to prevent people getting pensions.  That is their job.  The business of any representative of the Department of Finance who goes on a board of that kind is to oppose every pension; if he does not try to cut down every pension he is falling down on his job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>If he does not do that, he is falling down on his job.  I do not know who are on the board.  I know that one of the representatives of the Department of Defence, Finance Branch&mdash;the man who is now assistant secretary of the Department of Defence and who is a 1916 man&mdash;was excellent and probably a greater asset to the board and to the I.R.A. than their own representatives on the board.  I believe, however, that from the start it would have been better if we had the same type of board as under the 1924 Act, when there were two Old I.R.A. men to decide whether or not a man was entitled to a pension. In my time we were, as a matter of fact, always unanimous.  I do not recollect that there ever was a division of opinion between us in any case that came before us.  I think the present system of dealing with these cases is wrong, but perhaps it is too late to deal with that aspect now.  All that I ask is that the Minister will be fairly generous and take a broad view in referring cases back; not to be too <Col N="1539" /> much of a stickler so far as his demand for new evidence is concerned.  Let the board deal with that.  Send them back to the board and see whether, on reconsideration, and with an opportunity of putting their cases more lucidly, a different decision might not be reached.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasCarter1921" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with most of the observations of Deputy Corish and Deputy Lynch.  I have no kick coming so far as the board is concerned but, from meeting members of various brigades, I think there is something definitely wrong in other respects.  I know the members of one little company in which there were 63 men, and some of these men gave as good service to the country as anyone could expect, yet there are only two out of the 63 getting pensions.  That is why I say there must be something definitely wrong.  I am not charging the Minister in that connection, but I am going to make an appeal to him on behalf of these men.  Some of them are broken in health and it would only be fair to have their cases reopened. They may not all get a pension.  They were advised by many people to go to their brigades and have forms filled up.  I think the Minister on many occasions told them to do that, to reform their old brigades, to come together and to be as united as possible. That happened in some cases, but in other cases it did not happen, with the result that many men have gone down the hill, so to speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have known men to come to Dublin&mdash;they walked nearly all the way&mdash; to appear before the board and when they came in front of the board they did not know what to say.  They were excited and nervous.  I think Deputy Lynch has hit it well.  The members of the board included a representative of the Department of Finance and he was what might be termed a cross-examiner. That was bad for men who were getting old and who had young families and who were getting nervous from past trouble and the hard knocks that they received during the period of the Anglo-Irish War. These are the men who made this Parliament possible, who made this <Col N="1540" /> nation possible; these are the men we should lift our hats to every day we meet them, whether they have medals or whether they are getting pensions or not.</P>
    <P>I know a man who was wounded. Actually, there were three of them wounded in an ambush, but this man was badly wounded.  The doctor was not friendly, nor were a few other men, whom I will not mention&mdash;none of them was friendly.  This particular man was hidden in a clamp of turf in the bog and he remained there tied up and bleeding until his poor old mother came to him at night and brought him home.  Later he emigrated and he came back again to his home.  He cannot raise his arms properly and yet this man has been turned down for a disability pension simply because he had not a doctor to certify that he was wounded on that particular occasion.  I think that is going too far.  I ask the Minister in all fairness to give this case his sympathetic consideration and allow this man, and other men in a similar position, to come forward.  I know in some counties that has been already done.</P>
    <P>In my constituency certain men have approached me.  I suppose every Deputy has a similar experience. These men think that the T.D. can get a pension for them.  I am sure there is no Deputy who has not been asked by somebody to approach the Minister or some person connected with the Department.  I appeal to the Minister to give these men a chance&mdash;possibly it will be their last chance.  Their cases should be reconsidered, particularly cases such as the one I have mentioned of this wounded man who has no document, but who was badly wounded in this ambush, as everybody in the district knows.  He almost lost his life and at the present time he is almost a cripple.  There are plenty of neighbours who saw him bleeding.  I ask that that evidence should be accepted. There are plenty of doctors now who can verify the statement.  The doctor who was there at the time was not friendly; he would have had the man hanged if he could; he was an enemy, <Col N="1541" /> who is probably in a very safe position to-day.  I trust the Minister will give such cases as I have mentioned his very sympathetic consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardStapleton" hpid="Mr. Stapleton Mr. Stapleton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stapleton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Anthony's suggestion.  I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the case of a Clonmel soldier who was live and a half years in the National Army.  He contracted some form of disease, was discharged from the Army and sent to the hospital in Clonmel. From there he was transferred to a hospital in another part of the county.  To my knowledge, that young man was kept for months without receiving medical attention.  He is now receiving attention.  I waited on the Minister's Department some time early this year.  I wrote to his Department some time last year.  The Department could not see their way to grant him any consideration in the way of a bonus, pension or gratuity.  He has to wait until the emergency is over.  That man is the son of highly respectable people in the town of Clonmel who have a big family to support without trying to maintain a disabled soldier who contracted this disease in the National Army.  I would ask the Minister to see that his case is considered immediately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is some confusion of thought in regard to this matter.  We are mixing up two different things.  There is the case of the men who fought to sustain their principles and to bring into being this Government.  Theirs is a totally different case from the case of men who joined the Defence Forces of this country in the period after the Treaty. Men who join an organised army must, undoubtedly, do so under certain conditions and I think their case should be dealt with entirely through the Department.  The Minister and his advisers on the Army Council should know the regulations and should carry them out with all honesty and with a due sense of responsibility and this House has power to correct any abuse and I hope they will use that power if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to members of the I.R.A.  Incidentally, nobody <Col N="1542" /> ever speaks of the I.C.A.  I am afraid there would not have been any I.R.A. if the I.C.A. had not gone into action.  No reference is made to them and there is no suggestion that they were ever in existence.  I have some knowledge of them and I know of many very hard cases in connection with the treatment of members of the I.C.A., apart from the I.R.A.  The I.R.A. afterwards became the organisation that controlled all activities and the I.C.A. became submerged in the general mass.  I have a case in mind of a colleague of mine in the first days of the organisation of the I.C.A. in Dublin&mdash;incidentally, the I.C.A. was not organised in Dublin originally; it was organised in Cork&mdash; this man lay in a hospital in the City of Dublin&mdash;the South Dublin Union&mdash; for nine years and not a soul ever went near him to give him comfort. One day I was going through the wards and came across him.  I did not recognise him.  I asked somebody what was the trouble with him.  I was told that he had been lying there for years and that no relations or friends ever came near him.  When I was told his name I said, &ldquo;He is a member of the I.C.A.&rdquo; I asked if any records had been taken of his case and I was told that there was nobody interested in him.  I filled up a form of application for him and, after two years, he got 5/- pension, which he enjoyed for 15 weeks.  As soon as he got the pension he left the union and rented a room at 4/- a week.  He had 1/- to live upon.  He got a little food from his friends.  In 15 weeks he died and there was nobody to bury him.  I asked a man who had been very important in connection with the movement in the early days why he had been neglected.  &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;he was a Protestant.&rdquo;  That was the comment of a man who had fought alongside him.</P>
    <P>It has been admitted here, by a man who had authority to speak, that it is possible that political differences may be responsible for some of these men not getting recognition for their services.  If that is true, there is only one solution, that is, for this House to set up a committee, with the <Col N="1543" /> authority and approval of the Government, before which these cases can be verified, apart from any judicial proceedings or any Ministerial decisions. Any man who says that the men in Enniscorthy are not entitled to consideration does not know anything about what took place in 1914 and 1916.  I was not in this country at the time.  I was in another service, but I know of an application made under the 1924 Act.  This person's claim has never got the slightest consideration, and it has not yet been indicated whether his case was turned down or whether his application has yet to be considered.  In 1944 there are still men walking the streets who to my own knowledge were active units before I left this country and who were actively engaged afterwards, as I have been told by men who were on active service with them.  These men's claims have never been recognised.</P>
    <P>There was one man, who was one of the most active units, not only pre-Truce but until June, 1924, who died in Dublin from starvation.  The Minister knows that man personally and knows that what I am saying is true. He died from starvation, although his case had been put before the board at least half-a-dozen times by his family.  All his family were engaged with him and yet not one of them got any recognition.  The officers who knew him would not verify his claim.</P>
    <P>Why does not the Minister, who was an active unit himself, get some finality in regard to these cases?  Why do we not get some definite step towards settling these cases, for the honour of the country?  Some of the men received miserable pensions.  I know of one man who gave up a British Army pension.  He gave service before 1914 and was out until 1920 until the order to cease fire was given. He was Paddy Kavanagh, whose son was along with him and got wounded on more than one occasion.  He was awarded a pension of 5/- and he lost a 17/6 pension from the British Army. He died almost on the borders of destitution.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1544" /> Cases can be cited for a week and we have had them from men in different areas.  Incidentally, Deputy Lynch forgot to mention Meath. Surely, the men in Meath were as justified as the men in Enniscorthy, Galway and Dublin.  They were out just as quickly as the men in Dublin. If there is any man in the country who fought for the liberty of this country and the right for us to legislate, surely we should legislate for him first.  Every other consideration should be waived and these men should get justice.  They are not getting justice.  Some of them have deep-rooted grievances.  As far as records are concerned, we know how many men were on active service.  We know that many men are getting pensions although there is some doubt as to whether they qualified for them or not, but nobody is going to quarrel with that.  There are other men who have a legitimate claim who are living on home assistance or who, as has been pointed out here, are almost on the point of death from starvation. The picture has been painted so clearly that it must be true.  Deputy Carter has referred to a man who was left in a bog having been injured in an engagement.  The doctor in the immediate area was an enemy and refused to treat him or give any record on his behalf.  Surely that is a case that only needs stating to be admitted and proved.  I saw men in the United States when they landed.  They arrived there injured, practically penniless, with no one to care for them.  If such men came before any legitimate committee set up by this House they would get justice.  I have not the slightest hesitation in saying so.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that this problem be divided into two classes.  Deal with the question of the men who never got a real measure of justice or recognition and then with the question of whether a man who gives service to the country in time of crisis and who develops any form of organic disease has a legitimate claim.  We have undoubted cases of young men who passed a very rigid medical examination and who developed tubercular trouble, which could only have <Col N="1545" /> developed in the Army while they were under Army orders.  If these men in the course of their duties develop this particular disease, through exposure and so on, surely nobody will deny that this Government has a responsibility towards them, not only to see that they get all the medical attention that can be given, but to see that they are not thrown back on their families to be maintained as men who are not able to maintain themselves.</P>
    <P>The present position is disgraceful. In our boyhood days, we sang the old songs about the way the British Government treated Irish soldiers, but we are treating our men far worse now than ever the British Government did. I feel that the House would not hesitate for a moment to say that if a boy or a man offers his services to the country in time of crisis, in 1939, for instance, is in the service of his country for three or four years and develops any form of organic disease, he is our responsibility, that we ought to care for him and give him the best treatment and see that he is kept in comfort and not allowed to become a burden on his parents.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister should take the matter up in that way, dealing with the men who gave service in the revolution and with the men who have given active service in a duly constituted Army under this State.  In my opinion, the only way to do it is through an army council, exercising its functions through the Minister and subject to correction by the House, so far as the first category is concerned, and in the case of the other men, through a committee of the House, of three or four men who know the history of the time we passed through, the years before 1914 and the years afterwards, when we were carrying on internecine warfare against each other up to, say, 1924.  Men who were actively engaged on both sides should sit down together and deal with these cases as they ought to be dealt with, on a humanitarian basis.</P>

      <P>On 15th December last, I had a question on the Order Paper asking for certain information <Col N="1546" /> in connection with military service pensions payable in my constituency. From the information which the Minister has forwarded to me, I find that, in the County of Leix, 753 men applied for pensions, out of whom only 29 secured awards, there being no claim that is receiving attention at the moment.  Does the Minister or any member of the House believe that, during the troubled times in County Leix, there were only 29 men to come forward to fight for the freedom and independence of this country?  I hold that there were far more and I cannot understand how only 29 out of 753 were picked out.  Take the County of Offaly which I also represent.  In that county, 1,384 men applied for pensions and I hold that each of these men was on active service, because if a man in those days were detailed for an ambush and the ambush did not take place, it was not his fault that his life was safe.  Every man who held himself in readiness and was prepared to sacrifice his life at a moment's notice against the enemy was, I hold, on active service and I cannot understand how out of 1,384 applicants in the county, only 193 have been successful. There is only one case under consideration in that county at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the case which I brought to the Minister's notice some time ago in which, according to evidence submitted to me and to others who have more knowledge and are more familiar with the procedure than I, the applicant was definitely entitled to a pension.  It was proven beyond yea or nay that he was on active service, but a certain individual refused to vouch for him.  Deputy Fionan Lynch hit the nail on the head when he said that certain applicants were victimised on account of political differences. I can bring the applicant in this case, together with his record, before the Minister and prove that that individual in my county has definitely been victimised for political reasons.  There is also the case of the mother of one of the greatest of Irishmen this country ever produced, who was executed some years ago. His name will go down in the history of this country, but the mother of that <Col N="1547" /> man is in receipt of nothing more than 5/- per week on which to live to-day. That woman is facing the prospect of the South Dublin Union, but for assistance which she receives from friends.  That is a very unfair way in which to treat the mother of any gallant soldier who came out in the dark days and gave his heart's blood for the freedom which we in Southern Ireland enjoy to-day.</P>
    <P>In a question which I had on the Order Paper today, I asked the Minister if he would refund the expenses incurred in travelling to the city for interviews by the Pensions Board to all Old I.R.A. men who applied for pensions under the Military Service Pensions Act, 1924, and who were not successful.  Deputy Carter a few moments ago told us that several applicants from his own battalion in his constituency walked to the city for their interviews.  The majority of these people who applied for pensions were hard-working, honest labouring men and many of them were small farmers.  We had not got the rancher, the capitalist, the financier or the Jew in the Old I.R.A.  We had the plain, poor, honest people.</P>

      <P>The point I am putting to the Minister now is that these people who apply for pensions and have to travel long distances&mdash; some from as far away as Cork and Kerry, the Midlands, Donegal and other counties far from the city&mdash; should get the travelling expenses which they incur, if the Pensions Board is not satisfied that they are <Col N="1548" /> entitled to pensions.  It is not very much to ask and I should be very glad if the Minister would say that he is prepared to go into the matter and give it consideration.</P>
      <P>I think the only Deputy who spoke on how we should arrive at some satisfactory conclusion to this question was my friend, Deputy Larkin, who suggested that a committee of three or four members of the House should be set up for the purpose of investigating these claims.  I strongly support that suggestion and recommend that a select committee of the House be appointed to investigate these claims and to make recommendations to the proper authorities.  I would strongly appeal to the Minister and to those in authority to reopen the cases of the men in the Midlands.  I represent a constituency similar to that which Deputy Carter of the Government Party represents&mdash;the constituency of Laoighis-Offaly.  I have quoted figures for my own County of Laoighis where only 29 men got any recognition from this State out of 753 applicants.  I have seen evidence and I have received communications about 36 applicants from the village of Clogher and, in my opinion, these men were definitely engaged in active service during those days.  Quite a number of applications from that part of the county have been turned down.  I would be glad if the Minister could see his way to have these cases reopened in justice to these people who were prepared, if necessary, to sacrifice their lives when the call came.</P>

      <P>May I add my voice to what has been said by two Wexford Deputies with regard to the cases of the Enniscorthy men?  The Minister must be aware, having regard to the persistency with which their claim has been put forward on numerous occasions, that there is something in it.  The question has been raised on the adjournment on one occasion by Deputy Corish and it has been raised from time to time also by other representatives.  A number of these men have approached me individually and I have been also approached officially by an <Col N="1549" /> organisation in which they have banded themselves together for the purpose of enforcing their claim.  I have had many of their statements before me and, if I might venture to give my opinion for what it is worth, I think, if their statements are borne out, they would bring them within the terms of the Act.  It is not a question of verification, because what they did and how they conformed to the terms of the Act are well known in Enniscorthy and in County Wexford. I cannot understand under what circumstances they were turned down. The Minister must realise that there is some genuine grievance there, otherwise he would not be so persistently urged as he has been to reconsider their cases.  I ask him to take special note of these cases and have them thoroughly investigated and all possible relief granted.  I think that should be done in all justice and equity.  From what I can see from the statements before me, if they can be borne out, these men have a just claim.  In some cases I think it would only have to be stated, so clear does their claim seem to be.  I am sure the Minister will realise, the demand is so general and so persistent, that this group of cases requires separate and special investigation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMorrissey" hpid="Mr. M. Morrissey Mr. M. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the opportunity of calling attention to what I believe to be a great injustice that is being done to a number of our Old I.R.A. men under the Military Service Pensions Act.  On a few occasions I have raised this matter on the Minister's Estimate.  I do not wish to make a case for Old I.R.A. men who have not a case to make for themselves.  I am speaking from my own personal experience in Waterford and I am sure <Col N="1550" /> other Deputies have spoken from their experience in other constituencies. Knowing the service of practically all the men in the Waterford Brigade area I am satisfied that an injustice is being done by the present administration of the Military Service Pensions Act.  I was sorry that some provision was not made in the amending Bill to deal with such cases.  I am referring to the cases of men who had genuine active service. I could give a number of instances, but I know one man in particular in the Waterford Brigade area who took part in gun running and who was responsible for having cargoes of arms imported into this country and who spent weeks at sea in connection with that work.  It is appalling that men such as he, who were engaged in other activities as well, do not come under the present Military Service Pensions Act.  As well as that, men have been refused pensions who had the same service and even, in some instances, better service than men who have been granted pensions.  These men took part in the same activities and also took part in other activities which the men who got pensions did not take part in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have nothing to say to the men who got pensions, but I certainly hold that an injustice is being done to a small percentage of the Old I.R.A. men.  A large number of them, I am certain, are aware that they will not qualify, but there are men who genuinely believe that an injustice has been done to them.  Their officers are aware that an injustice has been done to them and the people in the brigade area are also aware of it.  I do not think it is necessary to amend the 1934 Act.  I was hoping that the Minister would instruct the board to give a broader definition to active service so as to include the genuine cases which have been turned down.  I think the board and the Minister have taken advice from the brigade advisory committee and the verifying officers.  I am sure these committees set up to deal with the cases and to verify them before they were sent before the board are composed of men who knew the service of the individual applicants and I am certain that they are not likely to trump up a case for <Col N="1551" /> any man who had not a genuine case. I suggest to the Minister that these committees throughout the country should be asked to compile a list of cases in which, in their opinion, an injustice has been done.  If that were done and a small number of outstanding cases discussed with the board and the verifying officers or a committee, I think that these men would get the justice which they deserve.  I am not making a case for men who have not the necessary service, but for men who had the necessary service.  I appeal to the Minister to give further consideration to this matter and, if necessary, to have amending legislation brought in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to correct some information I gave to Deputy Roddy at the beginning of the debate.  I think I mentioned a full year's salary: it should have been only a half-year's salary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the cases mentioned by Deputies Cosgrave and Hogan, I must admit that there was a certain amount of unnecessary delay and I have taken that matter up.  I should say, however, that much of the delay which is occasioned by reason of the methods by which they have to examine the cases of soldiers discharged from service is due, to a very large extent, to a fear the officials have of something to which Deputy Larkin referred when he said that this House is here to correct not only the Minister but his advisers.  Men who have to deal with cases of this kind will, no matter what I or Deputies may say, set out to see that the cases are dealt with only within the boundary of the regulations which prescribe their actions.  It may be termed &ldquo;red tape&rdquo; or anything else Deputies might like to call it, but the fact remains that that is one of the causes of a lot of the undue delay. There is a Public Accounts Committee, before which the Accounting Officer of each Department has to appear, and the officers responsible to that Accounting Officer must necessarily make certain that, as far as they are concerned, everything is water-tight and fool-proof and that they cannot be <Col N="1552" /> brought to book for anything they may have done.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde mentioned the case of a soldier falling over an embankment and also the cases of soldiers falling out of lorries.  In both of these cases, the soldier will be covered, if on duty.  He would not be covered if, for instance, he were out on his own, rambling along and, coming to a railway, decided to try a tight-rope walking feat across the parapet of a bridge and, in doing so, fell off, or if he were in a lorry without being on service&mdash;in other words, if he were taking a ride in a lorry surreptitiously or in any other way he might decide when off duty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is covered in common law, then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not be covered, anyhow, within the meaning of the Act.  Many Deputies have spoken here in regard to the 1916 men in Enniscorthy. I have had the Enniscorthy case dealt with on at least two occasions.  Deputy Corish has made representations from time to time in respect of those men and has raised it here on the Adjournment, so that I can only say that that particular case has been fully and completely examined.  The original number, if I am not making a mistake, given by verifying officers responsible for the actions in respect to the Enniscorthy 1916 men, was something like 60. Again, if I am not making a mistake or exaggerating, that has been increased by almost 100 per cent. Everything it was possible to do was done.  It is quite possible, of course, that there were numbers of people who were deeply sympathetic with the aspirations of the Volunteers in Enniscorthy and that they may have gone out and given valuable help in different ways; but unless they were members of the forces and can prove that, and unless they can prove that they were giving active service, it is quite impossible to bring them within the meaning of the Act, and there is nothing I can do to bring them within the Act.  I want to be frank and candid about that.  Neither can I bring in any other man who makes <Col N="1553" /> an application for a pension and fails to prove before the board that he is a person to whom the Act applies.</P>
      <P>I disagree with Deputy Fionán Lynch in respect to the type of board that is sitting.  We have sitting at the present moment, and we have always had sitting, at the head of that board a judge who, beyond the work which he was carrying out, had no interest, good, bad or indifferent, in any applicant.  He was sitting there in his capacity of judge, dealing only with the evidence placed before him and with the case made.  He had assisting him two representatives of the Old I.R.A., both of high standing as far as rank was concerned, and there was a representative of the Department of Finance and a representative of the Department of Defence, both civil servants looking after the interests of their particular Departments.  The secretary to the board is an Old I.R.A. man, a civil servant.  I deliberately selected that man to fill that particular post by reason of the fact that there was no man who had greater knowledge of the conditions which existed in respect to I.R.A. service than this particular individual.  And, indeed, I thought that, at some time or other, some Deputy would draw the attention of the House to that fact.  I made that appointment deliberately, with the intention of securing, as far as I could, a thorough and sympathetic examination of every individual claim which came before that board.  In the last couple of years, I changed the representative of the Department of Defence and I placed on the board as my representative a man with a good national record, associated with the movement down through the years.  I must admit that I thought I was loading the board in favour completely of the applicants and, in fact, against the Minister for Finance; but I did it because of continuous complaints, such as those I have been listening to here to-day.  I did it so that I could rest assured that the best possible type of mind, from the applicants' point of view, would be working on such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned a moment ago that I am not responsible for decisions&mdash;and I thank God that I am not&mdash;but I <Col N="1554" /> have done everything that is possible to see that the applicants would be dealt with fairly.  If the applicant, then, cannot prove his case when he goes before the board, what does the House want me to do?  I do not believe the House wants me to compel the board to give pensions.  Even if that were so, I could not give pensions where evidence of the type of service required is not produced.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Byrne who raised the question of a 1916 man who has decorations but has not got a pension. He wanted an explanation of that.  The only thing I can say in regard to that is that any man who claims he has 1916 service can apply for a medal without applying for a pension.  In other words, if he satisfies the Referee, on the evidence which he is able to produce, that he is entitled to a medal, then the Referee will give it to him.  I understand that a number of those people who have these decorations have not got a pension. They could at any time, I understand, apply for a pension.  I feel that the people to whom Deputy Byrne has referred are not these particular people.  The decoration which they may be wearing may not be an official one.  It was issued, perhaps, by a board of old officers in the Dublin area as a commemoration of the 25th anniversary of Easter Week.  It does not carry any official recognition beyond that of their colleagues.  I want to tell Deputy Hilliard, in reply to his question, that illegitimacy is not recognised in the Act.  In answer to Deputy Corish's question, as far as I am aware soldiers are not asked to sign a form such as he mentioned.</P>

We found that the numbers that were likely to be treated were so small that it would be uneconomic to do it.  I forget what the estimated cost was, but it would be a colossal sum in relation to the number of patients to be treated.  It was considered that it would be much better for the State to pay for their treatment in sanatoria outside.</P>

      <P>The position is that the medical examination cannot, in fact, be described as a rigid one.  The X-ray examination that we would like to have carried out in all cases is carried out only in the case of commissioned officers because their numbers are small.  It would not be possible at the present time to carry out an X-ray examination in the case of every man joining the Army although it would be highly desirable if we could do it.  I hope that, at some time, we will be able to do it because then any disease that may be latent in an individual which is likely to be aggravated by the hard exercise which the men have to undergo in the course of their training, will be revealed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  What I want to make clear is that medically unfit does <Col N="1558" /> not mean in every case T.B.  A man will be medically unfit if he has so many corns on his toes or so many welts on his feet that he cannot march.  That man will be discharged because we can do nothing for him; we cannot make him march any better than he has been able to march. However, I think we could leave that particular phase of the subject for the moment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Linehan raised a question as to allowances for travelling to and from the board.  Expenses are paid to applicants under the Army Pensions Act, but expenses are paid to witnesses only under the Military Service Pensions Act.</P>
      <P>I think I have covered most of the points raised by Deputies in this debate.  The only thing that I regret is that the word &ldquo;injustice&rdquo; has been bandied about to such a very large extent that, to my mind anyhow, it reflects on a body of men who, in my opinion, have been doing their duty honestly and fearlessly and as well as it could be done in the circumstances.</P>
      <P>Before I close I want to refer to a statement made by Deputy Larkin.  I think the Deputy was badly informed in regard to the particular man he mentioned.  That individual, for reasons known only to himself&mdash;the Deputy probably knew the man and his temperament; if that is so, he will understand what I am going to say refused absolutely to apply for a pension. I do not know what his reasons were; he knew those best himself.  But when he did apply, he was, I understand, in very low health and very bad circumstances.  He was induced by some of his old colleagues to make the application. He did so, and in less than five weeks a pension was granted to that individual; in less than five weeks everything we could do and that the Pensions Board could do was done in order to expedite the payment of the pension to that individual.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy had no better information with regard to the man he referred to than he had in the case first mentioned, then I will say, whoever has advised him has given him information that is not correct. The Deputy will find on examination that the application of the man he referred to was dealt with as fairly and as expeditiously as could possibly have been done the moment it was brought to the attention of the authorities.  But you must remember that the individual refused, for reasons unknown to most of us, to apply for his pension until in the last months of his life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not a single case of an applicant for a pension that has not been dealt with.  Every claim was disposed of.  The delay at present is in dealing with appeals.  I will say in respect of Deputy Lynch's queries that the Referee retired from the work he was doing, permanently, so to speak, when all these claims had been dealt with and the only cases left were really appeals.  Unfortunately, the appeals are growing in number. Deputies must remember that there were 62,000 applications and of these applications 12,000 have been successful. If the remaining 50,000 applicants are going to apply again we can easily visualise this board going on for ever&mdash;that is what it would look like.  I am not suggesting that the whole 50,000 applicants are going to apply, but the fact remains that there will be a very large number applying. In facilitating these appeals, I am doing what Deputies are asking me to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board can see very little light while I am referring these cases back for review.  Unless the evidence to be produced is evidence that was not available at a former hearing, unless it is new evidence, we shall have to <Col N="1560" /> put a clamp down and tell the applicants that their cases have ended. The reason why this thing is dragging along is not because there are any claims outstanding, but because appeals are coming in and it is the appeals that are outstanding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I want to correct that impression.  In the course of the debate here the word &ldquo;injustice&rdquo; was used very largely and the term &ldquo;genuine case&rdquo; was also used.  I do not know how any member of the House can talk about a &ldquo;genuine case&rdquo;.  I do not know what is meant by a &ldquo;genuine case&rdquo;.  Only the board can decide what is a genuine case. When you use the words &ldquo;injustice&rdquo; and &ldquo;genuine case&rdquo; you can imply only one thing and that is that the board is not doing justice to the applicant and that a case, while it may be a genuine case, is not being dealt with fairly.  I do not know whether Deputy Lynch used those words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I used either one or the other, but from what the Minister said it appeared that he thought I said something which cast a reflection on the judge acting as Referee.  I was very far from meaning to do so, and if I said anything that had that meaning I would withdraw it most emphatically because there would be no foundation for it.  I do not believe I made any such suggestion.</P>

      <P>Nor did I suggest that the civil servants on the board did anything but carry out their duties.  I did say that the representative of the <Col N="1561" /> Department of Finance is there to watch Finance interests, and that is correct.  I did not refer to officials of the board at all.  The Minister did refer to the secretary of the board, and I take this opportunity of joining with the Minister in paying a very high tribute to Mr. Cremin.  I join with the Minister in paying the highest tribute to the secretary, who was anything but a political associate of mine in over 20 years; but, whether you were politically associated with him or not, it must be said that no one got anything but the greatest courtesy and help from him.  He was certainly most helpful in advising Deputies or anyone else who sought his assistance; he helped them and showed them how to present a case.  I am glad to have this opportunity of paying that tribute to Mr. Cremin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one question I should like to put to the Minister and he can give a categorical &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  He will agree that all the difficulties centre around the definition of &ldquo;active service&rdquo;.  Military service is defined in the Act as active service of a particular kind, but active service is not defined and the Minister finds himself in a great deal of difficulty when he finds phrases such as &ldquo;injustice&rdquo;, &ldquo;genuine cases&rdquo; and all that sort of thing being bandied about the Dáil.  Is he prepared to bring in an amending Bill to the Military Service Pensions Act, 1934, defining active service?  After such a Bill was passed through the Dáil, nobody here could find fault with the definition of active service because it would have received the imprimatur of the Dáil and Seanad.  The whole trouble in the country is that one man who says he had active service will get a pension, and another man who says he had active service will not get a pension. The whole difficulty revolves around the definition of active service, and if the Minister removed that difficulty he would remove all the difficulties experienced by himself, the board and the Referee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with Deputy Hogan.  Deputy Lynch made a statement that a superintendent <Col N="1562" /> of the Gárdaí and another man, a common worker, were on the same job.  According to his statement, the superintendent of the Gárdaí got a pension and, at the time, he was connected with the awarding of the pensions. How does Deputy Lynch suggest that the man who did not get a pension is not being treated unjustly? Let us use terms as they ought to be used.  Either none or both of these men are entitled to a pension.  If one got it and the other did not there is injustice and that is the term that ought to be applied to it.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is reading into my remarks something that is not in them.  In the first place, I do not know whether the chief superintendent concerned applied for a pension at all or not.  I assume he did and it was granted.  I did not use the word &ldquo;injustice&rdquo; as far as the board is concerned because I am satisfied&mdash;and I mentioned it when I was speaking&mdash; that a great deal of the fault was because the local brigade officers who were supposed to vouch for that man did not do their job.  That is not the fault of the board.</P>

The term &ldquo;active service&rdquo; was deliberately left in that negative state in order that the Referee and the board could give as wide an interpretation to it as possible.

One would expect that there would be a <i>pro rata</i> increase in production from the garden and farm.  Instead of that, there is an anticipated deficiency of £115.  Surely that is not very creditable, if the garden and farm are being run efficiently, which I take it, as a Government institution, they ought to be.  The agricultural community are expected to do their job efficiently during the emergency.  The Parliamentary Secretary might explain to the House why this deficiency is anticipated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">

    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £23,450 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in <Col N="1567" /> course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1944, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with the Administration of the National Health Insurance Acts, ]911 to 1942, and the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts, 1935 to 1940; for services in connection with Food Allowances and with Supplementary Allowances to certain Beneficiaries under the latter Acts (Emergency Powers Act, 1939) and for sundry Contributions and Grants, including certain Grants-in-Aid in respect of the cost of Benefits and Expenses of Administration under the National Health Insurance Acts.</P>

      <P>The additional sum of £23,450 is required to meet expenditure out of the Vote for the current financial year.  The principal item in the Estimate is the sum of £22,000 in respect of State grants on expenditure on benefits and their administration. Two-ninths of all expenditure on benefits and their administration is recouped to the National Health Insurance Fund by the Exchequer. The expenditure in the current year on the ordinary benefits&mdash;sickness, disablement, maternity and married benefits&mdash;and on the administration of benefits has been slightly less than that provided for in the original Estimate. The additional sum required under this sub-head, therefore, is entirely accounted for by the expenditure on the additional benefits, dental, hospital, optical, etc., provided under the 1942 Act.</P>

      <P>I should like to know how far the additional dental benefits are intended to apply to all the people applying for them.  Does it mean that dental benefits are now available, because for some years it has been a very sore point in this House that when the old insurance societies were done away with, some of them were providing dental benefits and others were not?  Does this mean that we are now on all fours and that full dental benefits are provided for everybody?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know whether the Parliamentary Secretary's <Col N="1568" /> Department has given any consideration to the question of providing extended benefits to persons suffering from tuberculosis.  I think there is a growing recognition throughout the country of the necessity for dealing sympathetically and understandingly with persons suffering from tuberculosis, if we are to make any effective headway in combating and ultimately eradicating that disease. Many of these unfortunate people who are compelled to enter sanatoria for treatment find themselves faced with the prospect of a long period of enforced absence from work.  They get the normal national health insurance benefit if they have sufficient stamps to their credit for a period of six months, and, at the end of that period, they get disablement benefit amounting to 7/6 per week.  It is on that trifling sum that they are compelled to provide for a wife and three, four or five children. The sum is, of course, grossly insufficient for that purpose, with the result that the wife has to go to the home assistance authority and try to get some assistance to supplement the slender income from national health insurance sources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is generally recognised, and the Parliamentary Secretary is probably more aware of it than anybody else in the House, that the mental condition of a patient suffering from tuberculosis is an important factor in aiding the recovery of the patient.  If we can do something to bring about a state of easement of mind, so far as the patient is concerned, that type of treatment is probably as efficient as any other type which the patient can receive while undergoing sanatorium treatment.  There is on all sides a recognition of the necessity for dealing sympathetically with sanatorium patients, and possibly one of the ways in which additional and extended benefit can be provided is through the medium of the National Health Insurance Acts.  I know it is a big problem to contemplate the payment of full wages to persons during enforced absence from work due to tuberculosis, but it is a problem which must be tackled.  The cost, no matter how great from the sterling point of view, <Col N="1569" /> is really very small when we consider the vast number of human lives on the other side of the scale.</P>
    <P>I should like to be assured that this matter is engaging the attention of the Department of Local Government and that the Department's mind is running on the same sympathetic lines as I think the minds of the rest of the community are running.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us if his Department has any plans in mind, either by the introduction of special legislation to provide such compensation for loss of wages for those undergoing treatment for tuberculosis, or by an extension of the National Health Insurance scheme such as would provide persons suffering from tuberculosis with a reasonable subsistence allowance, as nearly as possible equivalent to their weekly wages, so as to enable them to remain in sanatoria, where they can be cured of this disease and not be compelled to go back uncured amongst the rest of the community to spread the disease which everybody realises must be grappled with effectively, if we are to preserve the life of the nation, and indeed if we are to preserve the race at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Dockrell's question, dental benefits are available to all members of the society who have the necessary contributions to their credit.  It does not follow that all members of the society who require dental treatment will, in fact, be able to secure it, but, in the current year particularly, a generous allocation for dental benefit has been possible by reason of the fact that other special benefits were not operating. The hospital benefit scheme was not operating, and there has been a transfer of a substantial sum of money, £41,000 in 1942-43, from the other special benefits to the Dental Benefit Fund.  In the current year the sum available for dental benefits will amount to approximately £210,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question raised by Deputy Norton as to special provision for insured persons suffering from tuberculosis under the National Health Insurance Scheme, no such special provision has been made so far, nor <Col N="1570" /> have I had any representations from the society to the effect that they propose to make any special provision for the treatment of tubercular patients. Insured persons do get preference in sanatoria under the control of local authorities and of voluntary agencies. But, if additional provision is to be made for the proper care and treatment of tubercular patients and of their dependents during the time of illness, it certainly will involve very heavy financial commitments.  I do not think it would be appropriate on the Vote before the House to go into that, inasmuch as the scope of this Vote is very limited.</P>
    <P>On the general question of making provision for insured persons under the National Health Insurance Act, such special provision can only be made by the sacrifice of some of the benefits already available to insured persons, unless the finances of the scheme are altered.  When we come to consider how the finances of the scheme might be altered in order that more money might be available within the financial structure for special benefits for a particular purpose, namely, the treatment of all tubercular patients, we have to turn our minds to the possible sources where the additional contributions would be found.  It seems to me there are only three sources within the scheme: the insured person, the employer, and the State.  It has not been brought to my notice, so far at any rate, that either the insured persons or the employers are prepared to give special contributions for the purpose of financing special benefit schemes such as a particular benefit for tubercular patients.  I do not know what the reaction of the general insured population would be to such a proposal, inasmuch as the levy would have to be general on the whole insured population for the benefit of a comparatively small section of it. There is, of course, left to them the third alternative&mdash;the shoulders of the State.  I can say, so far as the State is concerned, that the burden of taxation is mounting fairly rapidly.  On occasion there is a good deal of criticism of that.  I do not accuse Deputy Norton of criticising expenditure for public health purposes, but it <Col N="1571" /> seems to me there is a limit to the social services that can be financed, a limit, at any rate, to the money that the State can place at the disposal of the community for these various social services.</P>
    <P>If the society, in their wisdom, put up a scheme to us embodying special benefits for members of the society suffering from tuberculosis, it will certainly be examined with the greatest possible sympathy.  But it is open to doubt whether, if we have to transfer moneys from, say, dental or hospital benefits in order to provide special benefits for a very limited section, that is a sound public health proposition.  As I have said, the whole problem of tuberculosis is one of the greatest problems we have to face in the future.  Whatever our solution for that problem may be, it will apply equally to insured and to other sections of the community.  But, if we are to tackle it in the manner in which it might be necessary to tackle it, and if a satisfactory solution is to be found, we will have to be able to lay our hands on enormous sums of money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary is sympathetically disposed towards reformation of our existing methods of dealing with tubercular persons.  I do not think the cost involved need deter us from applying an early and efficient remedy in the matter.  After all, we raised £9,000,000 every year for the last few years to defend the country against possible invasion. If that means anything at all, it means defending the people against the possibility of annihilation at the hands of an external foe.  Here we have a situation where possibly an internal foe is making a more deadly and devastating attack on our people than any foe we know of.  If we can raise money for the purpose of resisting invasion, surely we ought to be able to raise money to save human lives. Assuredly, if we go on as we are going, we will simply have mass burials each year of people who have died from preventible tuberculosis.  If we want that situation to continue, let us drift on <Col N="1572" /> as we are doing.  If we want to deal with that situation, we can only do it by facing up to the responsibility involved in spending the money.</P>

      <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1944, for Transport and Meteorological Services, including a Grant-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dáil will have noticed that the <Col N="1573" /> Supplementary Estimate is required in consequence of increased expenditure under four sub-heads.  The increased expenditure under two of these sub-heads is due solely to the payment of additional bonus to members of the staff.  An amount of £5,130 is required for the payment of compensation for lands and property acquired in connection with the Shannon Airport. Certain property at Foynes had to be acquired for circumstances associated mainly with the expansion of activities at the airport.  Included in the sum is an item of £630, which represents compensation payable for a holding of land, which was acquired some years ago in connection with the construction of the airport at Rineanna, but which could not be paid because of difficulty in determining title.  That difficulty has been resolved and the compensation is now due for payment.</P>
    <P>There is also a new sub-head, B. 8, for a Grant-in-Aid in connection with the establishment of a clubhouse at Foynes.  With the growth of flying operations there, a considerable increase in the number of State staff and operating company personnel has taken place and the absence of a social and recreational centre for these staffs has been felt.  Discussions took place between the three operating companies and the airport authority, which led to arrangements whereby each of the parties will contribute a sum of money to the provision of a suitable building for a staff club.  The club will be run by a committee, of which the airport manager has been elected chairman and, as well as having a value as a focal point for social activities, it will, it is hoped, afford an opportunity of promoting good feeling and mutual understanding between all the members of the various staffs and thereby promote the harmonious working of the airport.</P>
    <P>Savings under sub-heads of the Vote more than equal the additional expense on these sub-heads and only a token amount is, therefore, being asked for. It is necessary to have a Supplementary Estimate, because the two matters to which I have referred were not covered in the original Estimate.</P>

I take it that this will become more and more important as time goes on, particularly in reference to air traffic.

    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am pointing out.  For instance, the observatory at Armagh is purely utilitarian, in so far as it aids the Air Force and other traffic.  Where I thought the Minister for Industry and Commerce came in here was that it would be essential for the future development of air traffic to take steps to provide <Col N="1575" /> meteorological services here in the South, and I think that in the future he will be very handicapped by the fact that we have no observatory here. As I understand things, the observatories have been closed down, and the only observatory in this country is in Armagh.  I am asking the Minister whether, in view of the growing importance of the air service in the future, he would not reconsider this question of opening up an observatory in the South, with particular reference to the utility of the meteorological service which is attached thereto.</P>

Could they not be available for the benefit of the farming community? There may be certain difficulties at present&mdash;I can appreciate that&mdash;as weather reports are discontinued elsewhere. It is a point which might be kept in view and which could be considered possibly in relation to the activities of the Agricultural Advisory Council.</P>
      <P>In connection with sub-head B (8), the Minister has indicated that the growth of traffic at Foynes has occasioned necessity for facilities for the staff.  Could he indicate the number of services utilising the airport at present?  Finally, regarding sub-head B (1) &mdash;Salaries and Wages&mdash;there is another airport which is not completely under the control of the Department but in that case, while the subsidy is the main basis of the payment of wages and salaries, the standard that has been set is not a very good one.  In so far as the Department has direct responsibility, it should set a better headline than the other civil airport, where considerable difficulty has arisen, owing to the low wages in force and to the fact that, when the standstill Order came along, it was not possible to improve the conditions, except by a very limited bonus.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point which has been raised, wherever there is a law case or a dispute which has something to do with the weather or the meteorological conditions, the farmers here have to apply to Armagh observatory for such data in regard to the state of the weather on the particular day in regard to which the dispute has arisen.  Therefore, it would be of use in that way to establish observatories in the South.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of persons employed by the State in the administration of the airport is approximately 100.  In addition, there would be about 250 people employed by the operating companies, so that the total staff for which the club-house is intended to cater would be about 350.  The property acquired for which the money is needed was not land: the greater part of the sum is needed for the purchase of a building on the pier at Foynes. This building had been purchased originally from the harbour trustees by the British Overseas Airways Corporation. At that time, the British Overseas Airways Corporation was the only company using the airport, but when other companies began to use the airport it was considered more appropriate that the building on the pier should be the property of the airport authority and not of an operating company.  The building was then purchased, by agreement, from the British Overseas Airways Corporation.  The Monteagle Arms Hotel at Foynes was taken over for staff accommodation, but the bar portion of the hotel was not acquired at that time.  Subsequently, with an extension of the staff to be accommodated and the need for providing better facilities for the provision of meals and the refreshment of people using the airport, the bar premises of the hotel were also acquired.  They were acquired compulsorily, and provision is now being made for the compensation that will <Col N="1577" /> be payable to the owner.  In addition, there was a gravel pit acquired to facilitate constructional work which is proceeding there at the moment.</P>
      <P>I think Deputy Connolly misunderstands the position concerning our meteorological services.  His references to Dunsink misled me.  There is, I think, some idea of reopening Dunsink, or of having some similar establishment for educational purposes, to enable students to acquire training in this science.  We have established here a very elaborate and highly organised and, I may say, very efficient meteorological service.  I think the scope of that service will be indicated by the fact that the salaries of the staff employed in connection with it amount to £40,000 a year.  That service was established by us some years ago.  Subsequent to the Treaty of 1922, the meteorological service continued to be operated by the British Meteorological Department.  Some years ago we took over the meteorological services and extended them very considerably.  It is true that since the beginning of the war the publication of daily meteorological information has been suspended, but there is a full information service in existence which can be availed of when necessary and which will permit of the publication of regular information when normal conditions are restored.  Not merely is it not correct to say that there is no observatory here but we have, in fact, a number of observatories.  A number of new observing stations are being opened in different parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our meteorological service at the present time is mainly employed in connection with civil aviation services.  I think it is true to say that it has been very efficiently run, so efficiently that it has established an international recognition for competency.  I have received from other Governments that have had contact with our service very substantial praise of its efficiency.  We are, of course, in a key position so far as the meteorological services in Europe are concerned.  All weather comes from the west, and the efficiency of the meteorological services in all European countries depends very <Col N="1578" /> largely on the efficiency of the service in this country.  Consequently, it helps to enhance our prestige internationally when our meteorological service is fully developed and efficiently run.  I think it is, but the use that can be made of it is, of course, limited in present circumstances.  There are three companies using the airport at the moment&mdash;the British Overseas Airways Corporation, the Pan-American Airways, and the American Export Airlines. The number of services operated by each company in a week varies considerably. The companies pay rent to the airport authority in relation to the number of services that they operate.</P>
    <P>I do not think there was any other point raised on this Supplementary Estimate.  The main Estimate for the Department will, of course, come before the Dáil in the course of the next few months, and it will enable Deputies to raise other matters that do not necessarily come within the purview and scope of this Supplementary Estimate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will have seen the sub-heads under which additional money is required.  Apart from the increased expenditure on salaries, wages and allowances arising from bonus payments, these additional amounts are necessary mainly for two purposes: for food subsidies and for turf subsidies.  The additional amount required for food subsidies is solely in connection with tea.  The House is familiar with our position in regard to tea.  We have been receiving through British Tea Control an allocation of tea equal to 25 per cent. of our normal purchases, representing about half an ounce per head per week of our population.  In 1941 a company was established under Government auspices&mdash;Tea Importers Limited&mdash;to purchase tea in India.  The company purchased about 12,000,000 pounds of tea, but of that amount only about 5,400,000 pounds had been shipped to this country before the development of war in the Far East, which made further shipping impossible. The balance of the tea lying in Calcutta, which could not be shipped, was sold by the company.  The sale realised a profit of about £46,000.  The tea which was imported came, as Deputies will remember, by a round about route.  It was shipped from India to New York, from New York to Newfoundland and from Newfoundland here.  On arrival here it cost substantially more than the tea which we <Col N="1580" /> received from British Tea Control on which the present retail price of tea is based.</P>
    <P>In consequence of these stocks imported directly by Tea Importers Ltd., we were able to increase the half-ounce ration to one ounce during the winter of 1942-1943 and to maintain it at three-quarters of an ounce since.  As it was considered undesirable to increase the price of tea, the tea allocated by Tea Importers Ltd. from their imports from India had to be sold at a loss.  If that tea were sold at a price which would have avoided a loss, an increase of 8d. per pound on tea would have been necessary.  Under present circumstances, the actual expenditure per household which an increase of 8d. per pound would necessitate might not be much, but it was regarded as undesirable and the sale by Tea Importers Ltd. of their tea at a price which made an increase of only 4d. possible involved the company in a loss of approximately £200,000.  Against that loss of £200,000 there is the profit of £46,000 on the tea sold in India which could not be shipped and it is necessary now to provide a sum of £154,000 to make good the company's loss.</P>
    <P>The company is a non-profit-making organisation set up by the Government for the sole purpose of importing this tea.  The quantity of tea which was imported by the company in 1941 is now nearing exhaustion.  I do not think there is any possibility that additional supplies of tea of any consequence will be procured.  Some small lots of tea become available from time to time, and when they become available they are acquired by this company, but the prospect of any substantial addition to our stocks is not very bright.</P>
    <P>It is a question which the Government will have to decide, whether we should continue the present ration of tea until these stocks are exhausted or whether we should seek to conserve some of the stocks by reducing the ration, at least temporarily.  So long as we continue to receive the allocation of tea from the British Tea Control there is ½ oz. per head per week available. Probably the Dáil will agree&mdash; I am not asking them to agree now, <Col N="1581" /> but I think it is a matter upon which there is not likely to be much difference of opinion&mdash;that it is desirable that the remaining portion of the tea held up by Tea Importers, Limited should be carried over to meet the requirements of next winter.  I think a higher ration of tea in the winter would be regarded as good policy.  If there is to be a reduction it is probably better to make it at the period when milk is most plentiful.  Milk is scarcest in the winter and it is the time when many families would prefer to have a higher ration of tea.</P>
    <P>We cannot continue the present ration indefinitely during the summer and not have to make a reduction in the winter.  In these circumstances it is thought desirable that approaching the summer season the ration of tea should be reduced to the amount we are getting from the British Tea Control and carry to next winter the reserve so as to permit of a resumption of the present ration during the winter months.  If this company should be able to procure any additional supplies of tea, no doubt a fresh subsidy will be required, but I think it is exceedingly unlikely that the Dáil will be called upon for money for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The other sub-head of the Vote relates to the turf subsidy.  The amount estimated to be required to enable the price of turf to be maintained unchanged during the year proved less than the actual amount necessary, for three main reasons.  First of all, the actual cost of turf to Fuel Importers, Limited, the turf produced by the county surveyors or acquired by them from private producers, was higher than had been anticipated.  When the Estimate was being maintained the final accounts of these surveyors for the 1941-1942 seasons had not been received. They have since been received and show that the production cost during these two years was higher than had been assumed by approximately 5/6 per ton.  Secondly, the cost of handling turf in the non-turf areas, that is to say, the cost of its delivery to the dumps and its maintenance in the dumps and delivery from the dumps to merchants in good condition, was also greater than was anticipated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to say that.  The turf produced is brought to the non-turf areas and placed in dumps there.  The original intention was to endeavour to build up in non-turf areas a year's supply, if possible, so that the breakdown of transport services would not necessarily mean a complete absence of fuel in the non-turf areas.  There was a carry-over from last year of a substantial quantity of turf to meet the requirements of the present year and there will be a carry-over from this year to meet requirements next year, so it is impossible to define the actual outgoings and the requirements of a particular year. The amount now asked is the total amount required to offset losses incurred to date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  A third factor which upset the original Estimate was that a substantially larger quantity of turf was purchased in the non-turf area than in the previous year.  As there is a very heavy loss upon the sale of turf, an increase in the quantity sold involves an increase in the subsidy necessary.  The loss per ton on turf now sold in the non-turf area is approximately 28s. 10d. per ton</P>

A sum of £2,600 was provided to meet payments in the current year on contracts entered into by the Special Employment Schemes Office for the erection of camps for the housing of turf <Col N="1583" /> workers.  It was anticipated the final payment of contractors for the erection of these camps would have been made in the previous financial year. In fact, some of the contractors delayed sending in their accounts and consequently payment may be made in the current financial year and it is necessary to provide a sum for that purpose.  Deputies will note that there was a saving under sub-heads of approximately £20,000 making the sum now required £329,860.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the fact that the accounts of both the nonprofit making companies set up by the Government, Tea Importers, Limited, and Fuel Importers, Limited, do not come within the purview of the Public Accounts Committee, but I should like to ask the Minister if their accounts are examined by the Comptroller and Auditor-General, because I feel that a system is growing up in this House where the Government ask the House to provide very substantial sums of money to be expended by outside bodies over which we have no control.  I think the House should be very jealous of their authority in that respect and should insist upon a proper accounting here.  I should like to have an assurance from the Minister that at least some representative of the State will examine the accounts of these bodies.</P>
      <P>The Minister has presented a very gloomy picture as to the tea supply. The present ration, of course, is not nearly sufficient, but that is not the Minister's fault.  He has made every effort to procure supplies, but we were unfortunate that the war developed in the East before we were able to clear supplies that had been ordered.  I am inclined to agree with the Minister that if we have further to cut down the tea ration it would be better to reserve a supply for next winter.  I think it would be wiser to ask the people to go on a lower ration during next summer rather than to continue on our present ration and exhaust whatever reserves are there and consequently be forced to cut down the ration next winter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1584" /> In regard to the question of turf supplies and the cost of turf production, it is very difficult for the House to understand the ramifications of the activities in this connection.  We obtained some figures on a previous occasion from the Minister regarding subsidies, the cost of development, and all that sort of thing.  I think it would be well if the Minister would give the House some information regarding the actual cost of production because some extraordinary figures have been published in the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i> of December, 1943, volume 18, No. 4.  In the year 1929-30, our estimated production was 3,567,000 tons.  That increased in the year 1940-41 to 4,235,000 tons.  From the year 1941 to 1942-43, with all our efforts to supply fuel for this country, there was an increase of only 10,000 tons.  The production in 1940-41 was 4,235,000 tons and in 1942-43 the production was 4,245,000 tons.  That increase of 10,000 tons occurred in two years when the Government was paying particular attention to the production of turf fuel.  The most amazing aspect of our efforts in that respect is that the value of the production increased from £5,293,000 to £8,206,000 in the year 1942-43.  While production increased by only 10,000 tons, the value of the production increased by £3,000,000.  That appears to me to cast a reflection on the efficiency of the whole organisation of turf production. As a matter of fact, the increase in production from 1929-30 to 1942-43&mdash;the last year for which the figure is available&mdash;was not quite one-fifth.</P>
    <P>In the general Estimate last year we were asked to vote the sum of £660,000 for turf subsidy.  Now the Minister comes to the House and says that is not enough, that he wants to increase the amount to £830,000&mdash;an increase of £170,000.  In addition, we are asked for a sum of £25,860 to provide camps for turf workers.  Then there is a development grant, in regard to which we have no information at the moment.  Taking all the figures into account, the cost now is 28/10d.  There are incidental costs that I am sure the Minister is not taking into account.  Is the Minister taking into account development <Col N="1585" /> grants that had been made, and the cost of providing turf camps, road development, and other incidental costs? It appears to me that if these incidental costs are charged to turf production, which they must be if we are to arrive at the actual cost of turf, it means that turf is costing an enormous price to the country and we are getting a very poor article in return. We have had various complaints here from time to time as to the wet, sodden condition of turf supplied to the city, the enormous cost of transportation and distribution in the city, and the substantial sums of money that the House has been forced to provide as a result of that situation.  Can the Minister give us any assurance that an effort will be made to handle turf production in a more business-like way? Surely one would expect that all our efforts would have resulted in a greater increase in production than one-fifth over what the country was producing in 1929-30.</P>
    <P>There is the fact that although our production has increased by only 10,000 tons, the value of that increase is £3,000,000.  Surely these are figures that require explanation.  In face of that situation, one can understand that the Minister is forced to come in here time and again to ask for higher and higher subsidies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Vote is agreed to, I should like the Minister to give the House a good deal more information than he gave when introducing it.  I have always, by voice and vote in the House, given every possible support to the development of the peat industry and the establishment of the Turf Development Board.  I had hoped, when the emergency arose as a result of the cutting off of coal supplies, that the industry would get an opportunity which would put it on its feet for ever, but the more we hear of the work of the board and the activities of Fuel Importers, Limited, in particular, the more I fear there will be a day of reckoning when the emergency comes to an end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought that in the normal course of events, whether pre-emergency or since, the people who produce turf <Col N="1586" /> would get a profitable price for their labour, whether they were private turf producers or people employed by the local authorities in providing whatever turf was required for Fuel Importers, Limited.  We have heard to-day a most amazing state of affairs disclosed in the brief statement of the Minister, namely, that in order to sell turf in the non-turf areas like Dublin at a price of £3 4s. 0d. per ton, it has now become necessary to provide a subsidy of 28/- per ton.  In other words, in order to prevent Fuel Importers, Limited&mdash;I suppose that is their case&mdash;from selling turf at a loss, it is necessary to fix the economic price at £4 12s. 0d. a ton.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister think, from what he knows himself, that the turf sold in the City of Dublin is worth £4 12s. 0d. per ton, seeing that the producers in some parts of the country last year were getting only about £1 a ton and certainly not more than 25/- a ton? I want to know from the Minister, who has, I am sure, up-to-date information at his disposal, what is the latest price paid by Fuel Importers, Limited, for the turf they purchased from private turf producers, as well as the latest price paid to the county councils who produce turf for Fuel Importers, Limited.  I want to know if he has any figures at his disposal which will indicate the position from that point of view and also if he will tell us how the latest figure of £4 12s. 0d. per ton is arrived at.  We now know that the subsidy is 28/- per ton.</P>

I want to find out how the figure is made up, so that we may see what the producer is getting, what the transport people are getting, and what the workers at the dump are getting out of this sum of £4 12s. 0d.  Would the Minister also let us know the quantity of turf on the hands of the county councils at the end of last year?  Can he indicate whether there was an increase in the quantity of turf produced by the county councils last year and, if so, to what extent? I asked him, when making his opening statement, whether he could indicate the extent to which there was more depreciation.  I would not put my opinion against that of the Minister, because he has very reliable information from all over the country at his disposal, but I am of the opinion that some of the turf which was sold in the city last year was worse than the turf which came in during the first year of the emergency.  It may be worse coming from some areas and I admit that it may be better from other areas, but the House should be given much more information than the Minister gave, and I should like him to give me the figures which I have asked for.</P>

      <P>I note that this is the second Supplementary Estimate in respect of the turf subsidy.  There is an increase of £170,000 now, and, at the end of the Estimate, we read that the first Supplementary Estimate amounted to £280,000.  I do not know whether all that is in respect of the turf subsidy, as I have not got the first Supplementary Estimate by me, but the Minister has given the figure of 28/10 as the loss on the turf.  I can remember a discussion on this Estimate, or an Estimate like it, last year, in which it was brought out that not only was there a loss on the turf at the price fixed, but there was another concealed loss amounting to an additional £1 per ton in respect of what Deputy Hughes has called the development <Col N="1588" /> grant.  I think part of it was in respect of unemployment or something like that, but the position last year, as I understand it, was that the price charged to the consumer was £3 4s. 0d. per ton, that there was a loss in the shape of the turf subsidy of £1 per ton and an additional loss in respect of development of another £1 per ton, amounting in all to a sum of £5 4s. 0d. per ton.  The Minister now says that the loss on the turf which occasioned the subsidy has now gone up and the amount is 28/10.  He has not told us how that loss arises&mdash;whether a lot more turf will be got out, or whether there has been a terrible error in calculation. He has not told us how much is included in the figure for development in respect of turf which, I suppose, might be more or less than £1 per ton.</P>
      <P>I propose for the Minister's benefit&mdash; I hope he will correct my arithmetic if I am wrong&mdash;to work it out in this way: the consumer is now charged £3 4s. 0d. per ton and there is a loss of £1 8s. 10d., which I will call £1 9s. 0d., making £4 13s. 0d., and another loss in respect of development, which we were told was in the matter of getting down to the black turf in the bogs, of £1 per ton, which would bring the cost of the ton of turf to the State to £5 13s. 0d. We used to hear that the equivalent of a ton of coal was 2½ tons of turf.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Even on that basis, the Deputy will see where my figures get him.  The Minister may say that there is no coal to be got.  Of course he is quite right.  Needs must when the devil drives, but even if you take two tons of turf to be equal to one ton of <Col N="1589" /> coal, that brings the cost of coal to £11 6s.  I do not think the Minister would imagine that that price will continue when the emergency is over.  Has the Minister envisaged the disappearance of turf in the non-turf areas like snow in a ditch?  There are great complaints about wet turf.  The Minister says that the merchants are getting the turf dry and that something must be happening to it; that it must be left out in the weather or something like that.  Be that as it may, a lot of consumers are bitterly dissatisfied with the quality of turf they are getting.  They are saying that they are paying £3 4s. per ton for a percentage of water.</P>
      <P>There is another matter and I do not know how far the Minister has considered it.  There are certain dumps and the Minister says that the supply to them must be kept up.  Deputies from time to time have heard complaints of turf coming from turf producing areas which is brought through districts that are short of turf and delivered at a turf dump.  I do not know whether the Minister could make any big saving in the delivery by getting a lot of that turf delivered direct to the distributors' yards.  That is a matter for the Minister.  But I should like the Minister to tell us what the actual cost to the country is of a ton of turf, namely, the price to the supplier here, the loss on the running of that, and the loss to the county councils through the production of turf.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will give us those figures, because we may as well face the situation squarely and see what turf is costing us.  I do not suggest that there is coal available.  We have to put up with that for the present. But the sooner consumers know what turf is costing us the better.  We hear complaints about it.  I think Deputy Davin is anxious to know what they are getting for turf at the bogs.  I do not know what they are getting at the bogs.  Apparently, it looks as if it was costing the country £5 13s. to get a ton of turf out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Government took over responsibility for turf production the tendency has been for the <Col N="1590" /> price to increase phenomenally.  I am afraid that tendency will continue unless some suitable or adequate steps are taken to regulate the price and to put turf production on something approaching an economic and business basis.  I assume from the Minister's statement that the balance of the subsidy provided for in this Estimate, the sum required in order to provide the full subsidy for turf production, is £170,000.  I assume that that balance is due mainly to the extra cost of turf production during the 1941-42 season. There is no question but that county councils did embark on turf production then on an extravagant scale, at the request of the Government, in order to ensure that there would be adequate supplies of fuel for the people in our cities and towns and generally in the non-turf areas.  There is no doubt that turf production during that season was carried out in a very uneconomic way and that costs were abnormally high; but since then those county councils producing turf for sale through Fuel Importers, Limited, have reduced the cost of turf production very substantially, judging by the reports which they have made to their respective county councils on different occasions. They have learned wisdom from their experience during that first season of turf production.  They have learned also how to utilise more economic methods in turf cutting and, generally, in turf production with the result that the costs of turf production for the county councils have been very substantially reduced.  That is not reflected in the price of turf to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apparently the Government are subsidising the sale of turf in non-turf areas to the tune of 28/10 per ton.  I would be interested to know from the Minister what are the factors responsible for that very high subsidy, in view of the fact that the cost of turf production has actually been cheapened by the county councils. What are the factors which contributed to such a very big subsidy having to be provided by the Government? Have all steps been taken to ascertain if it is possible to obtain turf from people who can produce it in a cheaper way than the county councils? For instance, have Fuel Importers, <Col N="1591" /> Limited, tried to arrange with private individuals to cut turf for them, let us say, on a piece-work basis?  I am certain that, by good organisation, it would be possible to arrange for a number of private individuals in turf-producing areas to embark on the production of turf at a very much lower cost than it is possible for county councils to produce turf.  I wonder has it occurred to the Minister or to Fuel Importers, Limited, to try an experiment, let us say, in one big turf-production area with a number of private individuals and get them to produce turf on a piece-work basis?  I think they will find that turf production will work out very much cheaper than it is at present and that it will be possible for the Government to sell that turf at a cheaper rate than turf is being sold at present.</P>
    <P>I also would be interested, like Deputy Davin, to know exactly what it does cost to produce a ton of turf at the present time.  Not only must you take into account the fact that one ton of turf is sold to-day at 64/- in Dublin and other parts of the country but that the Government loses 28/10 on that.  You must also take into consideration the proportion of the money spent in draining the bog on which the turf is produced, the proportion of the cost of making the road into the bog, the proportion of the cost of development and, in certain areas, of erecting and maintaining camps.  It would be interesting to know what exactly it does cost the Government or the fuel producers per ton of turf at present.</P>
    <P>After all, turf can be bought in some of the small country towns at one-third of the price which the unfortunate people in Dublin and other cities are charged, yet those selling in the country towns can travel long distances and sell that turf at a profit. So there must be something very uneconomical in the methods adopted by Fuel Importers in turf production.  I think it is time for the Government, as a duty they owe to the country, to make an exhaustive examination of the whole problem, with a view to placing the turf industry on a really economic and business basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the House would be very interested in the figures asked for by Deputy Davin and Deputy Roddy.  They would, perhaps, give us an insight into the working of this very elaborate turf scheme.  I think we will have to consider, on this question of turf, that this portion of the Supplementary Estimate&mdash;£170,000&mdash;is part of the price we pay for our freedom.  Of course, it is the business of this House to see that the price be reduced as much as possible.  However, everybody knew that the working of the turf scheme would be uneconomic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no escape from that.  We all know that the only economic way to utilise our resources on the bogs is not by the method which has been forced upon us by the outbreak of war through the stoppage of imports of coal but by some of the more modern methods of using the fuel value of turf there for electrification purposes.  When we look at the figures and make some calculation of what they would amount to if capitalised, we see that, had we the vision in the past to embark upon this scheme, we would probably be paying less per annum than we are paying now for the very ineffective service we are getting.  That is no fault perhaps of any development board or any Ministerial action but is due to the inherent difficulties of the situation and to the engineering and other economic difficulties when it is handled in the method with which we are now familiar.  That is the point of view I am sure which would be expressed by all who have the real interest of the turf industry at heart. If we are to have such an industry it must be reorganised as it could not continue on the present basis which is a very wasteful method of utilising our fuel resources.  I am perfectly sure the Minister realises that and also that, if we are to be made independent of British coal, we must sooner or later tackle this question of the electrification of our turf resources. We may link that up with the promised development of the rural electrification.  Whether we do embark on such a scheme or not we <Col N="1593" /> should take whatever steps are within our powers to see that the price to the consumer at present is of the lowest and that the content of the fuel as far as heating value is concerned is of the highest.  There are continual complaints about the nature of the turf.  Most of us thought that as the years went on there would be some improvement in the actual nature of the turf.  There may be improvement in various areas but in other areas the turf is still of a poor quality.  That may be inevitable but if it is possible to tap resources which produce a better quality it might be feasible for the Minister to concentrate upon those sites which give the better heavier mountainy turf rather than on the areas which produce the lighter form of turf so much more scorned by the person who uses turf at the present time. The value that we get from the turf, when we see that an additional sum of £170,000 is required, may not be as bad as it would appear.  I am not as certain as other Deputies regarding the method adopted in compiling these figures and when we are told there is a loss of approximately 5/- per ton in the estimated cost of production by the county surveyors, we should be informed as to the actual cost of production by those local authorities.  Does it in any way include the capital cost of the production? If the turf industry is to continue even on the present basis the capital cost should be spread over whatever number of years is considered the life time of this industry. I take it that the industry must continue at least for some years after the war and therefore the capital cost should be spread over that number of years to get an approximately correct accounting figure.</P>
    <P>There is one point on which I would like the Minister's view.  It is purely a local one and concerns the County Louth.  There are the usual complaints from County Louth, and the Turf Development Board has dealt with them within its capacity.  That does not mean to say that the consumers there are by any means satisfied but, as in many other places, they would be satisfied if they thought no <Col N="1594" /> preferential treatment was being accorded to other places.  There are persistent remarks about turf passing through Louth from nearby areas of a higher quality en route to Dublin, whereas turf that is consumed in Louth&mdash;in Dundalk and Drogheda specifically&mdash;is brought from Donegal, or, as they might term it, from the furthest point of the country. I do not know whether there is any foundation to those statements, but they cause a great deal of unnecessary dissatisfaction with the situation.  Perhaps the Minister would inquire into that point as to whether Louth is in any way discriminated against.  If he would do that I am sure a great deal of the expressed dissatisfaction there might be quietened, if the statement is not correct. In reference to the food subsidy there is just one point that I wish to make. As the turf subsidy is part of the price of our freedom, I suppose the food subsidy is part of the price of our neutrality.  A loss has been sustained and we have to pay the bill.  We should receive an assurance, however, that the loss was minimised by the exercise of all due care, prudence and vigilance on the part of the tea importing company.  I do not know whether this company has anything to do with the importation of coffee to the country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The point that I wish to make is that, perhaps, this company might consider the feasibility of obtaining stocks of coffee and of applying to coffee the same method of subsidy that is being applied to tea so as to make the use of coffee more widespread than it is.  As everybody knows, coffee is the ordinary drink of the vast masses of the plain people in America and Germany.  In this country, before the war at least, it was reserved for the somewhat higher classes, as they are termed.  With the coming of the war, and the conditions that obtain now, a lot of people have acquired a taste for coffee, so that it might be possible for the Minister to case the situation in regard to tea if <Col N="1595" /> he could subsidise the purchase of coffee on a somewhat similar basis to that obtaining for tea.</P>
      <P>Finally, with regard to the sub-head dealing with the camps for turf workers.  This item, I take it, represents part of the capital cost of the turf industry as such.  We of the Labour Party, naturally, would be concerned very much about the condition of these camps.  We should like to have some up-to-date information from the Minister as to the present condition of them, the state in which they are kept, the housing accommodation that is there, the availability of canteens or other methods of provisioning the workers, and the type of inspection that is carried out by the Department so as to protect the interests of the workers in these camps.</P>

      <P>The persons responsible for the supply of turf to Dublin are a great body of men.  They have succeeded in doing something which was supposed to be impossible. They have produced a large volume of smoke without fire.  That has been the experience during the past three winters, including the present one, of the average Dublin citizen who is now anxious to know if the promise made so long ago of being supplied with good turf is ever going to be fulfilled. In the first year of the emergency we had to depend almost entirely on turf which was very bad stuff.  It was wet and almost impossible to light.  Last year there was an improvement in the quality of the turf made available, but this year the quality has again deteriorated. In the early stages of the emergency the average citizen was inclined to be reasonable about the thing: to admit that the turf had to be produced in a great hurry and perhaps out of bogs that were not quite suitable.  That was the position two or three years ago.  The bad stuff is still coming to Dublin and is being sold at a high price.  The average Dublin housewife is very much concerned to know why she cannot get good turf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not have spoken on this Estimate but for the <Col N="1596" /> fact that I come from a turf-producing area.  I am interested in what has been said by other Deputies.  Deputy Byrne (Junior), has just referred to the concern of the average Dublin housewife to get suitable fuel.  I want to tell the House that if suitable fuel is not being made available it is not the fault of the workers in the turf-producing areas or of the bogs in the rural areas. In my view the people responsible are the various county councils and the officials who allow such turf to be sent to the cities.  I have seen turf sold in Dublin that I would not use.  What we do with it is we throw it into the bog-holes. I do not understand how the people in the city use it.  Something should be done to see that turf of a superior quality is sent to the cities. I am sure my colleague, Deputy Davin, must be aware that at the present time there is a serious shortage of turf in the town of Birr, the centre of a turf-producing area.  The turf in that area has been taken to this city with the result that the people in Birr cannot get any turf.  That indicates that there has been bad management somewhere. Surely somebody must be responsible for that situation.</P>
      <P>There is another matter that I want to bring to the Minister's attention, and that is the production of turf economically.  We have one of the most suitable bogs in Ireland which is situate quite convenient to the towns of Tullamore and of Athlone&mdash;and which is in the home parish of our colleague, Deputy Boland&mdash;on which, in my opinion, turf could be produced on an economical and extensive basis.</P>
      <P>It is in the district of Bellair.  The Westmeath County Council have passed a resolution asking the Minister to take the necessary steps to see that this bog will be developed.  The Offaly County Council have passed a similar resolution.  The bog runs through both counties and there is a railway line straight through the bog.  Very little would have to be done so far as the provision of transport is concerned. All the Great Southern Railways Company would have to do would be to erect a loading bank, because the railway tracks are there already through the bog.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1597" /> There are firms in Tullamore and in Athlone prepared to take the turf, and there is also Goodbody's jute factory at Clara.  There are other big factories in that part of the country willing to take turf from this bog.  All these firms would, I am sure, be anxious to see this bog developed.  I am of the opinion that it would mean a considerable saving of petrol, as lorries would not have to go to other bogs.  The railway is there to take away the turf the moment it is suitable for use.  The turf could be taken to Athlone, for instance, where there are industries which have agreed to purchase it once the bog is developed. This bog at Bellair, Offaly, is only three miles from the village of Ballycumber, eight miles from Athlone, and ten miles from Tullamore.  The owners of the bog are the Irish Land Commission, I am told.  The Westmeath County Council have done everything possible to get the bog developed, and the Offaly County Council also want it developed.</P>
    <P>I was told on very good authority about a statement made by an engineer, a very high officer of the Turf Development Board.  I think this particular individual happens to be county surveyor in Donegal at the present time.  I am open to contradiction, but I believe that that is so.  This man was put on this bog some years ago, and he said that it was one of two bogs in Ireland most suitable for a big scheme of turf production on a very economic basis.  He said it was far more suitable as a turf-producing bog than Clonsast or the bog in Kerry, the name of which I cannot remember at the moment.  I wish those in authority would take the necessary steps to see that this bog is developed.  If necessary, I will forward more details to the Minister, showing that there are firms willing to take the turf, firms that have already signed orders.</P>
    <P>If this bog is developed, there will be more turf available for the cities, because from that bog we will be able to supply our local factories and other industries.  There is no coal coming in, and the industries we have at Portlaoighise, Tullamore, Clara and Athlone have to use turf.  Before we send turf to the cities we will have to see <Col N="1598" /> that those industries are kept going with sufficient supplies.</P>
    <P>I do not know who is responsible for the condition of the turf that is being sent to Dublin, but I will say that there is considerable neglect in some places because some of the turf coming in here is definitely not fit to be used. The Minister should take some steps to see that there is an improvement in the quality of the turf coming into the city. So far as prices are concerned they are rather high, and I am convinced that there is somebody making a good thing out of the turf.  I do not know who is doing so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>When Deputy Roddy mentioned the point about producing turf through the efforts of private producers, I recollected that about two years ago a former Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Hugo Flinn, did discuss that matter with the House and he took a very favourable view of the possibilities of developing turf through the activities of private producers.  I do not think that aspect has since been considered.  In the south, at any rate, I do not think it has been dealt with by any local authority or Government Department to any extent.  I should like to put this to the House, Quite a number of families in the turf areas in my own constituency on the Kerry border have gone in in a large way for turf production.  They are people who have always cut turf and in normal times they sold it in the towns and villages.  They employ labour and there is no doubt that the turf they produce and the price they charge compare very favourably with anything the local authorities or others have done.  The best proof of that is that firms of the type that Deputy Flanagan referred to, industrial firms in County Cork, are always anxious to buy their turf.  Those producers have not the slightest difficulty in disposing of the turf and it is generally of a very high quality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think in areas like that, where you have five or six families in a big turf district, if these families were organised into a unit under the direction of the local authorities and subsidised at the start, given money so that they could hire men&mdash;they might <Col N="1599" /> not always have capital on which to operate&mdash;and if a contract were entered into with them say from the end of March to the 1st of August for the production of a certain quantity of turf, you would get turf of a much better quality and at a cheaper rate than you are getting it at the moment.</P>
    <P>On the question of price, I find it hard to understand the present prices in the cities.  When I was listening to Deputies asking for information I was trying to work out what I would consider a reasonable cost of production for turf, putting it at a fairly high figure, a figure that would give the private producer a reasonable profit for turf that he would deliver at a distance of three or six or seven miles. I came to the conclusion that 30/- a ton would be a very fair price.  I am estimating that on the price of turf in my own area, the price that is paid to people who bring the turf in their horse-carts over a distance of five or six miles.  I regard that as the price for first-class turf.  The discrepancy between that price and the price charged for an inferior quality of turf in the cities is amazing.</P>
    <P>I can understand that the question of transport enters largely into the matter, and also the question of employment. It might also be said that people who produce turf privately do not count in the same manner in the fixing of prices because they may not allow full wages to members of their own families, and that is an important consideration if you are hiring labour.  The fact that turf is £3 4s. 0d. a ton in the cities has enabled many people to raise the price to a figure they would not otherwise hope to get.  I am satisfied that the price they get in the country areas gives them a reasonable return and they are satisfied.</P>
    <P>One thing the people in the turf-producing areas have to contend with was referred to by Deputy Flanagan. That is the fact that very often turf is as scarce in the bog areas as in the cities.  The reason is that the fuel importing people run fleets of lorries right to the ricks of turf, the turf is loaded on the bog, and that is a great attraction to the turf producers.  If <Col N="1600" /> they can sell their turf in the bogs they will not go to the bother of breaking up ricks in order to sell the turf by the cart-load in the towns. That is one reason why there is a scarcity of turf in the very heart of the turf area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connolly referred to electrification schemes through the medium of turf.  I have heard it said that the idea of producing electricity on the bogs has been dropped and I should like to have some information from the Minister as regards that matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Daniel McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing here with the cost of production of turf, not with the generation of electricity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Connolly did refer to that matter and I am merely looking for information and I suggest that this has some relation to the price of turf.  The suggestion I heard was that the cost of producing turf for the purpose of generating electricity would be so excessive that a scheme would be entirely uneconomic. Is there anything in that rumour?  I do not want to carry the matter any further.  As regards Deputy Connolly's suggestion that the Minister should subsidise coffee in order that it could be sold at a cheaper price and popularised in the country, am I not correct in saying that there are vast stocks of coffee in the country at the moment in comparison with the demand?  I think Deputy Connolly will have to realise that as long as there is any tea available in the country, subsidisation of coffee will not result in any greater sales of coffee because if the people can get even half an ounce of tea in the week, 90 per cent. of the people in rural Ireland will not use coffee. That is an accepted fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell me, when replying, whether the scheme which the late Deputy Flinn said he was considering in regard to dealing with private producers has been considered or not.  There is one other point I wish to put to Deputy Connolly. He said that the Minister should take steps to see that the mountainy bogs that give the best hard <Col N="1601" /> turf were developed rather than low-lying bogs that yield a softer, whiter turf.  Deputy Connolly possibly did not realise that the development of the mountain bogs in the early stages of turf production by local authorities was one of the reasons why there was such terrific wastage of turf, because the local authorities went into these mountain bogs and anybody who knows anything about turf production would have to admit that they cut the turf so late in the year that it could not be properly saved.  The difficulty about utilising mountain bogs is that after July you cannot do any more work.  These bogs are naturally subject to fogs much earlier in the year than bogs in low-lying areas.  The one difficulty I see about dealing with mountain bogs in that connection is that the period of production is much shorter than it is in low-lying inland areas.  I would not go as far as Deputy O'Reilly in saying that while the county council schemes were badly managed at the start there has been any great improvement in them.  I am not at all satisfied about that.  One of the reasons I say that, as far as County Cork is concerned, is, that I have seen the Army and the county council schemes worked side by side in a bog and certainly the work the Army did there as compared with the county council work was a tribute to the Army.  The Army had the turf cut and saved and out of the bog while the others were thinking about it.  It is not the fault of the actual manual worker that the work was not done efficiently because 90 per cent. of the road workers and the men who went in as county council turf workers in rural areas did know something about cutting turf.  The fault was invariably at the top because the people in charge of the operations, like the people who made second and third cuttings of turf in the months of August and September, are the people responsible for the terrific wastage that occurred.  It is scandalous to see in areas all over the country thousands of tons of turf still lying in the bogs from last year, the year before, and the year before that, that will never be any good for anything except possibly to spread out over the bog again at <Col N="1602" /> some future period.  The county councils advertised to sell that turf as low as, I think, 10/- a ton.  I do not think they could get anybody to take it away for nothing to get it out of their way. The real fault lay in the fact that the people who were directing the schemes had not sufficient knowledge of the practical management of turf production. My experience of one of the biggest bogs in North Cork is that whoever was in charge of the Army scheme&mdash;and I understand the officer in command was a man who would not have been expected to know anything about turf production&mdash;a city man&mdash; the Army scheme was worked far more efficiently than the county council scheme that was operated side by side with it.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the best county council work that was ever done in any part of County Cork could possibly compare with the worst work done by any private producer cutting his own turf.  I saw cases of county council schemes where they cut banks of turf in such a way that when the turf was cut and ready there was not room to spread it.  The workers had to take the sods in their hands and walk 20, 30, 40 and 50 yards to a smooth patch where they could spread it.  That showed complete lack of any practical knowledge of the details of turf production. I think the Minister, when he is replying on the question of cost, could take my figure.  I do not think I am wrong in suggesting that a reasonable price for a ton of turf delivered at my door in my town by a man who produced it himself and delivered it by horse and cart a distance of four or five miles, would be 30/-.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Several Deputies raised the question of the cost of turf. I want to start off by giving my own figure for the delivery of one ton of turf by a horse and cart a distance of four or five miles.  Other Deputies, like Deputy Davin, who know all about the railway company and freight charges could possibly build up from that and the Minister could build up the other <Col N="1603" /> expenses incidental to turf production and let the people know how he arrives at the enormous figure of £5 a ton.  It would clear the air to a certain extent.</P>
      <P>I do not think the Minister was correct in saying yesterday, I think, in reply to a question, that there was not any wet turf coming into the cities.  I am thinking of Cork City and some turf I have seen here recently.  It is not wet turf in the sense that it is wringing wet, but I would go as far as to say that it is turf that was never dry, never properly saved, in the same way that a man cutting turf for his own household would save it.  Actually the turf that is being sent to the city is always damp and heavy and will smoulder instead of light simply because it has never been properly saved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>Of more serious importance to the country generally and to future turf production than the subsidy we are asked to vote here, which has been the subject of some discussion, is the irreparable damage that is being done to turf production generally, due to the condition in which turf is being supplied to the cities, towns and institutions in the country.  Probably the greatest obstacle to the production of turf in good condition is the fact that the emergency was sprung on the people and the Government in their effort to get supplies of turf had to take advantage of the bogs nearest to the biggest centres and, accordingly, had to operate undeveloped or virgin bogs.  Anyone with a knowledge of turf will understand that for a number of years turf produced from a virgin bog will be of the poorest quality.</P>

I fully agree with the suggestions made here by Deputies this evening, that the best possible production of turf at the <Col N="1604" /> cheapest price will be done by individuals. There is a technique in the handling of turf.  Families in bog areas who have always produced turf for their own use, and possibly for sale locally, have a method and a knack of handling turf even under difficult weather conditions that are not available where mass production is carried on.  I know the main difficulty in regard to the proposal I make is transport.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>In seconding this motion, I should like to remind the House that some years ago&mdash;in 1937, to be exact&mdash;a committee was set up by this House to inquire into Ministerial and other salaries, and a report was subsequently presented to the Minister for Finance, that committee having been established and having heard evidence from a number of Deputies.  As a matter of fact, I was one of those who appeared before that committee.  On page 15 of its report, the committee states <i>inter alia:</i>&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The various witnesses gave their evidence in the fullest and frankest manner possible.  We are very grateful to the Deputies who gave us their assistance in this way, namely, Deputies Anthony, Bartley, Brady, Carthy, McGilligan, Murphy, Myles, O Braonáin, O'Neill, and Pattison.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There were a large number of findings in the report, running up to nearly 100 paragraphs and an extract from paragraph 23, on page 12, reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It was a matter of general agreement that so far as Ministers were concerned not only were the post-1932 salaries entirely inadequate but that the rates provided by the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, also required revision.  There was also unanimity among the witnesses that the salaries should be sufficient to enable a Minister to accept office without great financial sacrifice and to maintain, while in office, the standard which his high position in the community inevitably entailed.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To that, I feel certain, every member will subscribe, if he believes that there is such a thing as dignity to be maintained in this State.  Another extract from another paragraph&mdash;I do <Col N="1606" /> not want to weary the House, but it is essential for the purposes of my argument that I should quote one or two of the paragraphs&mdash;reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In our opinion the present salaries are not sufficient, when all the various demands on the purse of a Minister have been met, to enable him to maintain his public position with dignity and honour to the country, while little provision can be made for the future or for the normal contingencies of life, such as severe illness or other misfortune.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have just said that many members of the House were examined at that inquiry.  As a result of that inquiry, it will be within the recollection of many Deputies that Ministers' salaries, the salaries of Parliamentary Secretaries and the salaries of the officers of the House were increased, and we all said then, and say now, deservedly so.</P>

      <P>Subsequently, in 1938, the Government considered the question of Deputies' Allowances.  It was then decided that Deputies' allowances should be increased by £10 per month. It was felt that the work of a Deputy who did his work consistently and conscientiously for his constituents deserved some recognition, in so far as it represented an additional outlay in the course of his duties.  It was felt that in all these circumstances the allowance at that time of £30 per month was quite inadequate.  It is common knowledge that for some years past a campaign has been conducted in this country&mdash;a campaign helped and fostered by many persons who are now members of the House&mdash;a campaign of calumny against Ministers, of abuse and vilification of Deputies, appealing to the very vilest and meanest of traits in the character of our people.  It is all very fine to stand up at a country <Col N="1607" /> cross-roads and tell the unfortunate agricultural labourer with 18/- or 20/- a week, and less in many cases, that there are men in Dáil Eireann enjoying fat salaries ranging from £1,700 down to £480, and doing nothing for them. All that kind of thing will come back one of these days like a boomerang on the heads of some of the Deputies at present serving the House, none of whom are giving their extra allowances to the St. Vincent de Paul or other charitable organisations.</P>
      <P>When the committee suggested in this motion is set up, as I hope it will be, I hope there will be a free, frank and truthful disclosure of the means of the various Deputies who will give evidence before it.  I appeal specially to some members of Clann na Talmhan &mdash;who are supposed to represent the farmers&mdash;to make a full and free disclosure of what their earnings on the farm are, what they have in the joint stock banks, and what they have by way of shareholding in the co-operative creamery societies, and why the various co-operative creamery societies do not pay any income-tax at all. These societies have long departed from their original objects, namely, to sell and purvey the products of the farm: milk, butter, eggs, etc.  We know that they have developed now into regular large chain shops in competition with the shopkeepers in the towns and cities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>The shopkeeper in the town and city pays his employees in most cases a trade union rate of wages, whereas we find on examination that very few of the co-operative societies in the country districts pay their workers even a decent living wage, not to speak of what is known as a trade union wage.  Let us hope then that when this committee is established, we shall have the incidence of income-tax, if we have to pay income-tax on our allowances, fully dealt with.  I for one am quite in favour of the principle of the payment of income-tax on allowances, whether they are regarded as allowances or salaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1608" /> There is, of course, a difference, and that difference should be marked, between what is known as a salary and what is known as an allowance. You will find in many of the official documents that a Minister has a salary and a Deputy has an allowance, an allowance made only to cover his actual out-of-pocket expenses.</P>
    <P>Again, we will have to find out how many Deputies are drawing two, three, and even four salaries.  Let us have a full, free and frank discussion.  If my allowance is made subject to income-tax, it will cost me a couple of hundred pounds a year.  How many farmer Deputies will it cost £100 or £120 a year?  Very few, I believe.  I want to know how many farmers threw up their farms to come into the Dáil; how many business men threw up their business.  Very few.  If a business man leaves his place of business, he has to pay a substitute to do his work. I resigned my post when I became a Deputy.  I resigned it for the time being and I can go back again to it if necessary.  I felt that I could not conscientiously discharge my duties to my constituents if I remained in my post.  I should like to know how many farmer Deputies and other Deputies put in a substitute when they came into the Dáil.  We will then have a very clear conception of what is meant by this slogan all over the country, that Deputies are free from income-tax and have nothing else to do up here but to smoke fat cigars and enjoy all the luxuries they can get in the metropolis.</P>
    <P>It is about time that some of the Deputies who amused many of their hearers at the cross-roads during the last election would go back now and give their impressions of the Deputies and Ministers they have met here. Will they be able to tell their constituents when they go back that Deputies have nothing to do except to lounge about the Library, to lounge about the bar, as we were told by several people, or to lounge about other places in Leinster House?  Now that they have got a rude awakening, as I believe some of them have, I hope they will have the decency, the courage, and the manliness to tell some <Col N="1609" /> of their constituents whom they fooled all about their lovely lives in Dublin.  I think it will be conceded that any Deputy who does his work as he should do it is not receiving too big an allowance when he gets a sum of £40 per month.  That may appear a colossal sum to somebody who never had more than one or two pounds per week.  But, to the man who had £400 or £500 or £600 a year, it does not appear so much at all.  That man makes a very big sacrifice.  That is very seldom told to people at the cross-roads.</P>
    <P>I hope that when this committee is established we will have a full, free confession and examination there, that we will know who is who.  We know, of course, that income-tax can be evaded by raising the allowance to £600 and then taking off £200.  I do not agree with that method of evading income-tax.  I want to see that the incidence of the tax, if it is imposed, falls on the shoulders of Deputies who keep on advocating that Deputies' allowances should be taxed.  When that is done I, for one, will be quite pleased.  I am not so sure that there will be much pleasure written on the face of others when they give evidence before this committee.  As one who objects to and despises the suggestion that I and other Deputies are living in an Elysium, that we indulge in a regular riot of living, I am gratified to second the motion in the hope that something good will emerge from it, something that will stop once for all this vile criticism that has been levelled at Deputies.  So far as Press criticism is concerned, no one bothers about that; no one bothers about cartoonists. I do not bother about it.  I can enjoy it.  But I certainly cannot enjoy the person who pretends to be a serious-minded Deputy and who tries to bring the institutions of the State into contempt.  It will come back like a boomerang on these people some day, and I hope it will.</P>

      <P>I must first of all compliment Deputy Dillon upon the resourcefulness and the ability with which he presented this motion to the House, having regard to the fact that he could not have had any prior notice <Col N="1610" /> that this motion would be taken last week.  I think it is a fine thing to have in this House a Deputy of Deputy Dillon's ability who has such lucidity of expression and other splendid accomplishments. It is rather a pity that those splendid gifts and accomplishments are more than counterbalanced by a lack of balance and common sense.  I think that if Deputy Dillon had used the common sense which is given to the ordinary Deputy he would have refrained from bringing forward this motion.  He claimed that this motion had a direct relation to a motion brought before Dáil Eireann by this Party.  It has no connection, good, bad or indifferent, with the motion we proposed.  What we proposed was that Deputies' salaries, whether they be adequate or inadequate, should be subject to income-tax the same as the income of every other member of the community.  We must remember that Deputies enjoy immunity from income-tax by reason of a special Act of this Parliament passed in 1925, an Act which was passed through the House, I might almost say, with the speed of greased lightning.  That is the Act which we seek to repeal.  We did not base the case for repealing that on the contention that Deputies' allowances were inadequate.</P>

      <P>I think I have the right to reply to the points raised by Deputy Dillon in his opening statement, and I think that he did very definitely refer to the motion we brought forward. Personally, when I read this motion when it was submitted to me a few days after our motion in regard to <Col N="1611" /> income-tax had been defeated, I felt like a guest in a certain hotel in this city who rang for the porter in the small hours of the morning, and when the porter, after wakening out of his sleep, put his head in through the door and asked, &ldquo;What is biting you?&rdquo; the guest replied: &ldquo;That is just what I want to find out.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I want to find out what was biting Deputy Dillon when he introduced this motion.  I believe that what was annoying him was a feeling that he had not justified himself in the attitude which he took up in regard to our motion for the abolition of income-tax, and that he felt it was his duty to do something to justify himself.  I think I heard of some writer who said: &ldquo;There is one thing worse than death, and that is not to be justified.&rdquo;  Deputy Dillon went out of his way, in introducing this motion, to accuse me of having definitely declared last week that Deputies' allowances were excessive.  I made it clear at the time that I had made no such statement whatever.  Deputy Dillon said that he would find the record of my statement.  I challenge Deputy Dillon to produce it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I deny it.  There is no use in Deputy Dillon trying to make charges of that kind and then trying to evade them.  I was very careful, when I was speaking in support of the motion for the abolition of income-tax exemption, not to make any reference as to whether the Deputies' allowance was adequate or otherwise, because I knew the case rested on firmer ground. Therefore, the charge made by Deputy Dillon is absolutely false and ridiculous.</P>
      <P>Now, I am one of those who have never supported a campaign against Deputies' standard of living or against Deputies having a decent standard of allowance.  If Deputies will recall, when I was opposing the increase in Deputies' salaries five years ago&mdash;and I was a very new Deputy in this House at that time&mdash;I opposed it mainly on the grounds, firstly, that the time was inopportune and, secondly, for a variety of other very sound reasons&mdash; including that it was wrong for a Parliament to make changes in allowances immediately after an election.  I hold that it is wrong for a Parliament to make such changes during the lifetime of that Parliament&mdash;that they should not take effect until after another general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position, therefore, is that Deputy Dillon has tried to associate this motion with one with which it has no relation whatever, with one which was based on an entirely different case&mdash;based on the case that Deputies should not enjoy a privilege from which other citizens are exempt. I am one of those who have always set their faces against any campaign <Col N="1613" /> to belittle the national institutions of this country and I have strong reasons for doing so.  I was brought up in a home where representatives of this country in a foreign Parliament were honoured and almost idolised. As a small boy, I remember I used to swell with indignation when I heard those representatives defamed, described as &ldquo;Four-Hundred-Pounders&rdquo; and as job-hunters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>No one takes Deputy Dillon as seriously as he takes himself. I have always held this Parliament in respect and the representatives of the people in respect.  I have sought&mdash;and the members of our Party have sought &mdash;to remove one clear cause of dissatisfaction amongst the people in regard to their representatives.  We tried to do that by a motion, which was defeated last week.  We did our best, and I do not think anyone can say but that we made as good a case as could be made in support of that motion.  I do not think anyone can deny that, sooner or later, the common-sense of the people and the sense of justice of the people's representatives will accept the proposal in that motion.  There is, and there always will be, people in this country and in every other country who despise democratic institutions and democratically elected representatives. There is a section of the community with whom one can feel sympathy&mdash;the very poor people who feel that a Deputy's job is a very good job and who do not realise the position thoroughly.  On the other hand, there is the very wealthy section of the community, who despise and denounce the remuneration paid to Deputies, because they realise that, if that remuneration were abolished, they would have a monopoly of government here. With those two sections, and with a considerable body of opinion making capital out of this question of Deputies' remuneration, it is only natural that Deputies should seek to leave no cause whatever for complaint; and that was what we tried to do last week.</P>

      <P>By leave of Deputy Cogan, I wish to point out that, as reported in column 1217 of the Official Debates, volume 92, I said that Deputy Cogan said: &ldquo;It is sufficient to pay his expenses and a good deal more.&rdquo; Deputy Cogan intervened, saying: &ldquo;On a point of order, I said nothing of the kind.&rdquo;  I then said: &ldquo;It is not a point of order, but you did say it, and I heard you.&rdquo;  I now turn to column 1047, Deputy Cogan speaking:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The case that has been made by some Deputies is that this allowance, which they receive in respect of their duties as members of the House, is not a salary&mdash;that it is purely an allowance to the extent of 100 per cent. of the £480 paid.  Can anybody sustain that argument for one moment?  Take the members of this House who have no other source of income but their allowance as Deputies&mdash;are we to take it that if the £480 is purely an allowance to cover out-of-pocket expenses, those Deputies must, since they have no other source of income, apply to the local relieving officer for home help, because that is what is implied in that suggestion?</P>
      <P>Of course, the fact is that it is partly an allowance for out-of-pocket expenses, and partly a salary paid to the members as public representatives for their services to the community.  And just as the doctor and the surgeon who receive an annual income must make a case to the income-tax authorities that portion of it was in respect of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by reason of their profession, Deputies should be compelled to make a similar case.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I submit, Sir, that Deputy Cogan says perfectly clearly there that the allowance is substantially in excess of his out-of-pocket expenses.</P>

That was not suggesting in anyway that it was excessive.  This quibble about salary and allowance has been going on for a long period.</P>

      <P>The expenses paid to a Deputy are intended to cover not only his out-of-pocket expenses but also to give him some remuneration for the time which he gives in the discharge of his duties.  As such it is partly a salary and partly an allowance. Deputy Dillon is annoyed because he cannot get away with the point which he tried to make the last day and tried to ram down my neck, as well as the point which he tried to convey here to-day, namely, that I made a statement and afterwards got it removed from the Official Report by some process.

If they were to receive an allowance only sufficient to cover their out-of-pocket expenses as Deputies, I just wonder how they would exist.  It is because there must be some margin upon which they do exist that portion of their remuneration must be regarded as salary.  Is that not quite clear?

I now realise that the Minister remained silent because he was unable to answer the case which had been put up, and if the Minister chose to sit down and suck his thumbs, instead of replying to the case submitted to him and instead of defending his action in voting against the farmers' interests, <Col N="1618" /> then he was guilty not of insulting farmers or this Party but of an act of gross stupidity.  The same applies to the spokesmen of the Opposition Party who also remained silent with the exception of a grant from Deputy Morrissey.  The same also applies to the Independent Deputies who traipsed into the division lobby behind the strong, silent Minister for Agriculture and voted against the Farmer Deputies.  They failed to defend their attitude to the House and to the country.</P>

      <P>I submit this is an absurd proposal to lay before the House.  Until the main question of whether Deputies' allowances should be exempt from tax is decided, it is foolish and absurd to set up commissions of inquiry to consider what allowance should be paid.  The main question must be settled first.  The privilege which Deputies enjoy at the expense of the rest of the community must be removed.  We can then have commissions of inquiry, if you like, to go into <Col N="1619" /> this question.  My experience of commissions of inquiry into Deputies' allowances and Ministers' salaries invariably has been to recommend increases. That is probably what Deputy Dillon intends to be the result of setting up this particular commission.</P>
      <P>It is absolutely impossible for a commission to decide accurately the legitimate expenses of a Deputy.  Let me take, as an example, some subject which may intimately concern a Deputy.  I might, for instance, take a deep interest in the development of agriculture in other countries and I might consider it necessary to visit those other countries in order to study agricultural conditions, if travelling conditions were normal.  It would be a very difficult question for a commission of inquiry to decide whether trips along those lines by Deputies for the purpose of acquiring knowledge which would, in their opinion, enable them properly to discharge their duties here, would be part of their allowances or expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Not a bit difficult.  The commission would decide that in five minutes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another point in this connection.  Let me take the case of an Independent Deputy.  Suppose an Independent Deputy does not want to be in a futile position for the rest of his life, acting merely as an Independent Deputy in this House. Suppose he wants to build up a Parliamentary Party.  He may feel it is his duty to go to various constituencies, to travel through the country so as to put his views before the people and win support for a nation-wide Party. Would not that Independent Deputy be justified in believing he was adding to his usefulness and effectiveness as a representative of the people and would not the expenses involved appear to be legitimate expenses?</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest all these questions would have to be dealt with by a commission inquiring into Deputies' <Col N="1620" /> allowances.  Suppose again that that Independent Deputy, in order to strengthen his position and to ensure that, after the next election, he would have a Party of ten, 12 or 14 Deputies, decided to establish a newspaper, which would involve him in a considerable expenditure, would he not also be justified in claiming that the expenses were incurred as part of his normal expenses as a Deputy?  I suggest that such expenses could be claimed as legitimate expenses for Deputies and I am making the case that it would be very difficult for a commission of inquiry to ascertain what are a Deputy's actual legitimate expenses.  I am making the case that if we set up a commission of inquiry the inevitable result will be a further increase in Deputies' allowances, and Deputy Dillon can claim whatever credit may be due to him for having brought that about.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I think that it is unjust to every Party and every individual Deputy.  To the extent that Deputy Cogan dealt with this motion, he would not have taken up two minutes of the time of the House. Anybody coming in and listening to him and not knowing what was on the Order Paper would find it impossible to know what particular motion he was talking to.  I should like to remind the House that we are a democracy here, one of the youngest democracies in Europe.  Some of us are old enough to have recollections of Parliaments in other countries prior to the beginning of this century when the principle of making a financial allowance to members of Parliament was first adopted and generally accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1621" /> Prior to the establishment of such a system, democratic Parliaments, so-called democratic, were the private preserve of the immensely wealthy, the landed aristocracy, the highly successful business man and the successful professional man, with an occasional highly-paid Labour leader. The ordinary plain people, the middle-class people and the lower-class people, the middle-class farmer, the middle-class business man, the middle-class professional man, could never put his nose inside the Parliament of any country in Europe.</P>
    <P>Democracy asserted itself and democratic principles began to be generally respected and the system of an allowance to meet the cost of Parliamentary representation was adopted by one Parliament after another.  It is entirely unworthy and entirely un-Irish that the first real challenge to that system in this young democracy, this infant State, should come from people who claim to represent middle-class Irish farmers.  There was a motion before the House suggesting that income-tax should be paid on allowances.  So far as that could be examined superficially, as a theory it would be entirely acceptable and I subscribed verbally to that theory. When you see it submitted to closer examination, you then find that far from having any equality you would have the most absurd and fantastic inequality.  You would have expenses of a kind that would be considered reasonable to a Deputy's position submitted to examination and investigation by a group of highly-trained but narrowly-trained experts who would have no conception of what the ordinary kind of expenses for a Deputy by way of entertainment should be.  Could Deputy Cogan or any Deputy sitting beside him who has any knowledge of income-tax inspectors and the income-tax code understand an inspector who would allow as legitimate expenses to a Deputy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order.  I submit we are not dealing with the motion for the exemption of income-tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making a case for the motion here.  Could anybody visualise a rigid inspector of taxes regarding as legitimate expenditure what would be regarded as normal hospitality or expenditure by a Deputy, say, in touring his constituency and meeting a number of friends after a meeting?  Every one of us incurs out-of-pocket expenses, whether we are teetotallers or otherwise. We must at least treat people who travel long journeys to meet us. No income-tax code would allow that as reasonable expenditure.</P>
      <P>The best speech that I have yet heard against income-tax on Deputies' allowances is the last part of the speech that Deputy Cogan has just made.  Do Deputies think that the most suitable person to decide what travelling is necessary or desirable in fulfilling the functions of a serious-minded Deputy is the income-tax assessor?  As the Deputy rightly put it, that would be a poser for a Parliamentary commission.  It would be an insurmountable obstacle for any income-tax assessor.  We have a motion before us and I would submit to the newer group that have come to this House that, forgetting all the petty wranglings of the past, it is a motion that should be supported to kill for once and for all that despicable direct and indirect propaganda that is degrading this great institution of the State, slandering its members, lowering the status of public representatives and generally sabotaging and sapping the very foundations of this new State.  That is an old technique.  All of us, I say, at some time or other, be it said to our shame, subscribed to that technique.  I remember that it was levelled, as Deputy Cogan said, against the Irish Members of the British Parliament in the past. I remember it being levelled at the first Dáil here, when a great number remained outside.  I saw it used by one generation of farmers' parties against the next generation, the unsuccessful against the successful.  We had wave after wave of that sordid appeal.</P>

      <P>No, it was not.  I said that, to our shame, every one of us, at different periods, engaged in that kind of propaganda.  For once and for all, for the sake of Parliament, and for the sake of the country, let us kill it.  How can it be done? It can be done in a worthy and in a dignified manner by a representative of every single Party, great and small, forming themselves into a Parliamentary committee to decide, taking even Deputy Cogan's view and the views of those opposed to Deputy Cogan, what would be a reasonable allowance for Deputies, and fixing that by common agreement, subscribed to by Labour, by Farmers, small and big, by directly opposed political Parties such as Fine Gael and the Government, and standing over that, shoulder to shoulder, at every cross-roads in the country.  That is the spirit of this motion and if that were done this Parliament would then be a better place to function in and the people outside would have a higher appreciation of Parliament.</P>
      <P>The alternative suggested in the past of making the allowances subject to income-tax on the plea that income-tax levelled all men and treated all men equally was either honestly or ignorantly put forward.  We know that the incomes of Deputies from other sources vary considerably and that if income-tax were applied to Parliamentary allowances some Deputies would pay £400 of their £480 and others would pay nothing out of their £480.  The democratic principle of Parliamentary allowances is that within the portals of Parliament all of us are equal and that whatever is allowed for Parliamentary expenses should be the same to every member.  If this particular motion is agreed to, if it is approached not in an atmosphere of petty squabbling and bickering, but sincerely and boldly, within the framework of the motion there is a method of producing a better Parliament, a more highly respected Parliament, a Parliament within which each Deputy and each Party may understand the other better and, if we have respect for one another, then the people as a whole will have more respect for all of us.</P>

      <P>I wish to correct the statement made by Deputy Cogan that the present allowances are based upon a speedily passed Act of 1925, passed through this House at lightning speed. Deputy Cogan must have a very short memory if he forgets that the present allowance of Deputies in this House is the result of a very careful inquiry, something on the lines suggested by Deputy Dillon in his motion, set up a very few years ago, at which the matter was very carefully considered. Representatives of all Parties tendered evidence and the present figure was arrived at.  Deputy O'Higgins, in his closing remarks, stressed the important point that all Deputies should receive the same allowance.  They do so at the moment.  There was a fixed sum allowed before that inquiry was set up.  There has been a fixed sum since.</P>
      <P>In my view, the most interesting statement made on this motion was the very common-sense, plain and relevant speech of Deputy Anthony, to which I listened with pleasure.  I was so much convinced by the argument put forward by Deputy Anthony that I intend to vote against the motion.  I am definitely voting against the motion because I do not believe for a moment that, well-intentioned as it is, it would have the results that Deputy O'Higgins visualises.  Deputy O'Higgins does not realise the calibre of those who calumniate Deputies of this House if he thinks that the setting-up of a committee of any kind of this House will silence the critics outside.  I think this motion is simply pandering to those elements for which the movers of the motion have nothing but contempt.  I believe an inquiry was held, some few years ago&mdash;I forget the actual date.</P>

      <P>I am aware that very close scrutiny was given to the subject at that time, and I do not see that anything has happened since which would justify re-opening it, or which would warrant the making of a reduction, except that conditions have altered since then which might justify <Col N="1625" /> what Deputy Cogan said, that it might result in further increase.  It could scarcely be considered from the other angle, in view of what Deputies have had to go through since.  The dignified line for the House to take is to say that they have examined the question on an all-Party basis, and have arrived at a sum which will enable a person to come into the House, if his constituents feel that his ability warrants them in selecting him to represent them, irrespective of his status in life. If people can do that, and not be handicapped by lack of finance in the giving of proper service to their constituents, a satisfactory position has been reached. The position which has been reached is one in which the allowance is not over-generous and not too niggardly, and, while I appreciate the motives actuating the mover and seconder, and also Deputy O'Higgins, I think it would be definitely a mistake to pass the motion.  I suggest that, instead of doing so, we should treat the critics with the contempt they deserve.</P>

      <P>There have been some interesting speeches on this motion, short as has been the time, and some not so interesting and not very much to the point.  I think the mover of the motion is largely responsible for some of the bad speeches made, because he showed a bad example by wandering away to a considerable extent from his motion. Where he did deal with his motion, where he stuck to his terms, if I may use that colloquial phrase, I am largely in agreement with him, though I do not propose to accept the motion.  With much of the speech, I think everybody in the House would agree, and, with Deputy Keyes, I believe that the mover had the best of intentions.  The desire was to try to find some way of putting an end once and for all to the talk which has gone on, as Deputy O'Higgins reminded us, too long on this particular subject, and which has not added to the respect for members of this Assembly now or in previous days, or to the respect for the institution itself that should exist amongst our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1626" /> To come down to the motion itself, I do not think it would achieve, or go anywhere near achieving, what the Deputy wishes to achieve.  It would not end the talk about the payments to members and whether they are too great or too little.  It would not end in being fair to all the members of the House, because if, as the Deputy suggests in his motion, an average figure for expenses is arrived at by a committee and made the law of the land, it is bound to be unfair to somebody at one or other end of the scale and the persons who will feel it most will be those who need the allowance most.  They will not be covered, and, if it is an average figure, they may be considerably out of pocket.  Take the people who live in West Cork, Donegal or Kerry.  In view of the distances they have to travel and the length of time they are away from their homes, no matter what average is fixed, they will not be covered in respect of all their expenses, and, therefore, the Deputy will not have achieved what I think he would like to achieve, that is, that all the allowances a Deputy is entitled to by way of expenses should be granted to him by the House.  I think that would be the desire of the House.</P>
    <P>We have had several committees before.  I do not know who it was decided on the original figure in 1922. It may have been a committee of the Provisional Government of the day or a committee of members of the Dáil.</P>

      <P>Later in 1922, when the Saorstát was formally inaugurated, there was a committee.  In 1925 there was a committee, and, in 1937, there was a committee, and Deputy Keyes has reminded us that before the 1937 committee&mdash;and I am sure before the others, or some of them at any rate&mdash; members of all Parties appeared and gave evidence, discussed with the members their difficulties, told of their expenses and of their experiences of what it cost them.  Let me remind the members of the Farmers' Party, and particularly Deputy Cogan, who insisted <Col N="1627" /> that this payment to members is a salary, that the law describes it as an allowance.  Legally, we have no right to call it anything else.  It is an allowance to members, and I can thoroughly agree with Deputy Dillon, from my own experience and my knowledge of my own colleagues who were T.D.s before becoming Ministers and members of our Party&mdash;and I am sure that what applies to the Fianna Fáil Party applies equally to other Parties in the House, or to those members of them who have had long enough experience&mdash;that there is not a man who was ever in the House who did his work honestly and conscientiously as a Deputy who was a penny the richer as a result.</P>
      <P>I am entirely with Deputy O'Higgins that it would be a good thing nationally if this talk were ended, once and for all.  We have had too much of it and I wish to goodness it could be ended once and for all.  This motion will not help to end it.  It will not get us one step nearer putting an end to that discussion.  It probably will bring more fuel to the fire.  That is my honest belief.  Well-intentioned as Deputy Dillon was in putting down the motion and sincere as Deputy Anthony was in seconding it, with the desire to stop this kind of talk which Deputy Cogan and others &mdash;not Deputy Cogan alone but others at other times&mdash;have indulged in, of defaming members of the House and defaming the House itself, dishonouring our national Parliamentary institution and bringing discredit on democracy, for that is what it has resulted in, you will not end it by this motion. If I thought it would end it, I and, I am sure, the Government would be happy to accept it, but I see no hope of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>None of the committees which met in the past succeeded in arriving at a figure which would satisfy everybody. What Deputy O'Higgins said as to the differences in relation to income-tax is quite true.  You would have members of the House, some of whom are blessed with a fair share of this world's goods, paying practically all their allowances out in income-tax, if that <Col N="1628" /> issue were raised.  You would also have those who are wealthy spending a great deal more than others who cannot afford it, and I am entirely with Deputy O'Higgins in saying that the wise course would not be to ask the inspectors of taxes or anybody with that mentality&mdash;the Civil Service mentality&mdash;to decide what should be allowed.  That mentality is bound to be narrow, bound to have regard to the strict letter of the law and to keep inside the strict line.  That would be the Civil Service mentality in a matter of this kind.</P>
    <P>You could not have a Select Committee of the Dáil always in session to examine week by week whether Deputies are entitled to this, that, or the other expense.  You would have to consider the expenses that would be allowed from time to time.  You would have to have the committee probably in constant session and that would not be helpful.  You would have disputes. Who is to settle these disputes? Would they have to be brought before the House?  The idea of fixing an average allowance is not a practicable one and, in my opinion, should not be adopted.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan is quite right in suggesting that it might be put forward as proper expenses, that a man had to go&mdash;I will not say to Paris, or Berlin, or Copenhagen, or touring on the Continent&mdash;but, say, to England and Wales and spend a month or two there visiting farming communities to see how their farms were worked.  It would cost a considerable sum of money and, as a farmer, he might be entitled to ask that that would be allowed as part of his expenses.  I would have been very happy at one time when I was in opposition if, by going to a committee of that kind, I could get allowed for the expense of running a newspaper which I paid for out of my own pocket.  It would have been a considerable saving to me.  According to Deputy Cogan, if his ideas are correct, I might have been entitled to do that, if we had such a body in existence to whom I could go and ask for consideration of that kind.  But I do not think that any such expenses would be allowed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1629" /> The 1929 committee recommended a fixed allowance as the most satisfactory arrangement.  Evidently they went into it fairly fully.  If Deputies look up the report presented to the Dáil they will see the committee recommended a fixed allowance.  Deputy Keyes said: &ldquo;The same for everybody&rdquo;. We are all treated alike.  I hope we are treated with the same respect in this House.  We should be, at any rate.  There should be no difference.  One man should not be able to say: &ldquo;I was allowed £250 for expenses and another man only £100.&rdquo; If this motion were adopted, some Deputies would be able to say: &ldquo;That average that is agreed upon has cost me £100,&rdquo; and another man might say: &ldquo;It has cost me £200 or £250.&rdquo;  There would be differentiation.</P>
    <P>In the 1937 committee report, which I read just before coming in here, I noticed that one thing that they said was: &ldquo;No element of salary is included in the present allowance.&rdquo;  I would commend that to the members of the Farmers' Party for consideration. That committee, after fully examining the matter and hearing Deputies of all Parties&mdash;the Farmers Party were not then in the House&mdash; stated: &ldquo;No element of salary is included in the present allowance&rdquo;&mdash; that was the allowance payable in 1937.</P>
    <P>I think it is a right and proper thing that all reasonable expenses should be allowed.  The sum of £480 may appear a large sum to Deputies who have not long experience.  But anybody who has had even five years experience&mdash; and those who have had ten years' experience will know better&mdash;that the amount that they would have left, after paying expenses in some cases would be a poor salary for any working man.  Of the professional men, the business men, and people of the working classes who have been here, I do not think one of them, as I have already said, is a penny the richer.  Many of them are poorer men as a result of their membership here. If they had devoted their time, ability and energy to work other than the national work that they did for the people's welfare here a great many of them probably would have been richer <Col N="1630" /> men.  This House should not be, as Deputy Dillon said, a preserve for the rich or the well-to-do.  I do not think that I need say any more.  I would commend the eloquent words of Deputy O'Higgins to all the members of the House and the public outside&mdash; that we ought to encourage and promote respect for the elected members of the Oireachtas; that we ought to encourage and promote respect for our Parliamentary institutions.  By doing so we will do honour and credit to ourselves and to our nation, and we will help to preserve democratic institutions in this country and in the world.</P>

      <P>I have listened to the lectures given to the Farmers' Party from all sides of the House to-night. Deputies were told that they should stick to the motion, but even the Minister did not stick to the motion.  You would imagine that because we put down a motion with regard to the payment of income-tax on Deputies' and Senators' salaries, we had done something terrible.  Now Deputy Dillon's motion comes along.  Surely the Minister and Deputies realise that in any walk of life a man is entitled to save himself from income-tax for one reason or another.  If some Deputies would not have to pay income-tax because they are justly entitled to save themselves from it within the Act, that is no reason why they should be blamed. We in this Party are convinced that there is not a particle of honesty in this motion.  We believe that this motion was designed for one purpose only, and that was to discredit the Clann na Talmhan Party and put them in a false position; but I assure the House that that will not happen.  We believe that this motion to set up a committee is intended to increase the salaries of Deputies.  I will quote the words of Deputy Dillon in this House not so very long ago:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If a constituent of mine in Monaghan asked me to work for £480 a year, I would spit in his eye.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Again, when he was moving this motion, he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I want to say deliberately that when this select committee is set <Col N="1631" /> up, if it sends for me to give evidence before it, I shall be constrained to tell it that I lose money as a result of being a member of Dáil Eireann, and that, if I were called upon to lose much more money than I am losing at present, I could not afford to remain a Deputy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Therefore, according to the mover, this motion means an increase in the salaries of the Deputies.  These are the Deputy's words, and he will hardly deny them.  Of course, if Deputy Dillon lives in such an expensive manner&mdash;if, as he said himself on one occasion here, it costs him nearly £1,000 a year to be a member of this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I regret that Deputy Dillon does not use his ability in something constructive, in this House and outside it.  It is a pity he would not do that, as he is certainly a man of ability.  I congratulate him on that, but I say that a motion of this description does not speak very well for him.  He said in the motion: &ldquo;A Deputy, if elected by the people to represent them.&rdquo;  Would he explain what he means by that?  Surely a Deputy must be elected by the people?  Do I take it that he has some thought at the back of his head about setting up some sort of dictatorship? I expected some of the trained legal men here to stand up to-night to deal with that point.</P>

      <P>In regard to the income-tax motion which has brought this about, Deputy Dillon's conscience seems to be pricking him for the fact that he moved into the Lobby to vote against it.  I regret to have to go back to that motion, but it has been brought in by every speaker.  It was a motion to prevent us from being set up, as we were, as a privileged class in this House.  That, and that alone, was the idea behind our motion.  Our motion did not state that Deputies were getting too much or were not getting enough, but it stood for preventing us from being set up as a privileged class. We talked about the foundations of the State and the danger to them. Several Deputies told how they did their best to shake the foundations of this State, by talking about the allowances to Deputies.  That has been dealt with by Deputy O'Higgins and by the Minister.  They even gave us a lecture, saying that we were the people who went out before the mob and said: &ldquo;Look at what those people are doing with their salaries.&rdquo;  We never did that.  We said&mdash;and I repeat it in this House&mdash;&ldquo;The day that you passed an Act which set yourselves up as a privileged class and put you in a position that you could say to the taxpayer: &lsquo;Do as we are telling you and making you do, but do not do as we are doing ourselves,&rsquo; that is the very <Col N="1633" /> day that you shook the foundations of this State.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As regards this motion, we intended to oppose it, as it is just the thin end of the wedge to increase salaries and set up a standard here of the high living of Deputy Dillon's type.  We intend to oppose this and will vote against it.  Our motion was an honest one and we know the way it was treated, and we are voting against this one.</P>
      <P>As I said before, it would certainly be better for this country if Deputy Dillon used his talents otherwise than in adopting these shabby, shoddy tricks, by tabling a motion of this type.  It is a kind of sharp practice and, to a certain extent, it reminds me of the mean, cheap sneers at this Party.  We have come here despite his efforts and despite the efforts of other Parties&mdash;both the Government and the so-called Chief Opposition in this House.  What we have said outside the House we say inside it and let the members of either Party not be trying to save their faces.  Do not try to set yourselves up as a privileged class and then come along to vote for a jack-shaped motion like this.</P>

      <P>Most of the speakers in this debate seem to have travelled slightly away from the motion.  I welcomed the statement recently by the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the need for dignity in connection with our institutions.  I believe that, if our institutions are to survive, we must attach dignity and prestige to everything connected with them.  I similarly welcome the statement of the Tánaiste this evening. Looking back over the years, I would be reassured, however, if we could have an assurance from the Government that dignity, prestige and honour will be accorded to the Oireachtas by a Party not only when in Government, but also when in opposition.  I give the Minister for Industry and Commerce credit for feeling some regret for their line of approach to the institutions of this State when they were in opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this Parliament and the institutions of the State are to be treated with respect, they must be accorded that respect by a Party when in <Col N="1634" /> Government and when in opposition, and by all the Opposition Parties. It is not sufficient to start, when in opposition, a campaign of vilification, abuse and criticism against the reigning Government.  I give this much credit to Fianna Fáil: when they started that campaign they had been separated from the Government of the day by a civil war.  That civil war did engender, and was quite likely to engender, more dislike and, possibly, hatred than the ordinary political activities which ought to be the functions of politicians and of political parties in normal times I believe that Clann na Talmhan, seeing the success which attended the Fianna Fáil tactics in opposition, decided that they would cash in on the same type of cheap propaganda and the same type of cheap abuse.</P>
    <P>I wish to say, speaking from opposition, that I have the same respect for the Government when I am in opposition as I would have if I were over there.  I want, further, to assure Clann na Talmhan that, if I thought that the tactics they adopted were the correct tactics, and if I thought the tactics of abuse and vilification were honourable tactics, so far as furthering political ideals were concerned, I would adopt them and would put them into use, far more eloquently&mdash;I say that without any pride&mdash;than the whole of Clann na Talmhan, with all their eloquence and all their ability.</P>
    <P>But that is not the function of the representatives here.  We are elected to serve the best interests of the community, either as individual independent Deputies or as Deputies in a Party, or as Ministers in Government. It is our function, if we are honest in seeking representation and in seeking the confidence of the electorate, to give of our best according to our lights, no matter what office or position we hold in the House, from the humblest individual Deputy up.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned to Friday, 25th February.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9 p.m. until Thursday, 24th February, 1944, at 3 p.m.</P>
