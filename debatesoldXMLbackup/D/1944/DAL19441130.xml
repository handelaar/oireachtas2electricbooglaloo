      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is aware of the desire of all National Parties in both Eire and Northern Ireland for a conference on the question of Partition, and if it is his intention, as head of the Government, to convene such a conference.</P>

      <P>I do not think that such a conference at the present time could effect anything useful.  It is well known that all Parties here and all Nationalists in the Six Counties ardently desire the restoration of the Six Counties and the unity of the national territory.  The Government has this problem foremost in its mind and any Party having views as to steps that might be taken towards its solution need have no hesitation in conveying them, if it so desires, to the Government.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Shortage of Boots.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he is aware that, despite recent measures taken by him, the shortage of boots is still very acute; and if he intends to take any further steps to remedy the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The measures already taken have resulted in a supply of footwear which represents about two-thirds of the demand, taking account of the non-availability of rubber footwear and rubber soled footwear. There is a shortage, but it cannot correctly be described as acute and in existing conditions it is not possible to overcome it.  There have been no imports of sole leather for a long time and imports of upper leather are relatively insignificant.  Consequently, the footwear manufacturers are almost entirely dependent for leather on the output of our own tanneries and this output is affected by the supply of tanning materials imported from abroad which are not available in normal quantities.  To relieve the position, footwear has been rationed and the output of the factories has <Col N="1188" /> been regulated to ensure that, having regard to the materials available, the maximum quantities of heavy footwear for men and women and of footwear for children will be produced. The situation is kept constantly under review in consultation with all sections of the trade and any practicable measures which can be taken further to relieve the shortage will be adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in many towns in Ireland at present there is not a pair of men's boots to be had and, bearing that fact in mind, will he consider in consultation with the Minister for Defence, relieving boot manufacturers from their obligation to deliver boots on Army contracts for a month or two, until the more acute shortage of heavy boots for civilian wear is in some measure relieved for the winter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Of the total production of heavy boots in this country, not more than 20 per cent. is allocated to the Department of Defence for local defence services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be true, but if 20 per cent. were now released it would greatly mitigate hardship in the case of many men facing the winter without boots.  If the Minister would consider taking that remedial measure, while not meeting the scarcity, it would relieve the situation.  Would the Minister consider that, and consult with members of his own Party as to conditions regarding the supply of boots in the different areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is necessary to keep the Army supplied with boots as well as other sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, but for a couple of months the proposal would relieve the civilian market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy must appreciate that there is a war on and that supplies are scarce.  There is nothing we can do which will result in increased production of leather if the manufacturers have not got it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Electricity Supply Board Coal Allocations.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies why he has allotted coal to the Electricity Supply Board in sufficient quantities to permit of 100 per cent. ration of electricity for consumers, while rural gas undertakings remain so severely rationed in coal as to make it economically impossible for them to maintain a supply of gas for their consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to a similar question on 27th September, 1944, I pointed out that the favourable position of electricity supply as compared with gas supply was due not to the manner in which coal is allocated but to improved conditions on the Shannon.</P>
      <P>These improved conditions have further made it possible, by diversion to the gas industry of coal which would otherwise be required by the Electricity Supply Board, to increase the allocation of coal for rural gas works to 100 per cent. of the pre-war consumption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister now allege that the rural gasworks are getting 100 per cent. of the coal they were getting pre-war?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>One hundred per cent. of the quantity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Bearing in mind the inferior quality, which is no blame to the Minister for Supplies, does he <Col N="1190" /> believe that the gas companies, with the coal they are getting, could increase the ration of gas which they are at present distributing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The gas companies where?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The rural gas companies, notably the gas company in Monaghan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a question I could not answer.  The efficiency of gasworks in different districts varies considerably.  A lot may depend upon the type of equipment available and the skill of the manager.  In some districts, it might be possible that, with better equipment or more efficient management, a larger supply of gas could be made available, but I could not answer the Deputy's question in any general terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that the Electricity Supply Board supplies of coal have been substantially augmented during the last few months since more considerable shipments of coal have become available, whereas no proportionate increase has been made in favour of the rural gas companies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The reverse is the truth.  Because of the abnormally wet weather, it has been possible to divert to the gasworks coal which otherwise would have had to be used by the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And they are getting 100 per cent. in volume of what they were getting pre-war?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Fogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he will be prepared to grant a permit and small petrol allowance to tillage contractors and extensive tillage farmers for small vans or private cars, with a view to facilitating them in their tillage operations and to enable them to transport more quickly supplies of oil, kerosene, spare parts, etc., for their tractors and machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The petrol supply position at the moment precludes the possibility of permitting farmers the use of petrol-driven private cars to facilitate them in their tillage operations. Tillage contractors who own at least two tractors which are engaged whole-time on hire for agricultural work are permitted petrol-driven light commercial vehicles for the purpose of transporting oil and other equipment in connection with the operation of such tractors at various farms.  Extensive tillage farmers are permitted to use petrol-driven lorries for the transport of agricultural produce. Both tillage contractors and farmers may use gas producer-driven private vehicles for personal transport in connection with their business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

The Deputy can make out for himself what the various expenses might be.  As regards the levy, that is definite.

      <P>Mr. McElhinney had been previously employed as a temporary postman and temporary doorkeeper intermittently since 1936 and continuously since 1941.</P>
      <P>Mr. McSherry was employed as a labourer in the Engineering Branch for varying periods in 1937 and in 1938 as a casual worker.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the fact that when officers were previously selected for these duties it was made clear to them that they ought to <Col N="1216" /> have previous experience and be specially trained in these duties before they were considered suitable for assignment? In the present case the Minister admits that two persons who had no experience whatever of the duties, and one of whom he admits was never previously employed, have been selected for assignment to duties over the heads of people with 19 years' previous service.  How can he justify the selection of non-trained persons for these assignments in preference to a person who had a total of 19 years' service?</P>

These men have been performing their duties for five years in a manner with which the Post Office Department is apparently satisfied.

      <P>I propose to take together the Deputy's two questions relative to the Charters estate.  The Land Commission had an inspection made of the lands of Ballydrehid in 1936 and decided to take no action regarding their acquisition at the time. I am unable to say what, if any, action the Land Commission may take in future in this matter.  The Land Commission have not had any inspection made of the lands at Garnavilla (containing only 34 acres) and they have no proceedings for their acquisition.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he intends to abolish the <Col N="1220" /> system of rundale still surviving in the Currane townland, Swinford, County Mayo (Ruttledge estate, Barony of Gallen); if he is aware that these tenants have been awaiting redivision of their holdings for over 20 years, and that the continuance of this system is hindering food production and preventing tenants from taking advantage of the Farm Improvements Schemes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>The townland of Curryaun forms part of the big Ruttledge estate (comprising over 6,000 acres) acquired by the Congested Districts Board.  This estate is most difficult to deal with owing to the amount of congestion and the prevalence of the rundale system therein.  The only way in which land can be acquired for the enlargement and rearrangement of holdings on the estate is by migrating a number of the tenants, but efforts made by the Land Commission in this direction have been hampered by the unwillingness of the tenants to co-operate in proposals for migration and rearrangement and also by emergency conditions.  So far, only two small holdings in the townland of Curryaun have been acquired by migration, but arrangements are contemplated for migrating five further tenants under the Group Migration Scheme as soon as practicable.  The Land Commission are fully alive to the desirability of effecting rearrangement of the rundale holdings on this and similar congested estates, but the difficulties are enormous and delay is inevitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister points out that the difficulty is due to the reluctance of the tenants to take advantage of the migration scheme.  That reluctance is attributable to the excessive rent they have to pay when they go up the country.  Is the Minister not aware that for 20 years both Governments have been promising the tenants redivision of this estate at the earliest possible moment, that the parents of children in the area have to keep them from school in order to mind cattle during the tillage season and that these people cannot take advantage of the farm improvement scheme <Col N="1221" /> and other schemes which they could do if this estate were divided?  Surely, the Minister will take immediate steps to have the estate divided so that the children will not have to be kept from school to engage in watching cattle out in the cold.  I think that this is a scandal.</P>

      <P>I have got here a copy of the question which the Deputy desires to raise as a matter of urgent public importance.  He had the courtesy to give me a copy yesterday, though he wanted no decision till to-day.  The matters on which the Chair has to be satisfied before allowing a question to be raised in the manner requested by Deputy Larkin are (1) that the matter is definite, (2) that it is of public importance, and (3) that it is urgent.  Deputy Larkin's case is, briefly, that he wishes to raise two allied subjects&mdash;the interference by the Gárda authorities with a meeting, or preparation for a meeting, held in Dublin, to prepare a petition for the reprieve of a man under sentence of death and, secondly, the action of the Press Censor in suppressing all newspaper references to the same meeting. I am satisfied that the notice given fulfils the first two requirements&mdash;that the matter is definite and is of public importance.  As regards the third&mdash; and, from the point of view of the Standing Order, the essential&mdash;requirement, namely, that of urgency, I am not satisfied that his notice is one contemplated by the Standing Order.  In this case; the Deputy's notice appears in substance to be censure of administrative action already taken and such censure can, and should, be dealt with, in the ordinary way, by motion after due notice.  Accordingly, I do not consider that the motion is one contemplated by Standing Order 29.</P>

      <P>With all deference and respect for your position, I must hold that your decision is arbitrary.  May I point out that the situation in question is not only of interest to the House as an administrative matter but is one of general public importance, in so far as the <Col N="1223" /> issues I raise affect, and arise out of, a much bigger issue?  The point I want to bring to attention is that, under the Constitution, citizens are granted certain rights.  There has been deliberate interference on the part of the police and the Censor with those rights&mdash;deliberate to the extent that men have been arrested and are still held in jail, deliberate to the extent that not only have notices in the Press been suppressed because of mention of the name of a man now lying under sentence of death, but even notices containing no such references have been prohibited publication in the Press.  Even to-day, a bare notice of an intention to hold a series of Masses between to-night and to-morrow morning has also come under prohibition by the Censor.  My understanding at the time was that those powers were given to the Censor to defend this State against its external enemies and not to interfere with the rights of citizens. Last night, members of this House were forced to protest because they were denied any other opportunity outside this House, except one meeting, of exercising their ordinary, Constitutional rights.  The police are here to support the law and enforce it and not to break the law.  The Censor is here to protect this country and its citizens, and I suggest that these are matters coming under the administration of Ministers and proper to this House.  I suggest that they are urgent matters because they are part of a situation which has led many ordinary citizens to believe that a man under sentence of death is there because&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Within 30 seconds of the bell ceasing, we were excluded from the House.  In my rather long membership of the House it has been the established practice that a minimum of three minutes is allowed after the ringing of the bell for Deputies to enter the House.  I can produce at least three Fianna Fáil Deputies and four other Deputies who were excluded from the House on the ceasing of the bell for the second last division.

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That it is expedient that a tribunal be established for inquiring into the following definite matter of urgent public importance, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>the supply of milk to distributors <Col N="1234" /> and consumers in the area consisting of the county borough of Dublin, the county of Dublin, and the urban district of Bray, including in particular:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) the existing arrangements&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) for securing that such supply is adequate, pure and wholesome,</P>
    <P>(ii) for the economical and efficient marketing and distribution of such supply,</P>
    <P>(iii) for making such supply available to consumers at reasonable prices, and</P>
    <P>(iv) for safeguarding the interests of the persons (including consumers) concerned in such supply, marketing and distribution; and</P>

      <P>(iv) for safeguarding the interests of the persons (including consumers) concerned in such supply, marketing and distribution; and...</P>
      <P>The words &ldquo;marketing and distribution; and&rdquo; were omitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>It is scarcely necessary to explain in detail the purposes of the motion, as its terms are self-explanatory. The facts are that the milk supply in the Dublin area at times is inadequate, particularly in the winter months, and marketing conditions are not satisfactory.  It is considered that distribution is open to better organisation. The condition in which milk is reaching the consumer leaves very much to be desired from the public health point of view, and, in addition, there are complaints as to price. Generally, the position of the Dublin milk supply is entirely unsatisfactory at present, and the setting up of this tribunal, with its extensive powers of inquiry, appears to be the most effective <Col N="1235" /> step we could take to ascertain what improvements in marketing, production, distribution and the standard of cleanliness and wholesomeness of our milk can be brought about.</P>

      <P>Will the question of the fat content of milk be examined by this tribunal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.  That would not ordinarily be a matter for determination by a tribunal such as this.  The fat content of milk is already determined by law and this tribunal may not deal with that matter.  It will deal with the matters set out here: the adequacy, purity and wholesomeness of the supply, the methods of production, distribution and so on, and will recommend such improvements in these various matters as they deem wise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Parliamentary Secretary is taking this step.  In the district in which I live, people have stated that they have seen milk been poured from cans into bottles, cardboard stoppers stuck in the bottles and the bottles then distributed to householders.  That is quite a common thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of the fat content, in summer, milk is supposed to be richer than in winter, but in actual fact consumers never seem to get the benefit of the richer milk in summer.  The milk is thin in winter, but does not seem to get proportionately richer in summer.  Whether this tribunal could examine that matter, I do not know, but it is a fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that would come within the terms of reference of the tribunal, inasmuch as the fat and mineral content of milk is determined by a particular code of law.  If, in fact, the minimum standards of fat prescribed by law are deemed to be too low, it would be a matter for amendment of the Food and Drugs Act.  It is not many years since amendments of the Food and Drugs <Col N="1236" /> Act in relation to milk were before the House and the whole matter of fat content was very fully discussed.  The standards fixed at that time were deemed to be reasonable, taking all factors into consideration.  That is not the purpose of this inquiry&mdash;it is not the primary purpose at least&mdash;and I do not think it is necessary to put the particular onus on this tribunal of examining that particular problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that this is a very proper step to take and I should like to ask whether it is possible to call this tribunal together at a very early date.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary is aware that in certain parts of Dublin at the moment, there is a scarcity of milk and that in some areas people have to travel long distances to get a supply.  In view of that, I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to see to it that this tribunal will hold a meeting at a very early date and examine the position with a view to dealing with this scarcity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give any definite information on that point, inasmuch as its constitution has not yet been <Col N="1237" /> decided, but I would say that the tribunal would consist of not more than five and not less than three persons.  Personally, I think three would probably be sufficient, but I need not enter into that matter as no firm decisions have been reached in regard to it.  So far as the actual personnel is concerned, that, too, is a matter which has yet to be determined, but I should like, if possible, to get as chairman a judge of the High Court.  I think we would need a bacteriologist and then arises the question, if we are to have a tribunal of three, what qualifications the third person should have.  The Deputy mentioned consumers and I can only say in that regard that we are all consumers, so that each member of the tribunal could be held to represent consumers.  The members of the tribunal will not in fact represent any particular interests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we resume consideration of the amendments, I should like to say that I raised a question yesterday with regard to an amendment which I put down on the Committee Stage.  I understood the Parliamentary Secretary to say that, while he might not accept the amendment in the form in which it was put down, he was prepared to bring in an amendment himself to meet it.  The Ceann Comhairle said that he thought the amendment to cover it would come on later.  The amendment was in connection with Section 13.  The Parliamentary Secretary will remember that I moved an amendment providing that no certificate of completion would be issued without the assent of the Minister for Local Government.  That was debated pretty extensively.  The Parliamentary Secretary said he could not accept the word &ldquo;assent&rdquo; but that he would bring in an amendment which would meet it in substance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We have done that.  We have provided for consultation with the Minister for Local Government. That is one of the points you asked us to provide for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it was not.  What you provided for was only a nominal amendment, that the Minister for Local Government would be one of the Ministers consulted.  But the main amendment was that the certificate of completion would not be issued without the assent of the Minister for Local Government.  I argued that the Minister for Local Government was one of the essential Ministers and the matter was pretty extensively debated.  I understood the Parliamentary Secretary to say that, while he would not accept the word &ldquo;assent&rdquo;, he was <Col N="1242" /> prepared to bring in an amendment himself.</P>

      <P>I do not think I was so kindly disposed to that amendment as all that.  I cannot imagine my being so kindly disposed to it as even to say that I was prepared to consider it.  I think that I opposed that very vehemently, in fact.  I pointed out quite clearly that we could not, of course, leave to the decision of the Minister for Local Government the question of when a scheme is completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary argued that he could not accept the word &ldquo;assent&rdquo;.  It was on that word that the difficulty arose.  I am almost certain that he promised he would bring in an amendment himself.</P>
      <P>Debate resumed on amendment No.24.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>We were discussing amendment No. 24 last night and the Parliamentary Secretary informed us that it was intended, as a matter of fact, to give greater discretion to the county councils concerned in the two schemes mentioned in the amendment for the purpose of increasing the amount provided for maintenance.  I feel rather uneasy about the amendment, because the Parliamentary Secretary is aware, of course, that for some time past there has been an agitation on foot for the purpose of getting the Board of Works to spend a substantial sum of money in putting the Owenmore river in a proper condition. According to the county council's engineer, it would require a major drainage scheme to put the Owenmore river in a suitable condition. For that reason, I feel that the county council may be saddled with a very heavy liability in the future after the transfer Order is issued under Section 37 of this Bill.  The county council may find themselves saddled with such a heavy liability that the rates may be strained to the utmost to meet it.  As Section 22 stands at present, the county council is safeguarded, because, of course, they cannot exceed the sum of £500 provided <Col N="1243" /> for in the Owenmore Act for the maintenance of the river.  By taking away that safeguard the floodgates are left open and the county council may find themselves in such a position in the coming years that they will have to face an enormous demand from the Board of Works.  I want, if possible, to safeguard the county council and the ratepayers of the county generally against such a possibility.  The same thing applies to the county councils concerned under the Barrow Drainage Act.  Of course, I am concerned chiefly with the rivers in my own constituency and with the ratepayers in my own constituency.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary indicated that the amendment was introduced for the purpose of facilitating the county councils, enabling them to spend more than £500 if they considered it was necessary to do so, in order that the river would be adequately and properly maintained. But there is the danger which I indicated, that if the law is amended in the manner in which the Parliamentary Secretary wants to amend it, the county council and the ratepayers in Sligo may find themselves faced with heavy demands in future years, demands that will impose such a strain on the rates that they will not be able to meet them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Roddy points out that the Parliamentary Secretary has informed the House that the amendment was introduced for the purpose of allowing the local authorities to spend more if they considered it necessary to do so.  I think he should have gone further and said that under Section 29 they may be compelled to spend a lot more than they feel it is necessary to spend, and they have no right to appeal to any court. That is the difficulty I see about this matter.  While it may be necessary and wise to spend money on the maintenance of drainage works, the local authorities, if they feel they are suffering under a grievance, will be denied the right of appeal to any court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we give that power to a Department <Col N="1244" /> of State, it may be abused.  For instance, there might be an acute unemployment problem to be solved and extraordinary powers of this sort might be used to put men on maintenance work.  That will be charged up against local authorities.  As the law stands, there is a limit to the amount of money that can be raised for maintenance work.  The moment we remove that we are entering the danger area.  We are being asked here to trust the drainage authority absolutely as to the amount of money that is to be spent in the future.  The local authority will have no say.  Even before the transfer Order operates, if the drainage authority decides that drainage is not being kept in a proper state of maintenance, they can compel the local authority to spend more. Once the transfer Order operates and it becomes the responsibility of the commissioners to maintain the work, they can spend whatever they think necessary and present a bill to the local authority and the local authority must pay.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary ought to give the House some assurance on that matter.  It is difficult to put a limitation on the maximum amount that could be raised for a particular purpose.  We are simply handing over absolute control to the commissioners and they are to be the final arbiters in the matter.  The whole scheme is very drastic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any reason for the fears to which expression has been given in so far as the operation of this amendment or the section to which Deputy Hughes has referred is concerned.  This amendment was introduced with the object that I have already explained. There is no subtle plan; there will be no question of taking advantage of anyone, nor could advantage be taken of the amendment to do any of the things Deputy Roddy stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is wrong there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me explain.  Any <Col N="1245" /> person knows what it means to maintain a river.  There is no question of deepening the channel or widening the channel.  It is a matter of removing anything from the channel that is obstructing the flow of water and keeping the district in a condition similar to the condition in which it was at the time it was constituted and the scheme carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not stated in Section 29.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody knows that is maintenance, and what I am proposing here is that to the extent that it might in any one year be found impossible to maintain the Owenmore at the figure specified in the Act of 1926, the local authority charged with the responsibility of maintaining that river should have power to increase that amount if it found it was necessary to do so.</P>
      <P>In the case of the Barrow, the estimated annual value of the land that has been drained by the Barrow scheme is somewhere in the neighbourhood of £6,200.  The House is aware, and Deputies from that area are aware, of the method by which the maintenance was financed.  They are aware also of the new method that is proposed here and they are aware that the rough estimate given as necessary for the maintenance of the Barrow was in the neighbourhood of £6,500.  We have some doubt as to whether or not the county councils concerned would be limited to a sum of £6,217, and we are anxious to ensure that these local bodies will have power to increase that amount from the flat rate, if necessary, in order to ensure that the works handed over to them will be kept in a proper condition.  That is all we are asking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea of the new works that Deputy Roddy talked about, new works that, on the advice of local engineers, might be necessary to make a 100 per cent. job of the River Owenmore, and the idea of using this amendment for the purpose of slipping the responsibility for such a problem over on the ratepayers of Sligo could never materialise.  Naturally, I have <Col N="1246" /> tried to get my mind clear as to what powers this gives us.  I know it does not give us the powers that are feared by the Deputy.  It really means nothing more than enabling the local authorities concerned to maintain these rivers up to the standard at which they were handed over when the districts were constituted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has not attempted to answer our point at all.  We understand, of course, what he is at: that he wants to increase his power to raise and spend money on maintenance, and, if necessary, to go outside the limits set by the original Acts.  Our point is that the moment that limitation is removed the door will be opened wide for the expenditure of any sum of money.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>What, in your opinion, does it mean?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that you can spend a good deal of money, and that it could be argued that it was still money that was being spent under the head of maintenance.  You could spend money not merely on removing the silting up that may occur in the bed of a river but on the trimming of the edges of a river and on all sorts of things.  Work of that kind would still be described as maintenance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it is maintenance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The degree of maintenance that is necessary and economic from the point of view of the ratepayer is the thing that we are worried about. The Parliamentary Secretary has not attempted to answer that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

      <P>Whenever in an existing drainage district there were outstanding on the 1st day of April, 1943, any arrears in respect of the drainage rate levied in such district on the owners or occupiers of benefited land, such arrears shall on the passing of this Act be funded in accordance with regulations made by the Minister, and the Minister is hereby authorised to make such regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is generally recognised that a great deal of dissatisfaction prevails in certain parts of the country subsequent to the carrying out of certain drainage work.  We know that there were certain land owners who did not <Col N="1248" /> pay the rates owing to this dissatisfaction. I do not think it is unreasonable to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to make provision that those arrears should be funded in the same way that the arrears of land annuities were funded in order to bring about a happy atmosphere and get the co-operation of all the people.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 29:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 16, at the end of Section 23 (2), to add a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(h) until such time as the Commissioners have put into repair drainage works and embankments transferred to county councils under this section, and have issued certificates of such repair, no county council shall be held responsible at law for damages arising from the present condition of such drainage works or embankments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Committee Stage I pointed out the necessity for a provision of this kind to save local authorities.  I am still more convinced of the necessity for it when I turn to Section 29. Despite any undertaking that has been given by the Parliamentary Secretary, the commissioners are taking compulsory powers in Section 29 to notify a county council that maintenance work is necessary.  If the local authority fail to do it the commissioners, who are subject to no authority but their own, can go in and incur any expenditure that they think fit.  The cost will fall on the local rates.  I had interviews with the Department about the embankment at Youghal.  I am informed now that it is about 50 per cent. in the urban area and 50 per cent. in the country area.  The embankment is in a precarious state.  Added to that there are tenants who have drainage rights into the River Blackwater.  Those rights were rigidly adhered to when the place was occupied by the late owner.  The land was subsequently sub-divided and is now in the hands of tenants who have not the necessary means to keep the drains open.  Within <Col N="1250" /> the last two years legal proceedings were instituted against the Land Commission, when it was discovered that the Land Commission had no authority. The matter really rested with trustees whose funds were not capable of doing the work.  If these works were to be transferred to the local authority in their present condition, then the liability for repairs would fall on it. There are people living behind the works who have rights which can be maintained in law.  It is with the object of safeguarding the local rates from this unexpected or, I might say, unapproximated expenditure that I am moving the amendment.  I rather deplore the provision in the Bill which transfers funds in the hands of trustees to the Treasury while it hands over the liability for maintaining the embankments in their present position to the local authority.  The Parliamentary Secretary said that the amount involved by those trustee funds was small.  That is all the more reason why he should not bother with them.  If the amount were substantial, if it were like the teachers' fund, a matter of a couple of millions, it would be of some advantage to the Exchequer and there might be some justification for treating it in this way but I see no justification for dealing in this fashion with amounts which are admitted not to be very substantial.  However, I am not very much concerned with those points. With the principle of the Bill, I am in entire agreement.  I do not wish to do or say anything which would in any way impede the Ministry in giving full effect to the Bill.  I have long maintained that it is far better for us to do all that is possible with the land we have so as to bring it to a high pitch of productivity than go in for schemes of land reclamation from the sea.  But I do not allow my anxiety for giving the Bill effect to blind me to its obvious defects from the point of view of the ratepayers.  You are handing over to the local authority these drainage works and these banks with a certificate that they are to be maintained in their &ldquo;present condition.&rdquo;  It will be extremely hard to define that. Section 29 of the Bill completely repudiates all these undertakings and places on the local authorities responsibility <Col N="1251" /> for the maintenance of the works in what is described in the certificate as their &ldquo;present condition.&rdquo;  I am sure that there is a mental reservation even in the Department in that regard. I am sure there is a suspicion that, now that they have a recognised authority against whom they may proceed, plenty of people will deliberately allow certain things to occur&mdash;I shall not say maliciously.  They will now have a mark for damages.  This should be the best Bill for the legal profession that ever came before this House.  It will lead to contentious problems all over the country.  In the interest of the ratepayers, I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to accept this added sub-section (amendment read).  I am afraid that the courts will have numerous opportunities of levying on the ratepayers for damages arising under the Bill.  I acknowledge the Parliamentary Secretary's local interest regarding this matter.  I have been informed that he has already taken action to have a report made on this question of the embankment.  In replying, all I ask him to do is to state that he has no intention of creating a situation in which the local authority will be liable for consequential damages under this Bill, provided they carry out their obligations, without engaging in repair work.  A statement of that kind would give us a reasonable safeguard and I am aware that the Parliamentary Secretary will get a report on the position.  The Parliamentary Secretary admits that this is a special case and I concede that it is a very involved case in which any effort on the part of the House to safeguard the local authority will hardly succeed. The only chance of success I can see is by acceptance of the sub-section I have submitted.  Neither the Parliamentary Secretary nor any of his advisers can foresee what action will be taken.  Nobody can foretell what view the courts will take.  Certain persons may have had claims up to now but there was no authority of sufficient substance whom they could make liable.  Once the local authority comes into the picture, it will be a different matter.  If Deputies turn to Section 29, I think they will admit that common-sense <Col N="1252" /> and justice demand that, for the protection of the ratepayers, a sub-section such as that which I propose should be inserted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of Deputy Broderick's amendment is to protect the local authority, particularly against consequential damages.  The Parliamentary Secretary admitted, when the Bill was in Committee, that the problem with which Deputy Broderick is so much concerned might be a very serious one for the local authority. The Parliamentary Secretary should try to meet the Deputy on this matter. A very serious financial burden might be placed on the local authority, particularly in relation to this embankment. No matter what the Parliamentary Secretary may say by way of reassurance regarding maintenance, we must have regard for the Bill. Section 23 (2) (e) states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No council or councils jointly shall be obliged by this sub-section to maintain any existing drainage works in a condition... better than the condition... in which such works were at the time of the last inspection by the commissioners.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That appears to be all right, but Section 29 states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whenever, after the appointed day, the commissioners are of opinion that any existing drainage works which are for the time being maintainable by the council of a county or the councils of two or more counties are not being properly maintained and that maintenance or repair work is immediately necessary....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Repair work is definitely brought in there and that might mean more than maintenance.  On amendment No. 24, the Parliamentary Secretary argued that &ldquo;maintenance&rdquo; meant merely maintenance and that it could not be extended.  He contended that the section could not put any responsibility on the local authority to maintain the works in a better condition than they were when they received them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1253" /> Now, maintenance or repair work, under Section 29, might mean very much more than just the repair of an embankment, particularly when the embankment concerned was in a very bad state of repair.  According to Section 29, whenever the commissioners are of opinion that any existing drainage works which are for the time being maintainable by the council of a county are not being properly maintained, and that maintenance or repair work is immediately necessary in respect of the existing drainage works, the commissioners can enter on these drainage works and execute or complete them, as the case may be, and, if they do so, the burden is then put upon the local authority, and they can force the local authority to undertake the work.  That might impose a very serious burden on a local authority in some cases, but particularly it would impose a very heavy burden on the local authority in the case of the Youghal district, in regard to which the Parliamentary Secretary, I think, has admitted that there might be very considerable consequential damages.  Surely, therefore, Deputy Broderick is not asking for too much in raising this question of the financing of such schemes under a national drainage scheme, particularly in view of the fact that the whole basis of the scheme is that, after the central authority carries out the work, generally, the local authority will have to maintain the work, and that any improvement work will be a national charge.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that, under Section 38 of the Bill, the central drainage authority will be enabled to compel the local authority to go outside that and undertake improvement and maintenance work, and to pay for it, and the local authority may not know what is its duty in that respect.  I am afraid that the local authority may be put into the position that it will have no court of appeal of any sort, in the case of such things happening, although it was suggested by the Drainage Commission that such an appeal board should be set up.  We have pressed on the Parliamentary <Col N="1254" /> Secretary that point of having an appeal board, but he is adamant on that question.  In my opinion, it is absolutely essential to have some board of appeal, and surely Deputy Broderick is entitled to press that point.  If the wording in Deputy Broderick's amendment is not correct, surely that is only a matter of drafting, and surely some such section should be inserted in the Bill to provide protection for a local authority in such cases.  I think Deputy Broderick said that there is a probability that these local authorities may be mulcted in heavy damages as a result of this, and I suggest that, unless some such amendment as this is accepted, it will have to be embodied in legislation.  At any rate, there should be some form of protection put into the Bill if the local authorities are to be safeguarded from any possibility of being mulcted in unreasonable financial losses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that I cannot go any further to meet Deputy Broderick than I have gone already, as I explained on the Committee Stage of the Bill.  There may be, as the Deputy has quite rightly stated, certain difficulties in regard to particular areas, such as the Youghal district, but in a short space of time we will know to what extent the problem of the Youghal drainage district has in it all the dangers to which the Deputy has referred.  We expect to have a report as to its present condition in a week or two, but, anyhow, in the case of the district concerned, the local authority will have to take it over just the same as all other districts, and we cannot make an exception of the Youghal district.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, we shall know more about that when we have got a report from the people who are examining it, and I think that it will not be beyond the power of the local authority and of the drainage authority, if it should prove that this <Col N="1255" /> is an enormously difficult district, to contend with it.  If, for instance, any of the difficulties to which Deputy Broderick has referred should arise, I am sure that the drainage authority would be reasonable enough to appreciate such difficulties as might arise, and, as I have already suggested, I do not think that these difficulties will be incapable of solution. I do not wish to be taken as resisting the principle of this amendment, but I find it impossible to set out the Youghal district as an exceptional case.  We do feel that it is a district that is in a different position from many others, and we are taking steps in regard to it, of which, I am sure, the Deputy himself is aware.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary for his sympathetic consideration of this matter and for his agreement on the point that this is a special case for consideration, but I also have a duty to the responsible authority, which, in the last resort, is the ratepayers, and I fear that no matter how sympathetic the Parliamentary Secretary may be with the case I have made, if this amendment is not accepted, the result of the passing of this Bill will be endless litigation.  I do not wish to go back on the case of the Youghal district, but until such disabilities as I have pointed out are removed, in regard to such county charges or county-at-large charges, I cannot see how there can be any general application of the scheme to the entire country, when you have a general scheme which is supposed to apply to the whole country and when you have also this business of a local authority being compelled to keep such works in repair and maintenance without knowing what is their duty in that regard, and having no method of appeal.  You have certain safeguards provided under Section 23 of the Bill, but then you find that these safeguards are swept away under Section 29, because the latter section makes it mandatory upon the local authority to undertake maintenance and upkeep work without any regard to the question of who is to pay for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamJosephBroderi" hpid="Mr. Broderick Mr. Broderick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>If you read Section 29, you will find that it says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whenever, after the appointed day, the commissioners are of opinion that any existing drainage works which are for the time being maintainable by the council of a county or the councils of two or more counties are not being properly maintained and that maintenance or repair work is immediately necessary in respect of the said existing drainage works, it shall be lawful for the commissioners to serve by post on such council or each of such councils a notice&mdash;in this section referred to as a notice of disrepair&mdash;stating that in the opinion of the commissioners the maintenance or repair work specified in that behalf in such notice is immediately necessary in respect of the said existing drainage works and requiring such council or councils to execute the said maintenance or repair work within a time specified in that behalf in such notice.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Failing the county council doing that, the Board of Works are entitled to go in.  There is no reference to the sympathetic treatment of Section 23. That section is completely mandatory and the county council is compelled either to maintain or repair at the will of the drainage board of the Board of Works in respect of any position in which the work is handed over.  That is the governing section of the Bill.  It is mandatory on local authorities and, without hesitation, I say that the only safeguard is the amendment which I have suggested.  If you read the section, there is no reference at all to Section 23, nor is there any reference to the sympathetic statements of the Minister or of his considering the difficulties of local authorities.  I see no safeguard other than the amendment I propose.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 34:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 19, Section 29 (1), line 11, to delete the words &ldquo;properly maintained&rdquo; and substitute therefor the following words &ldquo;maintained in a condition or state of repair equal to the condition or state of repair in which such works were on the appointed day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an amendment to Section 29, which I feel is rather contradictory of Section 23.  The drainage authority would have power to compel the local authority to do maintenance work, if <Col N="1261" /> the drainage authority decides that the works are not being properly maintained and that maintenance or repair work is immediately necessary.  &ldquo;Properly maintained&rdquo; is something different altogether from what is set out in Section 23.  I suggest in this amendment that we put in the words:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;maintained in a condition or state of repair equal to the condition or state of repair in which such works were on the appointed day&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am only asking the Parliamentary Secretary to be consistent in that respect, and to prevent any ambiguity arising owing to the way in which the section is drafted at the present time. I would refer the Parliamentary Secretary to Section 23 (2) (e).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I must say that the Deputy has given expression to fears for which there is no justification whatever.  At the moment there are a number of districts maintainable by county councils.  Even before the introduction of this Bill, the legal obligation on those local bodies was to maintain those districts in a proper condition.  Now, they are only being asked to continue to maintain those districts in a proper condition.  Deputy Hughes attempts to make the point that immediately on the transfer of those other districts which are in the hands of boards of trustees and drainage boards the protection that is afforded to local authorities under Section 23 will be wiped out by Section 29.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by those who ought to know that the protection that will be afforded to the local authority will be the protection that is afforded to that authority under Section 23.  That being so, I do not see why there can be all this talk about the injustices that can be done.  No <Col N="1262" /> injustices can be done.  In respect of districts that are now in the hands of local bodies, the local bodies are legally bound to maintain them in a proper condition and state of repair. In respect of the districts that will be transferred to them on the appointed day, they are being called upon to maintain them in a proper state of repair also, subject to the provisions of Section 23.</P>

      <P>What is the use of trying <Col N="1263" /> to reconstruct and misrepresent? I say now that before this Bill was introduced there are districts in respect of which the county councils are legally responsible for maintaining them in a proper condition.  It is possible, of course, that they have not been discharging their legal obligations.  Not only is it possible, but it is a fact that in many cases they have not. What I say is that there is nothing here that seeks to make their obligations greater than they are already in relation to those districts and, to the extent that we will on the appointed day transfer to them further districts, then they will be called upon to maintain these districts in the manner set out in Section 23.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary resisted the very reasonable amendment proposed by Deputy Broderick which asked that a county council would not be held responsible for damages due to the handing over to them of embankments and drainage works in an unreasonable state of repair.  The Parliamentary Secretary defeated that amendment by a majority of the House.  Now, we are asked to agree with him in saying that this is an unreasonable proposition by Deputy Hughes.  It means the Parliamentary Secretary wants to have it both ways and he is completely overriding the rights of public authorities.  Does he want to override the public authorities in the country who are elected to represent the ratepayers?  He is a member, or an ex-member, of a drainage board and a member of a county council.  Deputy Broderick is one of the most respected members of this House and an authority on the question of local government and his amendment has been turned down by the machinery of the Parliamentary Secretary.  Now we find the Parliamentary Secretary arguing against this proposition of Deputy Hughes.  It simply means that the Board of Works will hand over to the county councils works in any state of repair they like. We had the notable case of the Mulkear discussed in this House.  At the moment the banks are broken and hay and agricultural produce are being <Col N="1264" /> swept down into the Shannon.  That can be proved by anyone who goes to investigate.  But we must take them over, and they must be held to be in a reasonable state of repair and the Board of Works can come along and say to us at any time that we must maintain them in the condition of repair that they consider to be right. Why should not the commissioners have the responsibility of giving us the works in a reasonable state of repair? Surely the law ought to operate equitably and fairly as between a Government Department and a county council. A Government Department has no right to claim a privileged position because it is the Board of Works. I think it is a perfectly fair proposition. Eventually, it is all going to come from the ratepayers' pockets, whether of Limerick, Cavan or Carlow.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with a Department, and I regret very much that the Parliamentary Secretary, who made a big study of his job since he came into it, has seen fit to adopt the attitude of carrying on the very worst traditions of the Board of Works.  A more reactionary attitude one could not expect from his predecessors than he has taken up on this Bill.  How does he reconcile his rejection of Deputy Broderick's amendment and this one? We are told we must accept anything the Board of Works say is right.  On the other hand, we will have to satisfy them that we are maintaining these drainage works in a reasonable state of repair.  Give us the works in a reasonable state of repair and we will maintain them, but we should not be asked, as a result of the ineptitude of your engineers, to accept the responsibility of getting them into a required condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment and I support it as forcibly as I can.  The Parliamentary Secretary all through this Bill has taken up the attitude that the commissioners ought to be supreme in every way.  In fact, we are asked to give them more complete powers than I can recollect <Col N="1265" /> being given to any body under any Bill introduced since I became a member of the Legislature.  As Deputy Hughes and Deputy Keyes have argued, Section 29 cuts right across Section 23. We were given some safeguards for the ratepayers under Section 23.  Apparently the Parliamentary Secretary is determined that the ratepayers will have as few rights as possible and that whatever rights they have are to be subject to the commissioners.</P>
      <P>It would perhaps be wrong to say that the Minister deliberately cut out any authority representing local boards, but the Bill, as introduced, cut out the Minister for Local Government. There was a necessity to consult that Minister and other Ministers, but when it came to what purported to be completion of a scheme, the certificate of completion could be issued without any reference to that Minister as representing local councils and the ratepayers.  Section 29 maintains that the Commissioners of Public Works can, at any time, say to a local council that such and such a river was not being properly maintained, and that they proposed taking charge of it. Deputy Keyes referred to what happened in Limerick.  The position there is bad.  Deputy Keyes and I argued on the Committee Stage that, as a result, the local councils refused to take over a local river on the grounds that it had not been properly maintained. The contention of the Board of Works has been that work on the river was properly finished when Limerick County Council was asked to take it over.  The people of County Limerick were compelled to take over the river notwithstanding the fact that they got a legal decision, and a judge's verdict, in favour of their contention that the work was not completed. Nevertheless, in this Bill, if the Commissioners of Public Works say that the work is completed that decision has to be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, under Section 29, penalties may be imposed, in defiance of the judge's verdict.  I do not know if Deputies realise what the conditions are in County Limerick.  A large part of the county is flooded for miles, <Col N="1266" /> potatoes and crops have been washed away, and cattle isolated from farms, yet the Board of Works say that work on the river that is responsible for the floods has been completed, and they are compelling the county council to take it over, despite a judge's decision to the contrary.  What is going to be the position of the county council in four years' time when the Board of Works has finally passed on everything to the council?  Engineers may come down and say that the river is in a bad condition and that if it is not attended to the Board of Works will do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter will then be referred to the county council, the Board of Works will complete the job and present the bill.  Deputy Hughes is making an effort to avoid that position, but no matter what effort he makes the Board of Works will get over it.  I am going to back Deputy Hughes and I only wish that we had stronger backers in the interests of the ratepayers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have stated more than once during these discussions that the protection afforded to local authorities in relation to districts that will be handed over to them on the appointed day is carried over by this section.  I say further that the effect of what Deputy Hughes seeks, if the amendment were accepted, would be to release local authorities from the legal obligation they have now of maintaining <Col N="1267" /> districts that have been in their charge for a number of years in a proper state of repair.  Is that what the Deputy wants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>We are accepting the position that there is a bad condition of affairs as far as drainage is concerned, but the country has the impression that this arterial drainage work would correct that situation and develop drainage generally, and that local authorities would be bound to maintain such work after it was put into proper condition.  I am all for that.  Let local authorities be compelled to maintain drainage once the work is in a suitable condition for maintenance, but any improvements should be a State charge.  This section compels local authorities to do important work.  We were given the impression that any improvement works carried out were to be a State charge.  Apparently it is to be no such thing.  Once Section 29 operates it means that the drainage authority can compel local authorities to put local works into a proper state of maintenance and if that is not done according to the ideas of the Board of Works they can put them into proper maintenance and send the bill to the local authorities.  I want to see maintenance work properly done when local authorities are compelled to take it over.  There is no use in trying to blind the public and the House about what is going to occur. Local authorities are going to be compelled to improve works that are not now in a proper condition.  I want the work done but I want it to be done as a State charge.  That is where I disagree with the Parliamentary Secretary. I have studied the Bill carefully.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary suggests that there is a liability on county councils for works that have not been properly maintained, and that they are entitled to do the necessary work now.  Will he deny that works that were under their control are not in a suitable condition, but <Col N="1268" /> have been imposed on the county council in defiance of a High Court decision?  These works are not in a sound condition because the banks of a local river are broken and land flooded. The Board of Works was responsible for the work and as they are now handing it over to the county council they should put it into proper condition.  If the position was good enough for the Board of Works yesterday it should be good enough for the local authorities to-morrow.  Why impose liability for proper maintenance when the Board of Works did not do that?  That is a new liability.  I am talking of a specific case where the Board of Works failed dismally, and wasted the money of the State as well as Limerick County Council and the ratepayers without making a decent job of the scheme.  As the amendment moved by Deputy Hughes is being resisted, local authorities may be told that engineers will be sent down and more expense incurred.  There were better engineers available but their advice was not listened to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Board of Works is the only court of appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is pleaded by the Parliamentary Secretary, in defence of Section 29, that the phrase &ldquo;properly maintained&rdquo; is essential in order to ensure that county councils will discharge the functions which at present devolve upon them.  It is urged by Deputy Hughes in favour of the amendment that the Board of Works or the commissioners may hand over to a county council for maintenance a drainage scheme which may be in an indifferent condition, and that, subsequently, the Board of Works may send an inspector to look at the works, now under the jurisdiction of the county council, and may say: &ldquo;That work, in our opinion, is not properly maintained.&rdquo;  If the county council does not then conform to the standard of maintenance required by the Board of Works or the commissioners, the board may have the work carried out and send the bill to the county council, and the ratepayers will have the pleasure of paying it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment seems to me to seek <Col N="1269" /> to establish a condition in which, so far as the county council is concerned, its liability properly to maintain a drainage work is that it should maintain it in a condition or state of repair equal to that in which the work was on the appointed day.  In other words, it seeks to provide that a drainage scheme for the purpose of the section shall be deemed to be properly maintained, if it is maintained in a condition or state of repair equal to that in which it was when handed over.  Is there any difficulty in the Parliamentary Secretary stating, by means of a definition of &ldquo;properly maintained&rdquo; in Section 29, that while leaving the existing liability of the county council to have these schemes properly maintained, for the purpose of ascertaining whether the work is properly maintained in the case of a drainage work transferred to a county council, &ldquo;properly maintained&rdquo; will be complied with if it is maintained in the condition or state of repair in which it was when handed over?  That will ensure, in any case, that a county council will not be obliged to maintain at its expense a drainage work in a better condition or state of repair than the work was in when it was handed over.  It gives the Parliamentary Secretary all the safeguards he wants.  It continues the present liability of the county council in the phrase &ldquo;properly maintained&rdquo; in respect of old drainage works.  In respect of new drainage works assigned to the county council, it accepts that &ldquo;properly maintained&rdquo; means their maintenance in the condition in which they were when handed over.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us get a clear idea with regard to what is aimed at. County councils at this moment are responsible according to law for the maintenance of a number of districts created under the 1925 and other Acts. They are legally responsible at this <Col N="1270" /> moment for their proper maintenance and the words properly maintained here are the words used in the existing laws. Deputy Hughes asks me in this amendment to do something which would relieve the county councils of the duty of properly maintaining these districts in future.  He maintains that he is not asking me to take any retrograde step. He wants districts properly maintained and he wants everything done properly, but, at the same time, he urges me to accept an amendment which will have the effect of relieving local authorities of the duty placed on them by previous Acts.  I have made the position quite clear.  The position is (1) there is nothing in this section which imposes on local authorities any greater burden than is already on their shoulders in relation to districts which are already in their charge for maintenance purposes, and (2) there is nothing in the section which compels local authorities to maintain districts which will be transferred to them on the appointed day in a condition better than that in which they were on the day of that transfer.  I do not think anybody could seek any more.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because we have no responsibility for inspecting districts already in their charge.  We will only inspect those districts which are at this moment in the charge of trustees or boards, but there are, as I have said, a number of districts already in the hands of local authorities for the proper maintenance of which the local authorities are at this moment legally responsible.  We have no occasion to inspect these at all, because they are legally bound to maintain them in a proper state of repair. Deputy Hughes asks me to insert an amendment which would have the effect of relieving these local authorities of the duty of maintaining properly districts constructed under the Act of 1925 and other Acts.</P>

      <P>I see what the Deputy means now.  I took me a long time to grasp it.  The Deputy does want to relieve the local authorities of their legal responsibility.  He wants these districts properly maintained and he says that, though councils have had that responsibility, they have not discharged it, and he wants to insert an amendment which will relieve them of it now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>The county council ought to shoulder a responsibility which was theirs for maintenance, but the point on which we differ is in relation to a works under construction by the Board of Works, which is handed over to a county council.  It cannot be said that the local authority should then be responsible.  In the case I am dealing with, it had not been handed over.  They purported to hand it over, but it is not handed over until this Bill becomes an Act, and, by the vote <Col N="1272" /> of this House, the decision of the High Court upset.  It is only then that the county council can be held responsible for the Mulkear and Cappamore drainage scheme.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary specifically whether he will be entitled, under Section 29, to say that the banks are not in a proper state of repair according to his definition and whether we are to be liable for damage to that bank and responsible to the people who will suffer and are suffering?  Are we in the category originally mentioned by him or in the second class?  Will the Parliamentary Secretary say that the works, as they give them to us on the appointed day, are in a reasonable state of repair and that we must keep them in that state, or are we to be responsible for the condition in which the Board of Works did not put them?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>He is silent because he has no answer to the case made by Deputy Keyes.  Once the Bill is passed, the Limerick County Council is put in the position that they are liable for the maintenance, as an existing drainage work, of the Mulkear scheme.  The Parliamentary Secretary argues that it is one of the things that does not apply.  He said further that there is no added liability put on any council or anybody.  I say that the Parliamentary Secretary is not sticking to the facts.  The contention of the Limerick County Council was that they would not take over the drainage scheme, but the Parliamentary Secretary upset that.  The position of the Limerick County Council at the moment is that the Parliamentary Secretary says: &ldquo;No matter what judges, engineers or anyone else may say, we say it is a complete scheme. We undertook the job and we finished it.  It is in a good and proper condition and is complete and you will take it over&rdquo;.  Once the Bill is passed, the Limerick County Council have to take over the scheme when, as Deputy Keyes and I know, and every honest Fianna Fáil Deputy living within 20 miles of Limerick knows the scheme is in anything but a complete <Col N="1273" /> condition.  We have to assume, according to the Parliamentary Secretary, that everything in connection with the scheme is splendid.  The Parliamentary Secretary can hand it over next week after the Bill is passed or can wait for 12 or 15 months until the agitation dies down a bit.  The commissioners can then come along and say to the Limerick County Council: &ldquo;Put that river in a proper state of repair so that it will be a satisfactory job.  If you do not do it, we will do it and send you down the bill&rdquo;.  Then we will have another tour made by engineers, etc., down to Limerick with plates and 2×4 wires in an attempt to stop up a place where concrete had to be put.  They will probably make a job of it and the Limerick County Council will have to foot the bill.  I say that the Parliamentary Secretary has not answered us at all.  He says that there is no possibility of added liability.  I say that that is all bosh and rot and that it is not a fact.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary was rather inclined to sneer at my stand in this matter.  The Parliamentary Secretary has admitted that there has been a good deal of neglect all over the country so far as the maintenance of rivers is concerned. We all know that that is the case.  But he ought to bear this in mind, that the provision we are making in this Bill is that the maintenance is to be a county-at-large charge.  There is no provision made for raising a capital sum to do any repair work.  There is quite a number of existing drainage works in <Col N="1274" /> a state of disrepair and a substantial sum will be required to put them into an efficient condition.  I submit that that will mean a severe burden on the local authorities.  I want to be reasonable about it.  I suggest that it ought to be a State responsibility to put them in a proper condition and, once they are in a proper condition, then make the local authorities do their job. The local authorities have not been doing their job.  It will all come back on the ratepayers of the county generally.  A certain amount of development must be done again owing to the neglect through the years. That is what I am concerned about and only that.  I want to see that the local authorities are made to carry out the maintenance work after that.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 35&mdash;In page 21, Section 32 (3), line 23, to delete the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;Reference Committee&rdquo; (Aire Airgeadais)&mdash;agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 36:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 22, line 20, Section 34 (3), to delete the words &ldquo;and solely&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Sub-section (3) of Section 34 states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every person who suffers loss or damage by reason of the flooding of land owned or occupied by him shall, where such flooding is due directly and solely to the abandonment of an existing embankment in pursuance of an abandonment Order, be entitled to be paid by the commissioners compensation in respect of such loss or damage.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to delete the words &ldquo;and solely&rdquo; so as to ensure that if loss or damage is suffered by a person from flooding which is directly due to the abandonment of an existing embankment, that person shall be entitled to recover compensation.  Under the sub-section he would have to establish that the flooding was caused directly by the abandonment of the embankment, and he would also have the liability of showing that the flooding was caused solely by the abandonment of the embankment.  It may happen, for instance, that there will be no doubt whatever that the flooding or damage was caused directly by the abandonment of the existing embankment, but the loss may not be caused solely by the abandonment of the embankment; some other contributing factor may be present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If 90 per cent. of the flooding is <Col N="1277" /> caused by the abandonment of an embankment, but 10 per cent. of the damage is caused by some other factor than direct abandonment of the embankment, then the person presumably will not be entitled to compensation. I think it ought to be sufficient for the purpose of equity if the Parliamentary Secretary will provide that, where it can be shown that the loss is due directly to the abandonment of the existing embankment, the compensation will be payable and the person should not have to prove that it was due solely to the abandonment of the embankment.</P>
    <P>It would be extremely difficult in most cases to establish a claim for compensation owing to the tight manner in which this sub-section is drawn.  I suggest that the inclusion of those two words in the manner set out in the sub-section is calculated to give rise to endless litigation, and it will cause considerable strife between the persons affected and the boards if it has to be shown that the cause of the damage was directly and solely due to the abandonment of the embankment.  The Parliamentary Secretary might reasonably be satisfied with the word &ldquo;directly&rdquo; and delete the word &ldquo;solely&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of an embankment erected for the protection of land which does not succeed in protecting that land, the landowner has no right to compensation at present. If we take over that embankment, I do not think it would be wise to make the obtaining of compensation too easy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If a landowner suffers damage or loss by reason of flooding caused by abandonment of an existing embankment, surely nobody would suggest that he should foot the bill himself.  If we damage John Murphy's land by abandonment, we should pay John Murphy some compensation.  To ask John to prove that the flooding or loss was caused &ldquo;directly and solely&rdquo; by the abandonment of an existing embankment is setting him an impossible task.  I do not know what he would have to prove.  The Parliamentary Secretary admitted that he himself had difficulty in finding out what these words &ldquo;directly and solely&rdquo; meant.  The word &ldquo;solely&rdquo; should be deleted.  Even if it is necessary to arrange for an amendment in the Seanad, I think the Parliamentary Secretary should consider those words &ldquo;directly and solely&rdquo; so as not to set the landowner an impossible task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary should meet the Deputy.  Suppose an embankment is abandoned and there is negligence so far as the maintenance of the river is concerned.  That would be contributory to the flooding, but if the flooding is not &ldquo;directly and solely&rdquo; due to abandonment of the embankment&mdash;and it is not in this case, because negligence in respect of the river has contributed to it&mdash;the landowner will be ousted from compensation.  It should be sufficient to prove that the damage is &ldquo;directly&rdquo; due to abandonment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to accept the amendment, but with some hesitancy.  I find a tendency, when work of this nature is being undertaken, <Col N="1279" /> to confer enormous rights of compensation which did not operate in the past on persons who heretofore have been exposed to dangers and risks of all kinds.  If damage were to occur at present they could not get any compensation.  When the State is undertaking extensive works which will result in the improvement of the general condition it is not right to confer upon people rights of compensation which would not in the ordinary way be payable to them.  That is the only reason why I say that it is with some hesitancy I agree to the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 22, to delete Section 34 (5), lines 33 to 43.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This sub-section is designed to ensure that, even when compensation is awarded for flooded land, the amount may be claimed by and, if claimed, must be paid to the Land Commission in respect of the redemption of the annuity or other charge on the portion of the land affected, so that the person whose lands are flooded may get no compensation whatever.  It seems to me that the commissioners ought not to take upon themselves the right to decide a matter of that kind. It seems to be needless vigilance on the part of the commissioners to get <Col N="1280" /> after the man who obtains some small compensation for flooded land and say: &ldquo;We are going to collar that compensation because we do not trust you to continue to pay your annuities regularly on the entire land, not merely the land you had but the land affected by this flooding.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We are only proposing to redeem in respect of the land for which he has received compensation. Is not that reasonable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Here we have a man who has paid his annuities regularly on the gale day, a good, credit-worthy citizen.  There is no question of his defaulting in his payments to the Land Commission.  His land is affected and he gets compensation, whereupon the commissioners come along and say: &ldquo;We do not trust you to continue to pay your annuities with the same promptitude and regularity as previously.  Lest you indulge in riotous or irresponsible conduct, we are going to look after your financial interests and collar portion of the compensation awarded you to redeem the annuity on the flooded land.&rdquo;  I think you might let the fellow away with whatever compensation he gets.  If he has been paying an annuity of £30 for 30 years, what is the use of collaring the small sum in compensation which would be applicable to the redemption of the flooded land?  It might only reduce his annuity by 5/-.  Is it not as well to let him carry on with the annuity on the former scale, instead of making a petty adjustment by redemption of the annuity on the flooded portion of the land?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me to be hardly worth the clerical work involved in making the adjustment, particularly when the person concerned is a credit-worthy citizen in respect of whom there is no doubt whatever about a default. I imagine that there was a Shylock mentality brought to bear on the drawing of this section.  It is quite clear that if anybody managed to get compensation from the Board of Works he would have a job to get away with it by the time the Board of Works had exhausted every Machiavellian device <Col N="1281" /> to get the compensation back from him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an extraordinary case for the Deputy to make.  For example, I have 20 acres of land.  The State advances a sum of money for its purchase.  Five acres of it are flooded, and in respect of these five acres I get compensation.  The Deputy's contention is that the State is not entitled to deduct from the compensation I get the portion of the advance in respect of those five acres, and that the existing balance of the advance is to be thrown against the 15 acres, thereby allowing me to get off, so far as the five acres are concerned, with the money that the State advanced for their purchase. That is what the Deputy said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Suppose I have 80 acres of land and that one acre of it is flooded.  I am paying an annuity of £40.  I get compensation for the one acre of flooded land.  The Land Commission come along and say that I have to hand over compensation in redemption of that one acre of flooded land.  Let us say that the annuity on it would be £1 a year.  That is the redemption value.  I have been paying the £40 a year regularly in respect of the 80 acres.  Why would not the Parliamentary Secretary trust me to continue to pay it regularly even though one of the 80 acres is flooded? What is the purpose of ramming your hand into my pocket and saying that you will not trust me to pay the full annuity?  I accepted responsibility, in the form of an annuity, for the ultimate redemption of every halfpenny advanced under the Land Purchase Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the practice that has always been followed.  Let us take another example.  If the Deputy had a farm of land and proposed to sell five acres of it for some purpose, so far as I know the practice of the Land Commission is this: that if he applies for permission to subdivide his holding and sell portion of it he will get that permission on undertaking to redeem the portion of the advance in respect of the five acres he is selling.  If the <Col N="1282" /> Land Commission insists in doing that in relation to a transaction of that kind, is it unreasonable, when the State pays compensation to him in respect of flooded land, that it should deduct from his compensation the amount of the advance that is outstanding in respect of the flooded land?  I think that is a most reasonable attitude for the State to take.</P>

      <Col N="1283" /> The section generally provides that the commissioners shall maintain drainage works in proper repair and effective condition, but when the words after &ldquo;addition&rdquo; are added, the effect is that the commissioners are not obliged to maintain the drainage works in a better condition or state of repair than they were in on the date of the maintenance transfer Order.  The Parliamentary Secretary's answer to that may be that the commissioners could not maintain the drainage works in a proper state of repair and effective condition and that the highest degree of efficiency would be their test, and that the condition in the latter portion of (1) (a) is for the purpose of ensuring that the commissioners cannot be sued to maintain the works in a better state of repair than the state in which they were on the date of the transfer maintenance Order.  I would like to have some indication from the Parliamentary Secretary as to what the purpose was in inserting the latter portion of (1) (a).</P>

      <P>In page 27, Section 37 (3) (a), before the word &ldquo;employed&rdquo; in line 14 to insert the word &ldquo;wholly&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This paragraph (a) provides that certain expenses are payable to the commissioners in respect of maintenance on drainage works.  Those expenses are &ldquo;the remuneration and other expenses of all officers and servants of the commissioners employed in the maintenance of the said drainage works while they are so employed.&rdquo; The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the local authority will not be charged with the full salary of a Board of Works inspector or engineer engaged on maintenance, unless he is engaged in the work as a full time officer.  As the paragraph stands, it would appear that a charge could be debited against a local authority for the full salary of an official, even though he might be employed only for one day per week in the maintenance of the scheme.</P>
      <P>I want to ensure that, if the full salary is to be charged, he should be employed whole-time on the drainage work.  If the inspector or engineer looks at the drainage once a month or once a week, the county council should not be compelled to pay in respect of a month's work.  The Parliamentary Secretary might clarify the matter by indicating what is meant by the &ldquo;remuneration and expenses&rdquo; of officers employed on drainage work.  Is it intended to recover only such portion of salary as the county council would be liable for in respect of their employment for a limited period per week or per month on the scheme?</P>

      <P>The paragraph in the Bill proposes to debit the county council with expenses of every kind incurred by the commissioners in connection with the maintenance of a drainage work.  I suggest that there should be some protection for the local authority, which should be charged only with the expenses reasonably incurred by the commissioners. As it stands at the moment, the local authority will have to pay on foot of a demand by the commissioners, whether the council consider the demand reasonable or unreasonable. I want to insert the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo;, so that at least the county council will be able to argue that it is not bound to pay every charge made against it but only such charges as are reasonable, in its opinion, or one deemed to be reasonable as a result of arbitration.</P>

      <P>This section forbids a local authority or any industrial concern constructing, altering, reconstructing or restoring any existing bridge over any watercourse without the consent of the commissioners or otherwise than in accordance with plans previously approved by the commissioners.  In other words, a local authority has to get the prior sanction of the Board of Works before they can go ahead with the repair or reconstruction of a bridge over a watercourse.  Surely, a local authority is in a different position from a private individual or firm, and surely that authority should not have to wait for sanction from the Board of Works before doing essential repairs to a bridge, in a case of real emergency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We could not accept this amendment.  First of all, I think the Deputy can easily visualise cases where a bridge might be erected by a local authority, let us say, this year, and where, although it might be all right for their purposes at the moment, it might not be all right for our purposes so far as future drainage is concerned.  Would it not be better in such a case for the local authority to wait until they hear from us?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only concerned with the matter of whether the local authority can go ahead with essential work without having to wait for sanction from the Board of Works.  It may be a case of work that has to be done immediately&mdash;essential work&mdash;but in the meantime, it would appear that the local authority has to be put to the trouble of waiting for sanction from the Local Government Department before they can go ahead with the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not really correct to say that they have to wait for sanction in such cases.  What I mean is that the county surveyor concerned might have, let us say, a road scheme to discuss with the Department of Local Government&mdash;a general scheme involving the whole county, which might involve the building of a dozen or two dozen bridges.  In such a case it would be necessary to seek the sanction of the Department before going ahead with the scheme, but the county surveyor would not have to seek the sanction of the Department in a single case such as, I think, the Deputy has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not really referring to that kind of thing.  The type of case to which the Parliamentary Secretary has referred is all right, where roads and bridges have to be constructed over a whole county.  That is not the type of case which I have in mind.  What I have in mind is the case of a bridge which is damaged, and where there is immediate necessity for repairing it.  My suggestion is that in a case of emergency such as that, it should not be necessary for the local authority to wait for sanction from the Department before going ahead with the work, because that might mean that that very necessary work might be held up for a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The local authority in such a case would not really be held up because, if it were a really urgent matter, the local authority would get the necessary priorities to have the thing done immediately.  I should like to say this, however: I am sure that <Col N="1292" /> most Deputies here must have come across cases where everything seemed to be all right in regard to the building or reconstructing of a county bridge, but where it was afterwards found that the foundations of the bridge were not sufficiently deep, and very often large drainage schemes were held up until proper foundations and proper under-pinning of the bridge could take place.  I think that the section here provides against such an occurrence, and, after all, the local authority is the most important authority to be included here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and I can quite conceive that in the case of the sudden collapse of a bridge, it might be necessary, but I do not think it would be safe to allow a local authority to erect or recondition bridges without having regard to what the drainage authority might have in mind with regard to the whole area concerned.</P>

    <P>I do not know exactly what the Minister intends to do by the use of the powers expressed in the parentheses in this sub-section&mdash;&ldquo;(including modifications of the provisions of this Act)&rdquo;.  It seems to me that this sub-section gives us delegated legislation with a vengeance. The section appears to authorise the confirmation of any agreement made under this section and gives the Minister power &ldquo;to <Col N="1294" /> make such provisions (including modifications of the provisions of this Act) as appear to him to be necessary in connection with or in consequence of such agreements.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>There is joint responsibility for the maintenance of a district which extends into the Six County area.  This power is being sought only in reference to the maintenance work that has to be done there.  If we find it convenient, necessary or possible, to enter into an agreement with, say the County Council of Fermanagh, to provide for maintenance work on the Erne, we feel that we should be entitled to do that without coming here to have new legislation introduced.  It does not affect any new work or new proposal. It merely covers the cost of carrying out maintenance work.</P>

The Parliamentary Secretary said: &ldquo;What I am prepared to consider is, in the event of a local authority raising an objection, as they are entitled to do, to mention specifically the Minister for Local Government.  I am prepared to mention the fact that he would be consulted in the event of such an objection being raised.&rdquo;  The Parliamentary Secretary has not made any provision for that.

The House dealt with the matter from 7 o'clock until 9 o'clock last night, and from about 5 o'clock until let us say 8 o'clock to-night.  A total of only five hours has been spent on 64 complicated, technical amendments. I think the Parliamentary Secretary has got every possible facility.  There has been no obstruction, and everybody has aimed at improving the Bill. I cannot understand why the Parliamentary Secretary wants us to pass a Bill, which has been amended in 64 separate respects, before we have seen those amendments carried into the Bill.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £11,700 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1945, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, and certain Services administered by that Office, including Grants and other Expenses in connection with Housing, Grants to Local Authorities, sundry Miscellaneous Grants and Grants-in-Aid, and certain charges connected with Hospitals.</P>
      <P>The purpose for which this vote is required is set out in detail in parts 2 and 3 of the Estimate.  The first item is consequent upon the appointment, to which I referred in the debate on the main Estimate; it is to provide for the salary of the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Childers, who has been appointed to supervise on my behalf the administration of certain sections of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second item for which money is required is to provide a gratuity for a gentleman who since 1932 was a member of the former National Housing Board, and who retired in consequence of the dissolution of the board.  The member in question has rendered exceptional services to this State in many capacities, and not the least of his services were those which he rendered during his membership <Col N="1302" /> of the National Housing Board. We would have been very glad if we could have availed of his services in a more permanent and whole time capacity in the Department, but in view of his advanced years that was not possible under the existing law and regulations. Neither was it possible to award him a retiring allowance, and in the circumstances we have decided that it is only right and just that the modest sum which is asked for in this Estimate should be granted to him.</P>
    <P>The third and most important item for which money is asked in the Supplementary Estimate is under sub-head J (7), for grants towards the supply of footwear for necessitous children. Under this proposal, as will be seen, we require the sum of £20,000 for grants to public authorities not exceeding 50 per cent. of their approved expenditure on the provision of footwear for certain children under the age of 16 years, whose parents or guardians are not in receipt of home assistance.  In connection with this proposal I should explain that, so far back as Autumn, 1943, we were trying to evolve a scheme whereby the hardship which has been created for poor parents by reason of the rise in footwear prices could be alleviated.  I had hoped to have prepared much earlier a scheme which would aim first of all at securing that a proportion of the available supplies of children's footwear would be reserved for families of low income, and that such footwear would be made available to them at a cost which would be within their means.  The preparation of such a scheme has been by no means simple.  As the House is aware, the total supply of children's footwear is limited, and strong durable boots such as would be most suitable for this purpose cannot be obtained by encroaching on luxury lines, say of ladies' footwear, which were until then in comparatively good supply.  Neither, of course, could we encroach on the too low output of leather required for farmers' boots and for boots of the adult agricultural population.</P>
    <P>The first difficulty we had to overcome, therefore, arose from the fact <Col N="1303" /> that supplies of footwear for this scheme would, of necessity, have to be drawn from the normal production of children's footwear and this fact will involve the utilisation for the beneficiaries under this scheme of half the total estimated output of children's footwear in the current half year. Officers of my Department who have been in consultation with representatives of the trade, however, have, I should like to emphasise, stressed the desirability of increasing the production of footwear for all classes of children and I am satisfied that anything which the Department of Supplies, in co-operation with the manufacturers, can do to this end will be done.  But, as I have said, the fact that the footwear for this scheme has had to come from the current general quota has given rise to many complex questions which have had to be resolved in lengthy discussions with the representatives of the trade.</P>
    <P>The negotiations, I should say, were carried on with the utmost goodwill on the part of the trade and, notwithstanding that they were of a complex nature and that it was, naturally, found difficult to attain unanimity and quick decision from some of the interests concerned, what I hope will prove to be a satisfactory scheme has been evolved.  Again, I should like to emphasise that on the whole I have found all classes of the trade&mdash;manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers&mdash; very ready to make a special effort to resolve difficulties and to sink differences in the interests of securing a satisfactory and workable scheme.</P>
    <P>As to the details of the scheme, of course, the first step will be that the public authorities will give notice of the scheme by public advertisement, and applications which will be received in response to those advertisements will be investigated by the public assistance officers.  The local authorities will then determine those recipients who appear to be most in need, and will at the same time determine the respective contributions to be made by each recipient.  In the case of families already in receipt of home assistance, no contribution need be <Col N="1304" /> sought by the authorities if the circumstances of the applicant are such as to warrant the supply of free footwear. In all other cases, however, the recipient's contribution will be determined according to his means.  I should perhaps stress here that the footwear even when supplied at full fixed retail price, will be considerably cheaper than the ordinary market price, thanks to the special financial arrangements which it has been found possible to make with all the interests concerned&mdash;the manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers.</P>
    <P>When the need of an applicant has been determined, a voucher will be given to him.  In order to secure a voucher, of course, the applicant must be either the parent or the guardian of the child who is to receive the footwear. The recipient of this voucher will present it to any retailer of footwear. The retailer will then order the appropriate footwear from his usual supplier and, if available, supply it to the recipient.  The local authority will undertake to be responsible for the difference between the fixed retail price of the footwear supplied and the cash contribution towards its cost to be made by the recipient.</P>
    <P>All manufacturers of children's footwear are being requested by the Department of Supplies to produce a proportion of the official footwear and the distribution, subject to quota limitations, will be on orders from the retailers based on vouchers received by them from recipients or, in the case of larger firms, on estimated requirements.</P>
    <P>The financing of the scheme will be divided into two parts.  In the case of existing recipients of home assistance, footwear provided for them is assistance in kind and the net cost will be chargeable to the ordinary funds provided for home assistance, but a proportion of the cost not exceeding 50 per cent., exclusive of administrative costs, may be charged to the local authority's share of the grant of £170,040 which has already been voted, as the House is aware, by the Dáil for the supply of assistance in kind to recipients of home assistance. In the case of applicants not at present <Col N="1305" /> in receipt of home assistance but who are considered by the local authority to be eligible for footwear of which only portion of the cost will be met by the local authority, 50 per cent. of the cost of the scheme, excluding administrative expenses, will be borne by the local authorities out of the ordinary funds provided for home assistance, and the State grant, estimated at £20,000, is required to meet the other 50 per cent.  It is to provide for this balance that the sum of £20,000 is now asked for.</P>
    <P>The fixed prices which make provision for the necessary retailers' and wholesalers' profits for the different sizes and age groups range from 10/6 to 16/-.</P>

The weighted average retail full price of all the footwear provided under the scheme will be 13/6, On the basis of the State contribution, the local authority's contribution and the amounts which particular recipients will be required to contribute according to their means, it is estimated that the amount of the Supplementary Estimate for £20,000, with a possible further charge of £10,000 on the Vote for assistance in kind should enable a distribution of up to 160,000 pairs of boots or shoes to be effected.</P>

      <P>It will enable a distribution of 160,000 pairs of boots or shoes to be effected.  I should mention, however, that, so far, we have no assurance that this target of production will be reached before the 31st March next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard further to the administration of the scheme, the Parliamentary Secretary, Dr. Ward, under whose aegis the scheme will now be administered, is making regulations under the Public Assistance Act, 1939, to regulate the administration of the <Col N="1306" /> scheme in the various public assistance districts and an emergency powers Order to deal with possible abuses will be submitted in due course to the Government.</P>
    <P>If the Dáil now authorises the Supplementary Estimate, I shall have the public assistance authorities advised to-morrow of the detailed arrangements proposed and I hope to have the scheme in full operation in all areas before Christmas.</P>
    <P>I may say that I had hoped to be able to come to the Dáil long before this with a scheme of this sort but, as I have pointed out, the negotiations which had to be conducted have been of a complex kind; the arangements which have had to be made with the manufacturers, not merely in regard to the prices to be paid to them, but to enable the production of a standard article to be undertaken, have been difficult and intricate.  I am glad that at last we have been able to ask the Dáil to make some provision to case the hardships, which undoubtedly have been suffered owing to the difficulty of procuring children's footwear, and the high cost of such footwear when it is available.</P>

      <P>I must confess that it is rather difficult to follow the elaborate and intricate explanatory statement made by the Minister as to the manner in which it is proposed to administer the scheme for the distribution of footwear for children.  This Supplementary Estimate embraces three items, the first one being £1,200 for the salary of an additional Parliamentary Secretary. One would imagine that the Minister in asking the Dáil to vote the £1,200 would at least explain why it is necessary to have two Parliamentary Secretaries in the Department of Local Government.  It is the one Department of the Government in which we have two Parliamentary Secretaries.  When we think of the Department of Finance, which appears to be a bigger Department, with one Parliamentary Secretary, and of other Departments with one Parliamentary Secretary, one naturally asks why it is that there must be a Minister and two <Col N="1307" /> Parliamentary Secretaries in charge of the Department of Local Government. Anybody who has experience in the country will say that the work of the Department of Local Government has not improved, nor has it become more popular in the eyes of the people, notwithstanding the fact that we have a Minister and two Parliamentary Secretaries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my opinion, and if the Deputy has any opinion to express, he can do so later.  One would naturally expect that the Minister would have explained why it is necessary to have two Parliamentary Secretaries, and that he would also tell the Dáil how the work is divided in the Department; what section the Minister is responsible for, what section the first Parliamentary Secretary is responsible for, and what section the second Parliamentary Secretary is responsible for.  I want it to be clearly understood that when I mention Parliamentary Secretaries I am leaving out entirely the personality, the individual. I have a very sincere respect and regard for the gentleman who was appointed to the position, but I certainly think it was the duty of the Minister, when asking the Dáil to vote a salary of £1,200 for an additional Parliamentary Secretary, to explain what the duties would be, and why or in what way the work of the Department had grown so much that it was necessary to have the help of a second Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
      <P>The second item on the Estimate is for a sum of £500, gratuity to a former member of the National Housing Board.  I have no doubt the gentleman to whom it is proposed to give this gratuity of £500 has deserved that sum, and that his services in the past may have earned that amount.  The Minister might have told us how many years this gentleman was a member of the Housing Board and what his duties were.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that it may be necessary to segregate a certain amount of money to buy footwear for necessitous children.  A sum of £20,000 seems negligible owing to the size of the areas taken into consideration, and the number of children in cities like Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford.  When the necessitous children there are provided for I imagine that very little money will be left for children in rural areas.  This proposal loses a great deal of its glamour when examined in the light of the answer given to-day by the Minister for Supplies when it was stated that there was practically no upper leather available for men's boots and no leather for children's boots.  I do not know by what precise mesmerism the Minister is going to provide hides for the factories so that they may produce leather to implement this scheme. In any event, when the £20,000 is spread over the whole country there will be precious little left for the borough.  This may turn out to be a gesture wasted, while possessing some value of political significance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt about the necessity for this sum to provide boots and shoes for children, because in my experience I have never <Col N="1309" /> seen so many of them without boots or shoes as during the past 12 months. Anybody who has occasion to go into rural areas especially, knows that it is difficult for many poor people, trying to exist on low rates of wages, on home assistance, on low scales of unemployment insurance and unemployment assistance, to pay the high prices demanded for children's footwear.  In these rural areas one can see what I fear is a growing number of children who are compelled to go to school in bare feet, and badly clad.  If one impression more than another is gained, it is that the standard of living, judging by the footwear which children are compelled to wear, or by the absence of footwear, has shown a noticeable deterioration in recent years.  Anything that puts boots and shoes, on children who are without boots or shoes, or with bad boots or shoes, will be something that will be welcome to the children, whatever we may think of the philosophy of the State having to provide boots and shoes for children, instead of providing their fathers with decent employment and with decent rates of wages to enable them to buy boots and shoes.  I am sure the children will not quarrel at seeing a pair of boots or shoes for the first time in a long period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister told us about negotiations with the manufacturers, and about the scale of prices arranged for footwear, varying form 10/6 to 16/- per pair, with a weighted average of 13/6 a pair.  I should like to know whether it is intended that this footwear will be ordinary footwear such as might be purchased by any citizen with his own money in a shop, or that it will be footwear of a distinctive cut, or design, or leather, because it would be most regrettable if these boots and shoes were made in such a manner as would enable one child to shout after another: &ldquo;You have a pair of free shoes or boots on you.&rdquo;  It would be a most regrettable stigma to associate with them, and I hope that whoever is responsible for the technique of producing them will take all necessary steps to ensure that there is no distinctive cut about them and no distinctive quality of leather associated with them, so that children whose families are unfortunate <Col N="1310" /> enough to have to seek footwear under the scheme will at least be insured against the possibility of being taunted with the fact that their family's economic plight was such that they had to get their footwear from the State or the local authority.  I hope the Minister will make sure that the footwear is ordinary footwear indistinguishable from the footwear purchasable by any other citizen and that the stigma of free boots will not be associated with them.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that the scheme would be financed to the extent of 50 per cent. by the State; in other words, the local authorities will be reimbursed 50 per cent. of their expenditure.  I gather from what the Minister has said that it was also intended that applicants for these free boots and shoes would be required to make a contribution according to their economic circumstances, so that, of the cost of 10/6 of a pair of boots or shoes, the applicant will pay perhaps 2/- or 3/-, the local authority 3/- or 4/- and the State another 4/-.  The Local Government Department is one of the Departments which takes a stand on the belief that local authorities can never do anything intelligently unless they are shown by the Department how to do it.  We had an example recently when the Department told local authorities the way in which they were to administer the supplementary allowance of 2/6 to old age pensioners.  They sent a circular letter to local authorities on the matter which started off with the intimation that the sum of 2/6 was available in special circumstances for old age pensioners and recipients of national health insurance.  Every other paragraph was designed to tell the local authority where it could not give 2/6 and the scheme as administered, as those associated with local authorities know, has proved most unsatisfactory from the point of view of giving these people the supplementary allowance granted to them.</P>
    <P>I should like to know whether local authorities will get any instructions about this scheme.  Are they to be told the type of case to which they must not supply free boots or shoes, how much is to be expected from a <Col N="1311" /> person who is an applicant, whether there are to be any income gradings and generally whether local authorities will be permitted to exercise their own discretion based on their local knowledge and their sense of humanity in the application of the scheme.  If it is desired that the scheme should operate smoothly, I suggest that the Local Government Department, beyond telling local authorities that they will back their expenditure to the extent of 50 per cent., should give the local authorities wide powers to make this footwear available to the children of parents in necessitous circumstances. Local authorities, generally speaking, will view the matter in a humane and understanding way.  The main consideration, I take it, is to make sure that these boots and shoes are available to children for the coming winter, and a mass of red tape and instructions of a restrictive character ought not to be issued by the Department to frustrate the very desirable objective of making this footwear available to children during the coming winter.</P>
    <P>I should further like to ask when these boots and shoes will be available. The Minister has told us that the scheme will involve a demand on those producing boots and shoes up to 50 per cent. of their production in a period of six months.  It is very easy to approve of a scheme of this kind and to raise the hopes of people that they will see boots and shoes on their children during the winter, but if there is a lag between the announcement of the scheme and the time at which the footwear becomes available, considerable discontent will inevitably arise.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister say now, with some degree of accuracy as to date, when the scheme is likely to be put into operation, when the vouchers to purchase this footwear will be available, and, not only that, but when the boots and shoes can be got by children in necessitous circumstances?  Judging by the weather we have had recently, the necessity for urgency in the matter will be obvious to the Minister, and I hope he will be able to indicate <Col N="1312" /> that this scheme is not merely a scheme on paper but a scheme by which it will be possible to make boots and shoes available for these children with the utmost expedition. If the Minister could give any firm date, I feel sure that the scheme, which will on the whole, I think, be beneficial, having regard to the destitution problem with which we have to deal, will be still more welcome from the point of view of those who may benefit by the production of this footwear.</P>

      <P>There is a statement in connection with the Estimate: Grants to public assistance authorities not exceeding 50 per cent. of their approved net expenditure on the provision of footwear for certain children under the age of 16 years whose parents or guardians are not in receipt of home assistance.  Do I understand that children whose parents are in receipt of home assistance will receive free boots, the cost of which will be completely borne by the State and that the 50 per cent. is intended only to apply to categories other than these?</P>

      <P>I want to make it clear that if this scheme is to operate as I think it will operate, in effect, the greater burden will be borne by the local authorities and not by the State.  In view of the fact that a very large number of persons will be included in the low income category so far as Dublin is concerned, and that, in my opinion, the whole £20,000 would be needed to deal with the City of Dublin, when a survey is made and it is found that the money now being voted is not sufficient, will the Minister indicate that a further amount will be provided under this heading?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he is aware that local authorities have probably already earmarked all of the amount allocated to them for assistance in kind and that none of that will be available within the rest of the financial year for this footwear scheme.  A difficulty has already arisen in connection with one local authority that I know of who were allocated money on the basis of the Vote in the first of the financial year.  They gave out too much to each person and, coming into the winter, they found that they had to cease giving it in a great number of cases.  That local authority out of its own funds had to make good the amount in order to carry on the scheme of assistance on the basis on which it was allocated in the commencement of the year.  All the money voted to local authorities in the early portion of the year has been allocated and no portion of that will be available to subsidise this footwear scheme for persons in receipt of home assistance. I want the Minister clearly to understand that none of that money which was made available by the Minister, under the Vote, to local authorities is available now to subsidise this footwear scheme for persons in receipt of home assistance.  What Deputy O'Sullivan has said, therefore, is quite true.  If the local authorities are to provide boots for those in receipt of home assistance they will have to provide the full cost to the end of the present financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of this 160,000 pairs of boots, it is a good thing that something is being done because people down the country have been wondering for the last three or four months why all the footwear had gone off the market.  There was not a pair of children's or even adults strong footwear to be bought at any price.  In view of this scheme, it is possible that the manufacturers have been holding up the boots for the last four or five months.  I suppose that is what happened. It is to be hoped now that they will be released and that this 160,000 pairs will be made available in the next month or two.  It has been quite a mystery why children's boots <Col N="1314" /> could not be bought for any money in many shops in rural Ireland in recent months.  I hope all these boots have been made and are now in the hands of the manufacturers, and that they will be distributed at once.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether the Government thinks it is fair to unload on the local authorities even half the cost of this scheme. There has been a tendency during the emergency to unload half the cost of every emergency scheme on the local authorities.  We had the scheme in the early portion of this year for assistance in kind to old age pensioners and to other necessitous persons and half the cost was unloaded on the local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so in the case of the old age pensioners.  There was a State subvention of 76 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Twenty-five per cent. of it, or some portion of the cost at all events, was unloaded on the local authorities.  Why should any portion of it be unloaded on the local authorities? Why should not the taxpayer who pays taxes into the Exchequer stand the whole cost?  That is what we cannot understand.  It is something that I think we should protest against. Local authorities do not object to raising money, but they should not be asked to bear any portion of any scheme arising out of the emergency. They have their own burdens and their own expenses arising out of the emergency to bear.  Why should they be asked to bear a burden which should be placed on the Exchequer?  I think it is only right that the full cost of subsidising this footwear scheme should be met by the central authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that it would be a much better scheme if he had made an arrangement with the manufacturers to put subsidised boots of a durable kind on the market for certain types of people.  It would be much simpler to administer if certain lines of boots were put on the market for people who would be certified by the local authority as <Col N="1315" /> eligible to get these boots.  It would be a much better scheme than the present complicated scheme.  Local authorities and assistance officers have been complaining for the last year or two that, with the additional work thrown on them by other schemes, they cannot possibly carry out their work effectively.  There will be a similar complaint in connection with this scheme.  The administration of this scheme will be found to be very complicated and difficult and you will have complaints from all over the country.  A cheap line of subsidised durable boots put on the market for necessitous persons would be a far better scheme and much easier to administer than this scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree absolutely with Deputy Allen on this matter.  I think the House will agree that the cost of footwear and clothing is very high at present, and that a very severe burden is being put on the poorer sections of the people.  It is necessary to provide a subsidy of some sort.  As a matter of fact, we have advocated it from this side of the House on several occasions. Deputy McGilligan, in particular, has paid a great deal of attention to this aspect of our problem and has advocated the subsidising of different categories of food and clothing.  I agree with Deputy Allen that it is most unfair to put the responsibility on the local authority for a very heavy part of the contribution that is to be made in respect of this scheme.  Great Britain is paying a very heavy subsidy at present to keep down the cost of living.  It is costing well over £200,000,000 per annum in Great Britain and that accounts for the fact that the cost of living there is lower than it is here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What this really means, so far as the contribution of rural Ireland is concerned, is that you are really putting a tax on our primary industry, namely, agriculture.  We talk about helping agriculture and helping to expand production. These burdens which are being put on it from time to time may appear to be very small, but in the aggregate they are substantial.  I think <Col N="1316" /> that Deputy Allen's criticism of this scheme is very sound.  You are throwing it back on a great many people who can ill afford to have their tax burden increased, while there are other sections of the community enjoying good salaries and living in houses with nominal valuation who make no contribution to a scheme of this sort.  The fairest way to all sections of the community would be to give a subsidy from the Exchequer.  As Deputy Allen suggested, if you had a cheap line of footwear subsidised and available to members of certain families who would get a voucher to purchase them from the local authority, it would be far simpler and far cheaper to administer and to control.  While we believe that a scheme of this sort is very useful and will be very beneficial, the method of financing it is most unfair and unjust in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>I should like to join with Deputy Roddy in saying that the Minister gave no information and made no attempt to justify the necessity for providing at this stage a second assistant for himself in the way of a Parliamentary Secretary.  This is a very elaborate machine that this relatively poor country has to provide, and surely there is no justification whatever for providing a second Parliamentary Secretary in the circumstances.  The Minister should have made some attempt to justify the necessity of providing a second Parliamentary Secretary. Judging by the services that are given to the country, and the feeling down the country generally so far as services of the Department of Local Government are concerned, I do not think that even the addition of a second Parliamentary Secretary has improved matters or has brought about any expedition of decisions from the Custom House.  The Minister should give us a little more information on that point.</P>

      <P>There are a few matters upon which I would like to dwell.  One is in connection with the Government decision to take half-a-crown from the old age pensioners.  At a meeting on Monday last in Cork I questioned the manager with regard to a large number <Col N="1317" /> of applicants&mdash;the poorest of our people.  They had applied for the extra half-crown and they did not get it. Here is what I found.  There was a Government decision, a necessary decision I would say, but since last June in Cork County no applicant for the extra half-crown could get it unless some other fellow died.  That was the only way it could be given to him. That is the plain fact.</P>

      <P>Very well.  I will talk about footwear so.  With regard to footwear, whilst we are getting less money by way of subsidy, we have received notification that we will be expected, out of the smaller sums allowed, to provide footwear.  The subsidy last year was not sufficient to meet what it was expected to meet. This year, out of the ratepayers' pockets again, we are expected to provide footwear.  This policy of taking so much out of the ratepayers' pockets is not, to my mind, justifiable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This thing of asking boards of assistance, out of smaller subsidies, to provide footwear, in addition to other things which they had not sufficient money to procure last year, is, to my <Col N="1320" /> mind, scandalous.  On this question of footwear, the amount looked for is not half or quarter enough.  The Government Department should meet this question of footwear in full, not in part.  On the other point, about the Parliamentary Secretary, I would like to mention that last February a letter was sent to the Minister for Local Government in connection with the appointment of an architect for a Cork hospital.</P>

      <P>I would like the Minister to give some information as to how many pairs of boots will be made available within the next three or six months.  Both Deputy Martin O'Sullivan, the Lord Mayor of Dublin, and the Leader of the Labour Party estimated that Dublin alone would require the full amount of the Estimate.  I am anxious to know in what manner the amount will be allocated and when the allocation will take place.  I feel that Cork City alone would require the full amount.  The Minister must be aware that many public bodies&mdash;Cork Corporation included&mdash;will be striking their rates shortly and would like to know beforehand, even approximately, what amount the ratepayers will have to bear.  It would not be fair to expect the Minister to give a clear-cut estimate just now, but he might give a rough idea as to the amount and when the allocation will be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to welcome the introduction of this Vote for boots for the poor people and I am surprised to hear Deputies talking about what it will cost the ratepayers.  This Vote should not be challenged, as it is a very welcome one to the poor people.  There are subsidies for all other parties, including the farmers, and it is disgraceful that any member of the House should grumble about these few pounds now for the poor in the towns and cities.  It will not mean a farthing or a halfpenny on the rates, yet Deputies are talking about the ratepayers, although they have refused to pay income-tax themselves and are paying nothing to the State.  I welcome the introduction of this Vote, and I am sure the poor people will welcome it also, as they welcomed the children's allowances.  It is a step in the right direction for a Fianna Fáil Minister on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is sad that there is the necessity to introduce this relief measure.  It would be better if we could provide work for the fathers of these children, but if that cannot be done, there must be some help for the downtrodden people of the country.  There should be no argument, objection or opposition in regard to this Vote, simply because the local authority will have to pay 50 <Col N="1322" /> per cent. of the cost.  In Wexford, we are bringing in a motion in the county council to provide more money during the winter time for those who have been put off the home assistance.  This Vote should be welcomed by all Parties and I am surprised to hear some of the Fianna Fáil Deputies objecting to it. It will be welcomed throughout the whole country by the poor people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to welcome the Vote the Minister has introduced for the provision of boots for children.  It is something which is long overdue. It reminds me of a speech I heard from one of the Fianna Fáil candidates in my constituency during the election. He was so excited on the fair day that he said: &ldquo;When we get back into power, Fianna Fáil is going to provide boots for all the footless children.&rdquo;  It was very nearly being so, if the Minister had not introduced this long overdue Vote.  I am glad to see that the necessary steps are being taken now to ensure that the children will be provided with boots.</P>
      <P>We all know how regrettable it is that, in this House, we should be compelled to pass this Vote.  It is a disgrace that the vast majority of our people should be compelled to stretch their hands out for these relief boots from the Local Government Department or the local authority.  If the fathers of families were earning a decent living wage, they could have a proper standard of living, with food, clothing and shelter within the reach of every labouring man.  Then the majority of the people would not be dependent on home assistance from public bodies and the St. Vincent de Paul Society in order to eke out a miserable existence.  I welcome this Vote and say it is long overdue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding Deputy O'Leary's comment, I have been for the past hour and a half in the House and did not hear anybody grumble or protest. Everyone with common sense knows the Vote is very necessary.  How many children will you see walking through the streets of Dublin, morning after morning, in cold, frosty weather, without boots?  Then you hear the Minister for Local Government and Public Health making appeals for the co-operation <Col N="1323" /> of the general public in the campaign against tuberculosis.  How can the children, or the vast majority of the people, be in any other condition, when they are half-fed, underclothed and without boots?  It is about time the Government realised its responsibility and I am glad to see the responsible Minister here to-night introducing this long overdue Vote, which is well worth while.</P>
    <P>Regarding the matter of the Parliamentary Secretary, I have been in touch with this particular Department since I left school, long before I became a member of this House, and got very little recognition there until I became a Deputy.  Now, as a Deputy for the past two years, I cannot say that I have got much more satisfaction. There is a lack of attention in the Department.  We have two Parliamentary Secretaries now, so I definitely hope there will be some improvement in regard to the sanctioning of various appointments, the question of old age pensioners' allowances, and so forth.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the Minister is to receive help as far as the Parliamentary Secretary is concerned.  I think that every guy in the Custom House looks upon himself as a Parliamentary Secretary.  They all seem to be bosses down there.  I do not begrudge the Parliamentary Secretary the salary which we are providing for him to-night.  I wish him the best of good luck, and I hope he will prove himself worthy of it.  We all must admit there is a grave responsibility on the Minister for Local Government in respect of several important matters which come under his jurisdiction.  I think that if the appointment of the second Parliamentary Secretary is going to add to the efficiency of the Department, we should not grumble about it.  I am glad to see that the Government have appointed the additional Parliamentary Secretary if, as I say, that is going to lead to the efficiency of the Department.  In conclusion, I welcome very sincerely from my heart this legislation which, I think, is long overdue.  It will be welcomed by the poor of Dublin City and by the poor throughout the country.</P>

      <P>Deputy Roddy asked, in regard to the first item in the Supplementary Estimate, what section of the Department the Minister is responsible for, what section the first Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Dr. Ward, is responsible for, and what section my second Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Erskine Childers, is responsible for.  Well, Sir, under the Ministers and Secretaries Act, I, as Minister, am responsible for the Department of Local Government and Public Health as a whole.  Under the Delegation Order which was made by the Government at my request and laid before the House and, consequently, has the force of law, all my functions as Minister for Local Government and Public Health in regard to the public health section of the Department, and the ancillary services associated therewith have been delegated to the first Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Ward, and he, for all practical purposes, is the effective head of the public health section.  So far as the second Parliamentary Secretary is concerned, he, in accordance with the provisions of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, acts as my immediate personal representative in regard to any particular question to which I assign him.  By way of explanation, I would remind the House that I have already traversed all this ground in regard to the need of the Delegation Order and the appointment of the second Parliamentary Secretary in the debate on the main Estimate for my Department, and, therefore, I do not think it necessary to cover the ground again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to a number of the questions that have been raised here, I do not know whether it would be worth while prolonging the debate in order to give answers to them.  The House must adjourn at 9 o'clock, but in case there should be some doubts I shall refer to some of the points briefly.  I shall deal first of all with the point raised by Deputy Norton.  In regard to that, I should say that the modest amount which we believe will meet our requirements for this scheme is <Col N="1325" /> entirely due to the careful forethought, planning and consideration which has been given to the working out of the scheme.  If Deputies will bear in mind the prices which I detailed for these boots they will recollect that they range from, I think, 10/6 to 16/6.  That is the full cost of the boot, covering producers', manufacturers', wholesalers' and retailers' profits.  The weighted average price of the 160,000 pairs of boots which we hope to provide will be 13/6 per pair.  That figure could not have been obtained except as a result, as I have said, of careful planning and foresight and a great deal of goodwill on the part of the manufacturing and commercial interests involved.  I am satisfied that the amount which we are asking will meet our requirements so far as the 160,000 pairs of boots are concerned. Of course, should it fall short of our requirements and should more money become necessary we shall, if the sanction of the Minister for Finance is given, come to the House and ask it to make increased provision.</P>
    <P>As to the type of boots, they will be of good, strong serviceable quality. They will not be of a uniform pattern. If we could have got a uniform pattern, I think their cost would be still less, but they will, as I say, be of a good, strong serviceable kind made by all those manufacturers who are equipped to produce boots of that nature, and will be made, of course, of the best materials available to us.  They will not bear any mark except one.  They will bear a mark under the narrow part of the sole, close to the heel, a mark which will distinguish them as boots supplied under the scheme. One of our difficulties and one of the things which we have to safeguard ourselves against is that the provisions of this scheme may be abused: the advantages and facilities which we are offering and which are intended for the poorest classes in our community, may be taken unjust advantage of, and the goods we are supplying under the scheme may be misused.  Therefore, there must be some mark, but that mark will not be a conspicuous mark.</P>
    <P>The next question asked was when do we hope to get this scheme into <Col N="1326" /> operation.  If the Dáil passes this Estimate to-night, as I think it will, circulars will go out to the local authorities to-morrow giving them all the information necessary to enable them to get the vouchers printed and ready for distribution so that we are hoping to have the scheme in operation before Christmas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly, we could not have launched a scheme of this sort without having made proper provision beforehand for the production of the type of boot which we required.  These arrangements have been made and, in consequence of that, we are hoping that there will be 80,000 pairs of boots available before the 31st December.  They may not all be in the hands of those who require them at that date, but at any rate production arrangements have been made with that end in view.  We will also, I think, have the balance of the 80,000 pairs available before the 31st March next.  I should say, of course, that these estimates and anticipations of mine are subject to all the exigencies and unforeseen circumstances that may arise in the course of manufacture and distribution.</P>
      <P>It is now 9 o'clock, and if there is not going to be a division on this Estimate perhaps the House would give me a little extra time to conclude.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Some exception has been made to the financing of this scheme, and, in particular, exception has been made to the fact that we are asking the local authorities to bear a reasonable, a fair, proportion of the cost.  Well, now, when I hear criticism of the scheme of that sort, when I see an attack made on that feature of the scheme, I know at once that the scheme is generally a good one, and that the object which most of the critics have in view&mdash;I do not say all of them&mdash;is to try to decry the <Col N="1327" /> scheme in some way so as to make it unpopular with some sections of the people.  In this case, the sections of the people with whom they hope to make it unpopular are those ratepayers who will have to bear co-ordinately and concurrently with the taxpayers a fair share of the cost of the scheme.  I am sure that nobody thinks for a moment that we could carry out a scheme of this sort without imposing a burden upon the community as a whole, so that the only point at issue, apparently, between myself and my critics on that aspect of the matter is as to how the cost is to be divided between the several interests involved.</P>
      <P>In general, local authorities derive their revenue from the property-owners. The people who provide funds for the local authorities are the ratepayers, who are assessed upon the property they occupy or enjoy.  I do not think that there is anything unjust or inequitable in asking the property-owners to contribute according to their valuations half the cost, when necessary, of a scheme of this sort.  When I hear criticisms to the effect that it is unfair to ask local authorities to contribute to a scheme of this sort, I immediately ask myself: &ldquo;What are local authorities for; for what purpose were they set up?&rdquo; Their original purpose was to relieve destitution in their own immediate neighbourhood.  That was their primary obligation and that primary obligation remains their Christian duty to-day.  I see no reason whatever to apologise to any person for asking the local authorities to bear half the cost of boots to be provided for the children of the poorest of our people.  I think that it is unworthy criticism of a scheme of this sort&mdash;&mdash;</P>

On every occasion on which we try to do something to relieve the hardships which <Col N="1328" /> this emergency has created, the issue is knit as between the people who have property, on the one hand, and the general body of taxpayers, on the other hand.  I hope that this is the last we shall hear of that sort of criticism of schemes of this sort.</P>

      <P>The Manufacturers, the wholesalers and the retailers all made some sacrifice to enable us to produce those shoes and to offer them to the poor at the price at which they will be offered.  We should all be glad that we had the ready co-operation of the interests involved.  When a scheme of this sort, representing the fruits of a great deal of consideration, comes before the House, it should be welcomed and not made the subject of carping criticism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Anthony asked how the amount would be allocated.  No difficulty arises in that connection because, as I have mentioned, so far as persons who are relieved by home assistance are concerned, 50 per cent. will come out of the £170,000 already voted, without distinction of any kind.  A distinction should be made between that £170,000, already provided, and the £200,000 provided for supplements to old age pensions.  I am aware that, in some counties, the proportion of the £170,000 allocated may have been already used up.  On the other hand, I know that there are counties in which substantial balances are available.  If, however, the money has already been spent on assistance in kind, those who have spent it in providing assistance in kind, will have, if they are to avail of this scheme, to reconsider the position as a whole and rebudget, if necessary.  So far as people in receipt of low incomes are concerned, their case will be judged on its merits.  They will be asked to make a contribution and we shall provide half the balance required to meet the difference between the cost of the boot and the price at which it is sold to the recipient of the cheap-boot voucher.  The remaining 50 per cent. will, again, have to be provided by the local authority and, as I have said, so <Col N="1329" /> far as that is concerned, I have no apology to make.  I think that that course is fully justified on every ground.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1330" /> Vote agreed to and reported.  Report agreed to.</P>
