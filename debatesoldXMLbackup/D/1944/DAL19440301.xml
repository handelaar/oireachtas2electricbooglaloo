      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he will consider making it obligatory on persons entering this State from the Six Counties to produce identification cards for inspection in order to identify agents of any of the belligerent Powers.</P>

      <P>The methods for discovering and identifying foreign agents are constantly under review.  The Government in this matter are guided by the advice of their experts.</P>

      <P>If the Minister does in future consider this system of producing identification cards for persons entering this country from the Six Counties, will he also consider the practicability of applying the same procedure to persons who enter this country from other countries by parachute?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I say, in connection with questions which I have been asked, that certain Deputies are obviously specialising at the moment in asking questions which appear to be aimed at embroiling us with one set or other of belligerents.  They are, in some cases, so designed that it is extremely difficult to give an answer <Col N="1912" /> that will not appear to indicate a siding by us with one set or other of the belligerents.  They are very often tendentious in the framing and the mere putting of them on the Order Paper is itself dangerous.  Now, what is at stake at the present moment, and during the whole of this war, is the maintenance of our neutrality, the preservation of our State and of the lives of our people, and if there is a continuance of questions of this sort, I shall have to ask the House to give to the Ceann Comhairle, or to some other authority, the power to exclude them from the Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was in the interests of the preservation of our neutrality that I put down this question to-day, in order to make sure that we would not have in our country the spies to whom Deputy Dillon referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are responsible for the maintenance of the policy of the State.  That is their prime duty, and if the Government do not fulfil their duties properly, there is a remedy for the House and the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister for External Affairs is aware, every responsible member of the House would agree with what he has just stated, but that agreement would be fuller if what the Minister has stated could be applied not only to questions in the House but to some speeches made outside the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not so that in any case where, when a question has been put down by a responsible Deputy which has seemed to the Minister for External Affairs to be inexpedient in some special circumstances, a request has been made by him to that Deputy to withdraw the question from the Order Paper, the question has been readily withdrawn?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a fact that it has in all cases been withdrawn.  In fact, it puts the Minister concerned in a humiliating position.  It ought not <Col N="1913" /> to be necessary to have to go to a Deputy and beg him not to put the question on the Paper.  I think there should be some machinery in the House, through the Ceann Comhairle or some other authority, by which it could be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. L. Cosgrave Mr. L. Cosgrave">

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I suggest, as a way out, that, in connection with the original proposals regarding censorship of Dáil records, it was suggested, and my recollection is that it was agreed, that where a speech made by a Deputy might require to be censored &mdash;and the same would now apply to a question&mdash;a committee consisting of the leaders of the various Parties would be called to rule on it?  I think there would always be a very reasonable ruling given by such a committee, and it would take the direct responsibility off an officer of the House, which is an undesirable responsibility, and place it back where it should lie, on the shoulders of the whole House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been very loth to mention this matter at all.  I had hoped that the sense of responsibility in every member of the Dáil at a time like this would be sufficient guarantee that questions such as have been sent to me recently would not be asked.  I do not know what powers the Ceann Comhairle has.  Deputy Dillon seems to suggest that the Ceann Comhairle already has such powers.  I am not quite sure if that is a fact.  But I personally would welcome any group, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges or any other Committee, that might assist the Ceann Comhairle. I have only one difficulty in accepting that completely and that is, that the reasons for which it may be inadvisable to have the question asked&mdash;reasons which would be known to the Minister &mdash;may be of a type which it would not be advisable to communicate outside. It is difficult enough in times like this to preserve the necessary secrecy so that remours and all sorts of things will not be started.  Speaking of rumours, I want to say that I have been told that there is a good deal of public uneasiness at the moment and <Col N="1914" /> I simply want to say that there is no need for that uneasiness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had occasion from time to time on behalf of this Party to give consideration to the question of submitting questions to the Taoiseach on certain national matters of importance, and I think the Taoiseach will be the first to acknowledge that in all these matters I consulted with him in the first instance and that whenever it was suggested that the submission of a question was in any way calculated to interfere with our good relations with other Powers the question was immediately withdrawn. So far as the Labour Party is concerned, we have no desire whatever to embarrass the Government in any way by the submission of questions which are likely in any way to embroil us with belligerents.  If the Taoiseach at any time expresses the opinion on behalf of the whole community that he does not desire a particular matter to be put to him which would embarrass him by giving a public answer, we have at all times completely consented to respect the Taoiseach's wishes in that respect.  I think that even within the last 24 hours the Taoiseach has been conscious of our co-operation with him in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the Deputy and to say that what he has said is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Taoiseach has chosen to raise this matter in this peculiar form, I wish to say that, so far as I am aware, any responsible Deputy putting down a question about critical matters has suffered himself very largely to be guided by the Taoiseach's view as to whether his question is calculated to injure the fundamental interests of the State or not.  But I do not think any Party in this House, on reflection, should accept the principle that individual Deputies should be expected to accept censorship of their questions by Ministers of State.  The Parliamentary question is the most potent weapon in the hand of an individual Deputy against the Executive. Its use with discretion is the responsibility <Col N="1915" /> of the individual Deputy.  If the Taoiseach makes the case that any one amongst us has habitually used it without any regard to his warnings as to the dangers to the State that may be involved, the matter may have to be reviewed.  I would, however, urge most strongly on the House not in any spirit of panic to surrender the right of the individual Deputy to put such questions as he deems it is his duty to do.  I beg the House to reflect very carefully on the suggestion that the discretion of the individual Deputy should be taken away and handed over either to a committee of the House or the Executive as to whether a question should be asked or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is about two weeks ago since I discussed this matter with some responsible people in this House.  I have very often wondered what some people mean by the questions they put down here, what is at the back of their heads which has prompted them to put forward such questions, because I believe some of the questions&mdash;not the one on the Order Paper at the moment&mdash;that have been put down here during the past fortnight have been no help or no addition to this country either internally or externally, and the people that are behind them and who put their names to them are not, in my opinion, quite so innocent or so innocently led&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Deputy that it would be wiser to go on general lines rather than to single out any particular questions or Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I made a suggestion to some important people in this House, and I still stand behind it, that something should be done to curb and prevent this class of thing.  It may be all right to say: &ldquo;Do not interfere with the individual Deputy; the Parliamentary Question is a great instrument.&rdquo; It is for the country no doubt, but many questions are not an instrument that is of any addition to our country.  If people only realise the position, they may not put down those questions.  Speaking for the <Col N="1916" /> Party of which I have the honour to be the Leader here, I can guarantee to the Taoiseach and the Government and to all sincere Parties in this House that anything we can do in any committee, either inside or outside this House, to curb that class of thing we will gladly do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesPPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the National Labour Party, I should like to join in the assurances given to the Taoiseach in this matter.  We fully recognise that some questions raised here recently have caused nation-wide uneasiness and, personally, I sincerely hope that to-day's question is the last of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the indulgence of the Chair for intervening in this unusual manner.  I think that perhaps what has been said will be sufficient.  I am the last person in the House who would wish to curb any Deputy or interfere with his rights. Perhaps what has been said will be sufficient without doing anything further.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will state if it is the diploma of the Royal Veterinary College in England that successful students receive in the Veterinary College at Ballsbridge; and if he will state if any body in this State has power to grant a veterinary diploma or degree to students in this college.</P>

      <P>The diploma awarded to successful students at the Veterinary College, Balisbridge, is that of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons to which the college, in common with the other veterinary colleges in Great Britain and Ireland, is affiliated.  The Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons is not a teaching institution, but an examining body which controls the standard of and carries out the examinations of the affiliated colleges. This is the only diploma in veterinary science which will legally entitle the holder to practise veterinary medicine and surgery in Great Britain and Ireland. The control of veterinary surgeons in Ireland is exercised by the Veterinary Council set up by the Veterinary Surgeons Act, 1931, and no person can practise as a veterinary <Col N="1920" /> surgeon in Ireland unless his name is on the Register of Veterinary Surgeons controlled by the Irish Veterinary Council.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>These negotiations, if successful, would provide for a degree in veterinary medicine here, but that degree would only entitle a person to practise veterinary medicine here.

Beidh na scéimeanna sin ag braith ar aontú Aire an Oideachais. Ordú a tugadh sa Dara Dáil a thug comhacht i dtosach scéimeanna a cheapadh agus ráta a leagan i gcóir na scoláireachtaí sin.  Nuair a ritheadh an tAcht um Rialtas Aitiúil (Forálacha Sealadacha), 1923, tugadh an chomhacht sin ann in Alt a 17.  Ach hathghairmeadh go hiomlán Acht na bliana 1923, nuair a ritheadh Acht Rialtais Aitiúil na bliana 1941.  Ar an ábhar sin, níorbh fhuláir dlí a dhéanamh leis an gcomhacht a bhí ag Udaráis Aitiúla scéimeanna den chineál sin a leagan amach agus a riaradh a fhágáil acu.  Ní hamháin sin ach bhí sé riachtanach leis na scéimeanna atá i bhfeidhm fá láthair agus a bhí i bhfeidhm ó hathghairmeadh Acht na bliana 1923 a dhéanamh dleathach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On gcéad lá ar bunuíodh na scéimeanna sin, fuair 6,000 duine idir buachaillí agus cailíní oideachas Meánscoile no Gairm-Oideachas dá mbárr. Cé's moite de chupla cás, daoine iad sin nach mbeadh deis acu a leitheid d'oideachas fháil marach é.  Níl bliain dá dteigheann thart nach dtagann athrú ar líon na gComhairlí a cheapas a leitheidí de scéimeanna, do réir mar <Col N="1927" /> fheileas dóibh a dhéanamh.  Cuireann sé ríméad orm a rá, áfach, nach bhfuilComhairle ná Bárdas in Eirinn, ach ceann amháin, nach bhfuil fútha scéimeanna a cheapadh i gcóir na bliana 1944.  Má smaoinítear ar an droch-bhail atá ar an saol fá láthair ní bréag ar bith a rá nach ro-ioncháinte an socrú fá chóir scoláireachtaí atá dhá dhéanamh i láthair na huaire ag na Comhairlí céanna.  Ach do réir mar thiocfas malairt cóir ar an saol, tá súil agam go mbeidh ar chumas na nUdarás Aitiúil cur lena gcuid scéimeanna, agus go bhféadfa siad tuille airgid a chur ar fáil do mhalraigh nach mbeadh sé de bhrabach ortha thar oideachas bunscoile fháil, sin dá bhféadaidís a chruthú trí scrúdú no eile go mbeadh ar a gcumas tairbhe a bhaint as an deis a tiubharfaí dhóibh ar oideachas níos fearr fháil.</P>
    <P>Gidh gurb iad na hUdaráis Aitiúla, mar adubhras cheana, a chuireann ceann ar gach scéim, agus gur as na rátaí a thagas an t-airgead ina gcóir, socruíodh leis an Aire Riaghaltais Aiteamhail gur ar Roinn an Oideachais, o cheart, ba chóir cúram an Bhille seo a bheith, thárla dlúthbhaint a bheith aige le cúrsaí oideachais.</P>
    <P>Glacadh mar bhonn don Bhille seo leis na socruithe i gcóir na scéimeanna seo a bhí in Alt 17 d'Acht na bliana 1923.  Ach de thairbhe an eolais a cuireadh o shoin i leith ar riaradh na scéimeanna, gan trácht ar na hathruithe a tháinig o thaobh riartha ar rialú áitiúil féin, ceaptar nach fuláir socrú níos cruinne a dhéanamh maidir le modh oibre agus modh riartha na scéimeanna seo sa saol atá romhainn. Ceist a scrúduíodh go mion, ar chóir iallach a chur ar Udaráis Áitiúla socrú a dhéanamh i gcóir scoláireachtaí no ar chóir a fhágáil fútha féin sin a dhéanamh mar a bhí in Acht na bliana 1923.  Taréis gach ní a chur san áireamh shocruigh mé gur fútha féin a fágfaí scéimeanna a cheapadh no gan a cheapadh.</P>
    <P>Fá'n socrú nua isé an tUdarás Áitiúil a cheapfas scéim dó féin agus ansin cuirfe sé ós cóir Aire an Oideachais é.  Tig leis an Aire aontú no gan aontú le haon chuid de.  No go <Col N="1928" /> n-aontuighe seisean leis ní thiocfaidh aon scéim i bhfeidhm.  Má dhiúltuíonn an tAire aontú leis ní thiocfa sé i bhfeidhm no go ndéantar athrú air do réir mar mheasann seisean a bheith riachtanach.  Is cuma cén scéim a ceapfar ní thig le dalta scoláireacht fháil gan scrúdú oideachais a sheasamh. Ach is gnás a bhí ann, agus ní gá aon athrú a dhéanamh air sa mBille seo, é bheith de chead ag Udaráis Áitiúla pé socrú fá leith a dhéanamh a mheasas siad a bheith riachtanach dá gceanntar féin, sin má bhíonn brí agus bunús leis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to have the Minister's observations regarding Sections 6 and 7 of the Bill.  As he has observed, in Section 6, which deals with the approval of the Minister to the award of scholarships, he has taken to himself power to reject the scheme for examinations drawn up by Dublin Corporation, which, I may say in passing, like the other bodies affected, have to foot the bill in connection with these scholarships.  I think that we shall all agree&mdash;the Minister is, I am sure, quite satisfied&mdash;that Dublin Corporation have carried out this scheme to his satisfaction and with great success.  Under the Dublin Corporation Scholarship Scheme it is provided in Section 5, paragraph (b), in regard to conditions for passing the examination, that</P>
      <P>&ldquo;for the purpose of placing in order of merit those candidates who pass the examination the total marks obtained by each candidate in the four obligatory subjects will be reckoned,&rdquo;</P>
      <P>and so on.  Under the Bill the Minister is taking power to himself to award these scholarships.  He is not leaving it to the corporation or other public bodies who are to provide the money for the scholarships to do that. I do not think that is reasonable, and I would like to hear what the Minister has to say.</P>

In some counties it is to be regretted that there are no such schemes at all.  As far as can be seen, the Minister is not taking power under the Bill to stimulate local authorities to provide scholarships, nor is it the intention evidently to provide any inducement to local bodies to establish and maintain scholarships. Everyone is in agreement with the general principle of scholarships if they are correctly used and applied for the benefit of the individual holders of them, for the locality in which they are given and for the State as a whole.  Therefore, I think that the House would be quite agreeable that steps should be taken to do everything possible to promote and have a widespread diffusion of the scholarship idea: to make scholarships accessible to the members of the community, particularly their sons and daughters who, under the present economic system, are precluded from receiving higher education.</P>
      <P>The Bill, as I have said, does not contain any provision to develop the idea of scholarships generally, but under it the Minister appears to be taking too much power to himself.  He evidently requires central control in many directions where hitherto it has been absent.  It is a moot point whether the giving of this control over scholarships to the Minister will be good for the whole idea of scholarships or will be of advantage to those who are in most need of the benefits of scholarships.  The Minister has in every case to approve of schemes.  I take it that there is to be little local autonomy in the matter.  Everything will become more or less standardised. A certain amount of standardisation might be good, but too much of it does not take cognisance of local conditions.  It does not relate those scholarships, for instance, to local industries&mdash;the needs of different industries whether it be agriculture or other industries which are considered to be best by the people in touch with local conditions&mdash;and, therefore, would not, I submit, be of benefit to the State at large, and certainly would not be to the benefit of local initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1930" /> It is provided in Section 3, in the case of schemes which are submitted, that alterations, if there are any, shall not be made without the previous approval of the Minister.  That idea runs right through the Bill.  Section 7 is the only section in which one finds perhaps a gleam of hope for the local people.  Under it they may still retain some sort of initiative in determining, as I understand it, the actual number of scholarships and the value of them. That is to be a reserved function to the local council.  We all agree that it is a necessary and correct provision if the council is going to determine the total number of scholarships.  If the council is going to pay the piper, then certainly one would imagine that it would call the tune in a much more definite fashion than it is enabled to do under this Bill.</P>
    <P>In Section 5 the Minister enters into the greatest detail in regard to his control.  Not only shall he prescribe the examination tests and the age limits under this section, but he may, in respect of any examination, prescribe the subjects of such tests, the time and the place and the persons by whom they are to be held.  He is even taking power to determine and fix the percentage of marks at such tests as will be necessary to qualify for a scholarship.  My submission is that that is taking the matter too far.  That the central authority should so determine may have some relevancy to the question of standardisation, but experience in regard to these examinations shows that any very rigid plan, particularly in regard to the percentage marks to be obtained in order to qualify, sometimes imposes a great hardship on those sitting for the examination.  In many cases it actually works in the contrary direction, as those who have experience of examinations know.  Where the qualifying standard is fixed at a particular level&mdash; the examiner after all is only human&mdash; in order to make certain that the scholarships which have been voted by the local councils are obtained and used by candidates, there will occur, in fact, a diminution of the standard in the marking of papers under such schemes, rather than have the scholarships <Col N="1931" /> going a-begging.  That is particularly the case when there are quite a number of scholarships.  The last to qualify, if it were just a straightforward matter of putting them in the order of merit, may not come up to the high standard set by the Minister in this section, with the result, perhaps, that students who, in many cases, are on the border line, will not derive benefit for a year, and that may impose a great hardship on them and it may prevent them, by reason of the age limit, from competing in the following year.</P>
    <P>I submit that the general principle of fixing too rigidly the qualifying level, the percentage of marks, is not in the best interests of education and, in fact, is not observed by some of the best known examination bodies in other countries.  For instance, the Royal Society of Arts, which is probably the largest examining body in Great Britain or in the English-speaking world, for many subjects, consistently refuses to disclose what is the qualifying level at which it will award certificates&mdash;and these certificates are recognised by our Department of Education; they constitute, in fact, teachers' qualifications in many cases.</P>
    <P>I make those observations in passing to show that it is not the practice of those bodies, which have a long tradition in education and in examinations such as this, to confine too rigidly the qualification award to any pre-determined level.  I submit, therefore, that the principle of the Bill, while it may be correct in so far as it regularises the whole question of scholarships, is still defective in so far as it is intended to place too great a power in the hands of the Minister.  It is in keeping with many other measures which have been passed by this Assembly.  It follows along the line of centralising everything, destroying to some extent local initiative and, as that always has a retrograde effect.  I feel that when this Bill is under examination on later stages a more liberal interpretation of the whole position should be given to it by the Minister and that he should relax his control in a great many of the cases indicated under this Bill.</P>
    <Col N="1932" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think one of the greatest defects in our educational system is our attempt to have too rigid a curriculum, our attempt at standardisation, our attempt to turn out a type.  I think we have inherited that from the British system. With their highly industrialised outlook, they strive simply to turn out a type to suit industrial purposes.  That sort of thing, I suggest, is not in keeping with our conditions here, and yet we are still slavishly following that idea.  It is running right through this Bill, as Deputy Connolly has stated.</P>
      <P>The Minister reserves to himself almost complete control; he takes the control out of the hands of the local authority.  It is true that the local authority has power to initiate a scheme, but the Minister reserves the right to select the subjects.  Why should he have the right to decide the subjects for an examination test in areas in this country where the people might have a peculiar outlook, or where the conditions might be somewhat different from those of other areas?  I suggest that in doing that the Minister is simply trying to standardise education, having all the time at the back of his mind the examination test and the cramming and all the other evils that result from that system.</P>
      <P>One thing that strikes me about the Bill is the absence of any provision for a scholarships committee.  People in a particular area may be interested in education and may be anxious to give their services voluntarily on such a committee.  Should the local authority feel it necessary to call on such men to formulate a scholarship scheme, there is no machinery provided here for the purpose.  If you take an average county council, the members of that body may not be fitted to go into these matters in great detail, and therefore I suggest some provision should be made here for a scholarship committee.</P>
      <P>In Section 7 it is set out that the expenses of carrying a scheme into operation will be a reserved function of the local authority and Section 2 (1) says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1933" />&ldquo;The corporation of a county borough, or the council of a county may, whenever it so thinks proper, prepare and submit to the Minister a scheme for the provision of scholarships in accordance with this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that at present it is not a reserved function of the local authority to prepare such a scheme.  The preparation of a scholarship scheme at present is the function of the manager.  It seems to me an extraordinary state of affairs that that sort of work, under another Act, is reserved to the county manager, work which ought to belong to the representatives of the people.  If they feel it necessary and desirable, they should be in a position to select a scholarship committee which will go carefully into the subjects for the examination test.  That is the system that we operated in the past, but since the County Management Act came into operation it is the county manager who now prepares the scheme and sets out what subjects are to be included in the examination test.</P>
    <P>I think that position should be cleared up under this Bill.  It would appear that the county manager is not brought in except in Section 7 (2), where it is clearly stated that the only thing that is reserved to the local authority is the provision of funds. There are other aspects that might usefully be brought into the scheme, and it would be well to have them embodied in this measure.  We could, for instance, ensure that where finances are provided some preference should be given to remote districts.  It is true that where there are children from all classes of the community so situated that they are near a good national school and have no difficulty in travelling, it would be hardly fair to put them in examinations against children from the remote or more backward districts.  That would be putting the children in the remote districts at a disadvantage.  So far as the children of the poorer classes are concerned, their condition ought not to be overlooked.</P>
    <P>We should make some effort to ensure that people placed in a disadvantageous <Col N="1934" /> position should have their interests looked after, so that they can secure their fair share of whatever public funds are available.  I object to the Minister taking such autocratic powers.  I do not think the power should be given to one individual in the City of Dublin to determine what are to be the subjects for examination for this scholarship.  I think they should be determined by local conditions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">

      <P>These scholarships play a very important part in our general education system and, in my opinion, any legislation calculated either to extend or to place them on a higher basis is certainly to be welcomed. Like Deputy Hughes I am concerned with the Bill as far as Sections 2 and 7 are concerned.  The sections seem to be contradictory.  It is true that Section 7 says that the particular function in a county borough is a reserved function as far as the finance end is concerned.  That raises the whole question of the County Management Act with which we will probably be dealing in Private Deputies' time at a later stage.  It is interesting that we should be up against it in this comparatively small matter.  If a corporation or a county council is called upon to pay for scholarships they will obviously do so on a scheme presented by them, but they will have no voice in the matter.  I suggest that, in this rather important matter, a county council or a county borough, as the case may be, should be more closely brought into play in relation to scholarships.  As far as Dublin is concerned I am glad to say that the city manager has permitted the setting up of a scholarship committee.  That committee has done valuable work in so far as the scholarships are concerned. That scheme is working very satisfactorily in the city.  I am interested to learn from the Minister if it is intended to make any serious departure in so far as tests are concerned, as set out in Section 5?</P>

So far as it has been within the province of a local council to look after that end, all that is necessary, as far as I am aware, was approval of the scheme.  May I suggest to the Minister that there is one defect that he might consider in this Bill?  In so far as primary scholarships are concerned, they are from primary to secondary schools.  They are usually available at secondary colleges while vocational schools are excluded or are to be.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>No.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am aware no facilities have been extended in that direction.  I do not know if that is due to the fact that the recipients of scholarships do not desire to go to vocational schools.  I understood there was some specific exclusion on that ground.  If that is so, having regard to the extension of vocational education, and of the part that these schools play, they should be definitely eligible under these scholarships.  As far as university scholarships are concerned they have been most valuable in the city up to a certain point, but economic conditions have cut across their utility.  These scholarships are value for £80 in Dublin and less elsewhere. Roughly 12 scholarships were awarded in Dublin to those who had the highest marks in the leaving certificate. Subsequently boys who took scholarships were not able to continue because of economic circumstances and availed of the first opportunity to leave either for the Civil Service or for some commercial examination. A question may arise as to how far the utility of a scholarship has relation to money value.  My experience is that, as far as the city is concerned, it was not an exceedingly happy one up to the time that we had to raise the value of these scholarships.  Since then there have been better results.  I am glad to have an assurance from the Minister that it is not his intention to change the form of the test.  In that way there will be a certain amount of local autonomy.  I appeal to the Minister to permit a continuance of the unofficial arrangement we have, whereby scholarship committees will be set <Col N="1936" /> up to act in conjunction with the manager in matters of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister at any time decided how the means test is applied to parents of children whose teachers say that they should be allowed to enter for these examinations? I have been recently informed &mdash;I am sure my colleagues in the corporation are aware of this&mdash;of what appeared to be an injustice to parents who want their children to be allowed to sit for these examinations.  Is the Minister aware that a man who earns £5 a week and who has two children cannot enter these children for these scholarships?  If he has three children and £5 a week they are allowed to compete.  If he has a few shillings over £5 a week and three children they are not eligible.  I consider that to be an injustice to many parents who because of their frugality have house purchase and other commitments to meet.  Parents' means are taken into consideration by local committees on county councils and county boroughs.  The award of a scholarship in Dublin is a reserved function of the city manager.  I want to say of the Dublin City Manager that while he hears the views of the committees, and is most agreeable in every way, he has to have regard to the fact that the Minister may not sanction a scheme if the income of a parent is limited to £5 a week.  I consider the means test to be too severe.  Where a parent has to meet house purchase instalments, or insurance, or has to maintain a dependent relative an allowance should be made for each commitment so as to bring the means within the limit. Nobody can say that a man who earns £5 a week and who has-three children is well off.  I do not know how such people manage to meet their commitments on that income.  I think it is unfair that the child of a man with £5 5/- a week should not be allowed to compete for scholarships.  If the Minister would express the view that the amount of the means test should be increased we would all be agreeable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill in so far as there is an extension of the <Col N="1937" /> powers of councils to provide other than primary education for the mass of our children.  I should like the Bill to go further and to apportion a definite sum out of the rates for scholarship purposes.  That might be considered by many people an extreme view.  I know that it is hard to fix a definite proportion to suit different parts of the country.  In some places educational facilities are provided that are almost the equal of scholarships.</P>
      <P>If you take children fortunate enough to live beside the Christian Brothers' schools where the education is very cheap, they have not the same necessity as children living in remote places, and certain districts would require proportionately more than other districts just for that reason.  But there is a poor public spirit in the matter of scholarships in this country. In other countries, we see successful businessmen and successful industrialists endowing schools and colleges in such a way as to enable them to award scholarships.  Unfortunately, that is not the case in this country, and that is why I am glad to see that councils and public bodies are being encouraged to take up this matter to the fullest possible extent.</P>
      <P>Now, with regard to the powers of the Minister, so far as his powers have been criticised here to-day, I think the criticism is unfair.  I believe there ought to be some over-riding authority outside the council itself in the matter of the subjects chosen and the marks given and the other conditions affecting the awards of scholarships.  It is all very well to say that the councils and other authorities pay the piper and should have the right to call the tune, but the great point is that they do not pay the piper out of their own pockets.  If they supplied the money directly out of their pockets they would have a perfect right to call the tune, but that is not the case.</P>

      <P>The point I am making, if you give me time to develop it, is that while it is not likely that the award of these scholarships would be very much abused, none of us can deny that the possibility is there, and I have seen people clamouring in various counties&mdash;mostly people belonging to the Deputy's own Party&mdash;to have the setting of the examination papers taken out of the hands of the local councils.  I have seen that done in my own county and, I think, rightly so, because the possibility is there that if the councils have the decision in the matter, it is human nature that they might have, at least, a bias in favour of the child of one of their colleagues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that very few city managers or county managers would object to the setting up of an advisory committee of the members of the council, and from my knowledge of what is being done throughout the country, I believe that the managers would be perfectly fair and amenable. I have the honour of being the chairman of the scholarships committee of the Dublin Corporation, and we drafted schemes and submitted them to the city manager and they have been accepted and acted upon very fairly.  I think it would be a good thing if every council selected from its members a number of people interested in this matter of education and qualified to advise the manager.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1939" /> It would be a very good thing for every council and I feel quite sure that, when these schemes are drafted, if they are drafted reasonably and well, the Minister will not interfere in the matter beyond ensuring that a proper and right standard is set up. I know it is very difficult to deal with remote districts.  It is one of these problems in which it is hard to suggest a remedy.  There are children who are tremendously handicapped by not having schools of a good type in their neighbourhood and there are some other children three or four miles away from any sort of school at all.  Naturally, the schools are very small in these remote areas.  Each teacher has to take three or four classes in the small schools and to provide anything like the education necessary for a boy or girl is a very difficult thing.  If something could be done to level up the situation with regard to these children who are anæmic, it would be a very good thing.</P>
    <P>On the whole, I approve of this Bill, but I should like to see it go much further&mdash;in more than one direction, possibly.  For instance, with regard to this question of university scholarships, I am afraid to look at that matter at all, because university scholarships may be awarded to a type of student to whom they should not be awarded.  For instance, you have a type of scholarship awarded by the Dublin Corporation at the moment, but that scholarship is confined to people within the particular area.  We are tied, in the awarding of such scholarships, to candidates within our own area, and I think it is a pity that that should be so.  I think it is a pity that we should not be enabled to accept candidates from any part of the country, but under the present law we are restricted to take candidates from our own area.  I foresee that it might be many years before we might get a suitable candidate from Dublin for one of these scholarships, and I do not see why we should not be allowed to award these scholarships to students from other parts of the country.  It is quite possible that you might have a suitable candidate from some other part <Col N="1940" /> of the country offering himself for this scholarship, the result of whose work might be of wonderful benefit to the country as a whole; and if you can get a proper type of candidate for these scholarships, I do not see why they should be confined to one particular area.  I think that the area should be extended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to be able to assure the Dáil that the Department of Education has found that the arrangements made by the Dublin Corporation in regard to scholarships have been found to be uniformly satisfactory. The existing scheme provides that, subject to the rules and regulations contained in an approved scheme, scholarships shall be awarded, subject to examination in the following subjects: Irish, English, Arithmetic, History and Geography, Algebra, Geometry, Drawing, Nature Study, and Needlework.  Candidates must answer in the first four of these subjects, and, in any two, but no more than two of the remaining subjects.  It is pointed out that, subject to these rules and to the regulations contained in an approved scheme, scholarships shall be awarded in the order of merit as determined by examination, and the subjects of examination are set out in the order I have stated already.  Certain subjects are optional and others are compulsory, but I must say that in regard to the people marking these papers, they are independent; they do not know what papers they are marking, nor from what county the students come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any knowledge of what political Party the students belong to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of anybody who has any more knowledge of the procedure in these cases than Deputy Larkin has, it would be unnecessary to ask that question.  We pride ourselves in this country that, so far as markers and examiners appointed by the State are concerned, they are generally beyond reproach.  The markers in the case of examination papers are independent; they do not know whose <Col N="1941" /> papers they are marking, nor from what county the students come.  The scholarships are awarded to those who show that they will benefit by continued education.  Now and again, of course, there may be mistakes, but I am glad to say that during my term of office as Minister for Education, I have had no complaint with regard to the examination or marking of papers in connection with these scholarships.  It will be understood, of course, that a certain standard must be attained in order to warrant the award of a scholarship, because, otherwise, scholarships might be awarded to candidates who were not of sufficient merit.  The examination test is subject to the approval of the Minister for Education, but that does not mean that the local authority concerned may not depart from the particular type of test or examination required.  It is obviously a convenience and an economy to have a general test laid down, but we are not tying down local authorities to that one test.  The alternative is provided in Section 5, subsection (3) of the Bill, which says that different examination tests, including different qualifying percentages of marks and different age limits, may be prescribed in respect of different scholarships, whether comprised in the same or different schemes.</P>
      <P>I take it that the functions of the Minister there would be to see that no unfairness to candidates would occur.  It might be a very good thing that the Minister should have nothing to do with a scheme drawn up by a local authority, but a line must be drawn somewhere, in cases where there is question of inequalities or inequities; particularly as there was some doubt as to whether, in the original Act, the Minister had power to approve schemes.  Section 17 of the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923, says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The tests of ability to be satisfied by students under that section shall be prescribed in a scheme to be formulated for the purpose of the section by the council of the county or county borough in accordance with rules to be made by the Minister <Col N="1942" /> for Education, and that no such scheme shall have any effect unless and until approved by the Minister for Education.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that, as regards the scheme in general, it has to have the previous sanction of the Minister for Education, but whether the Minister for Education, believing that there is a certain inequity or inequality in the scheme, has the power to compel the local authority concerned to amend it, in order to meet the Minister's wishes, is a moot point.  Up to the present, we have always proceeded by way of persuasion, and if we felt that certain conditions, laid down by local authorities, were inequitable, we asked them to amend them.  The purpose of the present measure, apart from seeing that the money is provided and that the existing schemes will be validated, is to ensure that the Minister will clearly have power and be within his legal rights in asking a local authority to make certain amendments where he is not satisfied, and where he considers that such amendments should be made.</P>
    <P>I cannot foresee, nor do I believe, that it will occur that a local authority will seek to impose conditions that would clearly be unworkable or inequitable&mdash;conditions to which a Minister would have to refuse sanction. Some local authorities have provided very excellent schemes, and I must say that we have had no trouble where the scheme was properly thought out by people who had had long experience in education.  I must say that, since the beginning, where responsible persons were concerned, we have had no trouble, but in other cases we have had it where councils from year to year or the majorities on councils for the time being, have tried to amend the conditions, no doubt believing that it was in the general interest that they should be so amended.  It may happen that there is a difficulty in getting a local authority to see eye to eye with the Department of Education in the matter and, as I have already said, the purpose of the measure is to make it <Col N="1943" /> clear that if the Minister gives reasons and shows that a particular scheme should be amended, that some of its conditions are not acceptable, there should be no question but that he should have legal authority to ask that the amendments he has suggested be included.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne has referred to the means test and, of course, that is a very serious and important matter.  I cannot deal with it at the moment except by way of saying, with regard to the particular scheme in Dublin, that it is entirely a matter within the discretion of the local authority if they wish to amend it.  I could not say in advance what my attitude would be if they should so amend it, but if good reasons are given for amending it, and that it seems clear enough that no serious departure from what would be fair and reasonable is proposed, then the tendency in the Department would be to recommend to me that the scheme should be sanctioned.  In general I think the Minister should see to it that, while scholarship money should be distributed so that a reasonable number of persons would benefit, the value of the scholarships should not be reduced in such a way as to make them of little practical use to the recipients.  If we are not satisfied that the amount of money or the number of recipients is sufficient, the proper way out, I suggest, is to make additional provision and to give more scholarships but not to cut down on the existing ones.</P>
    <P>There have been suggestions of discriminations for one reason or another occasionally.  I think it is well recognised that, in some districts, rural schools are at a certain disadvantage as compared with well-staffed city schools or schools in large towns which may be able to make special preparation for examination tests for scholarships.  In such cases, there has come into being the custom of putting aside a certain number of the scholarships for candidates from rural areas. I think that is reasonable enough, provided again that it is not carried to excess, that there is not an effort to <Col N="1944" /> load the dice completely against the child living in an urban area and that, in general, regard is had to the relative proportions of the population under the jurisdiction of the local authority living in town and country.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Byrne's question, I would point out that Section 4 (c) provides for the scheme prescribing a means test and that 4 (d) makes provision for the award of a scholarship with a reduction in the amount, when the means of the parents is somewhat more than the limit laid down. Clause (e) goes further and says that in certain cases, with the approval of the Minister, the local authority may award in special circumstances the whole or part of a scholarship to a person who does not comply with the means test provisions.  There may be cases where the amount in question is very little&mdash;£1 or perhaps more than £1; I should not like to say at the moment what the amount might be&mdash; in excess of the income laid down and yet it would deprive the child of the scholarship, but, of course, we have to draw the line somewhere.  While we have that provision there, it is to meet very exceptional circumstances.  We cannot assume that local authorities would have a right to seek to evade the provisions they themselves had laid down for a means test or to get over these provisions by recommending&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>May I interrupt for a moment to say that I think the point I made has been lost sight of? I referred, not to the right of a council to award scholarships, but to the right of a council to permit the children of certain parents to enter for scholarships.  At the present moment, the third child of a man in the City of Dublin who is earning £5 2s. 0d. or £5 5s. 0d. per week is not eligible to sit for a scholarship.  That is the means test to which I wish to draw attention.  Would it not be possible to extend the limit so as to allow the child of a man in receipt of £5 5s. 0d. per week, with three children, to enter for a scholarship, having regard to the fact that the man by his own frugality may have entered on a house purchase <Col N="1945" /> scheme or into insurance commitments?</P>

      <P>I think it is a matter for the corporation to amend the scheme if it is considered necessary, but if the Deputy has referred by way of parenthesis to the limitations sometimes imposed in schemes upon the number of children from a particular household who may be awarded scholarships, I must say that it is a kind of provision that I do not favour.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I have not made myself clear.  I know that, in the City of Dublin, the children of a man earning £5 a week and with only two children, are not allowed to enter for scholarships at all because he has £5 a week.  If he has three children, the allowance for a third child just brings him within the limits, but if that man is now getting, say £5 5s. 0d. a week his children are immediately disqualified under our scheme.  I want to know is it the council that is responsible for fixing the means test which prevents the child of such a man from entering at all for the scholarship?</P>

      <P>I should like to say in reply to Deputy M. O'Sullivan that scholarships may be held in vocational schools.  As the first section in the Bill indicates, scholarships may be awarded to holders to be tenable in certain kinds of schools.  They are not confined at all to a particular kind of school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hughes referred to the question of committees.  As has been stated, this whole question is likely to arise on a motion before the House, but I see by a circular which has been issued by the Department of Local <Col N="1946" /> Government and Public Health on the 27th January, dealing with the whole question of the managerial system that as regards committees the appointment of permissive committees by county councils has also given rise to some misunderstanding.  The circular goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Under the Act the functions of the county council may be divided into three classes.  There are the reserved functions which are performed directly by the council, and the executive functions which are performed through and by the manager.  There is, however, in addition to the reserved functions another group of functions (which might be referred to as the &lsquo;supervisory powers&rsquo; of the council) to be performed directly by the council. These functions arise partly as a consequence of the council's financial control and partly from the special powers provided in the Act of 1940 which are exercisable by resolution. They include a general power to supervise the performance by the manager of the executive functions, power to examine and revise the estimates, power to obtain information and plans, and power to direct the manager to do specified things.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The provisions applying to the appointment of committees by county councils are Section 18 of the County Management Act, 1940, and Section 58 of the Local Government Act, 1925.  The effect of these sections is to preserve the powers of the council to appoint committees with the sole restriction that no executive function can be delegated to a committee except by the manager.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As far as the executive functions are concerned, arrangements may be made by the manager, I presume, and his staff to work in collaboration with the committee but, as far as the advisory power which, I think, is what is connoted by the powers of a scholarship committee generally, is concerned, I think there is no doubt, judging by that circular, that local authorities have the same powers now <Col N="1947" /> as they always have had to appoint scholarship committees and to utilise them as far as may be necessary.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the fact that more should be done to stimulate local aid in the way of providing scholarships. During the 20 odd years in which these schemes have been in operation, local authorities have shown themselves generally very ready and willing to provide money for schemes.  In the present year I find there are 1,466 scholarships held, the value of which is £35,000.  Last year the amount awarded in the way of new scholarships, of which there were 343, was £8,000.  As I said, there is only one local authority which has refused, so far at any rate, to make provision for scholarships.  Of course, this measure does not deal with university scholarships.  It deals only with scholarships from primary to other schools.  I endorse completely what Deputy Butler has said and I hope in the course of time it will be possible, in spite of the difficulties that I know local authorities have and the many calls upon them, to make even greater provision for education in this way. Unfortunately, not so much money is bequeathed for the endowment of education in Ireland as one would expect having regard to our special interest in cultural and spiritual affairs, and to our very distinctive position in the world in that connection.  Compared with Scotland, for example, we seem to lag very greatly behind.  There is a long tradition of educational endowment in Scotland, going back for hundreds of years, and it is quite usual in the Highland parishes to find good endowments which enable boys to go all the way to the university from the local school.  We have not these endowments here.  For university education, as for education in general, we have to depend on the taxpayer and the ratepayer to foot the bill.  Now that we have a certain lease of self-government and are trying to build up our own institutions, I hope that our citizens who are in a position to endow education from their private resources will do so and that our country will have something worthy <Col N="1948" /> to show in that respect as well as in others.</P>
    <P>If Deputies fear, from the wording of this measure, that there is some arbitrary attempt to impose upon councils the wishes of the Minister in regard to their schemes, I should like to say that that is not the position. Where you have schemes like those in Dublin or other areas which have been satisfactory, there is no intention whatever of interfering, but where there are cases of certain restrictions being imposed which my advisers and I consider undesirable and where we communicate our view to the local authority there must be finality at some point.  Up to the present we have not experienced a great many of these difficulties, but we have come across cases where it seemed as if efforts were being made to discriminate or to impose tests which might not be considered equitable when carefully examined by experts, though they may, on the face of them, appear reasonable to the man in the street.  I have no doubt that they may be reasonable in certain conditions, such as the case to which I referred, where a certain proportion of scholarships is kept for children from rural schools.  But if, out of ten scholarships, a local authority proposed to keep eight for rural schools, one would naturally ask whether the proportion of the rural population entitled them to such preference in the number of scholarships awarded.  It all depends upon the degree, and if conditions are imposed by the local authority, certainly I would not attempt to interfere with their discretion unless I felt that there were very good and sound reasons. What we are really guided by is the example of those areas where we have had no trouble because, as I have said the scholarship schemes were well thought out in the beginning and have given satisfaction.  It sometimes happens that parents are not fully acquainted with the details of the schemes, and one of the things that I intend to do when this measure becomes law is to make quite certain that the schemes as a whole and any amendments or changes are published in such a way that everybody interested <Col N="1949" /> will have an opportunity of knowing exactly the position.</P>

      <P>I wonder would the House have any objection to letting me have the remaining stages of this Bill to-morrow?  I do not think that, if Deputies ponder over what I have said, they will feel that it is a Bill that can be amended very much.  Either you are satisfied to give these powers to the Minister or you are not.  The whole of the Bill really boils down to the question of whether, as well as having general power to sanction or refuse sanction, the Minister had in fact the further power which we are trying to make clear in this measure that, if he is not satisfied with the details of the scheme, he will have power to interfere and say so, and, if he cannot get the local authority to see reason, the power to ask them to amend the scheme according as he may direct.  It would be only in a very extreme case, which I do not anticipate, that sanction to a scheme would be refused, but it may <Col N="1950" /> very well happen, as I mentioned more than once in my speech, that conditions which were inequitable were being imposed.  There is only a certain time allowed to deal with these questions.  Scholarship schemes, like other annual matters, have to be put into operation within a certain space of time, and we cannot afford to give more than a certain period to the discussion of needed changes and amendments.</P>

He has that function also, and if it should happen that a question arises as to whether they in fact had authority to grant a particular scholarship to a particular individual, I think the Minister's general powers should come in, though, as I have said, it may be very unusual.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The necessity for this measure arose out of certain legal opinions and legal decisions on certain sections of the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936.  That Act, as the House will remember, was designed to prescribe the conditions of employment of persons engaged upon industrial work.  The first difficulty which arose was concerned with the definition of &ldquo;industrial work&rdquo; as it affected the fishing industry.  It was not contemplated that fishing should be covered by the Act, as quite clearly the occupation of fishing, which is largely dependent upon tides and weather, could not be subjected to the same restrictions in respect of working hours, periods of rest and weekly half-holidays as other occupations. However, we have a legal opinion that the expression &ldquo;the killing of any animal&rdquo;, which is contained in the definition section of the Act, includes the killing of a fish, a fish being an animal, and, consequently, it would appear that unless this amendment is effected the business of fishing would be covered by the definition of industrial work.  It is proposed to amend the Act to make it clear that it does not apply to the business of fishing.  I should, however, point out that the effect of this amendment will not exclude from the Act persons doing industrial work in connection with the packing of fish or other operations which are not associated with the actual business of catching fish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1954" /> The second difficulty arose out of the provisions of Section 43 of the Act, which related to the payment of overtime. That Act prescribed certain maximum hours of work which could be performed in industrial occupations under various conditions.  For the ordinary type of industrial work, the maximum working week was fixed at 48 hours; but for continuous process industries, that is to say those industries which must go on continuously day and night, Sunday and Monday, the maximum number of hours that might be worked per week was fixed at 56.  There was, however, a certain ambiguity arising out of the provisions of Section 43.  Two cases have come to court which were in practically all respects similar, and conflicting decisions were given by the judges who heard the cases.  In one case it was held that, even in the case of workers engaged in continuous process industries, hours of work beyond 48 in the week had to be regarded as overtime and remunerated as overtime.  In the other case a contrary decision was given. Each case was appealed from the Circuit Court to a High Court judge on circuit and each appeal was rejected. We have, therefore, got to do something about the section of the Act in order to remove the legal doubt as to its meaning which has been created.</P>
    <P>We propose to give effect to what was the intention in drafting the original Act, to what the Dáil deemed to be its effect when it passed it, and what has in all cases been acted upon since the enactment of the measure, and that is to provide that, in the case of continuous process industries, the maximum normal working week will be one of 56 hours and that the payment of overtime arises only in respect of hours worked beyond 56 in the week. It is proposed that this provision will be retrospective with the usual safeguard that where proceedings have been commenced prior to the date of the introduction of the amending Bill, then the proceedings may be continued and will be determined as if this amendment had not been effected.</P>

In the other case, there have been cases heard by the courts and possibly there are some cases pending in the courts which I would not know of.  It is necessary in these cases to provide for a safeguard to ensure that where anybody has got a decision, that decision stands, or where anybody has started proceedings, these proceedings may be continued as if the amendment were not made.</P>

      <P>That depends on the type of work.  Two men may be employed under the same trade description by the same employer, and might, in fact, be in different categories so far as the Act is concerned.  One might be held to be doing industrial work mainly, and the other might not be so held.  In each case, the nature of the work performed is the deciding factor.</P>

      <P>Sub-section (1) of this section shall be deemed to have come into operation on the date on which the Principal Act came into operation.</P>
      <P>I should like to have an assurance from the Minister that that particular sub-section, if passed by the House, will not have the effect of upsetting decisions already given in the courts.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Where any proceedings were commenced before the 16th day of February, 1944, to recover any moneys alleged to be payable by reason of sub-section (2) of Section 43 of the Principal Act to a worker doing continuous process shift work&mdash;</P>

The effect of Section 4 is that in the case of any person who has got a decision, that decision will not be invalidated by the enactment of this Bill.  Similarly, if any person has taken proceedings under Section 43 of the Principal Act, he may continue those proceedings and get a decision as if this Bill had not been passed.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>The original Act is one of those on which the Government bases its claim to be a Party for progressive social legislation.  We on the Labour Benches never have denied that the original Act has been extremely helpful in certain cases.  One would imagine that, after the experience since 1936, these anomalies which have come to light in the original Act and which require to be dealt with, would have been dealt with in a progressive manner and not on the lines of the amending Bill.  One would have imagined that the loopholes which have become apparent in this particular form of social legislation would have been covered up, as the Minister <Col N="1958" /> says, from the point of view of the intention, at least, of his own Party, if not of the House.  That would give the full scope of this particular Act to the various sections of workers. From that point of view, we are somewhat disappointed with the amending Bill, which is so restricted in its definitions and provisions, and in which a number of very important anomalies have been overlooked.</P>
      <P>There are some points regarding the industrial field which have been engaging the attention of our particular side of the House, and even the attention of officials of the Department. There is the question of corporation employees and of the continuous dispute in regard to watchmen in industrial undertakings. There are difficulties in regard to the rates of payment for overtime, which are at complete variance with the recognised rates paid by good employers in association with trade unions.  All these anomalies could have been dealt with when the Minister was taking advantage of this particular opportunity to clear up weaknesses which he sees in the original Act.</P>
      <P>Instead of taking that line and pursuing what he claims to be the progressive line which he initiated in 1934 or 1936, it seems to me that, in regard to this industrial legislation, his Party and himself are taking the very same line as they are taking on many other important questions.  They have decided that they have gone far enough along the road and they are trying to retrace their steps, if not in important matters, at least in the most serious factor&mdash;this whole approach to these particular social and industrial questions. In Section 2 of the Bill, first of all, instead of an attempt being made to broaden the provisions of the Principal Act, as referred to by the Minister, in regard to the difficulty of defining industrial work, we have an attempt to deal with it by the exclusion of certain types of employment. Instead of restricting those exclusions we are adding to them, by including in them fishing.  I do not know why fishing should be excluded.  Perhaps very sound arguments for that have been provided by the Minister's industrial experts or official advisers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1959" /> If, however, we pursue that line of reasoning, we see other difficulties arising in excluding the question of fishing in relation to one or two other types of work which are still included. If we go down through the Bill, we find a little lower down that the killing of any animal or bird is still to be included as excluded under the original Act.  It seems to me, by a different process of reasoning, that the catching, and thereby the killing, of fish and the killing of a bird are much the same thing, if the killing of the bird comes under certain provisions in relation to industrial undertakings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is industrial work done in connection with the killing of an animal or bird.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I want to know.  If you pursue that course, how far would it go?  Would it extend to a man with a piece of twine and a worm on the end?  Does it extend to steam trawlers, to the packing and icing of fish, or the gutting of fish?  Where is it to end?  Are we again walking into difficulties of definition, to be cleared up by a further amending Bill?  If there were difficulties arising in relation to the definition of the term &ldquo;fishing&rdquo;, one could understand it; but, as I say, the actual amendment proposed here is not a progressive amendment but a retrogressive one.  It is at variance with the tone and purpose of the Principal Act.  We feel that the opportunity is being lost to correct definite anomalies which have given rise to difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already mentioned that some anomalies are due to certain types of workers not having been included. These, however, have already been taken to court and difficulties have been experienced in trying to get them rectified in that way.  There is the case of night watchmen in industrial undertakings. There should have been no difficulty about that at all, but it was overlooked in the previous Act.  We feel that this is an excellent opportunity to give these men the benefit of the Act, and it was quite clearly the intention of the House that it should extend to them in the first case.  To argue that a man engaged <Col N="1960" /> in industrial undertakings, who is performing the essential job of watching and caring for an undertaking during the night or during the week-end, is not to be included in the provisions of this Bill, seems to be peculiar, when we read down the list of industries and trades which are included and when we know to what extent the Bill can be used to afford benefits to certain classes of workers.  These watchmen, above all other classes of workers, require protection in regard to their working hours, as it is a common feature to have watchmen working 80, 90 or 100 hours per week.  Surely this broad section of workers should be given the protection that may be given on an opportunity like this?</P>
    <P>There is one point that occurs to me regarding Section 3.  Why is this matter dealt with, not in a broad, humane spirit, but by crabbing and confining the whole Principal Act? It is quite clear that this has relation to whether a man is doing continuous shift work on a basis of a 56-hour week. It is a good practice to follow the recognised custom that a man working on shift work for a 56-hour week should receive a special rate based on time and a quarter, or time and one-eighth. Again, I feel that the tightening up of the original Act should have been done on another line.  Instead of taking the attitude that it is now legal for a man to work 56 hours without committing a breach of the overtime provisions, the peculiar feature of shift work&mdash; the additional trouble and upsets caused in the home and to the man himself&mdash;should have been provided for in the way that decent employers have provided, by giving an additional rate, in recognition of the arduous nature of that work and of the special conditions under which it is performed. We seem to be going backward rather than forward.</P>
    <P>One important feature, to which attention has been drawn in the form of questions, is the outrageous procedure of introducing and giving effect to retrospective legislation.  Why must the Government always take the attitude that, no matter what mistake they make, someone else must pay for it? The same type of attitude is found in the labour exchange.  When an official <Col N="1961" /> mistake is made, and an unfortunate man is overpaid, that man must be penalised and have his benefit reduced. It is something for which he had no responsibility whatever.  A genuine and honest statement has been made, but someone far removed has made a mistake. We are completely opposed to that.  Again, it is worth while drawing attention to the difference between two of these sections.  In Section 2 retrospective effect is given to that section without any qualifying clause.  It is to be effective from the date of the original Act.  But, in Section 4, you take power to limit the operation of this Bill in relation to sub-section (2) of Section 43 of the Principal Act in so far as cases awaiting determination in the courts, or which have been determined by the courts, are concerned.  Will the Minister give us an assurance that, at the moment, there are no cases before the courts, or to go before the courts, arising out of the application of the original section to fishermen?  If there is such a case, why should the claimant be deprived of his right to have recourse to the law by this amending Bill, since a man suing in relation to overtime under the other section is protected? Surely, there is a strange contrast there.</P>
    <P>This is an attempt to rectify legislation at the expense of those who were intended to benefit by it although the mistake was not made by them but by the draughtsmen or the officials of the Department.  If they made a mistake, they should bear responsibility for it and not the men and women who proceeded on the basis of the Act, which was passed with the approval of this House and which had behind it all the force, intellectual and expert, of the Minister's Department. These ordinary men and women are entitled to the benefit of the legislation which has been passed, apart from the question of the equity of legislation of a retrospective character which nullifies the law and cuts away the whole basis of the protection afforded to the citizen by the courts of the land.  We propose on Committee Stage to try to induce the Minister to rectify some of the weaknesses and anomalies in this amending Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDavidLooney" hpid="Mr. Looney Mr. Looney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Looney</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to say a few words on behalf of shift workers engaged in continuous industrial processes. The Minister enhanced his reputation to a considerable extent by the introduction of the Conditions of Employment Act.  At the same time, he enhanced the prestige of his Party. But this Bill will re-act very unfavourably on the conditions of those who are doing shift work as a continuous process. We all know that there are only 24 hours in the day.  Nevertheless, he is proposing to extend the hours to 56 in any one week without any extra pay for overtime.  How the Minister is going to operate a 56-hour week as a continuous process by shift work, I do not know.  It would mean the working of two 12-hour shifts, or three shifts of eight hours.  That would mean a 56-hour week and would involve Sunday work.  Shift workers have been operating on a 5½ or six-day week.  The maximum of 48 hours includes meal times.  Trade unions have, during the emergency, endeavoured to accommodate themselves to the requirements of industry, and I should not like the Minister to take advantage of that position to deprive, at a later date, workers in industrial processes of conditions to which they are entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must realise that an undertaking working three shifts has its production trebled.  There is only one manager and one board of directors, but the output is increased three fold.  I think that it is very unfair to take advantage of industrial workers on this occasion.  I strenuously oppose any alteration or extension of the hours in relation to shift working. There is a great shortage at present of tea, sugar, butter and in some families, the members of which are engaged on shift work, there are many different meal times.  These people have little fuel and not enough of these commodities to make provision for those who are commencing and knocking off work at different hours.  The Minister should take cognisance of that fact.  When the Committee Stage is reached, I trust that an amendment dealing with this extension of the hours will be accepted. <Col N="1963" /> I think that the hours for shift workers are long enough as they are.  It will do a great deal of harm not only to the workers but to the Government if this proposal to extend the hours in regard to shift work is insisted upon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat astonished that the Minister should bring in this amending Bill without due consideration of the importance of its provisions.  He should withdraw this Bill and do what should have been done some time ago&mdash;that is, call into council those men and women representing the industrial forces and discuss the anomalies and contradictions in the original Bill.  We have been long waiting for amendments to that Bill and it was in the spirit of reasonableness and understanding that we wanted those amendments.  What do we find now?  One or two things which are of no moment are touched upon and fundamental things are forgotten. Take the section relating to fishermen.  I do not know whether anybody who had to do with this Bill had any knowledge of fishermen.  But surely fishing is an industrial process. Naturally, all the work in connection with fishing which goes on on the quays or in the factories is covered by the Act but surely the men who go out on a trawler are as much entitled to a decent measure of consideration as those who handle the fish when they come to the quay or those who prepare the fish for the market.  Why fishermen should be subject to worse conditions than other workers, I do not know.  If they were owners of their boats there might be some argument, perhaps, for different treatment, but where they are employees&mdash;and 70 per cent. of them are employees&mdash; the position is completely different. In some cases, they do get an allowance of a certain kind of fish, oddments and guts and things like that. All these are perquisites of the trade and have been recognised as such for generations.  Why should not those men have a reasonable working day, and why should they be excluded from the benefits of the Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A question was raised by my friend in connection with continuous processes. <Col N="1964" /> We have been the victims of this since 1936 to a greater extent&mdash;I mean the Union that I represent&mdash;than even the milling or any other industry. I refer to the gas industry.  The men in it have been working a 56-hour week since 1936.  They get paid overtime. The Minister is aware of why we agreed to the present conditions.  There is no reason in the world why those men should have to work a 56-hour week, except this: that it was argued by representatives of the company&mdash; some of them now in a very dangerous position&mdash;that otherwise there would not be a sufficient number of trained men to carry on the industry.  We agreed, pending the training of a larger staff, that our men would work a 56-hour week.  In this industry a man's life is at stake when carrying out certain operations, and the safety of the community is not secure if you have not competent men employed in it.  Because of that, we agreed to this continuous shift&mdash;an unnecessarily long one&mdash;until such time as a sufficient staff had been trained.  Ten years have passed since then, and nothing has been done to improve the situation.</P>
    <P>We are dealing here with a private monopoly which should have been taken over by the public years ago.  It has a statutory duty to pay to its shareholders not more than 8 per cent. After doing that the company is obliged to give a portion of the benefits accruing to it to the consumer, but the position is that at all times the company can take 8 per cent. out of earnings. It is a flourishing concern and has practically renovated its whole plant out of profits.  Yet during all the various emergencies and crises that have arisen during the last 10 years the company has not had time to train a sufficient number of men who could adapt themselves to the needs of the industry.  The men are still working a 56-hour week.  Why not give them what the Minister has provided for other classes of workers, a reasonable week's work and time to recuperate from the heavy tasks they have to perform? Anybody who knows anything about the production of gas must be aware that the working of retorts is one of the most laborious and exhausting jobs that a man ever applied himself to.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1965" /> The Minister is aware that we have an arrangement outside of the Act whereby these men work three shifts of 56 hours.  Four shifts of 42 hours would be the right and proper thing to have.  These could be provided at a cost of less than a quarter per cent. of the registered profits of the company, and if such a system were introduced you would be establishing decent and human conditions in the industry.  Four shifts would mean that 48 men who are now idle in the City of Dublin would be absorbed in the industry.  Under the Act the men are entitled to the same measure of wages that was being paid to them previous to the introduction of the 1936 Act. That is met by the men working six shifts and getting paid for seven.  At present the men have their domestic budgets built up on a certain income, and depend on that.  If you open the market to 48 additional workers coming in you naturally restrict their earnings.  But why should we hesitate to do the just thing by those men? For the purposes of the argument, let us suppose that their total earnings prior to 1936 were £4 a week, they are now getting £4 12s. in consequence of working the extra shift.  They also get additional holidays because in consequence of working the 56-hour week it is impossible to give them the 24 hours' rest that they are entitled to under the Act.  No matter how you divide up the number of hours in the week or hours in the year, you cannot, where you have men on a 56-hour week, give them the 24-hour break that they are entitled to under the law.</P>
    <P>It is time that the Minister took cognisance of that fact.  The men are being asked to burn material that they should not be required to handle. They are doing so in order to keep this utility service going.  The men's clothes have been burned on their backs, and they are enduring conditions that no human being should be expected to suffer.  I have seen men working in the stoke-holds of ships, but in all my life I have never seen anything to equal the conditions which those gas workers have had to endure since 1938.  They are such as no normal man should be asked to bear. While they are doing that, there is no <Col N="1966" /> suggestion of relief for them in this Bill.  I want to ask the Minister, why should the Government be paying unemployment money to 48 men in the City of Dublin while we have here a public utility service which has room for them in the morning?</P>
    <P>Their employment would help to relieve the present staff whose bodies are being burned.  When a blowback comes in a retort, their bodies are scorched in the same way as if a hot iron were run over them.  If the people are not getting a good pressure of gas at the present time, that is not due to the men.  It is due entirely to the quality of the material that is being used.  It is not suited to the job.  It is slurry and not coal.  At one time if anybody offered it to me as coal I would feel insulted.  I suppose that at the present time we can get nothing better.</P>
    <P>I think this thing might have been remedied, and I suggest that the Minister even now might take the Bill back and give the matter more consideration. It is well known that this thing has been going on for years and we have put up with this crucifixion, as I might term it, until we can stand it no longer.  There must be some protest. I have, as it were, sat on the safety valve of that industry on Sundays and other days when there was a feeling that the industry would close down.  The men, however, stood fast and worked like Trojans, many of them because of the appeal on patriotic grounds, and the only return they get is to be ignored in a paltry Bill of this kind.</P>
    <P>Let me now turn to the position of watchmen.  Why should a watchman be excluded from this measure?  Are watchmen not to be regarded as industrial workers?  If a man takes up a shovel to stoke a boiler in order to keep it going through the night, I submit that once he puts his hand to the shovel he is an industrial worker.  If he does not keep the boiler banked up through the night, it will mean that other men will have to come in earlier in the mornings, perhaps one and a half or two hours before the work normally commences, in order to have the boilers functioning, in order to have <Col N="1967" /> everything hunky-dory, as we say, so that everyone may proceed with his normal work.  There is hardly a watchman in the city who does not do some form of industrial work.  I am aware that some of these men are working 84 hours a week.  Is that a desirable thing in the 20th century?</P>
    <P>Most of those men are beyond their normal working years, and then they take over the responsibility of a watchman's position.  I might instance the case at Inchicore, where a watchman had a gun placed to his stomach and was ordered to hand over money. He refused to be cowed by the gunman. People who do that type of thing should be given sympathetic consideration. These men have very responsible jobs, and they are prepared to risk their lives and limbs in the duties they undertake.  What return do they get? There is not a word about a watchman in this amendment Bill.</P>
    <P>We have, through the trade union movement, been able to make employers recognise the watchman as a human being.  I am aware of cases&mdash; and I brought them to the attention of the Department&mdash;where watchmen were working 102 hours a week.  Even in the Dublin Corporation, where we have, I suppose, the closest approach to model conditions, the watchmen are not getting decent conditions in some instances.  We have, I admit, gone a long way above other bodies, but there are cases where the watchmen are not working under proper conditions. Some watchmen start their work at 3 o'clock in the afternoon.  They may have to walk from Whitehorse Yard and go as far as St. Anne's, on the north side, a distance of three and three-quarter miles.  The average casual watchman has to walk.  He may have to go to Drimnagh on the south side or, taking the north side again, to Finglas, in order to carry out his duties.  Watchmen have to protect the property of the corporation.  They have to work probably until 8 o'clock the next morning, almost 15 hours' work. That work is done for 11/- a night, or 35/- altogether in the one week.  The watchman does not get holidays.</P>
    <P>The beautiful system that was introduced <Col N="1968" /> by this Government, the rotational system, is worthy of some reference.  There are men working on that system in Dublin.  They are employed for five days a week.  Deliberately, by the policy of the Local Government Department, these men are allowed to work only five days a week.  Why?  So that they will not get the benefits of our legislation.  The six-day working week would be much more economic, in my opinion, but they are not allowed to work for more than five days for fear they would get a holiday, as laid down in our legislation. Is that an honest way of doing things?</P>
    <P>The same applies to relief work. They will not give a man a week's work because that would give him the right, after two months' work, to get a holiday. These unctuous gentlemen deprive them of that.  That is the attitude of the gentlemen who preside over the destinies of this country.  They forget that they are making these men dissatisfied, and dissatisfied men will not give an honest day's work.  Any man who would do so would be a fool. Do you mean to say that if you put me on rotational work I would be in the mood to do a normal day's work when I would be aware of the deliberately organised policy to deprive me of the benefits that other workers are getting? The average employer gives his workman six days' work, and that workman gets the benefit of our legislation. When you look at the situation squarely, you realise what a stupid, foolish, uneconomic proposition it is to deprive men of the benefits to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>Take the position of dockers in this country.  Is it not peculiar that the dockers are deprived of a holiday? There is no one in the Government or in the judiciary who can find a remedy, who can create the position whereby a casual docker will get what he is entitled to, a week's holiday.  The dockers work long hours, sometimes they work continuously for 30 hours, but they get no holidays.  I should like to draw attention to a case that was brought up in the courts.  The Government brought the case to test whether a docker was entitled to a week's holiday. <Col N="1969" /> It was a most extraordinary action.  The man who was brought up had worked one and half years in the one year&mdash;he had worked more than 500 hours' overtime.  These men are remarkable in many ways.  They work almost to the point of destruction of their physical powers; as long as there is work there they will do it.  The man who was brought up on the test case had worked 584 hours' overtime.  I would have said to that man: &ldquo;Look here, you have put in a normal year's work; give another man the half-year, that other man needs the work more than you do and you should take a week's holiday.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have working-men in the City of Dublin whose income from one firm totalled £581 for the year.  That amounts almost to a Minister's salary. Alongside these men are others who cannot get a day's work.  These are aspects the Minister has not considered. If he would only turn his mind to the proper regulation of industry and do away with overtime, it would be much more satisfactory. He should do away with the long continuous shifts.  They are unnecessary. Do not allow any man working at normal industry to work overtime until every unemployed man is absorbed. Surely that is the proper Christian ideal.  Let us recollect that the man in the vineyard who went in at the eleventh hour got as much as the man who went in the first hour.  What is the position here to-day?  In this era of Christian civilisation one man gets all the work&mdash;more than he can do&mdash; while another man cannot get an opportunity to earn a loaf of bread&mdash; can get nothing, in fact, except by way of home assistance.</P>
    <P>The Minister might bring intelligence and co-ordination to the control of industry and in 24 hours we would absorb a percentage of the unemployed. In this case there is a clear objective.  Nobody with any intelligence would allow one man to work 500 hours' overtime while other men cannot get a day's work.  Divide all the work in the industrial world and one-third of the idle men in the City of Dublin would be working to-morrow. <Col N="1970" /> Nobody would be injured. except that some firms would have to pay a little more out of increased profits.  It is extraordinary that where overtime is worked there are generally increased profits.  It is an absurdity from the economic point of view to have people employed for 60 hours a week when if we had a 48-hour week there would be work for extra men.  If the 12 extra hours were taken off those who work overtime it would mean that three men would be working instead of two, and they would be getting decent wages.  I do not know why employers persist with such a practice. It took years to get piece-work stopped at Inchicore.  The shipyard was reopened in Dublin, thanks to the cooperation of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I suggest that if the books are examined it will be found that a number of men are working overtime every week.  In one case I stopped a man who had worked 94 hours in a week.  When this firm opened there was distinct understanding on that matter with the trade unions.  The best arrangement was made in the document that was drafted.  Yet in a few months it was abused.  The manager who was a party to that has gone to India. Those who are there now deliberately lend themselves to the curse of unnecessary overtime.  Everybody knows that there are occasions when overtime is necessary.  Work has to be continued for instance if a ship is about to put to sea or has to be put into a dry dock, but that does not mean that out of 400, 100 men should be working a week and a half or sometimes a double week, while there are others idle.</P>
    <P>There should be no trouble about bringing in a Bill to make it illegal to exceed a 48 hour working week.  This country agreed to that at Geneva. Deputy Dockrell and I agree on a 44 hour week in the building trade, and I hope in the near future that we will agree to a 40 hour week.  I can assure Deputy Giles that men who are idle are willing to work but they are not allowed to do so by the mischievous methods of the Department.  I invite the Minister to take back this Bill, so that representatives of the workers <Col N="1971" /> and the employers might confer to see if they could not come to an understanding on these points.  I appreciate what the Minister has done for the workers.  There is no doubt that the social reforms he has brought about are a most valuable contribution, not only to the health of the men and women affected, but to the future of the nation.  Let me call attention to some abuses that occur.  A week ago I found a factory where peerless products are assembled.  No inspector had been there.  The owner was working in a nice little den.  It was a filthy place and the medical officer was called in.  Girls employed there were paid 7/6 a week on a casual basis. Starch and custard powder are manufactured from potatoes, but if the supply of potatoes did not arrive work was stopped.</P>

      <P>I am pointing out that nobody should be asked to work under the conditions that prevailed.  Nobody knew about this place until it was discovered by accident.  The Department that has the credit of bringing in social legislation for workers should also take discredit, if it was deserved.  In this case I notified the Department and as soon as they were cognisant of the position they took steps to correct it. Take the position in the boot and shoe industry.  No boy under 18 is allowed to work more than 40 hours a week. By what right was a change made in conditions for these boys?  The excuse was that the arrangement was uneconomic. A skilled man in that trade gets a skilled worker's wages, and boys and girls get a certain wage which is augmented yearly.  Why should those who are protected by an Act of Parliament be asked to work for 48 hours or longer?  The only excuse is that of greed and profit.  I do not know why this Bill was drafted.  We were told that there had been a test case, and that while the judgment in one court was favourable, in another court it was unfavourable.  We know that the lawyers have to live.  Seeing that the <Col N="1972" /> Minister is interested in imposing conditions not only on industrial workers but on all workers, why should he hesitate about withdrawing this Bill and bringing in one with the necessary amendments?  What is going to be done for these people I referred to?</P>
      <P>Since 1936 they have never enjoyed a holiday.  Why are they excluded?  Are they different from other human beings?  Why are men engaged for 56 hours on continuous process work ignored?  I submit that the Minister ought to take steps to remedy the position of these workers.  They are engaged on industries which are important in the country and there is nothing that they would do to stand in the way of the country or the people. We ask the Minister to withdraw this Bill and let us hear no more about it until he is prepared to bring in a Bill with entirely different provisions.</P>

      <P>As a worker with over 23 years' experience in the flour-milling industry and 10 years on shift work, I am greatly surprised at the attempt of the Minister to extend the hours of industrial workers.  On several occasions, we have been advocating a 40-hour week for shift workers and a 44-hour week for other workers.  I hope that day will come, but if the Minister insists on extending the hours for industrial workers, there is not a place in the country in which industries will not be affected.  I would appeal to the Minister as a worker&mdash;knowing what it is to be locked up in a mill all night, going in in the morning at 7 o'clock and working until 2.30, working from 2.30 to 10 and from 10 to 7 again on a fine summer's evening. After so many years organisation of trade unions and employers, the Government and the Minister are seeking to change the hours.  I think it is a very sad state of affairs.  No doubt, if we had shorter hours in modern industries we would be able to create more employment, now so badly needed.  Before I close, I would like to refer to a remark made by, I think, Deputy Giles, that the workers would not work in a fit&mdash;&mdash;</P>

As an ordinary working-man, and a representative of flour-milling workers at conferences since 1934, I would ask the Minister not to proceed with this amendment of the 1936 Act.  He will have the wholehearted support of the House and the country if he introduces the badly-needed shorter hours.  All the workers are looking forward to a 40-hour week for shift workers and a 44-hour week for others, and, in all sincerity, I would ask the Minister not to proceed with this proposal for 56 hours.  The time has come when the Government must foster employment.  If working hours are extended, employment will not be increased, because fewer men will be employed working longer hours. I am sure the Minister was ill-advised by the employers and the people concerned when he introduced this Bill. Everyone admired the Conditions of Employment Act of 1936 as the best Act ever introduced in the country, and to come along now and try to change it is very bad policy on the part of the Minister, and I doubt if the majority of the Government are in favour of it.</P>

      <P>The position seems to be even more shadowy than I had read it.  Apparently it applies only to one section, the continuous shiftworkers.  There is just only one further remark I would like to make to the Minister. I sympathise with a great deal of what Deputy Larkin said, but as I have no knowledge of those particular matters, I will not comment on them.  No matter what you do, a certain amount of overtime is necessary.  There is what is called co-ordinating overtime and <Col N="1975" /> that is best explained by the case of a carpenter on a building who is kept back to put up casings so that the men working the concrete can start in the morning.  There are other things like that.  There is a shadowy line between co-ordinating overtime and other overtime. It might be that somebody was too lazy to look for another employee and to spread out the work.  It is very hard to discriminate, but, certainly, most employers frown on overtime and yet find that a certain amount is necessary. I am afraid you will never be able to abolish it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Deputies, I object to overtime where it can be avoided, but there are certain essential industries in which overtime may be necessary.  The real kernel of the Bill is Section 3, and while the Minister says that it is to clear away doubts, I suggest there is another motive.  The Minister is well aware that a number of workers engaged in semi-Government employment have found out that they are entitled to overtime for every hour they work after 48 hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>They were engaged on essential work and a court decision has been given that they were entitled to overtime.  I suggest that the Minister is taking precautions to ensure that men engaged in the future for 56 hours will not receive payment for any overtime after 56 hours while men engaged in non-essential work, work not essential to life, will be entitled to overtime for every hour above 48 hours. These men, engaged in semi-Government industries, looked for their rights and a judge decided that they were entitled to overtime.  This Bill means that a man who works in a beet sugar factory for more than 56 hours would not be entitled to a penny overtime. The Minister realises that there are thousands of pounds involved as a result of the court decision, and that is why he has brought in Section 3. I would appeal to him to leave the <Col N="1976" /> matter as it was, and to give men engaged in essential work the same rights as those who are on non-essential work.  Why should there be differentiation? Why should a man who works over 56 hours on essential work be denied overtime pay?  I would ask the Minister to withdraw it.  We are going to oppose it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there has been a great deal of misunderstanding about this Bill and I will do my best to remove it.  The Principal Act prescribed the minimum working conditions which were enforceable legally in respect of certain types of employment. The Act of 1936 was concerned only with industrial employment as defined in it.  It did not cover employment in agriculture, employment in commerce, employment in transport or certain other types of employment.  It did not cover them because, quite clearly, the circumstances of these employments were such that the hours and other conditions prescribed for industrial workers could not be reasonably applied to them.  It was intimated that the Government contemplated series of legislative steps to give similar protection to other workers in respect of conditions of employment, and the second step took the form of an Act protecting the working conditions of shop workers.  Further legislation was not proceeded with because of the intervention of the emergency. May I say also that we took the easier part of that task first?  The other occupations not covered by the existing legislation will be much harder to provide for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Act of 1936 dealt with three different kinds of industrial employment: ordinary day work, licensed shift work, and continuous process shift work.  For ordinary day work, the Act prescribed a maximum working week of 48 hours, and any time worked in excess had to be paid for at overtime rates.  Licensed shift work was the type of work that might be done during a period of unusual activity or other exceptional circumstances in industries which would normally work on the basis of daytime employment and a 48-hour week.  So far as workers in these industries were <Col N="1977" /> concerned, it still remained the law that work done in excess of 48 hours was regarded as overtime and had to be paid for at overtime rates.  In the case of continuous process industries, the Act permitted a 56-hour week.</P>
    <P>These industries are defined as those which must be continuous all the time, which cannot be stopped even during the night, or Sunday, or for any other interval.  The manufacture of gas is an excellent illustration, and there is also the manufacture of sugar in a beet sugar factory during the campaign period, the manufacture of glass bottles in a bottle factory and other industrial processes of that kind which must go on all the time.  They cannot stop without destroying the whole process.  For workers employed in these continuous process industries, the Act prescribed that the maximum working week would be 56 hours, and laid down certain conditions which had to be complied with.  There had to be so many hours interval between each shift and various breaks in the work for the protection of the workers.  However, a worker who was employed in a gas works, whether he got the idea himself, or went into consultation with a lawyer, interpreted Section 43 of the Act as entitling him to overtime in respect of the hours worked by him over 48 and under 56, even though he was employed in a continuous process industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about overtime prescribed in the Act. Deputy Larkin, junior, stated that workers on shift work got shift rates. There is nothing in this Act or in the amendment to prevent that.  Whether the rate was based on a normal working week or based on shift work, time and a quarter had to be paid for overtime&mdash;that is the type of overtime defined in the Act.  That worker got a decision from a Circuit Court judge in his favour and it was upheld on appeal to a High Court judge on circuit.  Another worker in another gas works got the same idea and took a similar action.  He lost his case, the judge deciding that he was not entitled to the overtime, and on an appeal to <Col N="1978" /> another High Court judge on circuit, the decision of the Circuit Court judge was upheld.  You have, therefore, two conflicting decisions, and something must be done about it.  You cannot leave the interpretation of the law so vague as it is now.  We have got to have some uniformity of interpretation. What we intended in the Principal Act was that the standard working week permitted by law in continuous process industries would be 56 hours.</P>
      <P>Deputy Larkin and Deputy O'Leary and Deputy Looney all talked in favour of a shorter working week.  Let me be clear that this Act does nothing to prevent it.  There were two possible methods of approach by the Government to this question of regulating working conditions.  We could have taken power to prescribe conditions and to make regulations relating to employment in any occupation and enforce them ourselves.  But, I do not think we would have got agreement about it.  I think that members of the Labour Party, and certainly, spokesmen of the trade union movement, would be inclined to resent that type of Government interference with the details of industrial organisation, and so we proceeded along the lines of prescribing certain conditions representing what we conceived to be minimum conditions to be enforced by law, leaving the improvement of the conditions of the workers above the minimum conditions to the ordinary methods of trade union negotiation.</P>

Of course, there are some trades in which shift work is necessary at certain times of the year.  We had to make provision to deal with these circumstances in framing this Act and to set out the minimum conditions which should apply in these types of industry.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that there is any difficulty in the interpretation of that section.  The normal working week is 48 hours except in the case of continuous process industries. The Act does not set out to name them because, of course, it would be open to any person to go to the courts and get a declaration that his particular industry was a continuous process industry and that it was impracticable to work it on any basis except that of a continuous process.  Of course, there will be new industries started from time to time in which such conditions will apply, but the standard working week for all other industries is a 48-hour week unless a permit is given in certain circumstances to work longer.</P>
      <P>I am quite prepared to agree that at some stage the Legislature ought to reconsider the conditions which it set out as minimum conditions in 1936, but I do not think this is the time to do so. I think the abnormal circumstances existing at the moment would make it difficult to arrive at a proper judgment of what these minimum conditions should be, and we are not proposing to do it in this Bill.  In this Bill we are dealing merely with certain minor difficulties of interpretation which have arisen, and which would be the cause of legal difficulty if they are not clarified. We propose to clarify them by this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me be quite clear that we are not proposing to go back one step in this Bill from the position taken up in 1936.  We merely set out that the correct interpretation of the 1936 Act is what we thought it was when the Act was passed, and what everybody assumed it to be ever since.  There may be, and possibly is, as good a case for the regulation of the conditions of employment of fishermen as there is for the regulation of the conditions of employment of any other type of workman, but nobody, I am quite sure, will contend that the hours and the <Col N="1980" /> conditions we prescribe for a worker employed in an ordinary factory can be applied without change to the worker working on a fishing boat.  I do not know if I made it clear, though I intended to do so in my original statement, that this Bill, in so far as it excludes fishermen from its operation, does not exclude people engaged in work of a processing nature, such as the cleaning and packing of fish on the quays.  We are merely excluding people engaged in industrial work on fishing boats, because normal conditions of employment do not apply to their work. Nobody, I am quite sure, would seriously suggest that they do.  I assume it is not necessary to give illustrations, but you cannot just take a ship worker off his boat at the dinner interval to allow him to go for his dinner, nor can you stop a ship in the middle of the high seas when the maximum number of hours have been worked by the sailors.  It is because these conditions which we apply to all the industrial workers do not apply to workers in ships&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely we could apply these conditions when it is known that four trips across the Channel constitute a week's work.  If I am working on a ship going, say, to Brittany, and if I exceed the number of hours laid down as the normal working week, should I not be entitled to be paid overtime?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody would suggest that their conditions of employment cannot be regulated by legislation but what I do contend is that the problem of regulating the conditions of employment of fishermen is an entirely different problem from regulating the conditions of employment of ordinary industrial workers.  We propose to take them out of this Act so as to ensure that no practical difficulty will arise on that score.  It is true that the legal differences which have arisen as <Col N="1981" /> to the proper interpretation of the Act are due to the particular words used and the method of drafting which was adopted.  Deputy Larkin, Junior, says that it was the mistake of the Government or its draftsmen.  I just want to make it clear that so far as the Constitution is concerned, it was a mistake of the Dáil.  This Dáil is responsible for putting clearly into legislation what is intended to be there.  In so far as this Section 43 is concerned we had two legal interpretations, one different from the other, and as we have that conflict of opinion it is considered advisable to have it removed.</P>
      <P>May I say in relation to watchmen, caretakers and people of that kind, that in so far as they may be doing industrial work, they are covered by the Act.  If they are not doing industrial work they are not covered.  I think the problem that arises in relation to them will have to be faced when legislation concerning them is introduced but, as I have indicated, that is a different problem from the question which arises in connection with ordinary factory workers.  One of the conditions prescribed in the Act for ordinary factory workers is that work must not be carried on beyond 8 o'clock.  That is usually the time that a watchman commences work.  That may be only a minor difference which may be capable of being overcome, but there are other circumstances also which distinguish that type of work from the type of work we had in mind in framing this legislation.  The standard rule laid down in the Act is that work must stop at 8 o'clock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act provides exemptions from that and exemptions can be given by permit in certain circumstances.  Similarly in the case of dockers, although the point raised concerned the Holidays Act rather than this Act, the facts are the same.  If they qualify they are entitled to the benefits of that Act.  There is a Parliamentary Question by Deputy Larkin, (Junior), which is down for answer by me tomorrow on that matter.  There is an obvious difficulty in applying the Holidays Act to casual dockers but they are not excluded from the Act.  If they fulfil certain conditions they are <Col N="1982" /> entitled to the benefits of the Act but there are a number of casual workers who cannot comply with these conditions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>

      <P>In connection with continuous process industries, there is no special provision for overtime provided for here in the case of workers who work 56 hours.  That is true.

      <P>The case for making the provision retrospective is that, assuming that one judge's interpretation of the law is held to be correct, there may be a very considerable claim made on behalf of a large number of workers for something they never thought they <Col N="1984" /> were entitled to, that their employers never considered they would have to meet, covering a large number of years, the finances of which have closed, the goods produced in which have been sold, and which, if persisted in, would have very serious repercussions upon the industries concerned.  We certainly did not think that it would be right that people should, by some misinterpretation of the Act, or some default in the drafting of it, get a claim that was never intended they should get, that they never knew they had, or should now be allowed to substantiate it.  We are merely putting this Act in the form in which we intended it should be in 1936.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think all sides of the House have made it manifest that, under the new dispensation, they are solicitous to ensure that these women will be adequately paid.  It seems to me that in discussing that question, one fact of the problem was lost sight of, and it is one to which I should like to direct the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary.  I think, in order to secure adequate remuneration of midwives in this country, one would want either to zone the country or distinguish clearly between the conditions obtaining in one area and another because I remember being on a local authority at one time and finding that the dispensary midwife was paid an annual salary of something like £52, which seemed to me to be grotesquely inadequate for the kind of work she might be called upon to do, but, when I raised the matter, I discovered that a salary of £52 a year in that particular dispensary district amounted to a fee of approximately 15 guineas for each confinement she attended as a dispensary midwife. Almost all the cases she dealt with were, in fact, patients who gave her some honorarium, if not the full fee, for her work.  I have no doubt that there may be other parts of the country in which the services of the dispensary midwife are called upon very much more frequently by way of red ticket, and in these areas it might be that such a salary would be ludicrously inadequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether it would involve any expense in zoning the country and taking precautions to ensure that each midwife would receive adequate remuneration, due regard being had to her average work, but I think it is a matter to which the Parliamentary Secretary might very well turn his mind, because my experience is that local authorities are not clear in their minds (1) as to the measure of work a midwife has to do in her particular area and (2) as to what is a reasonable wage for a midwife, based on the number of cases she actually attends in her capacity as dispensary midwife, apart from the cases she attends in her private capacity for <Col N="1988" /> which she receives a fee or honorarium from the patient.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I will look into the point raised by Deputy Dillon although it may not be in order to discuss it.  There are, however, other difficulties.  I do not think the salary can be determined entirely on the number of cases attended.  There are geographical and topographical difficulties, and difficulties of travel.  The number of cases might be very few, but the difficulties in attending these few cases might be very much greater than the difficulties encountered in attending a larger number of cases in a different type of district.</P>
      <P>There are, I think, very few midwives at present on such a small salary as £52 per year.  So far as the policy of the Department is concerned, we have encouraged local authorities to improve their conditions of service.  I do not recollect during my 12 years in the Custom House refusing to approve of any scale of salary for midwives on the ground that it was extravagant or overgenerous, but, as the Deputy, I presume, appreciates, we cannot very well discuss that matter on this Bill.</P>

    <P>This is a drafting amendment.  The section, as drafted originally, required the Central Midwives Board to publish a statement of receipts and expenditure, including liabilities.  The actual phrasing was, in fact, copied out of the 1918 Act, but the word &ldquo;liabilities&rdquo; includes unascertained liabilities, and it does not appear reasonable to ask the board to be in a position to publish their unascertained liabilities.

      <P>Section 2 (c) provides that where the decision appealed <Col N="1995" /> against was a decision either removing a name from the roll of midwives or suspending a midwife from practice, the board may, if they so think fit, pay to the appellant such sum as they consider reasonable compensation for any loss of practice sustained by her between the decision of the board and the determination of the appeal or, where the appellant was suspended from practice by the board on the institution of the proceedings before the board, between the institution of the proceedings and the determination of the appeal.  The appeal by a midwife is to the Minister or to a High Court judge.  It is true that if the midwife elects to go to the Minister she will probably appear in person.  She may, however, appear by counsel before whomever the Minister directs to hear the appeal, as presumably he will not hear it himself.  If she elects to go before a High Court judge, it is almost certain that she must have her case prepared by a solicitor and a counsel. Most of these women are in modest circumstances.  There is no use giving a midwife a paper right to appeal if you make the right to appeal subject to conditions which no midwife can comply with.  Therefore, I suggest to the Minister that the board should be given not only the right but the duty to pay the midwife's expenses in bringing the appeal where the appeal is successful, just as she would have the right, against any defendant against whom she might take an action in a civil court, to claim costs if she succeeded in her case.  I could elaborate that point at length, but everybody in the House is as familiar with the analogies I have given and the grounds on which I make the plea as I am myself. Therefore, the Parliamentary Secretary may be inclined to go some way to meet me.</P>

      <P>Before Section 32 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The board shall issue to every woman who becomes a midwife or whose name is restored to the roll of midwives a certificate certifying that she is registered in the roll of midwives.</P>
      <P>(2)  Where the board, on the application of a midwife, are satisfied that her midwife's certificate has been destroyed, the board may issue to her a new certificate certifying that she is registered in the roll of midwives.</P>
      <P>(3)  Where the board remove the name of any midwife from the roll of midwives, she shall, within 14 days after the notification to her of the decision of the board, return her midwife's certificate to the board for cancellation, and, if she fails to do so, she shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding £5.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4)  Where a midwife dies, the person having custody of her midwife's certificate shall, within 14 days after her death, return the certificate to the board for cancellation, and, if such person fails to do so, he shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary <Col N="1997" /> conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding £5.</P>
    <P>The amendment proposes to substitute a new section for Section 32 and it makes the following changes: (1) provides that when a certificate is returned to the board on the removal of the name of a midwife from the roll of midwives, or on the death of a midwife, it is returned to the board for cancellation; (2) provides that the board shall issue a new certificate.  Under the previous construction, the certificate was to be returned to the board and the same certificate could at a future time be issued.  Instead of re-issuing the same certificate, the new section provides that the old certificate shall be returned for cancellation and, in the event of a midwife's name being restored to the register, a new certificate will be issued to her.</P>

      <P>Doubtless there is good reason for it, but at the moment it escapes me.  If there be a person suffering from puerperal fever it is very necessary to get the best nursing help available in the locality.  Unless it is made very clear that the midwife accepting responsibility in a case of that kind will suffer neither in her remuneration nor in her local reputation as a safe and careful person who is not permanently infected, it may be difficult to get the kind of attention that all of us would desire to secure for a sick person of the kind envisaged by the Parliamentary Secretary.  The Parliamentary Secretary will bear in mind that country people are a bit queer sometimes and misinterpret a sensible temporary precaution as being a permanent reflection on the cleanliness and capacity of the midwife who comes under such a restriction as is envisaged here.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary satisfied that there is provision here to ensure that the midwife to whom this section is applied will be adequately compensated for the inconvenience caused to her?</P>

    <P>This amendment is intended to empower the Central Midwives Board to grant certificates to persons who take courses of training and pass the requisite examination.

They are merely certificates to the effect that the candidates have taken certain courses and passed certain examinations. <Col N="2001" /> It has been the practice to issue such certificates, but this amendment now proposes to give statutory authority for the issue of such certificates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 19:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  Rules for the purposes of this section shall provide that a midwife employed by a local authority shall not be required to attend any course of instruction to which the rules relate unless the local authority, with the consent of the Minister, give her leave of absence for the purpose of attending such course.</P>
      <P>This amendment is intended to provide that when the Central Midwives Board make rules requiring midwives to attend post-graduate courses of instruction, such rules shall provide that, where a midwife is employed by a local authority, she shall not be required to attend a course of instruction to which the rules relate, unless the local authority, with the consent of the Minister, give her leave of absence for the purpose. If the Central Midwives Board could direct a midwife to attend a post-graduate course without her securing the permission of the local authority, a condition of confusion in administration would arise.  I do not think that it is likely that a local authority will, in any case, refuse permission, but it is desirable that the midwife should have the permission of the local authority before she attends the post-graduate course.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 48, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose the Central Midwives Board ordered a midwife, in receipt of a small salary, to take a post-graduate course, who is to pay the midwife's expenses when taking that course?  Take the case of a midwife who has about £104 a year.  She is called to Dublin to attend a post-graduate course at Holles Street or the Coombe or the Rotunda.  The woman may not be able to afford that course.  Is it thought right to give the board the power to order a midwife to <Col N="2006" /> take this course?  If so, what provision have we made for the situation in which the midwife's family circumstances do not permit of her attending such a course?</P>

      <P>I know that, but what Deputy Dillon has referred to might occur.  The local authority was fully satisfied that the amount allowed to those nurses was not sufficient to enable them to obtain proper accommodation in Dublin.  The local authority gave only what they considered sufficient and the Department turned it down. What Deputy Dillon wants is to secure, I take it, that this will not happen in the case of midwives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>It is open to the local authority, in addition to paying the midwife's salary and paying a substitute to discharge her duties, to give her further reasonable expenses.  They must have the consent of the Minister and, when it comes to a question of interpreting &ldquo;reasonable expenses,&rdquo; the Minister comes into the picture.  There would, probably, be a difference of opinion between the Minister and Deputy Corish as to what would constitute &ldquo;reasonable expenses.&rdquo;  It must be borne in mind that, if the midwife did not go to Dublin for a post-graduate course, she might not be able to retain her private practice as against her neighbouring practitioners who had reached a higher degree of professional efficiency.  It has also to be taken into consideration that, if she remained at home and did not take the post-graduate course, her maintenance would cost her something.  These matters have to be considered in assessing &ldquo;reasonable expenses.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be quite legitimate to be stiff on the subject of expenses if the course were optional but, if you give the board power to compel a midwife to attend a course, then it is necessary for us to secure that it will be made financially possible for her to attend.  I do not desire that she should be maintained like a queen in Dublin when attending this course. All I want to secure is that attendance at the course will not cripple her.  I take it that the power of the local authority to provide maintenance for her in addition to giving her leave of absence, derives from some other statute than that which we are at present considering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing in the Parliamentary Secretary's amendment imposing on the local authority the duty of providing maintenance.  All the amendment allows the local authority to do <Col N="2008" /> is to give leave of absence.  It does not bespeak maintenance at all, but merely the payment of a substitute.  I would, therefore, be glad to be reassured by the Parliamentary Secretary that there is some other statute under which the local authority may give maintenance in addition to leave of absence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, I desire to direct the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the wording of paragraph (d) of sub-section (1), &ldquo;such attention is given, otherwise than for reward,...&rdquo; Is it essential to put in the words &ldquo;otherwise than for reward&rdquo;? I quite agree that the day of the handy woman is gone, and that we <Col N="2010" /> are resolute in insisting that in future whoever attends a woman in childbirth shall be a qualified person. Nevertheless, those of us who live in the country know that very often a very good neighbour comes in and fills a gap in an emergency.  People would be reluctant in those circumstances to allow her to go without making her a present of one kind or another.  Would such a person be committing a statutory offence under this sub-section if she were to accept a present in such circumstances?  I would not like to see a situation created in which a perfectly respectable neighbour who so acted would bring herself into conflict with the law.</P>
      <P>If the insertion of the words is necessary in order to prevent abuses, then we will have to bear with them, but if they are not necessary I would be glad if they were left out.</P>

      <P>I must differ from Deputy Dillon on this point.  I do not want to speak of the experiences any of us may have had, but I would urge on the Committee that the more we tighten up everything connected with attendance on women in childbirth we will be ensuring that every woman, at such a difficult time, will get skilled attention.  I would not shy at the insertion of words in order to ensure that.  My own experience and that of most of my professional colleagues has been that if you leave the slightest loophole to meet what appears to be a genuine case, advantage will be taken of it, and you will have handy women and unskilled people coming back again.  I think that the words in the section are a safeguard and ought to be retained.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That Dáil Eireann is of opinion that, in order to preserve the independence of Deputies, it is not desirable that they should be in danger of being regarded as salaried servants of the State; that, in order to enable every citizen, rich or poor, to discharge the duties of a Deputy, if elected by the people to represent them, each Deputy should receive an allowance sufficient to defray the expenses of his work as a Deputy and that in order effectively to secure this object a Select Committee of Dáil Eireann should be appointed to ascertain the average expenses of the average Deputy and to recommend an annual payment sufficient to defray those expenses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. L. Cosgrave Mr. L. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we adjourned the other night, I had digressed for a short period to deal with the question of the dignity of Parliament.  If it is conceded that Deputies should receive an allowance, the next question to decide is: What is an adequate allowance?  Numerous commissions&mdash;I think four, to be exact &mdash;have considered this question.  The commissions were varied in their personnel and varied in the time at which they operated.  Each of these commissions decided that an allowance should be paid to Deputies and Senators. They all decided that that allowance should be free from income-tax.  I agree on principle merely that it would be more desirable that the allowances should be subject to income-tax; but, if the allowances are subject to income-tax, even the present amount will very likely be found to be inadequate for the ordinary expenses of a Deputy.  If the allowances <Col N="2015" /> are to be subject to income-tax, such as the Farmers' Party have mentioned, does it follow that one Deputy may escape with the whole £480, while another will probably have to pay every penny of it in income-tax?  There has to be equality among Deputies, and if each Deputy is to be on an equal footing in this connection each must pay the same amount in income-tax.</P>
      <P>It is quite easy for the Farmer Deputies to come here and say that the allowance must be subject to income-tax, knowing quite well that they will not pay a penny out of the allowance in income-tax, knowing quite well that they will be able to throw in farm implements or whatever property or stock they have, in order to escape liability under the income-tax code.  It is generally conceded that each Deputy has the same privileges and the same rights.  If that is so, each Deputy should pay the same amount, and should only be liable for the same amount, and if we decide that Deputies should pay income-tax on their allowances, then let it be at the full rate and let it be the same for each Deputy, with no rebates, because some Deputies may be able to throw in an ass and cart, a tractor, or something else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not generally realised outside that Deputies do a certain amount of work, and some Deputies work extremely hard.  I do not say every Deputy does.  It is possible every Deputy is not expected to, and particularly where you have political Parties it would not be possible for back benchers in every Party to rise on every matter and join in the debate. If a farmer Deputy leaves his farm, particularly if he is a progressive farmer like Deputy Hughes, he has to pay someone to do the work while he is absent, or otherwise he will lose, largely by reason of the fact that in his absence the men may not be devoting the same time and attention to the work.  Similarly, if a Deputy is a businessman, he has to engage a manager, or else chance the consequences; he may lose, or his business may not be run as efficiently.  If a Deputy is a professional man, he is <Col N="2016" /> taken away from his business, unless he happens to be a solicitor who has a partner to conduct the business for him.  If he is a doctor or a barrister, he is away from his business during the time he is attending to his Parliamentary duties.  I do not want it to be understood that I think Deputies should make profit out of their positions as elected representatives.  They should neither lose nor gain in so far as it is possible to estimate accurately what the losses or gains are likely to be.</P>
    <P>The campaign against free allowances to Deputies, or to make the allowances subject to income-tax, has been proceeding for a long time.  It started when the Deputies opposite were in opposition.  The Farmers' Party, or the non-political gentlemen who masquerade as defenders of the farmers, now come along and, because it goes down at the cross roads, or because the Labour Party can harangue the masses in the cities, they believe it is the right thing to do.  I think it is time in this country we realised that appealing to the lowest instincts of the people is not honourable or patriotic.</P>
    <P>In my opinion the Farmers' Party and the Labour Party, on the last occasion that they voted on this question, acted dishonestly.  They did so for two reasons: (1) they would not make the allowances subject to income-tax and (2) they could go to their constituents and say: &ldquo;We failed to make the allowances subject to income-tax,&rdquo; knowing at the same time that they were not subject to tax. In my opinion that was dishonest on the part of the Farmers' Party.  It was the very negation of patriotism and a mockery of truth.  If that is the kind of benefit we are to expect from the entrance to this House of Clann na Talmhan the sooner they fade out of political life the better.</P>

      <P>If we are to realise our responsibilities to the community, we will have to appeal to their best interests, by enlightening them on whatever policy we believe to be the best; not merely going out and saying that Deputies' allowances should be subject to income-tax, and that they should be in the same position as everybody else.  If that is the worst cancer in the body politic then eradicate it.  There may be many others, but we do not hear the Farmers' Party or the Labour Party mentioning them.  No Deputy desires to be a member of an institution that is being constantly ridiculed or abused. either in the Press or on public platforms. That lowers the prestige and the dignity of Parliament, and detracts from the usefulness of the work which elected representatives of the people can do.  If we are to continue on that line then political opportunists who get a few seats can point to the fact that Deputies are not paid allowances, but salaries, and we will never get anywhere.  We have been too long going around in circles.  The allowances paid to Deputies should, in my opinion, be subject to income-tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But I concede that numerous commissions have for a number of years decided otherwise.  As different Dála decided that allowances were distinct from salaries it was quite wrong legally for the Farmers' Party to refer to them as salaries.  Legally, they are allowances. Of course, legalities need not trouble the Farmers' Party.  If they are allowances they should be free from income-tax, and, if not allowances, should be subject to it.  We must decide what are adequate allowances and, having decided that, allow them to be paid without questioning <Col N="2018" /> at each recurring Parliament or general election.</P>
    <P>It may not be generally known that the allowances paid in other Parliaments are in nearly every case far larger than the allowances paid here. In Australia the amount is £1,000, in Canada £800, in South Africa £700 and in New Zealand £450.  Each of those countries may be more or less prosperous than we are, but they compare generally with conditions here.  These facts are never demonstrated to the people by the Farmers' Party or by the Labour Party when they inform them that the Deputies are getting away with privileges which ordinary people do not enjoy.  I believe it is desirable that this matter should be settled once for all, and I urge strongly on the Government the desirability of dealing with the matter now.  We had an intimation from the Tánaiste that it was not the intention to set up a committee. I am quite sure that the more mature Deputies on the opposite benches realise that their previous actions on this question were not all that might be desired.  If that is so, this is the time to decide, so that when there is an election, or when Deputies think some capital can be gained, they will not persist in haranguing the people on the inequity of this system. I have no desire to have my constituents labouring under the delusion that I am masquerading as an individual who is receiving money for nothing or money under false pretences.</P>
    <P>When I asked for the confidence of the electorate I told them that I would serve their interests according to my light in the changed circumstances that time might require.  I asked them if they did not believe in my policy not to support me.  I do not believe in bartering principles merely to get votes by cheap political propaganda which panders to the worst instincts of the people.  If Deputies believe that that is the right thing to do there is an ancient book by Niccolo Machiavelli&mdash; with which the Taoiseach is well acquainted&mdash;and from that book one can learn all about appealing to the worst instincts of the people or acting along certain lines.</P>
    <P>I maintain that we have for a long <Col N="2019" /> period been going around in circles, that there has been retrogression, and that if those in a position to judge us say that this is the worst Parliament since we got self-government, then that is no tribute to us after being for 22 years masters of our destiny.  It would be irrelevant to go into what contributed to that state of affairs.  But I want to urge on the Government the desirability of again examining this question and settling it once and for all.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan mentioned that all his Party required was a repeal of the Act of 1925.  I know, as well as other Deputies the results that will follow. The next step will be an attack on the President, and the attacks will continue until the institutions of the State are wrecked.  If that is the function of the Farmers' Party the sooner that dishonest sham is exposed the better.  We have to move forward, not backward; we must not go round in circles.  As General Collins said: &ldquo;Ireland is ours for the making.  Let us not fail.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the motion brought forward by Deputy Dillon in the hope it will put an end to the propaganda that has centred around payments made to Deputies for certain purposes.  I deprecate the use of the word &ldquo;salary&rdquo; in regard to any sums paid to Deputies.  If we admit that Deputies are in receipt of salaries, then we admit that they are servants of the State and at the beck and call of the State or some one else, and so perhaps lose their independence of thought and action.  Some of us have given voluntary service to this State and to the country generally in various ways for longer periods than the lifetime of some of the younger Deputies. We refuse to surrender our voluntary work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we admit the principle that the sums Deputies receive for their services in this House are allowances, then we need not enter into the question of income-tax which has been raised in this debate.  There can be no income-tax if there is no income, and unless we describe the sums received by Deputies as income, then we should not bother ourselves about discussing <Col N="2020" /> the taxation of them.  If some Deputy on the Farmers' Benches, in his goodness of heart, offers to buy or sell cattle for me at fairs throughout the year, and if I insist that he at least should take from me the out-of-pocket expenses he has incurred, does anybody suggest that the aggregate of the amounts he has received in 12 months must be disclosed as income to the authorities and that he must pay income-tax on these receipts.  I do not think that such a suggestion would be made by anybody here.  I, for one, will not be a party to any action taken inside or outside this House to lessen the dignity of members of the House.  An attempt has been made in the Press, and outside the Press, in every vile way to diminish the respect that should be paid to Deputies who have given, and who will continue to give, voluntary service to the people who elected them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon is allowed at least 30 minutes to reply to the various speeches that have been made on this motion, and I do not want to have it said that, for my part, I took up an undue portion of the time allowed for the debate.  Three sentences will suffice to say what I have to say on this motion.  Firstly, I deprecate the use of the word &ldquo;salary&rdquo;.  Secondly, no case has been made as far as I could hear from any part of the House to establish that the allowance that Deputies receive is too much.  It may be too much, but nobody has made the case that it is.  That case has not been made even by the Deputies who proposed that we should pay income-tax.  I suggest that we should end this matter once and for all by accepting my suggestion, that we drop this insane idea that we are paid servants, and that we have lost our voluntary status.  Let us admit that the Dáil was right when it said that there should be an allowance paid to Deputies to pay their expenses. If a sufficient allowance were not made to Deputies to cover such expenses, then it would not be possible for poor men and women to give service in this House to the State.</P>
    <P>The Committee which considered this matter suggested an allowance calculated to meet what they thought was the exact amount that would <Col N="2021" /> cover the ordinary expenses of a Deputy in the pursuit of his duties. Let it be accepted so as to put an end to this propaganda once and for all, that a reasonable allowance should be made for that purpose or let somebody argue that no allowance should be paid at all, so that those only who can afford to pay their own expenses should come into the Dáil.  I do not know whether I should be included amongst such people, but certainly if that were decided, many of the present members of the Dáil would disappear. If it is admitted that there should be some allowance to meet the expenses of an ordinary member let us fix some amount.  If the present allowance is too high, cut it down, and if it is too low let us increase it, but by some means or other&mdash;and I think Deputy Dillon's suggestion is as good as any that has been made&mdash;let us arrive at what the Dáil considers is a reasonable allowance for expenses and so get away once and for all from the suggestion that we are the paid servants of anybody and that there is no one in this country who has any disposition to give voluntary service to the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of what you have said I shall be very brief.  At the outset, I should like to say that I think this is a very dishonest motion.  First and foremost, an opportunity was given to Deputy Dillon and other Deputies if they were honest and sincere in their professions, to support the motion brought forward by Clann na Talmhan on the subject of the payment of income-tax on Deputies' allowances. I still hold that Deputies should not be a privileged class in this respect.  That is a personal opinion which I shall continue to hold.  Why should this House ask others to pay income-tax on moneys they receive <Col N="2022" /> when Deputies do not pay tax on their own allowances?</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon has stated that he would like to maintain the dignity of this House.  I agree with the Deputy that it is necessary to maintain the dignity of this House but I hold that the way to maintain the dignity of the House is by raising the standard of living of the Irish people in general.  How can we suggest that Deputies' allowances or salaries, call them what you will, this £480 per annum which every Deputy receives, should be free of income-tax when the farm labourer who is in receipt of £2 per week, the road worker in receipt of less than £2 per week, and the turf producer who must go down to Kildare and go out in the bog on a cold morning to raise fuel for the nation, and who also receives less than £2 per week, must contribute to these allowances of £480?  Without food and fuel the nation could not exist, and if we want to maintain the dignity of this House let us raise the dignity and the standard of the workers of the nation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect, I am discussing the motion, because the motion has a bearing on what the nation and the individual can afford to contribute to the payment of Deputies. These road workers, turf workers and farm labourers out of their frugal earnings must contribute to the £480 per annum, tax free, which Deputies receive, so that I hold I am justified and that I am in order in referring to these matters.  If Deputy Dillon would consider an addendum to his motion that this House should also consider the allowances paid to the average worker within the country I would support him.  As I have said, it was open to every Deputy to support the Clann na Talmhan motion.  Deputy Dillon described it as a dishonest motion.  I say here and now that it was not, and I challenge Deputy Dillon or any other Deputy to go out amongst the ordinary citizens of this nation and make that statement.  I guarantee that nine out of every ten citizens, <Col N="2023" /> including Deputy Dillon's own constituents, will agree that it is unfair that a Deputy should get £480 free of income-tax, with vouched travelling expenses, while the farm labourer, the road worker and the turf worker get less than £2 per week.</P>
      <P>Let us also consider the amount paid to the ordinary soldier in this country, though I am not saying for a moment that the Government is not doing its best to improve the condition of the ordinary soldier.  A soldier must give his whole time to his job and be prepared to lay down his life in defence of his country.  Let us try to raise his standard before attempting to raise our own.  What about the small farmer?  I do not mean the rancher but the industrious tillage farmer who has to work practically every day for the seven days of the week, if he is going to make his farm pay.  Has he £480 free of tax?  Let us try to raise the standard of these people and then we can talk about dignity.  All these people, although their standard of living is so low, have to contribute towards Deputies' allowances.</P>
      <P>Not one of the classes I have mentioned has an income of £480 and I do say with due respect that they are the most important section within the nation.  You could dissolve this Dáil and the country could carry on for the next 12 months.</P>

      <P>In concluding the debate on this motion, I think it right to say that at one time I felt that there might be a great deal to be said for levying income-tax on the allowances paid to Deputies of this House and I gave every expression to this view in this House.  But the more I reflected upon this question the clearer it became to me that a very distinct line of demarcation must be drawn between a salary and an allowance and that this House and the people must make up their minds as to whether they want professional, salaried politicians in this country or the system to which we have been accustomed of men who <Col N="2028" /> earn their living at their ordinary trade and vocation and attend to their public duties as well. Our people have chosen deliberately that they do not want created in this country a class of professional politicians and with that decision I most heartily agree.  That being so, those of us who are in this House must, if we are to rear families, and to live an ordinary life, have some other means of livelihood than our Parliamentary allowances.</P>
      <P>I want to emphasise again that Deputies are paying income-tax and that every time Deputies vote for an addition to the income-tax, they pay it with every other citizen of the State who is called upon to pay it, and it is a dishonest fraud on our people to tell them that because the Parliamentary allowance is exempt from income-tax, therefore, Deputies are free to increase the income-tax without suffering any of the consequences themselves. Every Minister in the Government pays income-tax on his salary as a Minister, and, if he votes for an increase in income-tax, he has to pay it as every other citizen has to pay it. Every shopkeeper in this Dáil, every lawyer in this Dáil, every skilled craftsman earning sufficient to bring him within the category of persons required to pay income-tax, share whatever burden they, by legislation, put upon the community as a whole.  They claim no credit for that; it would be an absurdity if the situation were otherwise; but it is wrong, it is fraudulent, for informed persons to represent to the masses of our people that the reverse is the case, and that we have constituted ourselves what Deputy Cogan chooses to describe as a privileged class.  Every shilling, every sixpence, every half-crown put on the income-tax is being paid by 90 per cent. of the Deputies, and will continue to be so paid, and if. in the next Budget, it is necessary to put another shilling on income-tax, 90 per cent. of the Deputies will have to make their contribution under that new impost the same as any other citizen of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to remind the House of this <Col N="2029" /> fact.  I was brought up in the tradition of people who served in Parliament for this country and got no reward at all.  They went to London, very often on 30/- a week subscribed by their constituents, and lived in tenements on the Vauxhall Bridge Road, in order effectively to do the work that had to be done for this country, and when Parliamentary allowances were introduced in Westminster, the members of the Irish Party voted against them.  I do not believe that, in this day and generation, you can expect or hope to get the spirit of self-sacrifice which actuated Parnell, Redmond and their lieutenants.</P>
    <P>They were fighting for the nation's freedom, and, as such, their sole reward, and it was ample, was winning the fight.  We, after all, are doing the nation's business, and, though our fellow citizens have the right to expect of us integrity and independence, they have not the right to ask us, now that they enjoy independence, now that they enjoy all the advantages of freedom, that we shall suffer heavily in our income by coming here to Dáil Eireann.  Let us be clear on this. There are many Deputies, and I do not make any apology for putting myself in the category, who would not accept £480 a year as adequate remuneration for the work we do.</P>
    <P>Let us be frank.  It is time to be frank.  If I devoted the time I devote to Dáil Eireann to my ordinary avocation and were paid for the hours I spend here at the same rate as I am paid for the hours I spend at my work, I would be paid a great deal more than £480 a year, and the same is true of other Deputies whom I do not care to name.  If the people want &ldquo;duds&rdquo;, then it is perfectly right to invite &ldquo;duds&rdquo; to come and take a &ldquo;dud's&rdquo; salary; but if the people want the best men in the country, let them make up their minds whether they want them on a salary basis or a semi-voluntary basis.  If they want them on a semi-voluntary basis, I believe the best men in this country will be proud to be elected to this Assembly without any salary; but if they want them as paid servants, the people will have to make <Col N="2030" /> up their minds that they will have to pay them a great deal more than £480 a year.</P>
    <P>I would regard it as a great catastrophe if the voluntary system of public representation came to an end in this country.  I want to see maintained in this country the system of farmers, shopkeepers, labourers and professional men coming in here, doing their Parliamentary work, maintaining in so far as possible their normal avocations at the same time, and receiving from the State a sum sufficient to compensate them for the actual loss they sustain as a result of conscientiously doing their work, but no more.</P>
    <P>Before I part from that point, I want to sound this note of warning.  The practice is growing in this country of charging Deputies with being motivated by every kind of base motive&mdash; that we are here for the salaries we get, that we are in a soft job and that we are in the position which Clann na Talmhan were going to right when they get into Dáil Eireann.</P>
    <P>If that kind of talk is to be maintained for a long time, nobody will come to this House but those with gangster mentalities, because respectable men will not suffer public insult of that kind for doing nothing but their duty as public men, and if that kind of talk is maintained in the public life of the country, you will end up by having in Dáil Eireann 137 men who have no reputations to lose and who, therefore, do not care what anybody says about them.  I have seen that happen in the State legislatures of certain States in the United States of America, where the standard of abuse of men in public life became so foul that no decent man would stand for the State Parliament. The result was that, in certain legislatures, they got a collection of gangsters, because no decent man was prepared to have his reputation bespattered and besmirched by every urchin who wanted to scrabble for votes by slandering his neighbours.</P>

      <P>I was not given much time.  This motion was put down to afford Clann na Talmhan an opportunity of taking steps to reduce Parliamentary salaries, if they really believe it ought to be done.  Deputy Cogan says his sole concern is to get income-tax paid, to get the provisions of the Act of 1925 repealed.  Deputy Cogan is quite mistaken if he thinks that exemption from income-tax was conferred by the Act of 1925.  It was not; it was conferred by the Act of 1938, which he took a part in debating here.  When he was discussing Section 3 of that Act when it was before the House, he made no reference at all to that part of the section which exempted his salary from income-tax.  This sudden solicitude about income-tax is now come to him. What Clann na Talmhan tried to prove <Col N="2032" /> down the country was that, if they got in here, they would reduce the Parliamentary allowances of Deputies.  Now is their chance; let them vote for my motion, and we will set up this committee and reduce salaries, if they are too high.  But they will take darn good care not to vote for it, lest their salaries should be reduced, because they do not want them reduced.</P>
      <P>In the very few minutes left to me, I want to say that the Tánaiste said that it is better to let this kind of propaganda die.  I do not believe that you can afford to let this kind of propaganda die.  I have seen this kind of propaganda bring legislatures down to the depths, whatever Deputy Larkin may say about it.  I have seen legislatures brought to the level that no respectable man would enter their portals.  I want to see Dáil Eireann an institution respected by every section of the community as truly representative of the Irish people; I want to see membership of this Dáil as the highest honour to which a citizen of this State can aspire.  Therefore, I say that whenever and wherever the type of propaganda for which Clann na Talmhan has been responsible shows its head, so long as I am in public life, I will drag it into the open, expose it for what it is and give those who spread that kind of propaganda an opportunity of demonstrating before their constituents whether they are honest or false.  I say that Clann na Talmhan has represented to the people of this country that Deputies here were receiving not only an allowance but an excessive salary.</P>
      <P>I now vouchsafe them an opportunity of collaborating with me in bringing that salary down to whatever level they think their constituents would think a fair and just allowance or salary for Deputies.  Deputy Cogan, in 1938, found that although £480 a year was to be provided, he was going to hand £120 away every year.  I do not know whether he did that or not.</P>

Let him vote for this resolution, and go on the committee I propose to set up, or any other shape of committee this House may think more effective for the purpose, and we will reduce the salaries, if they should be reduced.  The type of propaganda I am concerned to abate will doubtless recur from time to time.  So long as I am here, those who promote it will be drawn into the open and shown up for the frauds they are, and, when I am gone, I pray God that there will be someone here to give the same dose of medicine to the same kind of frauds, <Col N="2034" /> whencever they come and whenever they come, in the country, in the House, or outside this country, for the purpose of traducing the representative institutions of the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This is a short Bill of eight clauses of a rather technical character.  The purpose of the Bill is to amend in certain particulars five sections of the Labourers Act, 1936 and one section of the Housing and Labourers Act, 1937.  To explain briefly the full purport of the Bill, it is necessary to say that the Labourers Act of 1936, as amended by Part III of the Housing and Labourers Act 1937, was framed for the purpose of enabling the occupiers of labourers' cottages to become the owners of the cottages, subject to the conditions set out in that Act, and to enable the country board of health, now the county council, by means of a purchase scheme to vest these cottages in the purchasers, that is, in the cottiers occupying them.  Out of a total of 62,592 cottages in the State, 2,963 were, in fact, vested in the occupiers up to the end of last September.  These figures, I suggest, speak for themselves and clearly indicate that the provisions of the 1936 Act were not availed of by those whom it was intended ostensibly to benefit from the provisions of that Act.</P>
      <P>Section 2 of the Act of 1936 contains the definition of a purchase scheme which, in the case of a labourer's cottage, is the instrument by which occupancy is transferred into ownership. The purchase scheme is required to contain provisions relating to the terms of sale and the payment of annuities in respect of every cottage vested in the occupier.  So far as the section goes, no clue was given as to the intention of the Government or the county council with regard to the basis on which these annuities would be fixed.</P>
      <P>In practice, however, the schemes approved by the Minister contained a provision fixing the annuities on the basis of 75 per cent. of the rent payable before purchase.  That is to say, a purchase scheme will not be approved by the Minister, unless it provides that the annuity payable under it will amount to a sum equal to 75 per cent. of the former rent, even though, when he was paying rent, the tenant was entitled to have repairs carried out for him by the country council, whereas under the purchase scheme he is personally responsible for the carrying out of all repairs to his own cottage.</P>
      <P>Clause 3 of the Bill now under discussion seeks to amend this provision by inserting in the Principal Act a definition of the expression &ldquo;terminable annuity.&rdquo;  In this clause, the definition given to the expression is that it means an annuity which does not exceed 50 per cent. of the rent at which the cottage was let to the original occupier.  Briefly, the effect of the proposal is that a cottage purchaser will pay an annuity of not more than half his former rent, instead of paying three-quarters, as was the case hitherto.  Of course, under the Act of 1936, he also takes on the new liability of keeping the cottage in repair at his own expense. That obligation is not affected by the provisions of the present Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next important provision in the Bill is contained in Clause 6, which relates to the payment period.  Again, <Col N="2037" /> the purpose of this clause can be stated briefly.</P>
    <P>It is this: the payment period shall be reckoned as a term of 50 years from the date on which the cottage was let to its first occupier.  If, therefore, a cottage is 40 years old at the date on which it is vested in the occupier under the Act of 1936, the Bill proposes that the payment of annuities will continue for another 10 years, when the payments will cease completely.</P>
    <P>The Bill also proposes to modify one of the statutory conditions prescribed in the Act of 1936 in relation to a vesting order.  Section 17 of that Act provides, for instance, that the vesting order shall contain a provision to the effect that, on the death of the purchaser, the cottage may be used only for the use of a relative who was resident in the cottage at the time of his death.  There is a provision in the present Bill to remove the limiting words &ldquo;at the time of death,&rdquo; that is to say, the Bill proposes that the widow, or a child of the owner, selected by him, may succeed him as owner of the cottage, even though such person was not actually residing in the cottage at the time of the owner's death.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Did I understand the Deputy to say that the purpose of the amendment which is proposed in sub-section (2) of Section 6 is to allow the owner to select the person who is to inherit the cottage after his death? If that be so, it is not clear from the sub-section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the Minister should read up the wild, reckless promises made to the tenants in 1932 when he was seeking to be Minister&mdash; and a misfit of a Minister at that.  Two, other small amendments are proposed in relation to the Act of 1936.  Firstly, it is proposed that the time for the lodging of objections to the making of a particular purchase scheme by the county council be extended from three weeks, as provided in the Act of 1936, to six weeks, as provided in the Bill. Secondly, it proposes to extend from one week to six weeks the period of notice which is required to be given to the occupier of a cottage against whom proceedings are being taken by the county council for possession of the cottage, in a case of arrears of annuities.</P>
      <P>Under the Act of 1936, it is sufficient for the council to give one week's notice of their intention to institute proceedings against the cottier who is in arrear with his payments but, in the event of any form of non-compliance with the statutory conditions, they are required to give him not less than six weeks' notice.  The purpose of the proposal in the present Bill is to ensure that the practice in regard to the giving of notice will be uniform, regardless of the grounds on which it is given.  That exhausts the provisions of the Bill so far as they relate to the Act of 1936.  It contains one other provision which has reference to Part III of the Housing and Labourers Act, 1937, which, itself, was an Act to amend the Labourers Act of 1936.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section II of the Act of 1937 makes provision for the funding of such arrears of rent as are due in respect of a cottage which is being vested in the occupier under the Principal Act <Col N="2039" /> at the vesting date.  The provisions themselves are quite reasonable so far as the majority of the cottiers are concerned and no attempt is made in this Bill to disturb them.  But the provision made in 1937 in respect of the payment of interest on the funded arrears is entirely unwarranted and the final proposal of the present Bill is to delete it from the statute.  The relevant provision in the Act of 1937 is to the effect that the arrears which have been funded shall be paid with interest added, if the council so directs, at such rate, not exceeding 4? per cent. per annum, as the council may appoint.  The Bill proposes to eliminate the specific reference to the 4¾ per cent. rate of interest so as to leave open the question of calculating the rate of interest.  While, of course, the reference in the Act is to a &ldquo;maximum&rdquo; rate of interest, generally the 4¾ per cent. has become the target at which county managers and the Department aim.  In certain cases, it may be proper to charge interest; in other cases it may be unreasonable to do so.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not aim at settling that point; it seeks merely, so far as the clause in question is concerned, to get rid of the specific provision relating to the payment of interest in respect of funded arrears.  Henceforth, if this Bill becomes law, the matter will be an open question for discussion on its merits as to whether or not interest may properly be charged.</P>
    <P>If the purpose of the Bill were to be described in a phrase, it might be said of it that it is a measure designed to give effect to the primary intention of the Labourers Act of 1936&mdash;that is, of having 60,000 labourers' cottages vested in their occupiers under terms of purchase of which the occupiers can approve and which they will be able to fulfil without placing an insupportable burden on their backs.  If it is passed into law, it will make the Act of 1936 a living reality instead of being a dead letter, as at present.</P>

      <P>I should like to hear from the Minister how many of the cottiers accepted the provisions of the previous Act.  Has it not been wholeheartedly turned down?  I think that I would be right in saying that, out of 63,000 cottage tenants, only about 1,000 or 1,500 decided to accept purchase. After all, would it not be wise, and good policy on behalf of the Government, to put 63,000 cottage tenants in possession of their premises and holdings? What did His Holiness the Pope say in his broadcast on Christmas Eve 12 months ago?  He said that the worker should be given some stake in the country, particularly the heads of large families.</P>
      <P>If the Government accepts this amending Bill, I can assure the Minister, on behalf of the 63,000 cottage tenants for whom I speak, that 98 per cent. or 99 per cent. of them will agree to purchase their homes. They will, thereby, be securing that stake in the country to which they are justly entitled.  The farmers have been given a 50 per cent. reduction in the amount of their annuities.  They got that following the withholding of the moneys from Britain.  The cottage tenants claim that they are equally entitled to a similar reduction.  The Fianna Fáil Party made 12 promises&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;before they got into power, and one of them was that they would introduce a purchase scheme that would be acceptable to the cottage tenants.  I am always ready to give credit where credit is due, but that was one of the promises made on a particular poster that I saw.  The Party, when it did get into power, passed through a cottage purchase scheme, but the terms of it were not acceptable, with the result that only 1,000 tenants out of a total of 60,000 purchased their cottages.  Therefore, I say the Government Party did not fulfil their promises to those tenants by introducing an acceptable purchase scheme.</P>
      <P>In my opinion, if the 50 per cent. reduction were given to the tenants it would prove a great benefit to the general body of the ratepayers because at the present time the cost of repairs, especially in the case of the older cottages, is a heavy burden on the county councils and boards of health.  The proposals in this Bill, therefore, would mean a saving to the ratepayers as far as the pre-1922 cottages are concerned. The owners would then have the responsibility for the upkeep of the cottages.  I am sure the Minister would agree that a 25 per cent. reduction would not go any way towards meeting the cost of repair of those old cottages. I know that in county Meath, where the execution of repairs was neglected for some period, repairs cost thousands of pounds.  Cottages rented at 1/7d. and 1/9d. per week have cost as much as £50 each to repair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not know that this Bill was coming on to-night and therefore I have not by me figures which I had proposed to give.  If I had the figures I think I could satisfy the Minister that the ratepayers and the local authorities would gain by giving this 50 per cent. reduction to the cottage tenants. I, therefore, appeal to the Minister, to the Government Party and to every Party in the House to support this Bill.  By doing so they will be conferring the rights of ownership on 63,000 cottage tenants, men who are the backbone of the nation.  Those <Col N="2042" /> agricultural labourers and cottage holders are as important a section of the community as any other.  I want to give the Government every credit for the measures of social justice which they have passed through the Oireachtas since coming into office. But none of those measures, in my opinion, ranks in importance with the one that we are considering to-night. Would it not be a grand thing for a cottage tenant to be able to feel in his old age that he was the owner of his cottage and had the right to nominate his successor?</P>
    <P>Such a measure as this would be an encouragement to the tenants to make their homes and their surroundings beautiful.  Their position to-day is that they are simply tenants at will.  They have no security in their cottages and can be served with a notice to quit, without any, reason being stated. Surely that is not the right way to treat the cottage tenants of this nation.  His Holiness the Pope has said that the worker should be given some stake in the country, and particularly when he is the head of a family. This Bill presents an opportunity of doing that in the case of 63,000 cottage tenants.  At the present time, if a tenant is served with a notice to quit, he has no defence in law.  The strange thing about that is that though we denounce British law and have denounced English Acts of Parliament, the summons in the case is issued under an Act passed in the British House of Commons.  There is nothing about an Act passed by the Irish Parliament because I am certain that an Irish Parliament would not pass such a measure.  The present position is that a man may be the occupier of one of these cottages for 40 years and then because perhaps he displeases somebody, he can be told to get out with no reason given.  I can assure the Minister that if the Government accept this measure the cottage tenants will respond by accepting the proposals it contains of becoming the owners of their cottages.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
