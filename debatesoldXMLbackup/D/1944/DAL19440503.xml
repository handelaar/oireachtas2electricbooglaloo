      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to vote in favour of the amendment and against the Second Reading of the Bill, for sound and, I hope, convincing reasons. Everybody who has spoken in this debate so far, except the Minister, has suggested or admitted that it is very inadvisable at the moment to proceed any further with the motion for the Second Reading of this very important measure.  It has been properly pointed out by several speakers that certain sections of the Bill, particularly the compensation clauses, may be affected by the report of the tribunal set up by this House and, as a result, the compensation to be paid to the stockholders in the Dublin United Transport Company and the Great Southern Railways Company may be different from what is proposed by the Minister in this measure.  In response to a suggestion made by me here yesterday, the Minister admitted&mdash;and I was glad he did it so frankly&mdash;that the reputation of the existing management of the Great Southern Railways, which is likely to be the management of the future, is involved or likely to be involved in the report made by the tribunal.  I think these are two very <Col N="2004" /> good reasons why the amendment should be accepted by the Minister and the Second Reading of this Bill deferred until such time as the tribunal report is made public or is furnished to members of this House.</P>
      <P>There is another very important reason in support of the amendment. Many members of this House, and large sections of the trading and travelling public, are not convinced that the recent reductions in rail services, including the suspension of branch line services, are justified by the facts as we know them.  I am not satisfied that a good case has been made, either by the Minister or by the railway authorities, in support of the recent proposals, approved of by the Minister, for the closing down of several branch line services of the Great Southern Railways and for the reduction in the main line services. For instance, the suspension of return fares is just another way of adding 20 per cent. to the passenger rates paid by the travelling public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister himself has said that the management must be conducted in accordance with the requirements of public policy, and I think the requirements of public policy are dealt with in this Bill.  They should be defined more clearly by the Minister, in his reply, than they were outlined by him in his elaborate introductory statement.  I wish to say <Col N="2005" /> quite frankly, and in order to be fair to the Minister, that he made his introductory statement in conciliatory and fairly convincing terms.  They were not convincing, however, from my point of view, from the point that he was justified in doing a somersault on the major policy issue, that is, on the question of nationalisation versus private monopoly as proposed in this Bill.</P>
      <P>The management of the Great Southern Railways has been entrusted to a chairman-dictator, and when that appointment was made, and when it was challenged here at a particular time, I supported the Minister in his attitude in making a drastic change in the management of the railway at that particular period.  I knew that things could not be worse than they were and that, if any sound commonsense chairman-dictator could be found to replace the people responsible for the mismanagement of the railway up to that particular period, it would do good. That was the reason I supported the proposal put forward.  On an occasion of this kind, I think we are entitled briefly to review the policy of that chairman-dictator, related particularly to the point that the man who has been in charge of the railway system for the past two years is likely to be&mdash;almost certain to be&mdash;the chairman-dictator provided for under the terms of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that perfectly well.  I was coming to the House the other day&mdash;I think it was last Friday&mdash; and I was called to one side by a gentleman&mdash;I think he is well known to the Minister&mdash;and he said: &ldquo;Come here, Davin; do you ever back a double?  Would you like to back a winner?&rdquo; I said I had had the misfortune to back losers on more occasions than I backed winners.  I do not gamble very much.  I know the Minister is a good sportsman.  &ldquo;Take it from me,&rdquo; said this gentleman, &ldquo;the best thing going for this week is a double for the railway and transport stakes, Mr. Reynolds for chairman and a prominent Transport Union official for a place.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2006" /> There is another reason which would justify me in opposing this measure as it stands, and that is the unusual proposal contained in it as regards fixing the date for the coming into operation of this legislation.  I know of no other Bill introduced into this House&mdash;I am subject to correction on this matter&mdash; in which the commencing date was named.  The commencing date clause in connection with measures of this kind has always been put down in a different fashion&mdash;usually there are words inserted in a particular section giving power to the Minister to make regulations fixing the date for the coming into operation of the legislation, partially or wholly.  Here we have a date fixed on which the provisions of this very comprehensive measure are to be brought into operation.  I put it to the Minister, with great respect, that in the existing circumstances, and with such limited time at our disposal for the discussion of this very important Bill, it is utterly impossible from the point of view of Parliamentary business, properly to consider the various sections if we are to permit the Bill to be put into operation on July 1st, as is proposed in a certain section.  I strongly urge, if the Bill is read a Second Time, that the Government should alter that date.</P>
    <P>The policy enshrined in this Bill is a complete reversal of the transport policy of the Fianna Fáil Party, as indicated from time to time over a long period of years by the Minister.  This Bill, in the opinion of many people who would be inclined to regard it in an impartial way, is based on a Fascist philosophy.  It is an amazing thing that a Minister, who presumably stands for democratic principles and who, up to yesterday, advocated a policy of nationalisation for the country's transport services, should in such a short time turn such a somersault in regard to a big issue of this kind.  It is not necessary for me to go back upon the many speeches made by the Minister, both outside and inside the Dáil.  The Minister's policy, as indicated when he was introducing this Bill yesterday, is a complete reversal, without any justification, of the policy that was put before the <Col N="2007" /> people by him and his colleagues since they came into office in 1932.  Would it be unfair for me to suggest that, in backing the election of the Fianna Fáil Government in 1932, the Labour Party at that period indicated they were doing so because of the transport policy of the Minister?  That was one of a number of items indicated to us as part and parcel of the Fianna Fáil policy.  Fianna Fáil Ministers said they would regard it as their duty, having come into office, to put their transport policy and their policy in respect of four or five other major matters into operation.</P>
    <P>It is hardly necessary to remind the House that no attempt was made, subsequent to the formation of the Fianna Fáil Government, to bring the policy of nationalisation of transport services into operation.  In 1933 the Minister got the House to pass a measure which, in his opinion, would stabilise the railway services, give us an efficient transport system, give the trading and travelling public cheaper rates, and ensure for the workers engaged in the industry more security of tenure and better conditions of service.  Is that not a fair interpretation of what the Minister said when he was concluding on the Fifth Stage of the Railways Act of 1933?  I take it he is not disputing that summarised version of the speech he delivered on that occasion.  He wound up by saying that this was the last opportunity private ownership of the transport of this country was going to get and, if it was necessary to go further, the next step would be nationalisation of all the transport services of the State.</P>
    <P>Here we have a Bill containing quite a different policy.  It is the most extraordinary measure ever introduced in this House in my memory, and I have been here since 1922.  It is a measure which sets up a private monopoly, but puts the onus on the taxpayers to provide the money with which to carry on the proposed scheme to improve the existing transport system.  It places an obligation on the taxpayers in the future if necessary, to find the money which will <Col N="2008" /> pay the interest on the £16,000,000 debenture shares.  While the taxpayers may be called upon to guarantee the interest upon the capital of £16,000,000, not one representative of the taxpayers in this House can raise a question as to the administration of this measure.  I say that that is a Fascist philosophy.  It is produced to us in very naked form.  It is an amazing reversal of the policy over which the Minister stood since 1932.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is a hardworking Minister who gives good service to the citizens according to his own lights, but he had no right to go before the people, among whom are thousands of railwaymen in his own constituency in Dublin City South, and in Athlone and Cork and elsewhere, and tell them that his policy for the stabilisation of the transport services was a policy of nationalisation.  He comes in here, after having misled the citizens of the State, and produces a Bill which is quite the opposite to what he promised the people when discussing this matter on several occasions since 1931.</P>
    <P>The Minister on many occasions in this House taunted the members of the Labour Party with constantly criticising proposals of the Government and failing or refusing, because of their inability or because they were lazy, or for some other reason, to produce any constructive alternative.  Now, the Minister in his introductory speech yesterday did mention the fact that this Party had sent him a copy of certain proposals which had been prepared over a very long period dealing with this whole matter.  These proposals, which were prepared with the knowledge that the Minister had committed himself in his public statements here and outside the House to a certain policy and after careful consideration and examination of the matter by railway experts, experts on the financial side as well as on the operating side, are our constructive alternative to the suggestions in this Bill.  No matter what he may think of the contents of the document which was sent to him with the compliments of the Labour Party, no matter what he may say about their soundness or <Col N="2009" /> otherwise, the Minister cannot accuse us in future, at any rate, of failing to face up to a solution of this particular problem.</P>
    <P>When dealing with the question of nationalisation and trying to explain to the House why he had changed his attitude and why the attitude of his colleagues had changed on this question of major policy, the Minister apparently had our proposals in his mind. He made the extraordinary excuse for refusing to accept the policy of nationalisation that a nationalised transport service meant a subsidised transport service.  I refuse to accept that argument.  It is possible to conduct a transport service under a system of nationalisation administered through public utility corporations in such a way as to give an efficient service to the public at even cheaper rates than are being provided at present and to give to the workers engaged in the industry better and more secure service conditions than they now appear to be entitled to.</P>
    <P>There is no use in the Minister quoting the case of Belgium.  It is not a sound comparison with the conditions prevailing here.  The Minister talks about a subsidised transport service.  I wonder does he know that when this war broke out, every country that was immediately involved in the war, where the railways and the transport services were not at the time under the control of the Government, immediately brought the railways and transport services under Governmental control.  I wonder does he know that, following the adoption of that policy in Great Britain, not alone have the railways not increased their rates to any great extent but, after making full provision for the standard revenue, actually handed over to the British Chancellor of the Exchequer a year ago £43,000,000, which was the excess revenue over the standard revenue provided for under the British Railways Act.  There is no question of a subsidy there.  As well as rendering an important national service during the period of the war, in addition to the fact that they did not to any great extent increase the goods or passenger rates, they handed over £43,000,000 to <Col N="2010" /> the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, and, if my information is correct&mdash;I could not produce evidence to prove it at this stage&mdash;a bigger sum is likely to be handed over as a result of the current year's working of the British railways.  How is it that countries which are at war and whose Governments did not believe in the policy of nationalisation immediately adopt a policy of nationalisation or Governmental control when war breaks out?  I refuse to accept the suggestion that a nationalised transport industry automatically means a subsidised transport industry.  Indeed, if we are to judge the administration of the larger transport concern here subsequent to the coming into operation of this Bill as it now stands, I do not think that the country will be assured of any more efficient railway service or any cheaper form of transport.  Certainly, so far as one can judge, the security of the workers employed in the industry is in very grave danger.</P>
    <P>I said that I strongly supported the appointment by the Minister a couple of years ago of the present chairman-dictator. I admit that the chairman-dictator came into that position at a very critical period when the railway industry was on the verge of collapse. I always assume that a dictator who is gifted with common sense and good judgment and who knows his job is not by any means a dangerous man and that a dictator who knows his job is a man who will not kow-tow to &ldquo;yes-men&rdquo; surrounding him in carrying out the big job that the chairman-dictator, for instance, of the Great Southern Railways was handed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>A strong man in any business concern is a man who does not want &ldquo;yes-men&rdquo; and the only thing I am amazed at is that the chairman of the Great Southern Railways in the past, who could not help in the exceptional circumstances being surrounded by three or four &ldquo;yes-men,&rdquo; did that.  If the man who is there at the moment is to be the person to administer this Bill, I would be amazed, if he is a man who knows his business, if he will tolerate six or seven &ldquo;yes-men&rdquo; around him.  They are there as `yes-men&rdquo; and, according to the relevant <Col N="2011" /> clause of the Bill, they have no power except to sit at the board meetings. Six out of seven of them can be present at a meeting but, if the chairman is absent, they can do no business.  Unless the chairman is present and agrees to take a certain decision and to put that decision into operation, the other six can talk as long as they like, but they cannot prevent the chairman from carrying out whatever decision he has come to. If there is any greater example of &ldquo;yes-men&rdquo; I do not know where it is to be found in any commercial concern in this or any other country.  I do not know too much about the working of similar concerns in other countries since 1939, but there is no other case of the kind in the world that I know of.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I do not know how six self-respecting commercially-minded men, who know their own business, but who know nothing about the transport industry, would take a job on the board of the Great Southern Railways without having any power except the power to talk and collect fees for doing nothing or for being prevented from doing anything.  The &ldquo;yes-men&rdquo; who have been serving with the chairman-dictator for the past couple of years are to get extraordinarily generous terms of compensation under these proposals, while the railwaymen, the men who help to carry on the industry from day to day, are not guaranteed anything, except those of them who may be declared redundant between 1st July and 31st December. I have a limited knowledge of transport operating work and I have a fairy intimate knowledge of the very large number of men who have been employed over a long period of years by the Great Southern Railways.</P>
    <P>The Minister amazed me when he suggested yesterday that there would be very little redundancy, while, in an earlier portion of his speech, he suggested that there would be considerable economies.  If there are to be considerable economies, as a result of the so-called unification scheme provided in the Bill, are the economies to be in connection with reductions in <Col N="2012" /> purchases of coal, of material?  Where are the economies to be?  Am I to take it that the chairman has indicated to the Minister that there is very little likelihood of any redundancy being created as a result of the coming into operation of the measure and that any redundancy likely to arise will disclose itself between 1st July and 31st December? In other words, is it to be understood that the chairman-dictator and his advisers have gone into this scheme in such detail that they know exactly the number of railway officials, if any, who are likely to become redundant as a result of the coming into operation of this measure on 1st July?</P>
    <P>I suspect that it would take a long time after the measure came into operation to find out where redundancy would arise, and, if that is so, it naturally follows that the compensation period provided for those who are likely to become redundant should be extended to far beyond 31st December.  The chairman is a marvellous man if he could walk down to the Minister's office the day before the Bill was introduced, and give him exactly the number of persons likely to become redundant.  Did the chairman give in detail to the Minister, when discussing this aspect, the improved methods of working likely to be brought into operation following the passage of the Bill?  I suspect that if there are to be improved methods of working from the technical angle in connection with the administration of a long-term measure of this kind, they will not be disclosed until after the war ends, and, if that is so, redundancy will not be exposed until after the war ends, and, on that basis, there is, in my opinion, a very sound argument for extending the period during which compensation will be paid to those who may become redundant.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton on the question of compensation asked the Minister yesterday whether the people who have become redundant at the moment, as a result of what the Minister says is the temporary closing down of branch lines, are entitled to compensation under existing legislation, or will they become entitled automatically to compensation as redundant servants following <Col N="2013" /> the coming into operation of this measure?  I want an answer to that question.  I am personally satisfied&mdash;I hope I am wrong&mdash;that the railway branch lines recently closed down because of alleged shortage of fuel are not likely to be re-opened for a long time, and I suspect that this is associated with the long-term transport plan enshrined in this measure. Why do I say that?  I went on a deputation to the Minister with some of my colleagues representing my constituency a few days ago, and it was suggested that if the Minister could see his way to carry on the working of a certain branch line, that line could be carried on, to the satisfaction of the people who know a good deal about the running of the railway, with fuel consisting of turf and timber.  I have a letter from some railway people who are affected by the closing down of what is known as the Shillelagh branch.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>They are, but what has happened in the recent past has a very definite bearing on the administration of the measure we are discussing.  I am relating this to the compensation clauses of the Bill.  The Minister yesterday declined to give a definite assurance as to whether persons who recently became redundant as a result of the closing down of branch lines are entitled to compensation under the existing law, or whether they will be entitled to compensation under the terms of this measure.  If engine drivers and firemen who know their jobs better than I do and better than the chairman-dictator knows them, men who have been working these branch lines&mdash;the Shillelagh branch and the Mountmellick-Portlaoighise branch to which I am referring&mdash;say that these sections can be carried on with turf and timber&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made it relevant by references in his speech. He talked about the recent closing down of these branch lines as being temporary and I am endeavouring, following upon his statement, to give reasons&mdash;they may be wrong&mdash;as to why I think these branch lines have been deliberately closed down, never to be re-opened.  Following on that, some hundreds of railway men are declared to be redundant and I am asking simply whether compensation will be provided for these redundant men, either under this Bill or under the existing law.  I think that is a fair argument and I am not wasting time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am endeavouring to make the case that if the present chairman-dictator is to be the chairman-dictator of the future, and if the policy of that dictator in the recent past is to be his policy in the future, this Bill is a farce.  I may not be making that case as well as a better educated man, or as men with university degrees, could make it, but I am trying to make the case as a person who has been employed in the transport industry for 37 years and who knows a little about the operating side of the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the things I regret more than anything else about the attitude of the chairman is his general attitude towards the railway workers.  Deputy O'Higgins made a very significant remark yesterday when speaking in opposition to the Bill and in favour of his amendment, when he said it was quite possible that the persons appointed to administer this measure might look upon this in a rather peculiar way.  In other words, he said, there might be a chairman-dictator who was a purely road or rail-minded man.  I knew perfectly well, when the present chairman was appointed by the Minister, that, because of his past <Col N="2015" /> limited experience of the running of a local service, he naturally would be a road-minded man.  I think that has been proved up to the hilt by the policy he has pursued since he took office.  He has made a number of new appointments which make it quite clear that he looks on the roads rather than the railways as the kernel of the transport system of the future.  It is one of the things that cannot escape the attention of railwaymen.  I think that it was the duty, that it still is the duty, of every railway servant employed by the Great Southern Railways to co-operate, for their own selfish sakes, if you like, with the powers-that-be in order to try to bring about as efficient a system of transport as possible and to give the public a really satisfactory and efficient transport system.</P>
    <P>I am inclined to think&mdash;in fact, I am convinced&mdash;that the chairman of the company looked upon railwaymen with a certain amount of suspicion. He did not appear to take them into his confidence, from the very first day that he took up his position as manager at Kingsbridge, and the Minister knows just as well as I do, if not better than I do, that a number of the important appointments that were made subsequent to the chairman's taking up office during the last couple of years were drawn from persons outside the railway service and from persons who had been associated with road transport services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit, with all respect, Sir, that the successful working of this measure is very closely related to the ability, intelligence, and balanced judgment of the chairman-dictator-to-be of the company, who, I suspect, will be the man who is there at the moment and who has pursued a certain policy during the two or three years in which he has occupied that position.  I assure the Minister with all sincerity that I have no personal prejudice against that man.  I do not envy him in the difficult job that he has had during the last couple of years, nor do I envy him in the more difficult job that he will have to face if he retains the position of chairman-dictator in the coming years.  I was trying to relate the few remaining remarks that I want to make to the Minister's statement, namely, that the management of the company must be conducted in accordance with the requirements of public policy.  Is it part of the public policy of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to encourage the chairman-dictator to act in the way he has acted towards the railway workers in the recent past?  Whenever the chairman-dictator has anything to give away, he sends for what he calls representatives of the rank and file.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I never heard of such an attitude being adopted by the head of a concern which is going to have control over the lives of about 80,000 of our citizens.  He must know perfectly well that a number of long established organisations are in existence and that <Col N="2017" /> they represent the considered opinion of the overwhelming majority of the railway workers here; but instead of sending for the elected representatives of the organised railway workers, whenever he has anything to give away or anything to discuss in connection, for instance, with the setting up of a pensions scheme, he sends for the representatives of what he calls the rank and file.  Is that Communism, or what kind of an &ldquo;ism&rdquo; is it?  Any man of well-balanced and sound judgment, if he wants the co-operation of the workers in connection with a huge industry such as this, would surely send for the elected representatives of the men concerned and discuss with them such matters as their living conditions and so on.  I am sure that some of the railway men who were sent for by the chairman represented nobody but themselves.  Some of them, probably, are well known in the local Fianna Fáil Cumainn but they do not represent the organised workers, and yet they are sent for while the real representatives of the organised workers, who have represented the workers over a period of years, are ignored in connection with a matter affecting their livelihood and that of their families.</P>
    <P>I want to know from the Minister in what way that kind of activity is related to, or in accordance with, the requirements of what he calls public policy.  If it is, it is another reason why we should oppose the Second Reading of this Bill; it is another reason why, at any rate, the Minister should have a serious talk with the man who has been carrying on the concern in such a manner.  The same person recently instructed his general manager to send for the representatives of the unions when this transport crisis arose.</P>

Section 10 of the Railways Act, 1933, says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;From and after the passing of this Act the rates of pay, hours of duty, and other conditions of service of the road transport employees of a railway company, employed for any of the purposes of the road transport business carried on by such company and whose depot or other place of employment is situated in Saorstát Eireann, shall be regulated in accordance with agreements made or to be from time to time made between the trade unions representative of such employees of the one part and such railway company of the other part.&rdquo;</P>

The existing railway unions have been in existence for a long period.  Deputy O'Sullivan, Deputy Keyes and I have been members of some of these unions for the greater part of a lifetime.  I want to put this matter to the Minister fairly and squarely and I do not accuse him of any personal prejudice in this connection. Railwaymen, irrespective of the particular section of the industry in which they work, have lifelong rights as members of trade unions. They have paid for insurance benefits, for pensions for their widows and orphans if they themselves pass out while in the service, for unemployment benefit during the period of a railway strike or a crisis in which they lose their employment and for convalescent benefits.  It is proposed by this chairman-dictator to take these constitutional rights from the railwaymen by a stroke of the pen.</P>

      <P>I suppose that if this Bill survives the Second Reading Stage, I will have another and better opportunity of dealing with many of the matters of importance that arise as a result of its introduction.  For the remaining portion of my life in the transport industry&mdash;a short portion&mdash;I want to see an efficient transport industry, efficient from the point of view of service to the community, as well as one that will offer more security than has apparently existed up to the present for those carrying on the industry.  I said also that if the chairman-dictator to be appointed under the terms of this Bill has a good sound knowledge of the transport industry, knows his future policy, has made up his mind as to what should be done in order to provide more and better transport services for the community, he will not&mdash;if he is a strong man who knows his job&mdash;take the insult offered to him by the section of this Bill which gives him the assistance of six &ldquo;yes-men.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He has had the services&mdash;if they have rendered service&mdash;of these &ldquo;yes-men&rdquo; and I ask Deputies of this House to examine the over-generous terms of compensation provided by this measure for these &ldquo;yes-men.&rdquo; Some of them occupy several directorships and chairmanships.  I understand that one of the men who is going to get compensation under the terms of this Bill will get compensation if he goes out.  He is nearly 80 years of age and before the next meeting he will get compensation as a director of the Dublin United Transport Company, and compensation as a retiring director of the Great Southern Railways Company as well. He has several other directorships including the chairmanship of the famous Dublin Gas Company.  Compare these terms with the so-called terms of compensation provided for the railway workers who because of the redundancy inside a short period, and outside the period of redundancy <Col N="2028" /> prescribed in the Bill, will have to leave their jobs.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the Bill will effect considerable economies, but he did not say in what particular department or section these economies would be achieved.  If economies are brought about by the reduction in the prices paid for materials, or in the quantities of materials purchased, very well, but I suspect that the considerable economies will be brought about as a result of the redundancy created by the terms of this measure.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I want to ask the Minister one question.  The Minister continued to talk during his speech about the unification of transport, the principle supposed to be enshrined in this Bill.  If this is a Bill as he says for the unification of all the transport services of this country in one public concern, why has he left out the Grand Canal Company?  I have spoken to several transport people who might be able to give me some explanation as to why the Grand Canal Company was left out of the Bill.  It is over 20 years since a commission set up by the Minister's predecessor reported in favour of the nationalisation of inland waterways and canals.  One of the advisers, who is on the Minister's right-hand side to-day, a man who has a lifetime of service in the transport industry, was the efficient secretary of that commission.  If that commission found it necessary to recommend unanimously the nationalisation of inland waterways and canal companies why is the Grand Canal Company left out of this so-called unification scheme?</P>
    <P>I want to tell this to Deputy Larkin, and it may be information to him. People who are in a position to know the facts are saying that the reason the Grand Canal Company has been left out of this so-called unification of transport is because Jim Larkin's Union is in control of the workers there, and it would be a dangerous thing to do.  If that is not the reason, let the Minister give us the real reason.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarSeanDoyle" hpid="Mr. P.S. Doyle Mr. P.S. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some very objectionable features of this Bill <Col N="2029" /> to which I desire to refer briefly.  As a Dublin citizen and as a representative of the citizens, I contend that this city, the capital of the country, should have a transport service separate from that of the country, and that it should not be bound up with it in any way as it is proposed should be done under the Bill.  The citizens have for many years enjoyed an ideal transport service which has a great record for efficiency.  They feel, and it is my opinion, that the Dublin transport services will not be bettered by this measure.</P>
      <P>The position of the Dublin Corporation has already been referred to by various Deputies who are also members of the corporation.  They have pointed out that the obligations of the two companies, the railway and the transport company, are not being transferred to the new company under the Bill.  I understood the Minister to say that they are.  But members of the corporation are advised and contend that there is no definite provision in the Bill to cover this.  I think the Minister ought to safeguard the rights of the citizens by transferring the existing rights of the corporation and ensuring that they are inside the scope of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Section 41 provides that compensation shall be payable to employees only if their office or situation is abolished within six months from the 1st July directly and solely as the result of the amalgamation.  But the section is qualified to provide that compensation shall not be payable if the abolition of situations or offices is due to decrease in renewal or maintenance work, alteration of methods of working, closing of railway lines or other economic causes.  The expression economic causes covers a wide field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the new company has to do is to defer taking action in the case of any employee until after the lapse of the first six months.  Then the employee may be dispensed with without compensation and, in any event, exceptions in the section rule out any possibility of anybody obtaining compensation because everything is <Col N="2030" /> covered to deprive all employees of any grounds for claiming that their retirement was directly due to amalgamation. Let us contrast this with the Third Schedule of the Railways Act of 1924, as amended by the existing Officers and Servants Act of 1926, which provided that any employee can qualify for compensation at any time within seven years of the passing of the Act.  It is obvious that, under the present Bill, only two or three members of the company's 15,000 employees can qualify for compensation and then only if their offices are abolished within six months of the passing of the Act.</P>
    <P>Section 60 relates to the new advisory committee.  In selecting a new advisory committee, I would suggest to the Minister that he should make some provision for the inclusion in it of an expert who has a railway mind, and who understands railway work. Without throwing any reflection on any of the persons whom he proposes to appoint, I feel that any man or group of men who are what I might call road transport minded, will not be capable of running a railway under the proper conditions.  I think that railway transport should be kept distinct from road transport.  I do not know to what extent the Minister may accept amendment of this Bill, but as it is presented to us I feel I must oppose the motion for its Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The state of the railways and of transport generally in this country requires that something should be done for them and we have now before us the Transport Bill.  I feel, however, and I think the public generally feel also, that insufficient information has been given to us on this subject.  We have the report of the Transport Tribunal but the proposals contained in this measure should have been more widely discussed and we should have been given more information than we have got up to the present.  That is one of my chief objections to this Bill&mdash;we do not know where we stand in relation to the problem, and we do not know what changes the Bill is going to bring about.  Very wide questions like the <Col N="2031" /> suitability of a railway system in this country are raised by this Bill.  I cannot really deal with that problem in a speech here and no attempt has been made to inform public opinion as to what experts think about it, especially foreign experts.  In that connection I think that it is an utterly unsuitable time to alter the transport system of this country during an emergency, in the middle of a world war.  I would like to recall Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's fear that the present measure would lead only to the bolstering up of an inefficient railway system.  I am not saying that the railway system in the past was inefficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said so. He said it was inefficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come to that later He did say it.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney was afraid that an inefficient system would be bolstered up as a result of this Bill, while Deputy Larkin, Junior, was afraid that the railways would be neglected. There you have two Deputies taking entirely different points of view on this Bill.  I do not think that it is any great tribute to the clarity of the public mind in connection with this matter and I believe the Government should have introduced these proposals in a different way.  They should have cleared the public mind on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two Deputies have put forward diametrically opposed points of view, and we have had this talk of nationalisation. I think that there is a distinction without a difference between nationalisation and what is proposed in the Bill.  After all, nationalisation by creating public ownership of transport, and a system in which the Minister takes on an immense number of new duties in connection with transport, are very close to each other.  If the Bill does not propose public control of transport, I do not know what is meant by public control.  The Minister proposes to make the country liable to pay interest on £16,000,000 capital.  The citizens of the State are <Col N="2032" /> to be saddled with that sum if the railways cannot be made to pay.  That again is more or less nationalisation.</P>
    <P>We have heard a good deal about the dictatorial powers of the proposed chairman under the Bill.  He may have dictatorial powers but there is no doubt as to who is the boss.  The Minister is the boss under this Bill. As I say, I think this is nationalisation in its essence, but unfortunately I think that the scheme will have many of the disadvantages of Governmental control without Governmental responsibility. I am afraid that when any question in connection with transport is raised in this House it will be only too easy for any Minister to say: &ldquo;That is not a question concerning my Department; you had better apply to Córas Iompair Eireann and they will answer you.&rdquo; One will be chasing from Kingsbridge back to the Dáil and, at the end of it all, one will find it impossible to know under which thimble the pea lies.  I think that is a danger that might very easily arise.</P>
    <P>This Bill is designed to help transport. So far so good, but transport is a means; it is not an end in itself, although it is of very great and very vital importance to this country.  It is the handmaiden of agriculture and industry.  It is their servants.  In what way is this Bill going to improve the position of the railways and thereby serve the public generally in a better fashion than has been done hitherto? I would submit that matters can be improved only by putting up rates, getting more traffic or lowering costs generally.  It is not going to be very easy to increase traffic generally without any very great revival in trade. That is a matter which would be entirely outside the transport companies' powers.  As regards lower costs, they may be able to lower costs. I do not know very much about that and I do not suppose anybody in this House is able to say just to what extent the Great Southern Railways Company could at the moment lower their costs.  I do not suppose they could lower them very much.  I feel that the way in which this scheme will be made pay will be by the easiest method, namely that of increasing the <Col N="2033" /> rates and that is at the bottom of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Another method will be to cut out competition.  The Minister in his speech used words which, I think, he was quoting from the Transport Tribunal.  He referred to &ldquo;an uneconomic excess of transport&rdquo;.  That had to me a very ominous sound&mdash;&ldquo;an uneconomic excess of transport&rdquo;. How does one get rid of an uneconomic excess of transport?  If you are in the position of a monopolistic company, you cut out that uneconomic excess.  You can call it uneconomic, as it undoubtedly has been at times, but it has been also ordinary flow of healthy competition.  I believe that in the end this company, whether it starts out with that intention or not, will raise its rates and crush independent hauliers.  To my mind there is no other method of making this company pay.  What do you think any Minister&mdash;I do not refer to the present Minister; there will be other Ministers after him&mdash;faced with the alternative of having to come to Dáil Eireann, admitting that his Department cannot run the railways properly, because he will be partly responsible for them, and asking for money to subsidise the railways, or of putting up charges on the public, who are inarticulate and disorganised, will do?  He will put up the rates.  Of course, he will.  He will not come here, ask for half a million of money or whatever sum he may require and run the gauntlet of the Opposition.  No, he will put so much extra on the rates.  Further, some competition which will be called &ldquo;an uneconomic excess of transport&rdquo; will be cut out and in the end the ordinary trader will be paying more for his transport than he has ever paid. Under certain circumstances that line of action may be advisable, but I should like to know just what safeguards the public are going to get in this connection.</P>
    <P>There is just one further matter to which I should like to refer.  As a member of the Dublin Corporation I am interested in the question of wayleaves. They have been dealt with in this Bill, I think, in a rather unfair fashion.  The Minister said that in <Col N="2034" /> 1966, I think, the trams then running could be taken over by the corporation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not suppose there will be any trams running in 1966 but as regards wayleaves, I would say &mdash;and I think this is the view which is held by the corporation legal experts &mdash;they were payment for a monopoly, not payment for the right to run trams as such.  Now that the buses have come on, we are told that the wayleaves are to go.  The buses, however, are still the vehicles of a monopolistic concern.  It does not much matter whether the vehicles happen to be trams or buses.  More than ever in the past the company which is running the bus services, is now to be in a privileged position.  It was because of that privilege principally that wayleaves were first paid.  However, I see that this matter is to go before an arbitrator.</P>
      <P>There are very many other points in connection with labour and the internal administration of the company upon which I have not touched and I do not propose to refer to them; but I should like to get an assurance from the Minister that his references to an uneconomic excess of transport do not mean that more private hauliers are to be cut out in future and that the poor public, who pay for everything, are in the long run going to be mulcted to pay for this new change.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Davin in his opening remarks took advantage of his position in the House to libel the officials of another Irish union, many of whom would not indeed attach very much importance to his statement. When he uses his position as a member of the House to make these statements and makes use of what somebody told him outside the gate in connection with the official of an Irish union, I think he is only trying to raise a smoke-screen to hide the members of his own union.  I am not going to take advantage of my position here to give my opinion of other unions.  I say that we cannot be too generous to the railway workers.  We owe them a debt of gratitude.  We should not treat them <Col N="2035" /> in the niggardly way indicated in this Bill.  We should be most generous to the men who rendered service to this country when we required it.</P>
      <P>I confine myself to two features of the Bill.  One is the generous manner in which the shareholders are being treated.  They are being awarded three times the market value of their stocks.  I contrast that with the niggardly treatment of the employees. I would ask the Minister to deal specifically with the position of the men who may be redundant, so as to remove many misgivings and doubts in connection with the Bill.  Members from all parts of the House made an appeal on behalf of the redundant employees. Personally I do not believe that the general manager, whoever he may be, would be in a position to reorganise the railway and assure the general public the services they have heretofore received, inside six months.  As other Deputies have mentioned, under this Bill, employees who are dismissed after six months will not be entitled to compensation or gratuity in connection with their redundancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will make it clear that there will not be less generous treatment of the employees under this Bill than was given under the Railway Employees Act, 1935.  Under that Act they were given seven years. This Bill gives them only six months. I believe this is a step towards nationalisation.  It would be a step further if the Minister were to introduce a token vote each year and have some report brought to the House so that we would be in a position to discuss the undertaking and its working for the previous 12 months. Farmers and others would be in a position to criticise the management if there were excessive charges imposed on the farming community or on the general public.  We would have control.  I am opposed to this Bill for the reason that it is giving away rights and giving control to a private company. I am more concerned with the provision of facilities for the public than I am for property.  I should prefer that the Minister and this House should have the right each year <Col N="2036" /> to discuss the management during the previous 12 months.  We have our experience of the sugar factories, the Electricity Supply Board and other undertakings in connection with which, although the Minister may nominally have control, the House is not allowed to discuss the management.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to go over all that has been stated by other Deputies.  I am concerned only with two items, namely, facilities for the general public, including an assurance that there will be no excessive charges, and a guarantee that no member or employee of the railways will suffer any loss as a result of this Bill.  I am sure we can make improvements on the Committee Stage of this Bill.  I should like to point out to the Minister that this Bill would appear to be a class Bill.  There is generous treatment for directors, whoever they may be&mdash;I have no particular person in mind&mdash;and niggardly treatment for the rank and file of the employees concerned. I should like to place on record that, as far as I am concerned, I would do everything possible to make a special appeal to the Minister and the Government to recognise the services that these employees rendered to the country in the days when we required their services.  We can never forget that.  For that reason I would appeal to the Minister to make a public statement that he as Minister and the Government as a whole will not be a party to depriving these men of any rights they enjoyed under the existing law.  I make those two special appeals: (1) that the House should have some control, and (2) that there should be an undertaking that employees who may lose their positions will receive adequate compensation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamFrancisODonne" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>My first recollection of the word &ldquo;transport&rdquo; was in connection with sentences of transportation for life to Van Diemen's Land. At that time I did not understand what &ldquo;transport&rdquo; meant.  The modern forms of transport are railways, buses, aeroplanes.  We farmers would be, in the first place, interested in the roads. We have houses on the sides of the <Col N="2037" /> roads.  Forty years ago, when trams and buses arrived, we suffered greatly on the roads although in some ways we benefited.  The history of the main roads is well known.  In course of time, side roads evolved and they were built by the men on the land.  But, 40 years ago, when motor traffic was introduced, the roads were stolen from the men who built them and it became impossible for a four-footed animal to travel on them and it has been impossible since.  I had several carts on the road and I believe the shafts were broken in many cases three or four times over.  It did not end there.  Very often I went riding and driving and about ten years ago I was driving into my native town with a good young horse and I did not know what happened until I woke up in the local hospital.  It was a shame to take these roads from the men who built them. The men who built the modern roads could hardly be described as artists. They are more fit to be bootblacks than road designers.  On all these roads there should be a range on either side for the foot-footed animal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamFrancisODonne" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Well, in connection with road transport, when the Bill is put into operation, I hope whatever Minister may be in charge will look after the roads and recompense those who live on the land for the stealing of the roads.  That is my point, Sir. That is putting it in short.  I need not labour it any further.  We deserve better than that.  It should never have been allowed to happen.  The capital has appreciated by £2,500,000 since the racket in the shares started.  I am not supposed to say anything about the Railway Tribunal, but I wonder if everybody who went bankrupt in the last 20 years would be treated in the same way as this concern.  Why should they be treated in that way?  I do not suggest that the Government or the Minister has any responsibility, but I was impressed by what Deputy Corry and Deputy Linehan said concerning the appreciation of the shares.  There was also a suggestion that the capital <Col N="2038" /> that has appreciated as a result of the racket should be dealt with in some form.  It is not right that that should be allowed to go on.  I have great sympathy with the position of people living in towns.  I did not live in this city for a quarter of a century without thinking of the well-being of people in towns and cities.  Whatever form the operations of this Bill take, the Minister should take steps to see that attention is paid to the claims of owners of horses and cattle that have to travel along the roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of our experience of transport during the past few years, the great reduction of railway traffic as well as the complete elimination of road traffic, we find that the business of the country is moving along fairly satisfactorily.  The only people who appear to complain of being inconvenienced are those who normally owned motor cars and motor lorries. The ordinary commercial people are fairly well served.  In my opinion fast railway traffic is quite unnecessary and any proposals involving the expenditure of large amounts of money for such services would seem to be unnecessary or wasteful.  With the experience I have acquired of the transport business, my idea is that there should be such a service provided for the agricultural community as would take them to the nearest towns on market days and take them home in the evenings.  Such a service would be of real value to rural areas.  The practice of the railways of transporting people in fast trains from the furthest ends of the country to the cities could be suspended.  I do not think such a form of transport service is of any benefit.  Any proposal to spend large sums of money on the development of speedy transport is at present unnecessary.  When dealing with transport generally I cannot understand why more attention is not paid to inland navigation.  Some of that service is still in a navigable condition, but when travelling one is impressed by the complete absence of traffic on our canals.  I am informed that the Grand Canal is very little used and that sufficient attention has <Col N="2039" /> not been paid to its maintenance.  The people who use the canals tell me that if those in charge of the weirs or the gates were available when boats come along there would be a considerable saving of time and that additional journeys could be worked.  Apparently the men in charge are not paid sufficiently to justify regular attendance and as a result considerable delay occurs.  An effort does not appear to have been made to keep the waterways in a navigable condition, and for some years there has been little dredging done.  The result has been that boats have been damaged and the carrying capacity reduced.  Traffic on the canals should be of considerable value to the community at the present time.  I consider that canal navigation should be dealt with by any Transport Bill that comes before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also believe that any transport legislation should include horsedrawn vehicles.  A considerable amount of transport work from railway stations to surrounding areas could be dealt with by horse transport. I assure the House that the needs of country districts would be well served in that way, especially in the delivery of merchandise from railway stations. I believe that the inclusion of horsedrawn vehicles in transport legislation would be an advantage to various towns and villages.  Turning to the position of owners of private motor lorries, cases have come to my notice where people in the conduct of their business made a fairly comfortable living, but as a result of the restrictions that were recently applied, the railway company was not at all friendly towards them.  In the case of men who were compelled to cease acting as carriers they found that the railways company was not prepared to facilitate them or to engage their lorries. If it is just to include in the Bill, as I believe it is, compensation for those who had invested money in the concern and for directors who may be removed, then it is only justice also to ensure that anybody whose livelihood is interfered with by the new regulations and restrictions will get an equal measure of the same form of <Col N="2040" /> consideration, just as the workers employed in the concern have.  Having spoken from time to time with various railway officials and workers I can say that there is a great deal of discontent prevailing amongst them because they are uncertain what this Bill will hold for them.  They have plenty of spokesmen here in the House who no doubt will put their case and ventilate their grievances but, as an ordinary citizen, I say it is very unfair to leave men who have had long service in the position that they do not know what the future will hold for them.  That is a matter which should be cleared up. The community would not wish that the Bill should interfere with any class.</P>
    <P>Whatever form of transport we have in the future I think railways will be an essential part of the transport service for many years to come.  I consider that in planning regard should be had to the provision of the best facilities and at the same time to the utilisation and development of our own fuel.  That concerns particularly the Arigna area.  Whatever else may have been said a condemnation of the late management is the fact that that area, which is now the chief source of our coal supply, was left with a narrow gauge.  That meant the double-handling of the coal, and being soft coal it deteriorated as a result.  Why a wide gauge was not provided is unaccountable. The same applies to the handling of turf.  Anyone who has watched a lorry load of turf being loaded into a railway wagon and seen it falling into the wagon bit by bit will know the waste that occurs.  In my opinion a raised platform by which the lorry would be higher than the railway wagon could allow the lorry, by opening the side of the crate, to let the turf fall into the wagon.  That would be a great advantage in improving the condition of the turf as well as in saving time.  If the railways were to include in the reorganisation scheme measures by which our native industry and our native fuel would get a fair chance, then a good deal could be said for subsidising the railways.  In any case it has become necessary to deal with transport generally, and I emphasise that the considerations which <Col N="2041" /> I have mentioned, the position of the workers, the convenience of the agricultural community and the utilisation of local fuel supplies, should be borne in mind, and should be the chief factors.  The facilities provided for the country towns are of much greater importance than the facilities for the cities.  Consideration of these matters would be a benefit to the country, and I would be prepared to stand over even an annual expenditure of money for an essential industry if the working of that industry was for the benefit of the country, particularly the country community.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the suggestion which I have heard made here that a better system would be nationalisation. I have had enough experience of Departments here carrying very heavy responsibilities and discharging them efficiently so far as the ordinary official department duty goes.  But that experience is sufficient to satisfy me that it would be fatal to place a business undertaking directly in charge of a group of civil servants.  A civil servant by reason of his position has to make a keen study of the interpretation of every Act of Parliament and he can only interpret to such an extent as his reason will permit.  To do otherwise would be to put him in a very awkward position and even lay him open to the charge of having political leanings.  No business can be done by merely interpreting Acts of Parliament.  If one goes to a railway station one can read long lists of bylaws of the railway company.  If these were to be interpreted every day by the company officials then the condition of the public would be a very pitiable one.  That sort of thing cannot be done in business but civil servants have to interpret every section of the Acts.  There has to be give and take in business and there could be no success in business if the officials had to stop to interpret Acts of Parliament.  Business cannot be worked if the control is in the hands of civil servants.  The only possible way to have success is to have an ordinary business management.  For that reason I am opposed to the proposal for complete nationalisation. <Col N="2042" /> As regards the question of postponing the Bill I do not know whether there is any necessity for rushing it or not. The Minister seems to think there is and other speakers that there is not. Perhaps the Minister is the best judge. Speaking generally the things I have just said are merely thoughts that have occurred to me as an ordinary outsider. I am satisfied that the Bill is necessary and I support it provided an undertaking is given by the Minister that the position of those affected by it will be no worse than the condition of persons who find their service discontinued because they are no longer required; and generally, that the principle of compensation adopted in the case of the shareholders and directors will be made to apply all round including the case of private lorry owners who find their business interfered with and their livelihood taken away.</P>

That means that any contracts already subsisting between the companies remain and are effective. Section 47 would mean that no change in that arrangement may be made without the Minister's sanction, but it appears to me that the company and the Minister between them, without the agreement of the other parties to a pooling or routing agreement, might change whatever agreement there is.</P>

      <P>There are just two other items on which I would like to have some information.  There appears to be a considerable difference of opinion amongst people about them. First of all, can I have the number of lorries owned by private owners hauling their own goods; secondly, the number of licensed hauliers, other than the railway company; and, thirdly, the number of lorries owned by the railway company itself.  I have been given figures which show, roughly, 8,000 to 9,000 lorries privately owned, about 2,500 owned by licensed hauliers, and about 600 owned by the railway company.  These figures relate to pre-war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister looks at the Transport Tribunal's Report, he will find, I think, that these are the figures which emerge from it.  With regard to the paid-up capital of the company which, at the outset, we are told will total almost <Col N="2045" /> £13,500,000, am I right in assuming that not more than £2,000,000 of that represents the tramway company's substituted capital, and that the rest will represent Great Southern?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Transport Tribunal in their report say that the paid-up capital of the Great Southern Railways Company in road vehicles at the date of their report was not more than £1,800,000.  Hereafter, the purchase price may be found to be a matter of importance in dealing with the assets which the Minister declares to be obsolete.  One would have thought that he would have found out how much we are supposed, under this measure, to pay for obsolete assets.  I take it to be at least a sum of £9,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that, in his opening statement, the Minister pleaded that he should get agreement from all Parties with regard to certain things. I think he could have got a greater volume of agreement concerning a discussion on the transport situation in the country if he had supplied the House and, through the House, the public with more information.  We are being asked in an ordinary empowering clause in a piece of legislation, and on the statement of the Minister from which very few facts emerged, to pass over control to an individual, to be appointed hereafter by the Minister, of the allocation of an expenditure of about £20,000,000 capital in transport facilities in this country.  We do not know whether what is projected is a rail scheme or a road scheme. We assume that it is going to be a <Col N="2046" /> mixture of both, but as to whether the rail use or the road use is to predominate in the future, no information has been given.</P>
    <P>In that context, I would like to allude to what members of the House will remember about the electrical development scheme in this country.  I recall the compliment that was paid by the Leader of the Labour Party, the Party which was then the Chief Opposition in this State, in connection with that scheme.  I may say that it was one of the few complimentary remarks passed by that individual on the scheme, but he did say that there was nothing on which so much information had been given to the public as in connection with that matter. There was, first of all, a very detailed report by the German firm which projected the scheme; there was a full report by five European experts, and, finally, the Government's proposals. All three were sent to every member of the Oireachtas and to the Press. The fullest possible technical advice and criticism were obtained on that measure.  The matter was thoroughly discussed in the Dáil, and could be discussed because the information was before the Dáil and the public.  The Press had full knowledge, and agitated the matter considerably.  There is not the slightest doubt that, after that legislation was passed, the people could say they were well informed in respect of that matter.  Certainly, as regards items down to £10,000, every detail of the amount of money which the State was to put up for that scheme was known in the same way that the sub-heads in the Estimates are known in regard to the moneys which are given to the Government for the various services each year.</P>
    <P>After the public had got that information and had voted on it it was possible to say that we could then set up a board in some sort of independence because we knew the exact amount of money that would have to be spent and the purpose to which the money was to be applied almost to within 5 per cent. up or down on a running scale.  The board was set up and was given authority to do certain things.  The chief thing it had to do <Col N="2047" /> was to encourage electrical development in the country, to remunerate the moneys that had been given over to it, to pay interest where any money was outstanding, and not to earn any profits.  The board was simply to fix charges at such a rate as would bring in the money required for the working expenses, to remunerate the State capital by way of a sinking fund arrangement, and the payment of interest while any money was outstanding. The scheme was put before the people in that way.  In that situation it was reasonable to say: &ldquo;Let the day to day management of those who have the great task of getting a return of that money be free from detailed control.&rdquo; It was accepted by the House as a good consideration in those days that, when this big amount of public credit was put behind this new development, the public was given the assurance that year by year there would be an opportunity offered for detailed discussion of the whole matter.  The way that was arranged was this: that the Minister, at the expense of the board, could put in an auditor of his own to investigate the accounts of the board, that the auditor would bring back a report to the Minister who gave him that duty, and that it was the duty of the Minister, thereafter to put such questions to the auditor as would clarify any points that were confused or doubtful.  Then the report, with the auditor's remarks, came before the House and it was agreed that if there was any considerable body of opinion requiring it, a day would be set aside for a discussion on the report.  As a matter of fact, there never has been a discussion.  The reports were very good and very comprehensive and they were referred to here from time to time, but there never was such a crisis in the board's affairs as led to a debate, calling attention to matters of policy or detail, in which the House disagreed with the board.</P>
    <P>What have we here, on the other hand?  As far as the expenditure of the money is concerned, we have not the slightest evidence from the Minister that either he or his officials, or the man who will, we expect, be chairman <Col N="2048" /> of the new company, have a plan before them.  The best the Minister could say was that he felt we could not get on without the permanent way, but he made reservations even there.  I am speaking from reports of colleagues, as I was not able to be here to listen to the Minister.  I understand he made reservations almost immediately, in which he appeared to be still doubtful as between his two earlier moods.  He had two earlier moods&mdash;one was that we could not get on without the railways and the other was that we had got on without them and could do so again.  On which foot he is standing now, we do not know.  Nobody knows whether there is to be road development in the main or rail development in the main.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us that it is necessary to have this Bill now.  He has a date fixed&mdash;the 1st of July&mdash;and is working towards that.  Why?  Deputy Maguire has said that probably the Minister is the best judge of that. Deputy Maguire is asked to be the judge of that, too, yet he has no information from the Minister.  The Minister says that it is necessary to plan ahead against the problems that will arise post-war.  Apparently part of the use to which these substituted capital moneys will be put is to purchase new assets as against the obsolete assets of the Great Southern Railways.  When is he going to purchase them?  Not during the war, possibly not for two years after the war.  Why are we being asked now to vote on this, when we do not know what the future of rail development or road development will be?  The Minister is not certain in his mind regarding any plan or, if he is, I suggest that, even if it is only of a tentative nature and has many reservations, he should give the outline of it to the House.  In the absence of that information, why should we be asked now to vote on an expenditure of £20,000,000?  We are not told how it is to be spent and there seems to be no possibility that any great portion of it will be spent within the next three or four years.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that we might agree upon certain general views.  In regard to one point, there is very little <Col N="2049" /> disagreement, namely, that transport in this country for years back has been very unsatisfactory.  I have met a considerable number of foreigners here from time to time and there was not one of them who, after getting some information about our country and how things are done, did not comment at once on the extremely high charges which the transport services impose upon the public.  I have never heard anything but unflattering comparisons between railway charges here and those elsewhere.  The condition of affairs has been very unsatisfactory&mdash; there is no argument about that.</P>
    <P>Having said that, the Minister was realistic enough to say that few people would accept the Government's hope that transport under this particular scheme would be remunerative.  In addition to being remunerative, that is to say, that it would repay whatever capital had to be remunerated, the Minister said he hoped we would get extensive, efficient and cheap transport. Undoubtedly, those are very big aims.  How are they to be achieved? The Minister simply says that the Government believe it can be done. The Government cannot believe that, unless they have had something on which they rest their belief.  Will we not be given some hint as to the circumstances which they feel are likely to operate in the future, different from those which operated in the past?  The Minister says his aim is that transport shall not be subsidised.  He has said, in a very sweeping phrase, that subsidised transport means costly transport and, eventually, inefficient transport.  Therefore, it is not to be subsidised.</P>
    <P>Now, without subsidy, transport is to be remunerative.  The Minister described that by saying that, by the sale of transport facilities, enough income would be earned to remunerate capital, provide for wasting assets and pay the employees.  According to the Minister, in this mood of faith, economies are not going to be effected at the expense of the staff.  He says he believes there will be no redundancy and he also holds out against subsidised transport.  He does not believe that the State will be called upon <Col N="2050" /> to pay the guarantees on these debenture shares, but it is noticeable that he provides against that emergency and says it would be impossible to get new capital except on the basis of the Government giving a guarantee.  I take it the Minister has no scheme which he could unfold to the public, which would inspire such confidence that they would invest their money, in the hope of getting a return from the new management, in the new circumstances. Therefore, the Minister provides a subsidy, although he hopes the guarantee will not have to be called upon.  In the same way, the Bill not merely provides, but protects effectively, against any possibility of expense falling upon the company in connection with economies in staff.</P>
    <P>Although he expresses the hope and the belief that no redundancy will take place, he has a clause enshrined in the Bill that, if any redundancy occurs after six months from the establishment date, there is to be no payment by way of compensation to those who lose their posts.  That is, I suggest, providing against redundancy and providing for redundancy without expenditure on the part of the company.  I wonder what the Minister's hopes are based on in this connection.</P>
    <P>We come, then, to a discussion as to the best method of handling the future of transport&mdash;whether it be nationalisation, or something short of it like this, or private ownership.  I would welcome any scheme in connection with a public service like transport the nearer it goes to public utility operation, or socialisation or nationalisation. I think the world is moving away from the time when it was completely under the dominance of the private profit motive.  We are getting further and further away from that. The more schemes of this kind there are, the larger the field is likely to be widened for future schemes of the sort.  To a certain degree, I welcome this, because the Minister has approached it on the lines of going as near as possible to nationalisation, not going further and adopting full nationalisation as it would only mean difficulties and not advantages.</P>
    <P>I was reminded very forcibly of the <Col N="2051" /> new development of the situation when, recently, after the proposals had been published, the chairman of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce indicated that he hoped there would come from the present proposals better services, in the sense of more extensive services, cheaper rates and a more simple classification.  The Minister is not bold enough to say whether we will get that or not.  The man who said that might not have been aware of his own position.  He is running a particularly big concern, where there is really no public advantage given by having a private operator at all.  That man might have been sawing very quickly through the bough on which he himself was standing, but, even so, he welcomed this Bill.  That is an indication of the public mind in the matter of transport: the nearer we get to full socialisation or nationalisation the better for the people.</P>
    <P>I do not like to have a scheme like this put up, unless there is some chance of success about it.  Inevitably, it is so precariously balanced between nationalisation and something short of it, that people say it is a near approach to nationalisation.  There will be people who will again vigorously demand that all this type of service should be handed back to private profit, and who will say that if there were private profit and some stimulus of gain, then the newly-fashioned transport monopoly might be successful.  What makes for success or failure?  The Minister admits that since 1924 the Great Southern Railways Company never found it possible to earn its dividends.  The situation is even worse than that, and I am sure the Minister knows it, too.  The situation with regard to the Great Southern Railways is that the company, while having losses, paid dividends out of losses, if I may put it that way.  The way they did it was by paying out money which should have gone to the replacement of wasting assets.  Because they did not replace wasting assets, they have got to the position that their assets are nearly obsolete.  At the end of the last war, after the British Government had <Col N="2052" /> handed back the railways to the proprietors, the Government of that day did hand over certain sums.  They were supposed to be for the arrears of maintenance and renewals which had been allowed to go into neglect during the period of the war.  The proprietors distributed those funds; they held them as a fund out of which to distribute dividends in the years in which they were not earning dividends.</P>
    <P>The citizen who wrote the Minority Report in connection with the Transport Tribunal, in a table on page 148, column 4, sets out the position as he sees it.  It is a position which must appeal to anybody, and must commend itself as a reality to anybody who knows what provision had to be made for wasting assets.  He gives the adjusted net income arising out of the company's accounts and he sets out the deficit on maintenance and renewals.  He draws the conclusion, in paragraph 61, that the amounts year by year fell short of the sums necessary to pay debenture interest and other fixed charges.  Over a period of eight years, according to the table set out there, the Great Southern Railways did not earn sufficient money even to pay the debenture charges.  Of course, there were serious deficits, if one took the payments to be made on the guaranteed preference stock, the ordinary preference stock and the 4 per cent. ordinary stock.</P>
    <P>The Minister said yesterday that the capital of the Great Southern Railways, as established under the 1924 Act, was considerably less than the combined capital of the companies which were then amalgamated.  In that he was right, and that is something in the neighbourhood of £26,000,000.  In 1932-33 the Minister carved down these stocks considerably, slashed the ordinary dividends to one-tenth of the original value, cut down entire holdings by more than half, and arrived at £12,500,000.  We start off with railway capital higher than £26,000,000.  We come to £26,000,000 and they cannot earn dividends on the debentures.  You cut it still further to £12,500,000, and even then they cannot earn the debenture interest.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2053" /> What do we propose to do to ease that situation?  We propose to allow a substitution for what the Minister calls dead capital.  If the Minister says the assets of the Great Southern Railways are virtually obsolete, and they have to be renewed, then the new company is in a serious position, because we are going to pay almost £13,500,000 in substitution of the stocks of the Great Southern Railways and the Dublin United Transport Company. The Transport Company's stock is stock on which debenture interest has always been paid and on which, except for a few years, ordinary returns were paid.  Take out that £2,000,000 as representing good assets and take out £2,000,000 of the Great Southern Railways assets as representing road vehicles fairly recently purchased and in somewhat good condition.  We are going to buy £4,000,000 worth of usable assets and pay £13,500,000 in substitution of the stocks of the Great Southern Railways.</P>
    <P>The new company that is going to replace the Great Southern Railways, which could not earn debenture interest on the cut-down capital of, roughly, £12,000,000, will pay £9,000,000 for assets that are not there, and it is expected to remunerate not merely the new capital, but the £9,000,000 representing dead assets.  What chance has it of doing that?  If it does not do it, a subsidy will have to be paid by the Government and, further, if it does not do it, does not the Minister know that the next step will be redundancies in connection with the staff? If this particular situation does not develop inside six months, then any redundancy means that the man who walks out cannot go before an arbitrator to attempt to prove the difficult matters he has to prove under this Bill.  That is the reality of the situation.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister seriously meant that the assets of the Great Southern Railways were really so bad.  But there are signs that they are bad.  The Minister spoke of one thing being a mistake under the 1924 Act, the singling of the Dublin-Galway line.  I assume the Minister knows why it was done.  I think I know why it was done.  Does the Minister <Col N="2054" /> see any reason why it should not be made public&mdash;or any other matter which reveal the serious situation to which the line had got?  The Transport Tribunal Report says that for a long time the railway company had got only a modified certificate regarding the safety of the permanent way.  The Minister knows why the singling of the Galway line was carried out.  The reason was that the Great Southern Railways Company was warned by the engineers that the main line between here and Cork was in such a seriously deteriorated condition that the passenger trains could only be run over them at a very much reduced rate of speed, and the plea made in those days was that, unless they were able to lift good line along the double track to Galway, and put that into the main line between here and Cork, there might be fatalities.</P>
    <P>That was a great sign of the times&mdash; an indication that their assets were depreciating.  And, actually, all the time the shareholders were getting dividends out of money that should have gone to the replacement of the wasting assets.  The assets were getting into such a shockingly bad condition that they were forced to single the Galway line and use the portions of line they lifted to patch up the permanent way between here and Cork. There is a good background of fact to the Minister's statement that the Great Southern Railways assets are not worth very much.  We are asked to devote £9,000,000 to the purchase of them and we are asked to believe that the new company will earn enough money to remunerate the new capital put into the replacement of these hopeless assets and also to pay some return on the £9,000,000 not represented by any really usable asset.  One may say that a miracle could happen.</P>
    <P>One of the matters referred to as indicating the extremely bad cash condition of the railway company is the significant phrase in the report of the tribunal, which discovered that in 1938 the cash position of the Great Southern Railways was so bad that it had abandoned its previous practice of carrying five weeks' stocks of coal and decided to carry only one week's stock of coal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2055" /> That is the present position.  They were allowed to drift into the war with only one week's stock of coal, although the Government had that report before the war broke out.  They have been carrying that limited stock of coal since 1938.  There might be some glimmer of hope or optimism if the Minister said: &ldquo;We are putting all that behind us.  There is a new situation developing and we have reason to believe&mdash;and here are the reasons&mdash; why the new company, overloaded with a burden of dead capital, will give remunerative transport, cheap transport, thoroughly efficient transport and no economies at the expense of the staff.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Tribunal Report of 1939 goes into a variety of detail as to why transport had arrived at the position in which it was found then.  There is no necessity to go into the whole of it.  Certain things, however, emerge from the report.  They say, first of all &mdash;and let us bid good-bye to that&mdash;that one of the matters seriously bringing about a decline in the railway situation was, of course, the economic war. They give details of the traffic, particularly the live-stock traffic carried at the time when that unfortunate matter was on and they show the tremendous losses which must have accrued to the railway companies, because they say that the position was serious not because the same number of animals was not carried, but because the company did not recover the loss of revenue in the three or four vital years in which the impact of road competition was being most seriously felt; that at the time when the Great Southern Railways had money to play with the directors might have gone in for some better form of road transport to meet the competition; but it was the falling off in traffics because of that matter which was more serious for them.</P>
    <P>However, the report of the tribunal does pick out a couple of things.  One of the things is the impact of road competition.  Having examined that thoroughly, it is pointed out that the impact of road competition is mainly felt on the passenger side.  I do not know whether it has been very specifically <Col N="2056" /> stated to the public, but it has been stated as between the railway company and the Minister's office, it has been stated frequently in cases, some of which I have attended; it has not been made exactly public by promulgation to the Press, but I think it is fairly well known that in this country railway transport is in the peculiar position that on the railways here, unlike elsewhere, passengers in the main subsidise goods, and as I understand, high-class goods practically subsidise the lower grades. Therefore you have a position in which if the passenger services of the railway company do not go well, there is bound to be a decline in their fortunes.</P>
    <P>The report points out that there was a great decline in the receipts from passenger services and the greatest part of that arose from the fact that private cars came on to the road.  They are to be left on the road.  Not merely is the private car to be left on the road, but the indications are that, with the development in motor car engines, the new way in which bodies are being built, and the impetus which is being given to motor engine production during the war, motor transport is hereafter going to be very much cheaper than it ever was before and that it will put on the road the man who could not afford a motor car before.  If that is the situation, the new company will have to face all the competition the old company had from the private motor car and will probably have increased competition. The tribunal report states that it was the decline in the passenger receipts that brought about the big decline in railway income.  That will continue.  I think it will increase, but, in any event, it is there.</P>
    <P>The other thing which the Transport Tribunal found was that the efforts made by the Great Southern Railways, through passenger services, to meet competition in the old days of the independent bus operators resulted in a loss to the company on the road passenger side.  I understand that that loss was continuing up to the war.  So that, if the efforts the Great Southern Railways made to meet competition <Col N="2057" /> in respect of passenger carriage on the roads had not been a success, there is no likelihood that there will be any better situation in the future.</P>
    <P>What about goods?  The Transport Tribunal discussed that.  They stated that the railway company's chief plaint was that the unrestricted use of motor lorries had brought about a very definite decline.  That is examined very thoroughly by Dr. Kennedy, who points out that the decline in the road receipts is very much smaller than the decline in passenger receipts.  He gives details as to the number of lorries on the road.  Whatever the situation was, the Minister is going to let that continue.  The man and the company who are hauling their own stuff are to be allowed freely to operate on their own.  They have something in the neighbourhood of 8,000 or 9,000 vehicles on the road and I do not think they will be lessened, because it seems to me that, with what is promised in respect of cheap motor transport, these traders will drift again into running their own vehicles instead of depending on the transport company's vehicles.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, we have the licensed hauliers.  The Minister does not propose to deal with these; they are to be left on the road still. According to the figures&mdash;they are only very rough ones&mdash;there are between 8,000 and 9,000 privately-owned lorries.  There are something in the nature of 2,000 licensed hauliers, and the number of the company's fleet is 600.  In the report it is recognised that the company, with its rigidity of movement, peculiarity with regard to charges, and the fact that its servants are more out of touch than the private hauliers, can never compete with the privately-owned vehicles.  I appeared before that Transport Tribunal representing licensed hauliers, and very early in the proceedings the chairman, noticing that I had a large number of witnesses, asked me whether those witnesses were there to give evidence as to (a) their charges; (b) that they could give services of a more flexible or adaptable kind than the railways. When I said that they were there for both purpose, he said that I could <Col N="2058" /> dispense with any who were there merely to prove that these private people could give better services than the railways, because the railways did not contest that.  My dozen or so witnesses, who were there to demonstrate that point, were put out of the room.  The railways gave in on that point.  The tribunal report also says that it is clear that for flexibility and adaptability of use the local operator can beat the railway company hollow every time.</P>
    <P>What then is the situation?  The old Great Southern Railway did not pay its way.  It shelled out dividends while failing to meet even fixed charges.  The new company is to have heavier charges.  The old Great Southern Railway found itself unable to meet the charges, particularly because the passenger receipts were on a terrific decline and the road receipts were on a somewhat smaller decline.  The Minister is not proposing to change the situation with regard to the private cars operating against the company, and it was the private car, not the bus, that was the main cause of the decline in passenger receipts.  If the Minister does not propose to interfere with the running of the licensed haulier or the private trader or private company carrying their own goods, where is the revenue to be got?  Where is the Minister's belief in this?  I searched through the newspapers this morning and I asked my colleagues what the Minister said last night.  I understand he said at one time that, while other people said that what had occurred in connection with the company was due to incompetent management, he or the Government did not accept that point of view.</P>

      <P>I could not understand that quotation, because the Minister went on to say that the company had not risen to their responsibility, which seems to me to argue that there was incompetence.  There is a phrase quoted in the <i>Independent</i> to-day which says that the Government did not accept the point of view that <Col N="2059" /> it was incompetent management which brought the situation about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Distinctly that was stated afterwards.  The Minister has these additions to it, according to the <i>Independent:</i>&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It may be contended that the unsatisfactory situation was due to incompetent management of the Great Southern Railways and that, given better management, the situation could be remedied without new legislation or Government interference. The Government was unable to accept that point of view.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government do not refuse to accept the point of view that it was incompetence in the management which helped to bring that situation about. I should imagine that the Minister cannot deny that, because he goes on to say that the company had failed to rise to its opportunities.  Incompetency in management has, therefore, something to do with it.  Is that to be replaced by anything very much better?  We do not know.  We do know that the Minister recently promoted to the head of the Great Southern Railways service an individual who was undoubtedly a tremendous success in running, as an independent operator, a passenger bus service and we know that later the same individual went on to still more definite success in running the passenger services of the Dublin Transport Company.  The Minister has not indicated that anybody who has any experience of any notable type is going to deal with road matters and the Minister does not appear to have in <Col N="2060" /> mind any new person experienced in railway matters.</P>
    <P>The Minister does say, in a later part of his speech, that, by the amalgamation which he represents this to be, the new company will get the best of the technical and administrative ability as between the two companies, so that we must take it that there is good technical and administrative capacity as between the two companies. But look at what happened. We are to build on the foundations which have already crumbled under the Great Southern Railways.  The only change which is to be made&mdash;and this demands a terrific act of faith&mdash; is that the board of directors at Kingsbridge are to be substituted by one man.  How will that man operate?  I think the prospects of this new company are bad, as the Minister has described them.  I cannot believe that, in a small island like this, transport cannot be run economically and effectively, but that has not been done in 22 years, and the circumstances which rendered it ineffective and dear are still to be allowed to operate, in the main, in future.</P>
    <P>The Minister apparently reposes all his faith in one man.  How will that man operate?  The Minister says that he dislikes nationalisation because he thinks nationalisation will mean political pressure, the putting on of pressure by people who want fares, rates changed for different localities, who want extra services for new areas or who may interfere in the matter of appointments and so on, and that the Minister, if this were a nationalised service, would be answerable for the day to day administration.  There are, in some part of his statement, words to the effect that he is going to set up this board, of which the chairman will be a director, but on which there will be other directors who, subject to certain conditions, will be as free as the directors of any-ordinary company to bring their minds to bear on the problems and to aid in the solution of these problems.  That is only farcical when one looks at the Bill. The chairman may be a quorum by himself, and, if nobody else goes to a meeting, he can carry on by himself.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2061" /> No meeting can pass a resolution in the chairman's absence and, if the new board by unanimous voice, with the exception of the chairman's, take a particular decision and the chairman vetoes it, the chairman's veto carries.</P>
    <P>We can imagine what incentive to keenness in regard to management, what incentive to any sort of industry, any surveying of problems or any indulgence in research to find the answers to these problems, there will be in a board which knows that the chairman can meet in a room by himself and decide everything, and which knows that, even if they scrambled into the room and overpowered the chairman by united vote, he can still carry his resolution.  In addition, the Minister said that the chairman, being appointed by the Government, would be in the position that he would be under the control of the Government &mdash;I am not pretending to quote&mdash;that he would have to carry out Government policy, but would act in full accord with the wishes of the Government. Later, the Minister said that the company would be given such a position as was compatible with the maintenance of Government control of policy, of services, of charges and of discrimination. The Government, through the chairman, is to have control of policy, charges, and services, whether the services are adequate or inadequate, and they will interfere when they think there is any discrimination as against individuals, or possibly to impose discrimination as against individuals.</P>
    <P>The whole thing is to be built on the new chairman whom the Minister represents as a free agent.  The Minister dislikes nationalisation because political pressure might be brought in the Dáil in regard to services, charges and other things, but the Minister says that Government policy is to run through the managing director or chairman down to this company and that the chairman must be subservient to the Government in respect of policy, charges and services.  I do not know what is the difference between that and nationalisation, but that is a later point.  If, however, that is to be the attitude of the Minister towards this man, it means that the Minister does <Col N="2062" /> not really trust this man.  I cannot imagine the gentleman, of whom we all speak without mentioning his name, solemnly putting up to the Minister a proposal involving £20,000,000 of capital without at least knowing in big outline what it was to be spent on.</P>
    <P>If the Minister told us, &ldquo;So much is for railway development of a particular type or the replacement of wasted railway assets and so much for better road service development,&rdquo; we would at least have some information.  If the Minister had done that&mdash;and the more thoroughly detailed it was, the better it would be appreciated by the public and the more public opinion would be got solidly behind it&mdash;he could have thrown the whole thing at arm's length from the Government and the Dáil, and said: &ldquo;Run along for five years and we will then get an account of your stewardship.&rdquo; But the Minister has not done that.  I believe the Minister has no plan; he certainly has revealed none.  I do not know whether this chairman of his has a plan or not.  It may be that, because of the difficulties of the situation, they have varying plans, but, in any event, they all found upon this, that we want £20,000,000&mdash; £13,500,000 to substitute present capital, mainly of a dead type, and £6,500,000 for other purposes.  What is the sum of £6,500,000 for?  If the Minister would tell us and if we could see any hope of its giving us a better transport service, the Minister might be entitled to get leave to appoint his nominee and give him these controls free from his own supervision.  The Minister is going to have supervision; there is to be supervision over these matters.  That brings us to the crux of the whole situation.  In the difficult situation which is pending, I think there is no reason for any hurry as this money cannot be expended.</P>
    <P>I should have mentioned one other matter in connection with this expenditure. The capital of the old Great Southern Company was something in the neighbourhood of £25,000,000 or £26,000,000.  That was the reduction from the capital of the absorbed companies. In other words, assets at some time or another had been purchased involving the expenditure of at <Col N="2063" /> least £26,000,000.  The Minister eventually wrote off more than half of that, but, in 1933, even after he had pruned off the wasted assets of the company, £11,000,000 odd was supposed to represent the value of the assets then remaining which were of some use. After we have substituted £13,500,000, the new operator will have £6,500,000 to play with.  For what?</P>
    <P>According to the Minister, he is to replace the wasted assets of the Great Southern Company, which at one time were supposed to represent a value of £27,000,000, and, at another time, even after he had pruned them down, £11,000,000.  Is the chairman of the new company going to buy for £6,000,000 sufficient to replace these assets which at one time were supposed to be worth £27,000,000, and, at another time, £11,500,000, particularly when everybody knows that prices are on the upgrade?  I have heard of nobody yet of any standing in the economic or financial world who believes that prices after the war will settle at anything less than 33? or 25 per cent. above pre-war prices.  We ask the new chairman to undertake the task of husbanding his money so carefully that, by spending £6,000,000, he will replace what at one time was supposed to cost £27,000,000.  That, however, is incidental.</P>
    <P>Coming back to the point of what is the best solution of this problem, I do not think that any best solution can be arrived at at the moment.  The Transport Tribunal in their report urged a wait and see policy, or a wait and observe policy, for five years.  They apparently thought that a great deal could be said in criticism of the management, even apart from the confusion and upsetting of calculations due to the war.  If the object of this Bill is to impose better conditions of management, then let it be done in the full light of day.  If £1,500,000 or £1,250,000 is what is thought to be necessary in order to secure better management of the company, then provide the company with that sum and let them carry on with it for four or five years, until it can be determined how they are carrying on, and then <Col N="2064" /> have a general agreement as to policy. We are now asked, however, in spite of the fact that, due to the war, all calculations and all values have been upset, solemnly to come to the conclusion that we ought to give to a man who, I say, with all respect to his ability in the transport of passengers by road, has yet been untested in respect of railway matters.  We are evidently to expect that that man will be able to carry out, in the name of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, what I can only describe as a miracle, in view of present conditions.</P>
    <P>I suggest that, since the Minister has gone so far, he should take another step forward.  The Minister has described this plan as a peculiar plan&mdash;what he calls a chairman, to be appointed by the Government, who will be assisted by a group of stockholders who, we are led to presume, will be as keen as mustard in the carrying out of the business of the company.  The Minister evidently thinks, according to his statement, that this plan will be a model for future companies or organisations of that or a similar nature.  I must say that I see no virtue in the plan.  Ordinarily, I would react against nationalisation of such services, but, in view of the proposals that are now presented to us in this Bill, it seems to me that nationalisation would be preferable to the present proposals because, under nationalisation, and particularly in view of the present confused position, this Dáil, at least, would be able to look in on the operations of the proposed company, and the Dáil, through the Minister, would have the company under its control.</P>
    <P>It would appear to me that the Minister is aiming, in regard to this company, at the position which he has brought about in connection with other companies, whereby the chairman of the company is going to be protected if any difficulties should arise.  In other words, if any difficulties arise, the chairman can resort to the plea of Ministerial control, and the Minister also will be protected against any criticisms or imputations in the Dáil by saying that it is not his business, <Col N="2065" /> the business of the Government, or the business of the ordinary Deputies here to interfere with the operations of the company.  We are asked, however, to put the taxpayers' money into this enterprise, the success of which in the past, as I say, has not been proved and for which the possibility of success in the future has not even been outlined to the Dáil.  It would appear that most of the conditions or difficulties that existed hitherto are to be allowed to continue in the future.  Yet, now, we are being asked to trust to the ability of this gentleman to get us through difficulties that would, undoubtedly, sap the courage of any ordinary person who had to face such a task, having regard to the difficulties that have been presented by the war situation and which are bound to continue for years after the war has ended.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the Bill ought to be proceeded with at this time.  I do not think that there is any necessity for us to vote this money until we know on what it is going to be expended.  I think that, at the moment, we cannot say what sum of money should be laid out on this matter: that we cannot say what sum of money will be required for it, even years after the war has ended; and, therefore, I see no reason why we should now say whether the money that is proposed to be expended is either not sufficient or too much.  I do not wish to refer again to the sittings of the tribunal, but I do say that everybody must be aware, apart from the hearings that are going on before the tribunal, that there is undoubtedly a peculiar situation existing with regard to stocks.  Nobody knows what the real value of these stocks is, as represented by the assets they were once supposed to represent, and until we can get some clear indication as to the value of these stocks, apart from inflations or any other factors arising from the emergency position, I hold that the Dáil should hesitate to vote this money.</P>
    <P>In that connection, as I said before, I hope to persuade this Dáil and, through the Dáil, to persuade the people of this country to support an amendment which I propose to put <Col N="2066" /> down in order to test this matter of the purchase of these railway stocks.  I am referring to people who bought stocks&mdash;assuming that they were innocent&mdash;in this company before a certain date, not knowing whether the company could pay its way or not.  Presumably, these people had faith in the railway company and, therefore, let us put them in the position where they will still be able to rely on their belief in the company, but I think that when we come to the question of substituting stock in this company by new capital, we should deal only with those stockholders whose names were on the list of stockholders on the 1st January, 1943, and give no guarantee to people who bought stock from the old proprietors as between 1st January, 1943, and the present date.  I think that we ought to confine the guarantee to people who held stock on the 1st January, 1943, and refuse any such guarantee to the people who, presumably, muscled in on the genuine holders of railway stocks prior to the 1st January, 1943.</P>
    <P>With regard to this matter of a time limit, I cannot understand the Minister's attitude.  He tells us, in effect, that no redundancy is going to take place amongst the ordinary servants of the railway company.  If that is so, then I suggest that there is no reason why he should put in all the old things about reorganisation and a time limit in a case of redundancy.  If he really believes that there will be no redundancy, then why not leave out this matter altogether?  Why does he tie it up with this six months' period which is mentioned in the Bill, since it is quite clear that the new development cannot take place within that period? I should like to point out to the Minister, as he might find himself in the same position later on, that I remember a time when I introduced a Bill here, which there was a large amount of criticism and almost hostility in the House&mdash;the Railways (Existing Officers and Servants) Act, 1926. It would appear to me now that the Minister has copied the provisions of that Act in regard to this matter of a time limit of six months, so far as redundancy is concerned.  At any rate, <Col N="2067" /> it would appear that it was on the provisions of that Act that he framed the clauses in the present measure.  As a result of the passing of this Bill, if the employees concerned do not fulfil this condition with regard to the six months' period, they will be left without a penny of compensation.</P>
    <P>Now, in that connection, I should like to say that the Minister may, some day, have the same experience as I once had myself.  I remember that Act of 1926 very well, since I sponsored it in this House and had a good deal to do with it, and so far as draftsmanship or human ability and endeavour inside the office were concerned, we were assured that men would find it quite easy to prove their case in regard to the matter of compensation and that, if there was redundancy and it could be proved, they would get compensation.  I was not half a year practising at the Bar, however, when one poor man came to me with a clear case showing that he came under the redundancy clause in that Act, and I took up his case.  The case lasted for a considerable time; it eventually went before the railway arbitrator, but in the end&mdash;and in this case the period was seven years, instead of the six months in the present Bill&mdash;it was decided that, although the man was, in justice, entitled to compensation, it could not be given to him because of that clause in the Act of 1926.  That poor man was trying to get help.  He was being brought from pillar to post.  He had a wife and family, and the only talent that he had was the experience of his hands in the work in which he had been engaged, but yet, through the operation of my own Act, that man's case, although in justice he was entitled to compensation, was thrown out.</P>
    <P>The period there was seven years, instead of the six months that is proposed here, and yet it closed him out from compensation, and that certainly did impose on me the feeling that I would always have the obligation afterwards of not standing for economies in the making of rules at the expense of workers who could not possibly change over from one occupation to another in a short period of <Col N="2068" /> time.  Again, I must point out that the time limit was seven years in that case instead of the six months now proposed.  Naturally, even if there were a job for that man, he would not be fitted to change from one occupation to another in the time.  I suggest that if the Minister would regard this thing from a purely human point of view, he would say that since there is no likelihood of redundancy, then let us take out this time limit altogether.  If it should be proved at any time that there is redundancy, then the onus is on the man concerned to show that he is entitled to compensation.</P>
    <P>I know quite well that, in his own Department, the Minister will be able to find people who can advise him on this matter, and I would ask him to seek their advice, or the advice of other people outside his Department, because I am telling him and the House the heart-breaking experience I had in the case of the man I have referred to, who could not be compensated because of the Third Schedule contained in the Railways Act of 1926&mdash;an Act introduced by myself.  Under the present Bill, a person can claim for compensation if he is dismissed within six months from the date of the operation of the Bill when it becomes an Act.  In the 1926 Act, the period allowed was seven years, and yet that injustice occurred.  That Schedule, in effect, said that every existing officer or servant who relinquished his office or situation within seven years after the passing of the Principal Act and every existing officer or servant whose office or situation was abolished within seven years on account of his office or situation having become unnecessary in consequence of changes of administration due directly to the amalgamation and absorption of the companies, and so on, would be entitled to be paid compensation by the amalgamated company, subject to certain rules.  I have already pointed out what the result of that was in the particular case to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>As far as this Bill is concerned, I oppose it as it stands, because I do not see that there is any hope for the transport position so far as the <Col N="2069" /> provisions of this Bill are concerned. I am not in favour of nationalisation of transport services, but I should certainly much prefer nationalisation to the proposals contained in the Bill. I would sooner see, as I have said before, a certain amount of money being provided for, say, five years, for the carrying out of an experimental scheme which would embody the railways and road transport companies as well as the licensed hauliers, etc., in order to see what might be done by their combined efforts, and then, if that did not succeed, we could proceed with the consideration of another scheme or, if it did succeed, we could then examine the position.  Otherwise, although, as I have said, I am not, in principle, in favour of nationalisation, I would much prefer it to the proposals contained in the Bill.  Although nationalisation is not the ideal solution of the problem, still I think it would be far better than the proposals put forward here.</P>

      <P>One always comes away from debates on the Forestry Department with one impression&mdash;that everybody is in favour of increasing the amount of land under timber and the amount of timber grown.  That is about as far as we get. There is unanimity on this subject.  It is interesting to compare the situation in this country with the situation in other countries.  But we do not always make the proper comparisons.  Yesterday, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia were mentioned by way of comparison. These are countries in which <Col N="2070" /> there were originally vast amounts of native timber.  It had been growing there for centuries.  A better comparison would be furnished by Holland and Denmark which often serve as comparisons in other matters.  I have taken from the Planning Exhibition around the corner the figures for these countries.  They may not be strictly accurate but I assume that they are approximately correct.  They disclose an extraordinary state of affairs so far as this country is concerned.  We all know, generally, what the physical and geographical characteristics of these countries are.  These countries are flat countries, more or less surrounded by the sea.  In Denmark, 9 per cent. of the soil is under timber, according to the figures which I obtained.  In Holland, 6 per cent. is under timber and, in our own case, less than 1 per cent.  I think that the exact percentage mentioned in our case by some Deputy was .3.  That figure was, probably, taken from the statistical reports.  That shows that our position is completely unsatisfactory and I think that we are all agreed that we must rectify matters as best we can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question is: Who will grow the timber and look after it?  The Minister and his Department are the only people who can do that unless individuals to whom I shall presently refer are brought in.  The private grower grows timber because he likes it and he has not any great inducement to grow it for the purpose of profit.  When the Minister was introducing this Estimate, he said&mdash;I have not got his exact words&mdash;that, in order to be a paying proposition, State forests should be of sufficient extent to keep the cost of fencing, cultivation and supervision within economic limits.  He went on to say that they would have to be of not less than certain dimensions.  That is the position as regards the State, which goes on from generation to generation and which does not have to reap a profit within the lifetime of an individual.  There is another advantage which, I think, the State has over the private individual in this connection. I do not know that the State contributes any sum corresponding with that which the private individual <Col N="2071" /> has to pay annually by way of income-tax on the land on which the timber is grown.  I think that the State is exempt from the payment of income-tax. So that, in addition to the difficulties which the private individual has to contend with and which are common both to himself and the State, there is this burden of an annual tax upon the land.</P>
    <P>The Minister will readily appreciate that no scheme is really worth while, from the point of view of the private individual, unless it covers a considerable extent of soil.  That being so, if we are to conserve the timber resources of the country, it must be done on a national scale and we must not look to private individuals to provide any substantial quantities of native timber.  Undoubtedly, a number of private individuals will go in for the planting of timber.  Those will be divisible into two categories. In the first category will be those who start out to lay down new plantations and, in the second category, will be those who are bound under the law to replace old plantations which they have cut down.  The Minister has referred to inducements.  One inducement is an increase of the grant from £4 to £10 per acre.  Notwithstanding the inducements, I do not think that we shall get under present circumstances the result which we all wish to see brought about.  The question will come to this&mdash;that the State will have to carry the entire burden of conserving the timber supply of the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that there was a new Bill on the stocks.  It would be of great interest to those concerned with afforestation if we could have a general outline of what is likely to be envisaged in connection with that Bill.  Timber is a matter for long-time planning and we should like to know whether anything likely to affect the running of timber plantations is contemplated.  I have here a very interesting little book on forestry which I turned up in the Library since this Estimate came before the House. It is one of the few books we have in <Col N="2072" /> the Library on this subject.  It is by Mr. E. P. Stebbing, and it is entitled: <i>The Forestry Question in Great Britain.</i> It is a work I would recommend to all those interested in the possibility of forestry development.  Page 47 gives an account of the development of the district of Landes, on the western coast of France, 100 years ago.  I quote it because it illustrates the possibilities of forestry development in this country from the paying point of view.  In this particular district in France, considerable economic benefit resulted to the community concerned by that development of forestry.  With the permission of the House, I shall quote the paragraph of the book I refer to.  It is a very well written book, and the paragraph is so clear and devoid of technicalities that everyone can understand it.  Speaking of the development of forestry in England, it says, at page 47:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The above contention can be easily substantiated by a trip across the Channel and a study of any forest centre in France.  The well-known case of the Landes on the western coast on the shores of the Bay of Biscay may be instanced. Something over a century ago this ribbon of country edging the sea consisted of shifting sand, sand dunes and malarious marshes, the sand being constantly being blown inland thereby covering up valuable agricultural lands and vineyards.  The population was sparse, lived under the most miserable conditions and was racked by fevers.  Chiefly with the object of arresting the march of the sand, the French Government commenced a forest in this region which now presents to view a great belt of forest of the maritime pine. The work, commenced at first as a purely protective one, has turned out an extraordinary financial success. A large and healthy population (for the marshes have been drained and fever has disappeared) is now entirely immersed in great industries; timber, resin (the pines are tapped) and paper pulp (the last the latest), the direct outcome of the afforestation schemes and most lucrative ones.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2073" /> This I think is the most important part:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For years ships have brought pit props from here to the Welsh mines and carried back therefrom, coal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That refers, of course, to the war of 1914.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Since the war we have been paying France well over £1,000,000 sterling, per annum, for the pit wood sent us from these regions...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That alone indicates the financial benefit of forestry to a country.  A study of that passage shows what can be done and illustrates the possibilities before us in this country too. Of course, one of the obstacles in our path is that we have not the facilities at the present time because of wartime conditions.  But, certainly, there is a great future for forestry in this country and I trust that the Minister and his Department will see that the opportunity for development is availed of by the State and that something less will be expected from private individuals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words in connection with this matter.  I agree with those who have indicated their dissatisfaction with the slow progress made by this particular Department.  Before 1920 and 1921, when we were endeavouring to attain our freedom, one of the things held out to us was the extension of afforestation in this country.  I want to suggest now that, considering the length of time we have been in a position to develop our own resources, comparatively little has been done.  People in this country are not taking a sufficient interest in forestry.  I would suggest to the Minister for Lands that, at an appropriate time in each year, his Department should get into touch with different local bodies all over the country.  I believe that in that way a great deal of work could be done. Little or no interest is being taken by a great number of people who should take an interest in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde has referred to the production of pit props.  I remember <Col N="2074" /> that during the last war a large number of pit props was sent over to Wales.  In Wexford Town, a number of men were employed week after week, not only in cutting these pit props, but in loading them into steamers and schooners which brought them across the channel.  I suppose that it is because of the fact that these are not available nowadays that this trade is not carried on.  But, apart from pit props, various other things could be secured as a result of growing more timber.</P>
    <P>I suggest that, if we had a certain type of timber, we would be able to produce wood pulp, and thereby relieve the paper supply situation.  Everybody knows that we have had a paper shortage for the past two or three years.  Some of the paper we have is not very good, but if the Minister and his Department paid particular attention to that aspect of afforestation, I feel that it would be of great benefit to the country.</P>
    <P>Recently, the Department of Agriculture have been given a present of Johnstown Castle and demesne, a couple of miles outside Wexford, and I am wondering if the Minister has made any representations, or would he make representations to the Department of Agriculture, with a view to getting them to make available some of the land which is very suitable for three planting for forestry purposes. I would suggest that that should be done.</P>
    <P>Some years ago, in consequence of local agitation in Wexford, the Forestry Department took over for planting the Forth area, two miles out side the town of Wexford.  Some planting was done on that occasion, but for some reason it was discontinued, and there are still tracts of land which are useful for the purpose of planting.  I would ask the Minister to request his Department to pay attention to that particular area.  I would also like to ask the Minister what is the position regarding Camolin Park?  My information is that not much work is being done there at the present, and I was wondering if there was any particular reason.  I suggest that the Minister should get in touch <Col N="2075" /> with the local authorities at a particular time each year and invite their co-operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not have an opportunity to hear the Minister yesterday, and I am, therefore, at a disadvantage in speaking in this debate.  When the Minister is replying, I should like him to give us some indication of the intentions of his Department in regard to afforestation generally, and to tell us whether it is intended to speed up the rate of progress made during past years, or whether it is intended to slow it down generally.  Public opinion demands a speeding up of the rate of progress.  It is, however, not always desirable to draw comparisons between this country and other countries in regard to the amount of land used for afforestation.  The actual percentage of forestry in other countries, as compared with ours, should not be the deciding factor, in our opinion.  The deciding factor should be the actual value of forests to this country or rather to the creation of wealth and we should also consider whether land utilised for forestry will give a greater return than if it was utilised for any other purpose.  In this respect, we have to consider, in respect of every acre of land acquired by the Forestry Department, what exactly it will cost for acquisition, planting, and overhead charges, and what return it will give when the timber has matured.</P>
      <P>Last year I asked for information from the Minister.  The Minister told me that the average cost of planting was £14 an acre, the cost of wiring the land, £3 an acre, and the overhead charges, £4, making a total cost of £21 an acre.  It would be of interest if the Minister would give us the average value of the timber produced so that we could find out whether, on the average, afforestation has been economic or how far it has been profitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Wicklow, I may say, is one of the most extensively planted counties in Éire, and I think notwithstanding that there is, so far as the ordinary observer can ascertain, still wide room even in Wicklow for very considerable expansion <Col N="2076" /> of afforestation, but this House would like to have the detailed information to enable us to assess the value of timber production per acre when we have to compare it with the value of the same land used for agricultural purposes like sheep raising.  We have also to consider the potential value of this land for sheep raising and agricultural purposes generally, if extensively developed and improved, as much rough grazing is capable of improving under modern systems of agriculture. It is not sufficient to go out and say to the Department of Forestry that such and such land is giving a very small agricultural return and has a very small agricultural value, and therefore ought to be taken up and acquired immediately for afforestation purposes. We must also consider the results which might accrue from the reclamation of such land and its utilisation for agricultural purposes.  These are matters to which the Forestry Department and this House have to give great attention when considering the progress of afforestation in this country.</P>
    <P>Might I say that I am still of opinion that there is a very wide field for advance and for the extension of the Forestry Department?  There is also a considerable field for private enterprise, or rather for the carrying out of afforestation by private individuals and by local bodies.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has provided additional inducements to private individuals and I hope that, with the general improvement in the economic condition of the farmers, they will avail themselves of the opportunities provided.  But I must say that, so far as the individual farmer is concerned, afforestation is not pursued because of a profit-making motive.  There is a desire on the part of the farmer to improve not only the appearance of his holding but its permanent value for posterity.  It is only in times when the individual farmer is fairly prosperous that he can turn his attention to improvements of that kind.  We must bear that in mind in considering the extent to which we can hope for improvement from the individual landowner.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of encouraging local bodies such as parish <Col N="2077" /> councils, or any local co-operative body or society which may be established in rural areas to acquire small portions of land and to plant them.  I hope that the Minister will look into the question of such bodies and give all facilities and assistance possible, and I ask him to facilitate them in the acquisition of small portions of waste land and to see that they get the assistance which is provided here for the private land owner.  In this connection, a local body such as a parish council would not be inspired so much by the profit motive. They would be influenced largely by the motive of improving the district and generally giving a considerable amount of local employment and creating a local asset.  That kind of local enterprise should be encouraged. Through the country, we see patches of two or three or four acres of land which could easily be acquired and planted but, for various reasons, the Forestry Department cannot touch it.</P>
    <P>Some local bodies such as I suggest, whether co-operative societies or parish councils, with the best interests of the country at heart, should be encouraged to acquire such patches of land because in many cases the actual land involved is suitable for reclamation and for the planting of trees. The work of planting would entail a certain amount of grants so that the land would be made suitable.</P>
    <P>There is one last matter which, I think, falls under the Minister's supervision &mdash; the checking up of our resources of timber suitable for firewood. Having regard to the very dangerous situation in which we are to-day in regard to fuel, it is absolutely essential that the resources of this country in timber suitable for firewood should be ascertained and, whether it is owned by the State or by private individuals, regarded as an iron ration on which the community could fall back if every other sort of fuel became unavailable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not delay the House unduly by the observations I have to make.  I should like to urge upon the Minister that when lands are taken over for the purposes of forestry an investigation should be carried out in that locality to ascertain whether that land is unsuitable for tillage and fit for forestry.  In the area from which I come, there is one farm of about 37 or 38 acres the owner of which, I believe, has applied very often to the Forestry Department to take over the lands.  There are two further farms in regard to which applications were recently made, both to the Land Commission and the Forestry Department, with a view to securing the whole or part of the land for the purposes of tillage.  This is land which, to my mind, is very suitable for tillage.  In one holding there are about 220 acres, 150 of which at least would be suitable for tillage.  A very small farmer with young sons in the locality applied for that land for the purpose of devoting it to the production of food, but now we find that it has been taken over by the Forestry Department.  Only yesterday I discovered that another farm in the locality, where an abortive Land Commission sale was recently attempted, has also been taken over by the Forestry Department.  Another farmer who applied for that land would have utilised it for the production of food rather than see it turned into a plantation.  These are matters which <Col N="2080" /> I should like the Minister to consider. I have no objection to afforestation. On the contrary, I say the Government have not made sufficient progress with it.  I think that everything should be done to promote forestry on a far more extensive scale than heretofore even by individual farmers and landowners. We all know that shelter belts are very desirable and that they help to improve the fertility of the land very considerably but, coming back to the point which I raised at the outset, I would suggest to the Minister that before land is taken over in any particular area due consideration should be given to the question of whether these lands are suitable for tillage and, if there are people in the locality who need that land and who would put it into production, I hope the Minister will give their claims favourable consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter raised by Deputy Heskin is the crux of this whole question.  There seems to be a general view that land which is good for anything else, tillage or otherwise, must not be used for forestry, that in fact we should turn to the useless land, the mountain and the rock, and use that for forestry purposes.  I do not know whether there is any basis for that view.  I am not sufficiently familiar with the growing of trees to express any decided opinion upon it, but I think it is a question that deserves examination.  I have the feeling that one would require nearly as good land for growing a tree as for growing anything else.  If that is the position, we have to make up our minds on that very important matter of policy, as to whether we are going to devote a portion of our good land to afforestation or whether we are going to keep it for the production of other things to which we are more accustomed and that most of us think more important, such as potatoes, turnips and corn.  That is the question we have to resolve because I doubt very much whether you can successfully grow trees to any extent on land that is good for nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that experiments were carried out in many places, to some <Col N="2081" /> of which my friend, Deputy Mongan, referred and that they did not meet with any great success but, mind you, I would not accept the result of these experiments as final.  As Deputy Mongan pointed out, the stumps of trees are there to this day to prove that woods flourished there in the past and it is incredible that, where woods once grew, they will not grow again. We have nothing to guide us as to whether the climate has changed so much in the years that have passed since the woods grew there originally, that the type of tree which grew there before would not grow there now.  As regards the experiments that were carried out, I have seen the results of some of these experiments.  They were mere skeletons, things that never developed into anything.  The explanation given was that the Atlantic winds prevented the trees growing.  I doubt that very much.  I think something could be done to get over that by planting some type of shrubs in the first place as shelter belts for the trees.  Eventually, by the selection of proper trees, you might find a type that would be suitable for these areas.</P>
    <P>It is hard to believe that places which once grew trees have so altered that they are no longer capable of being used for afforestation.  I think, above all, we have to make up our minds on the particular point that Deputy Heskin raised.  Apparently, he is strongly of the opinion that, because a certain holding is suitable for tillage to his knowledge, it should not have been acquired by the Forestry Department. That is an important matter. That is a question of policy which is important, namely, whether it is advisable to utilise land which is suitable for the more ordinary agricultural purposes for purposes of afforestation. I have an open mind on the matter but I do feel that it is desirable that we should do something to have more trees planted and especially, if I may say so, I think it is desirable that we should have replanting done where the country is now being denuded of trees. I do not know whether that is being strictly enforced.  I do not know if it is the job of the Forestry Department to see that where a tree is cut down a tree must be planted but I have very <Col N="2082" /> grave doubts as to whether it is being done.</P>
    <P>As a result of the last war, large stumps were left all over the country. That is another matter that requires attention.  They are an eyesore. Where a man has been given permission to cut down a belt of trees in any particular area, he ought to be made to clear out the stumps as well. There is nothing worse than to see on sloping ground throughout the country, in Kerry, Tipperary, Wicklow and other places, at a height of about two feet from the ground, stumps of trees dotted here and there like gravestones. If the Minister has any power in that matter, he should see that these stumps should be cleared out by whoever gets permission to cut down the wood.  I do not know whether the replanting has to be done in the place where the trees are cut, but to my mind it would be impossible for young trees to develop if these roots are not taken up.  The roots of these old trees have very wide ramifications and a young tree would not get very much chance of developing if it were planted amongst these old roots.</P>
    <P>I know the Forestry Department cannot undertake to acquire small areas such as four, five and ten acre plots and to utilise them under their own forestry inspectors and forestry hands but, to develop the suggestion of Deputy Cogan, I think they might consider helping local authorities, or parish councils, or bodies of that kind, to acquire them.  The Forestry Department might, under their compulsory powers, acquire them and hand them over to these bodies for development. These bodies might be willing enough to undertake work of that kind but they would usually be financially incapable of acquiring even a small portion of land for the purpose and everybody knows how the price of land will suddenly spring up if anybody wants it for a purpose of that kind.  The Forestry Department would have powers of acquiring small belts of that kind where they were either offered or pointed out to them and if they could get some bodies or trustees even locally, without the formality of <Col N="2083" /> a parish council at all, to undertake the planting and the care of trees when planted in these areas I think they might be doing something worth while.  It is throwing an extra burden on the Department but it is in line with what they are doing on a bigger scale in other places and I think it would not be too much of a burden.</P>
    <P>With regard to tree planting generally by the private person, I think a good deal could be done in the way of propaganda, in the nature of what we used to do in the old days. The Minister will remember the Arbor Day, I think it was the 1st November in each year, which was an institution of the Sinn Féin movement.  It was put up to everybody to plant a tree or a few young trees on that day.  That was in itself very good propaganda.  It got trees talked about.  A good deal might be done for afforestation by getting people tree-minded, as it were, or forest-minded.</P>
    <P>The main point that the Minister will have to face in dealing with this problem is the objection that Deputy Heskin raised.  You will always find persons saying, &ldquo;why should you waste good land which could be used for tillage for trees which you could grow anywhere?&rdquo; People's minds ought to be made clear as to whether or not trees will grow anywhere.  I do not think so myself.  I think you require pretty good land to grow trees just as to grow crops.  If I am right in that, people should be told about that so that they will not adopt the hostile attitude that they will otherwise constantly adopt when the Forestry Department acquires land which might be used for tillage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point that Deputy Lynch and Deputy Heskin referred to, I think there is no necessity to go into good arable land for tree planting while we have thousands and thousands of acres in the valleys and on the sides of hills which were under plantations in years gone by.  I think it would be ridiculous at the moment to go into any land that is fit to produce crops and to utilise it for afforestation purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2084" /> The Forestry Department should not acquire them.  I have never seen trees grow on rocks and poor land but I know various glens and hills sloping up 200 feet that were under timber in my time and that had been cleared during the 1914-1918 war.  There are areas in West Cork about which I could give information&mdash;I am sure the Minister has particulars in his Department &mdash; Castletownshend, Lackareagh, and Cononagh.  They are still bare. As Deputy Lynch says, the stumps of the trees are all that is to be seen. These places grew valuable and good timber.  There is no private enterprise willing to take over and plant these areas.  The objection that the Forestry Department have to taking them over is that they could not be worked economically, that the area is too small.  The people who planted these areas in the past were the landlords who had their pound of flesh from the poor people.  They planted in good lands and did not mind whether the land was valuable or not. I do not mind whether the areas are five, ten, 20 or 50-acre plots, the private individual cannot plant them. They are eyesores in the countryside and, whatever the economic aspect of it may be, I think it is the duty of the Forestry Department to take over and plant them.  The difficulty is the repairing of the fencing.  The private individuals who are planting small sheltered belts and doing a little bit year after year find it very difficult at the moment to fence.  You cannot plant young trees unless you have fencing.  I and others like me are held up because we cannot get the paling posts or the wire.  We are at a standstill. Numbers of people who would plant small shelter belts and help to beautify the country are held up.</P>
    <P>I do not know when a survey was made of the land in West Cork but, starting at Ardgroom and coming over the valley to Eyeries and Allihies, there is a big tract of country not suitable for tillage in any shape or form, but there is sufficient soil for timber. That land could grow valuable timber although it is not very much use for cattle feeding or for sheep.  I think the people there would be very glad to have that land taken over by the <Col N="2085" /> Department and planted.  It would save and beautify the countryside.  It would be an asset in the future. Coming on to Castletownbere and Bantry there might be plots.  The Minister should have a survey made in these areas and, as far as possible, acquire land, even if a little extra had to be paid for it.  I do not believe in planting 500 or 1,000 acres but would prefer to see from 20 to 50-acre plots planted.</P>

      <P>It seems to be the habit in regard to the Department of Lands and Forestry to travel over a very wide area.  I often wonder what the critics of the Forestry Department would do if they were deprived of the example of the Landes.  When I am listening to people criticising the Forestry Department and telling us about its ineptitude and the lack of progress compared to what has been done in France.  It seems to me that Deputy Esmonde is very ill-informed if it is only now he discovered that there was a book on forestry in the Library. That book has been there for many years.  I wish Deputies would take some notice of what our own experts say, and of the publications of our own people in Ireland, and try to realise what the conditions are in Ireland, and why things that have been done in other countries cannot be done here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I know, one of the chief officers of the Land Commission, in a lecture delivered recently in Dublin, referred to this question, and it has been referred to time and again by various officials of the Department.  A thorough explanation has been given why the planting of the Landes has been successful and why planting on the seaboard of Connemara and places like that is not successful.  The question of erosion was raised by Deputy Hughes and he referred to the position in America.  Deputy Crowley also referred to the American policy and the tremendous efforts put into forestry there during the last few years.  I explained on the Estimate for the Department of Lands that, in regard to erosion, we in the Land Commission had taken certain action, particularly <Col N="2086" /> in regard to sand fixation in County Donegal.  I saw the work done by the Land Commission in Donegal nine or ten years ago and was very much amazed at the methods utilised and surprised at the success that had been achieved.  I became very interested, and, after reading an American magazine of a sand fixation project that had been undertaken on the coast of Oregon and Washington, I wrote to a friend of mine in America asking him to get from his State forester all the particulars he could regarding the work done in Oregon and Washington. The State forester sent me all the information available in Washington to the Federal Government.  He wrote me a personal letter describing his own knowledge of sand fixation and erosion and told me that all the work was based on the findings of a man named A. H. McClean, of the Irish Land Commission, who was an acknowledged expert on the subject. He advised me to get in touch with Mr. McClean.  I wish Deputies, instead of roaming over Denmark, Europe and America, would get in touch with people who, according to Deputy Kennedy, still operate the law of mortmain in regard to Ministers. Deputy Crowley also spoke about the tremendous amount of work being done in America.  Undoubtedly there has been a great development of forestry in America, but the reasons underlying it were much different from the reasons here.</P>
    <P>A French writer who is a very shrewd observer of social and economic phenomena charged some time ago that the American farmers had done more harm to America than the gangsters.  Undoubtedly when I hear members of the Opposition and of the Farmers' Party talking about destruction of fertility in the land here through Government policy I remember what happened in America and what brought about the condition of things that is now being repaired by forestry.  Continual cropping with the same type of crop completely destroyed a tremendous acreage of the Middle West and, in order to prevent that area from being turned completely into a desert, under the N.R.A., and irrespective of cost, President <Col N="2087" /> Roosevelt undertook to plant enormous belts there.  We cannot do that.  We have not the same problems; we have not the same land, and we are not empowered or able to spend the same amount of money.  I never heard any Deputy&mdash;since we finally sold the idea to the Opposition&mdash;objecting for the past couple of years to the growing of wheat.  The only objection to wheat growing on the part of Deputies, was to its being grown in their own constituencies.  It is the same with forestry.  Deputy O'Donovan, Deputy Cogan and every Deputy would like to see more forestry but immediately the Forestry Department takes over a piece of land in their areas they complain because it is not handed over to landless men and the Old I.R.A.  That is all rubbish.  You cannot have it both ways.  It has not been the policy, and Deputy O'Donovan ought to know that it has not been the policy, to take over arable land.</P>

      <P>The Forestry Department has been very humble in its demands and has been satisfied with a very poor type of land.  It has even tried to grow trees on rocks.  The Land Commission very definitely has not butted in on the good land but has tried to get the second-class land planted.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney was as lyrical as Joyce Kilmer in his description of the tree but I think we will be able to satisfy him as to what exactly a tree is so that if anybody goes out to buy an elephant they will not come back with an ash-tree.  Deputy Crowley said that there were offers of land in Kerry and that they were turned down by the Land Commission.  I sincerely hope the Deputy will carry out his promise and make a list of these lands and give us all the help possible in securing them because the only thing that is preventing planting is the lack of land. It is not that we are not forestry minded, as Deputy Crowley says.  I dislike praising civil servants&mdash;it makes me suspect&mdash;but I think that in the Forestry Department we have the most <Col N="2088" /> earnest officials in regard to their business in the whole country.  Deputy Crowley said that we were offered land in Kerry.  If he had spoken about Mayo or Donegal I might not be quite <i>au fait</i> with the position but I know every blade of grass in the area Deputy Crowley spoke of.  West, north and along the source of the Blackwater there have been negotiations going on for years and years between the Land Commission and the tenants.  Every inducement has been offered to the people to give land that is cold, bare, desolate, that really should be planted. Every effort is being made by the Forestry Department to secure that land.  Deputy Crowley tells us that he has secured an offer of land and one would think that it was a straightforward proposition.  It is not.  Kerry is, as it were, suspect with me.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Crowley could get about 50 farmers from his constituency migrated up to County Kildare or County Meath or elsewhere then we could have the land for forestry, but we have not had the straightforward offer of forestry land in Kerry that Deputy Crowley mentioned. I am not in any way enamoured of the idea of getting local authorities or parish councils enthused about forestry.  I do not think that that is a good proposition.  Deputy Corish and Deputy Lynch, from two points of view spoke about 1920 and 1921 and what we did then.  Deputy Lynch said that the planting of trees and an Arbor Day was very good propaganda for forestry.  In my opinion it was very good propaganda for Sinn Féin and that was what it was meant to be.  The results as regards forestry were nothing.  Trustees, parish councils and local authorities are not satisfactory bodies for carrying on forestry. It is a job that must be done by the State.  There is no other way of doing it, but I believe very much that it is worth doing and that it is worth making mistakes to try and secure success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hughes said that we hide our errors.  We do not hide our errors.  Other people say that we <Col N="2089" /> parade our errors in order to prove that forestry cannot be developed.  I think it is a wise policy to tell people what the successes are and what the failures are, so that the people can judge exactly what the position is. The talk that there was about stumps in bogs and hillsides that have been there from time immemorial does not guarantee successful planting now. Again I will give you an instance. Quite recently, a friend of mine, who is now somewhere in the Pacific, wrote from somewhere in Australia to say that he was surprised to see &ldquo;beech&rdquo; trees in Australia that were some thousands of years old.  He said that Australia had made various efforts to plant and propagate &ldquo;beech&rdquo; trees throughout the country and had failed because of a complete change in the climate of the country.  The &ldquo;beech&rdquo; trees that originated some thousands of years ago are still there, dropping away gradually, but no new ones can be planted because of the change of climate.  In the same way when you get stumps here it does not show you can grow trees at the present time.  I will not say anything more.  I think I said everything in making my opening statement, but I am quite confident that the Forestry Department is alive to its responsibilities. It is capable of handling the situation in a satisfactory fashion.  I am anxious that we should pursue the development of forestry as strongly as possible and I would ask Deputies to co-operate with the Government and the Department in trying to secure the land on which to plant the trees.</P>

Sna ceanntair <Col N="2096" /> bhochta seo tá an talamh lom, gortach tanaidhe agus ní thig slí bheatha a bhaint as.  Tá na gabháltais ró-bheag le muirghean a thógáil ortha. Níl ann ach go gcoinníonn siad an t-anam agus an cholann le chéile.  Ní thiocfadh leis na daoine seo bheith beo gan na tionnscail baile atá aca, mar obair na holna, báinín, cniotáil, bróidneoireacht, iascaireacht, ceilp, carraigín agus saothrú a gelann ar an choigrích.</P>
    <P>Isé is lugha a bhíthear ag dréim ó Rialtas Náisiúnta go dtabhradh siad cúram do na tionnscail dúthchais seo ortha féin agus iad a fheabhsú agus a leathnú ar fud na Gaeltachta, agus margadh d'fháil do shaothar na ndaoine seo.  Táthar á dhéanamh seo san am i láthair, ach níl an Roinn ag cur an dúthracht ceart leis an obair seo.  Tá an t-othar ag dul chun báis agus an Ghaeltacht ag dul chun báine agus na doctúirí ag caibideal.  Thiocfadh a dhá oiread d'fháil ó na tionncail seo dá gcuirtí an suim ceart ionta. Níl an fuinneamh no an dul chun cinn ar chúl na dtionnscal seo atá riachtanach má tá siad le bheith beo láidir againn nuair a bheas an cogadh seo thart.</P>
    <P>Caithfidh an Roinn níos mó suime a chur ionta, go háithrid tionnscal an bháinín.  Seo tionnscal a fhóireas go fíor-mhaith do mhuintir na Gaeltachta. Tá bun maith air i dTír Chonaill cheana féin ach thiocfadh é a dhéanamh i bhfad níos láidre ná tá sé.  Tá an t-éadach a ghnítear ar an seol láimhe anois ionchurtha le héadach ar bith ar an mhargadh.  Tá na sníomhnóirí agus na figheadóirí ag biseadh gach lá ag cur deilbh úr agus snas níos fearr ar an bháinín. D'fhéadfadh an Roinn cuidiú a thabhairt do na daoine seo nach bhfuiltear a thabhairt dóibh.  Thiocfadh olann níos míne d'fháil dóibh, ola agus dathanna d'fháil dóibh, agus eolas agus teagase a thabhairt dóibh le éadach a dhéanamh trom no éadtrom do gach seisiúr, do réir mar bheadh éileamh air.  Acht níltear á dhéanamh sin.</P>
    <P>Ansin thiocfadh cuidiú mór a thabhairt do na daoine seo dá bhfuigheadh siad an chuid is masluithe den obair <Col N="2097" /> déanta i muileann olna.  Sin an olann a bhriseadh agus a spíonadh, a dhathú agus a bhealú, a chíoradh agus a chárdáil le dul chun túirne.  Thiocfadh leis an mhuileann an t-éadach a sciúradh agus a reamhrú i ndiaidh é theacht ón fhigheadóir.  San am i láthair caithfear an sciúradh seo a dhéanamh i mBaile Atha Cliath.  Ba cheart an obair seo a dhéanamh uilig sa nGaeltacht.  Tá an chumhacht sa mhuileann i gCill Chártha anois ach níl na hinnill ansin le húsáid a bhaint as an chumhacht sin.  Ba mhór an neamairt nach bhfuarthas na hinnill don mhuileann seo i 1939 ach níl gar a bheith ag caint air sin anois. Má tá inill no gléasra ar fáil sa tír don mhuileann seo ba chóir greim d'fháil ortha gan mhoill.  Bheadh céim chun tosaigh tugtha ansin a rachadh go mór chun tairbhe do mhuintir na Gaeltachta. Bhéarfadh sé slí bheatha do na céadta a bheadh ar ghann-chuid gan é nó bheadh ag imeacht thar sáile uainn de dhíobháil oibre sa bhaile.</P>
    <P>Rud amháin eile.  Ba mhaith linn na cuntais a bheith níos cruinne agus níos iomláine agus cuntas ar leith do gach tionnscal.</P>

      <P>Is maith liom tagairt a dhéanamh do na tionnscail tuaithe agus a rá cho tairbheach is atá siad do na háiteacha ina bhfuil siad suidhte.  Is féidir le cailíní idir deich fichead agus dhá phunt sa tseachtain an duine a thuilleamh. Is léir go bhfuil obair mar seo i bhfad Éireann níos fearr agus níos tairbhighe ná aon tsaghas eile oibre dá fheabhas ó bhaile agus go mórmhór ná obair i Sasana.  Tá éileamh mór i nGaillimh Thiar ar tuilleadh de na tionnscail seo mar aithníonn na daoine bochta rud fóintiúil nuair a fheiceann siad ag obair é agus tá meas mór aca ortha seo.  Tá a fhios agam cho deacair is atá sé meaisíní a fháil agus mura féidir monarchana a bhunú béidir go bhféadfaí obair láimhe bhaineas leis an tionnscal a chur ar fáil.  Is feasach mé gurb iad lucht an Airm is mó a cheannuíonn saothar na nIonad Tionnscail, ach tá súil agam go mbeidh sé ar chumas na Roinne an obair a choinneál ar siúl nuair a bheas an cogadh thart.</P>

Rinneas féin tagairt don cheist seo cheana agus bhíos ag súil go mbéidir go mbeadh tionnscal mar atá aca i dTír Conaill curtha ar bun in áit eicínt thiar i gConamara roimhe seo.</P>
    <P>Tá moladh agus creidiúint ag dul don Roinn agus molaim iad.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil croidhe an Aire san áit cheart maidir leis an nGaeltacht. Le có-oibriú eatorra is féidir tuilleadh feabhais a chur ar shaol na ndaoine bochta.</P>

Agus anois ó thárla gurb é atá i mbunadh na Gaeltachta tá súil againn go bhfágfa sé í níos fearr agus níos Gaelaighe ná fuair sé í.  Ba mhaith an rud dá gcuirtí tuille de na scoltacha cniotála thart timpeall, mar tá na mná ag déanamh go maith ortha.  Do réir Mhichíl Óig Mhic Pháidín tá na daoine ag déanamh a seacht saibhreas i nGaeltacht Dhún na nGall ar na bréidíní agus a leitheidí.  B'iongantach an rud dá bhféadadh an tAire a leithide seo a thosuighe i gceart i gConamara.  Tá an olann againn agus na daoine&mdash;níl uainn ach an gléas oibre fháil.  Do réir Mhichíl Óig Mhic Pháidín tá na fir ag cárdáil chó maith leis na mná i nDún na nGall.

    <P>Anois an cheilp&mdash;feicim go ndubhairt an Coiste um Chuntaisí Puibli go raibh súil aca go mbeadh níos mó ceilpe le fáil i mbliana ná anuraidh. Tá faitíos orm nach mbeidh, mar bhí na slata mara á ndóghadh le haghaidh ceilpe anuraidh.  I mbliana tá siad á gceannach asta féin agus á ndíol mar <Col N="2099" /> atá siad.  Mar sin beidh ábhar is fearr na ceilpe ar iarraidh&mdash;mar b'asta a b'fhearr a thagadh ceilp le haghaidh leasú.  Déarfainnse leis an Aire go mb'fhearr dhó an teist a laghdú no luacha a árdú.  Mara ndéana sé é sin ní chuirfe sé fonn ar na daoine an fheamainn a chruinniú mar beidh faitíos ortha nach bhfuighe siad an oiread uirthi is fuair siad anuraidh.</P>
    <P>An carraigín anois&mdash;ceapaimse go mb'fhearr dhá phraghas air ná trí cinn, mar tá faitíos orm go gceannuítear é ar an bpraghas is ísle go mion agus go minic agus go ndíoltar arís é ar an dara praghas no ar an bpraghas uachtair.  Sin é le rá, an dream a chaitheas a saol agus a n-aimsir á phiocadh agus á thriomú, nuair a thugas siad chuig na ceannuitheoirí é go ndeireann siad nach bhfuil sé sáthach maith le haghaidh an chéad phraghas no an dara praghas agus gur ag na ceannuitheoirí bhíos na buntáistí ba cheart a bheith ag na daoine a chaitheas a saol agus a n-aimsir leis. Is maith an rud go bhfuil riail ann go gcaithfear é bheith go maith ach tá faitíos orm, ar nós go leor rialta, go bhfuil cuid de na daoine ag déanamh níos mó air ná ba cheart.

    <Speaker pid="BryanMylesBrady" hpid="Mr. B. Brady Mr. B. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>A matter in which I am very much interested was dealt with some time ago when the Supplementary Estimates were under consideration. I refer to the purchase of homespuns.  On that occasion I made suggestions which had been conveyed to me by people engaged in that industry. They were hopeful that these suggestions, if put into operation, would be of considerable help.  So far as I am aware, no steps have, so far, been taken to meet the points that were raised on that occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considerable difficulty is being experienced at the moment in connection with the manufacture of homespuns. The difficulty arises out of the meagre supplies of the oil used in the carding of the wool.  Representations were made to the Minister and to the Department, and so far as I have been <Col N="2100" /> informed the people concerned were referred to the Clover Meat Industry, and were told that there they would get oil supplies.  Communications were addressed to the proprietors of that industry, and the reply was that there was no oil available.</P>
    <P>I read in a local paper the report of the committee set up to take charge of the carder which the Gaeltacht Services Department was good enough to place at the disposal of the homespun workers.  I was rather surprised at the amount of wool that passed through that carder in a period of 12 months. Over 100,000 lbs. of wool were carded in Ardara in that period, and that did not represent by any means all the wool carded.  A large amount was carded in the homes of the workers. That will give Deputies an idea of the amount of oil required for the carding of the wool.  I realise the difficulties with regard to procuring oil, but at the same time I think some effort should be made to obtain supplies for these people.  This is a vital industry, and oil supplies are badly needed, and I would ask the Minister to approach the Department of Supplies so as to ensure that adequate quantities of oil will be made available for the carding of the wool.</P>
    <P>I feel that the Department is not approaching this matter in a sufficiently serious way, and it would seem to me that the Minister is inclined to regard this as something thrust upon him by another Department in order to get over the difficulties that have arisen.  It would appear that they are just carrying on this duty for the time being, and are not accepting much responsibility. I suggest that that is a wrong approach.  This industry was practically allowed to die, but it is now being revived and it provides people in several parishes with a reasonable means of livelihood.  In many of the small uneconomic holdings there is a weaving and spinning tradition, and I think it is the duty of the Department to see that these industries are kept alive, and I hope that in the future it will take a more serious view of the situation.  There is no reason why the two industries, home spinning and machine spinning, should not run <Col N="2101" /> hand-in-hand.  At any rate, the Department should adopt a more serious attitude in regard to this matter and endeavour to meet the requirements of the people engaged in those industries.</P>
    <P>In the course of his statement, the Minister suggested that people have been licensed to produce and sell the homespun article, and in addition the Department have direct supervision.  I suggest that if the Gaeltacht Department indicates the designs that it requires and gives all the information necessary to the weavers, the weavers will give a ready response and will-be quite prepared to supply the types of cloth needed.  The buyers give all cloths very severe examination and rightly so.  I do not see any reason why the Gaeltacht Department should not be in the same position as the private individual.  If they know what they want, they should provide the weavers with the designs.  If that is done, I have every reason to believe that the results will be quite satisfactory. I think the Minister will find that the weavers, spinners, and indeed everybody engaged in the industry will be only too anxious to co-operate with the Department.</P>
    <P>Under the existing arrangements, there is every hope that this industry will be established on a permanent basis.  The people realise that they have an organisation to market their cloth, and that they have more or less a stabilised price.  In that way they recognise that it is in their own interests to use every endeavour to make the industry a success.  I hope the Department will co-operate with those people and give the weavers designs, so that they will know what type of cloth is required.  With co-operation of that type, there is no reason why the industry should not be very successful.</P>

      <P>The question refers to a post which is being filled through the Civil Service Commission. The figures asked for in the Deputy's question are:&mdash; Number of applications received for the post, 34; the amount paid in fees by each applicant, £2; the net total amount in fees received from all applicants, £66 (the application fee was refunded, in accordance with the usual practice, to one applicant who was ineligible, in respect of age, to compete).  Pending the results of the written test, which is due to take place on 9th instant, it is not possible to state the number of applicants who will be interviewed.  As provided in the regulations, copies of which were supplied to all applicants, all who qualify in the written test will be called for interview.  All applicants who <i>prima facie</i> are eligible to compete will be afforded an opportunity of sitting for the written test, and, as I have said, all those who qualify in the test will be called for interview.  The question of the refunding of fees in the circumstances envisaged by the Deputy does not, therefore, arise.  The latest date for accepting completed application forms was the 18th April, 1944.  As is clear from what I have said the appointment has not yet been made.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he is aware of the hardships and difficulties experienced by some 50 holders of turf bogs at the Powerscourt mountain area, County Dublin (map reference &ldquo;P&rdquo;) owing to the long distance that turf has to be wheel-barrowed from the bog to the nearest road for loading&mdash;approximately 300-500 yards; that the journey is very laborious and wasteful of time; and if he will consider the desirability of making a road, for which there is a suitable lay-out, to join the county boundary road which runs from the Military-Glencree road.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the first part of the question is in the affirmative. The preliminary work which was undertaken was the clearing and levelling of the ground and the erection of fencing at a cost of about £2,000, and that section of the scheme was completed with the aid of an employment grant in the financial year ended 31st March, 1940. Grants towards the carrying out of employment schemes can be made only when there is a number of unemployed in an area to warrant the carrying out of special works.  The number unemployed in the Cloghran area declined considerably in the subsequent years, and since then the amount of grant that could be allocated to the area could not be economically expended on the next stage of this particular work. Grants from the Road Fund for road improvements had to be suspended since the financial year 1940-41, owing to the decline in the income of the Road Fund, so that no grants from that source have been made available.  The completing of the work at Cloghran will be considered as soon as it may be possible to allocate further grants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he has examined the legal powers of county councils to compel owners of property to connect the houses which they own with local sewerage schemes, and whether he is now in a position to indicate the legal position in this connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The powers to require owners of property to connect houses with local sewerage schemes are contained in the Public Health Acts.  The principal power of a sanitary authority to enforce connection of houses with the public sewerage system is contained in Section 25 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878.  That power can be exercised only where the house is without a drain sufficient for effectual drainage and there is a sewer within 100 feet of the house.  The procedure to be followed in requiring the owner of a house to connect with the public sewerage system is by service of notice by the sanitary authority on the owner or occupier of the house.  If the notice is not complied with the sanitary authority may, after the expiration of the time specified in the notice, do the work required and may recover the cost from the owner.  When the Deputy asked a similar question in October last, he referred to the results of the efforts of the County Kildare Board of Health to compel property owners to connect with the public sewerage system.  In that instance, the sanitary authority endeavoured to compel the owner of the premises to substitute water closet for privy accommodation. The sanitary authority relied on Sections 110 to 112 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, with a view to proving that the existing privies constituted a nuisance instead of proceeding under Section 45 of the Act of 1878. Section 45 empowers a sanitary <Col N="2112" /> authority, where a house in their district appears to be without sufficient water closet, earth closet or privy accommodation, to require by written notice the owner or occupier of the house within a reasonable time to be specified in such notice to provide sufficient water closet, earth closet or privy accommodation.  The sanitary authority are the sole judges of the sufficiency or insufficiency of the sanitary accommodation on the premises; subject only to the owner's right to appeal to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, under Section 68 of the Act of 1878.  It is understood that the sanitary authority in the case referred to were advised as to proper sections of the Act of 1878 to proceed under, but did not resume proceedings.</P>

      <P>As stated in reply to a question on the 26th ultimo, the matter is receiving active consideration.  The proposed Bill will not deal with rates of pay and conditions of service.  These are matters which may be determined from time to time under the Local Government Act, 1941.  The remuneration of mental hospital attendants was one of the subjects discussed on 4th January last when I received a deputation representing attendants in mental hospitals, accompanied by Mr. Thomas Kennedy, General President of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union.  On that occasion representations were made to me as to the inadequate remuneration paid to some of the mental hospital staffs and the <Col N="2113" /> discrepancies in the initial rates of pay and the scales in the several institutions. I outlined to the members of that deputation the scales of salaries and allowances, including valuation of allowances, which, if acceptable to the employees concerned, and adopted by mental hospital authorities, would secure uniform conditions of remuneration. There was subsequent correspondence for the purpose of clarifying details, and it appears that a further discussion with the representatives of the attendants will be necessary.</P>
      <P>On 19th January, 1944, I received a further deputation of representatives of the attendant and nursing staff of the Grangegorman and Portrane Mental Hospitals accompanied by Deputies Larkin, Senior and Junior, when certain matters affecting the employees concerned were discussed.

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that a claim for a contributory pension <Col N="2114" /> under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts received from Mrs. Elizabeth Quigley, 4 Ebenezer Terrace, South Circular Road, Dublin, was rejected on the grounds that her late husband was not an insured person under the Acts at the date of his death on the 28th June, 1943.  It was ascertained from the National Health Insurance Society that deceased had surrendered contributions to the society for many years, that the last contribution surrendered was in respect of the week ended 26th April, 1942, and that, in the absence of further contributions or duly notified incapacity for work within the succeeding 12 months, he was regarded as having ceased to be an insured person under the Acts on the expiration of his &ldquo;free year&rdquo; on 26th April, 1943, i.e., some two months before he died on 28th June, 1943.  The National Health Insurance Society does not issue special notice to a member warning him of the impending termination of his free year.  His membership card contains information as to how the free year operates, and as to how, before its expiration, a member may arrange to preserve his insurance rights by becoming a voluntary contributor.</P>
      <P>The eight contributions referred to in the question which would have the effect of extending the free year until the date of death could only be affixed in respect of weeks of insurable employment. It has, however, been ruled that the late Mr. Quigley was not insurably employed subsequent to the 26th April, 1942.  From inquiries which were made it was ascertained that deceased's only employment subsequent to the latter date was casual employment as a ticket collector on race-days at Leopardstown and the Curragh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This employment has been ruled as non-insurable, and the claim for a contributory pension was, accordingly, rejected on the grounds that deceased had ceased to be an insured person under the Acts at the date of his death.  Mrs. Quigley was notified of this decision on 15th April, 1944, and was given the option of appealing <Col N="2115" /> against the rejection of her claim within one month from that date.  It is proposed to submit the case to a Referee.</P>

      <P>The reply of the Parliamentary Secretary is exactly a repetition of my question.  He says that this widow has been denied her widows' and orphans' pension because eight stamps were short on her husband's card.  I should like to know whether it is not the duty of the society to serve notice on a person when he has run into arrears.  If a person is ill for a few months and neglects to get the necessary stamps, surely it is the duty of the society to ask him to submit an arrears card. The Parliamentary Secretary says that it is not a statutory obligation on the society to give such notification, but I should like to ask him if he will make it an obligation, so that people will not be deprived of their pensions. Further, with regard to this man having worked at a turnstile at Leopardstown Races, is it a fact that some authority has ruled that that class of work is not insurable, and under what section of the Act has such a ruling been given?  This matter deals with only one case, but it may affect hundreds of others later on.</P>

Owing to their present shortage of staff the Land Commission are unable to undertake fresh proceedings for acquisition except in special cases, but the provisions of Section 37 of the Land Act, 1927, enabling the Land Commission to take possession of holdings for default of the tenant-purchasers in payment of their instalments of land purchase annuities have been and are applied in a number of cases.  It would be to the national advantage if the Deputy would be good enough to report to the Department of Agriculture any cases of uncultivated holdings within his knowledge, with a view to the enforcement of the compulsory tillage regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Including the Supplementary <Col N="2118" /> Budget of November, 1939, this is the sixth Budget which I have the honour to present to Dáil Eireann.  At the outset I might, perhaps, make this comment.  The nervousness of stock exchange and commodity markets traditionally associated with the pre-Budget period has for years past become a matter more of appearance than of reality.  It may be that the shocks inflicted by repeated doses of severe taxation have dulled the sensory nerves of the taxpayer and reduced him to a state of coma.  This condition is sometimes mistaken for acquiescence, and in no place is misconception of the position more likely to flourish than in Dáil Éireann and, I might say, Seanad Éireann also. Members of both Houses and of all Parties are so frequently importuned to lend their support to a variety of objects, each of which seems more or less worthy of Government attention, that their powers of resistance to the required increases of taxation necessarily become weakened.  A similar process takes place with regard to the Minister for Finance, whose Governmental colleagues, in furthering the interests and activities of their Departments, press their views upon him so forcibly and sometimes so unitedly that his defences are continually breached.  He is habitually fighting a delaying action, and that not always successful.  Now, it is a bad thing for any Minister of State to find himself in such a position and in an endeavour to evoke more widespread appreciation of my difficulties and secure the sympathy and support of the Oireachtas and the public in my resistance to excessive expenditure I think it well at this stage to mention some significant figures in regard to the rapid acceleration of the burden of taxes and rates relative to the volume of agricultural and industrial production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The expansion of taxation may be judged by the figures of Exchequer issues for Central Fund and Supply Services.  These have increased from an actual figure of £33,110,000 for 1938-39 to an estimated figure of £49,977,000 for 1944-45, an increase of 51 per cent.  In the same period expenditure by local authorities, that is, <Col N="2119" /> net expenditure from revenue (excluding county agricultural committees and vocational education committees), less amounts derived from Government sources, has risen from £7,464,000 to an estimated £9,600,000 for the current year, an increase of 28½ per cent.</P>
    <P>Increased taxation must be considered against the general economic background.  Between 1938-39 and 1942-43 (the latest period for which the statistics are available) the gross output of agriculture has risen in value by 61 per cent. but the value of net output of agriculture (or the value added to the materials by the agricultural process) had increased considerably more&mdash;by 87 per cent. &mdash;because of the decline in the volume and value of materials.  This increase in the net value of output of agriculture was due principally to a marked increase in agricultural prices&mdash;which have nearly doubled since the outbreak of war. There has also been an increase of 9 per cent. in the net volume of output although the gross volume has fallen by 8 to 10 per cent.  Between 1938 and 1942 the value of net output of industries producing transportable goods (which normally cover roughly 80 per cent. of total industrial output) increased by £4,748,000, or by 19 per cent. while the volume has declined by 21 per cent.  The value of net output of agriculture together with &ldquo;transportable&rdquo; industry has increased by 63 per cent. between 1938-39 and 1942-43.  On account of the exclusion from these figures of the building industry, in this country as in others normally the most important non-agricultural industry, this figure exaggerates the increase in the value of industrial and agricultural production.  State-aided building (new and reconstruction) has been reduced in volume by nearly four-fifths since before the war but, taking account of repair work, the volume of production may be in the neighbourhood of one-half of its pre-war level.  In 1943 as compared with 1938 the value of imports declined by 37 per cent. and the volume declined by 71 per cent.  The value of exports increased by 13 per cent. but the volume declined by 47 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2120" /> These various economic indices tend to show that there has not been a disproportionate increase in actual taxation as compared with taxable capacity in certain parts of our economy but there are large professional and other groups of various kinds, representing a substantial part of the population, whose income has either remained stationary or contracted. On these, burdened as they are with the high cost of living which does not affect the farming community to the same extent, the pressure of current rates of taxation falls with particular severity.  It is regrettable that a large part of such additional production as there has been in war years has had to be shorn off by increased taxes and rates, especially as such addition was to a material extent at the expense of capital.</P>
    <P>It is not surprising in the circumstances that the financial year just closed was remarkable for the heavy yield of revenue, which at £43,780,000 was £4,052,000 in excess of the previous year, despite the fact that the last Budget effected only very minor alterations in taxation.  The inroads on the taxpayer were most marked in regard to property and income-tax, including sur-tax, which was up by nearly £1,500,000 in the year and by corporation profits tax, which increased by over £1,000,000.  The growth in yield of the latter duty has been remarkable. From £591,000 in the last complete financial year before the war the yield has grown to £3,781,000 in the last 12 months, being over £500,000 in excess of the estimate.  The only important head of revenue to show a decline as compared with the previous year was motor vehicle duties which were down by £93,000.  This fall scarcely needs to be explained.</P>
    <P>The return for customs and excise was also beyond expectations and in regard to the former we are again mainly indebted to tobacco which, at £9,081,000, yielded us £1,112,000 more than in the previous year.  This is a new record.  The pipe of peace helps to finance our neutrality and I am setting users of the weed a still higher target for the coming year, no less than £9,250,000; I count on them to <Col N="2121" /> smoke, snuff or chew their way to this objective.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to tobacco leaf, however, gives us some reason for apprehension.  Our stocks are not considerable and we are finding difficulty in securing from the United States the necessary permits to enable Irish manufacturers to purchase and export to this country the supplies of leaf required to meet our minimum needs.  There has been a decline in the American acreage under leaf and in recent years various crop restrictions and marketing quotas have been imposed by Governmental agency.  In the coming year growers are to be allowed by the War Food Administration an increase in acreage of 10 per cent. and in the amount of leaf marketed of 20 per cent.  How far this will help us is not clear.  The growth in the armed forces of the United Nations and the full employment of their civilian population, as well as the conditions of strain under which many are forced to live, have resulted in an unprecedented expansion in the demand for this popular and, I suppose we may still call it, cheap narcotic.  While smokers here cannot get all they want, there is still a fair supply available, but in a year's time manufacturers' stocks of the leaf in this country will be dangerously low unless there is some favourable development in the meantime.  Tobacco, like whiskey, mellows and improves with age, at any rate up to a certain point, and the present big expansion in world consumption is being met, to a large extent, by drawing on reserve stocks.</P>
    <P>The enhanced yield from tobacco duty in the past year was in some measure due to an increase in imports of foreign-manufactured cigarettes. These supplies have helped to alleviate the prevailing shortage, but they cannot provide any significant relief from the difficulties to which I have referred, and moreover, no assurance can be given that such imports will be maintained.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to the concession under which certain gifts of imported tobacco are admitted free of duty.  I granted this in the hope <Col N="2122" /> that it would meet cases of hardship and would not be abused.  From an examination of some such imports, I am afraid that exemption is being claimed on parcels of tobacco represented to be gifts, the despatch of which is not unsolicited and the cost of which does not fall on the sender. If this abuse continues, and certainly if it increases, I shall feel obliged to consider the withdrawal of the concession.</P>
    <P>Tobacco contributes about four-fifths of the revenue from customs duties and that must be my excuse for having dwelt on it at some length. Practically all other heads of customs revenue showed a decline last year, the greatest being in clothing and apparel which fell away, as was indeed to be expected, by over £250,000.</P>
    <P>The supremacy of tobacco on the customs side is matched by that of beer and spirits on the excise side. The two together returned us in 1943-44 no less than £6,299,000, which is £1,000,000 in excess of the previous year's contribution.  In conformity with this movement, the entertainments and betting duties also showed a certain liveliness.  How far the last-named will be affected in the coming year by the further restrictions on racing fixtures announced for this country and the United Kingdom I cannot say at present.  Entertainments will also be affected by poorer transport facilities, but the determination to seek them out will, it is hoped, triumph over all obstacles.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will see by turning to the first of the tables issued in connection with the Financial Statement, the deficit for the year just closed worked out at £529,000 as against £3,555,000 anticipated.  Though the expenditure, like the revenue, reached a new record at £45,009,000, it was not as great as was anticipated.  This was mainly because of shortage of many of the materials required by the various Departments.  The realised deficit was small but, as against this, it must be remembered that we treat as ordinary revenue the whole of the receipts from land purchase annuities and from death duties.  The former, at £1,768,000 for the year, contain a large capital <Col N="2123" /> element&mdash;in the neighbourhood of £700,000.  These annuities will, of course, lapse after a time and the capital element in them now should more appropriately be applied to capital purposes, or set aside in a special fund, the income from which would be utilised by later Finance Ministers to compensate for the falling off in these annuities in subsequent years.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer returns issued on the 31st March last which, of course, do not distinguish between normal and abnormal expenditure show the difference between Exchequer issues for Central Fund and Supply Services and Exchequer tax and non-tax revenue to be £1,229,000.  Similar figures for recent years have been: 1942-43, £3,317,000, and 1941-42, £3,644,000.  The total of these differences in the years 1939-40 to 1943-44, inclusive, amounts to £13,330,000, which had to be financed altogether by borrowing.  To this figure should be added a payment in 1942-43 of £1,054,000 under the Insurance (Amendment) Act, 1938, and £80,000 discount on the issue of loans, bringing the total up to the large sum of £14,464,000.</P>
    <P>Table III of the tables circulated to-day relates to capital liabilities and assets and shows gross State liabilities as at 31st March last of £82,865,000, and assets, including the Exchequer balance, of £37,013,000.  Variations on either side of the account during the year were inconsiderable, the chief movement being a repayment of £1,200,000, made by the Local Loans Fund to the Exchequer, consequent on repayment of earlier advances made by that fund to local authorities. This repayment helped to ease the problem of Exchequer financing during the year.  Further easement was provided by the rise in net subscriptions to Savings Certificates to £790,000 as compared with £515,000 in the previous year.</P>
    <P>To the gross capital liabilities of the State, just mentioned, is to be added £9,447,000, representing the estimated capital value of the State liability for <Col N="2124" /> the Exchequer contributions payable under the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932, towards the annual loan charges of local authorities on account of moneys borrowed for housing.  This brings the total to £92,312,000.</P>
    <P>The gross indebtedness of local authorities on 31st March, 1943, amounted to £37,493,000.  If we allow for the value of State contributions towards housing and for certain electricity and technical instruction loans, the net debt outstanding was £24,069,000, an increase of £1,302,000 on the previous year.</P>
    <P>Assuming an increase of £500,000 in the case of local authorities during last year, the aggregate gross liabilities of the State and local authorities on 31st March, 1944, was £130,305,000, an amount which is offset by the assets referred to.</P>
    <P>I may mention here our liability to depositors in the Post Office Savings Bank and to trustee savings banks, which amounted on 31st March last to £24,562,000.  This figure, which includes £2,435,000 in respect of trustee savings banks, represents an increase of £5,352,000 over the corresponding figure for last year.</P>
    <P>Our total indebtedness in respect of Savings Certificates, inclusive of accrued interest, is estimated as on 31st March, 1944, at £13,300,000, or £1,068,000 in excess of the liability at 31st March, 1943.</P>
    <P>On the 31st March last, there were approximately 505,000 depositors in the Post Office Savings Bank and 31,000 in the trustee savings banks, while the number of Savings Certificate holders was about 236,000.</P>
    <P>Deputies have, no doubt, seen some of our recent special publicity designed to reach those who are not already availing themselves of the facilities afforded by our savings institutions. We are utilising all available advertising media, including the radio, cinema, daily and weekly newspapers and periodicals and notices and posters in public places and buildings.  Apart from my desire to absorb any excess <Col N="2125" /> purchasing power with a view to curbing inflation, it is hoped that, by this means, the formation of habits of thirft, especially amongst the young, may be further developed and intensified.</P>
    <P>We may now turn to the White Paper Estimates of receipts and expenditure for the year ending 31st March, 1945.  As will, of course, be appreciated, an element of conjecture always enters into these Estimates and this year the element is larger than usual.  Hitherto, we have proceeded on the assumption that no major disturbance would arise affecting our economy and this assumption has been abundantly justified.  The recent curtailment of coal and other supplies and of land and sea transport and communications has, however, somewhat obscured the outlook for the next 11 months of the financial year. Both our import and export trades are bound to be severely affected if the additional restrictions continue over all this period, or are intensified.  The home trade, too, is bound to suffer, with consequent curtailment of earnings and profits, leading to reduced receipts from direct and indirect taxes.</P>
    <P>In the case of all dutiable commodities, I am, however, assuming that both supply and consumption will continue at around existing levels and any serious disturbance of this assumption would react unfavourably on the yield of revenue.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that we will be able to retain in operation our reduced, but still serviceable, fleet of merchant vessels.  The total of Irish registered ships lost since the outbreak of war amounts to 30,000 gross registered tons, with 135 lives.  The courage and endurance of our sailors who face many perils deserve our admiration.  They have brought us essential imports in critical times.  We owe it to them and to the other vessels engaged in cross-Channel services that despite all the obstacles in the way of trade, it has been found possible during the past few years to maintain our imports, and, particularly, imports of wheat, on what must, in the circumstances, be regarded as a reasonably satisfactory level, though the shortage of tonnage made it impossible to import adequate quantities of fertilisers and other essential <Col N="2126" /> commodities.  The credit for this satisfactory result must be shared with the various private trading interests concerned and with the emergency companies set up by the Government.</P>
    <P>The last three years have seen the foundations laid of an Irish oceangoing mercantile marine through the formation of Irish Shipping, Limited. The success of this new venture, in face of many difficulties, is a cause of no little pride and is a tribute to the enterprise of the board of the company. These gentlemen who, with commendable public spirit, have refused during the emergency to accept remuneration, have not contented themselves with the ordinary functions of a shipping company but have courageously extended their activities into the field of war risks and marine insurance.  As a result, the country has been saved large sums of money which would, otherwise, have gone abroad; freight and insurance rates have been reduced, thus helping to keep down the cost of living; and the company has established itself as a marine underwriting concern of high standing.  In addition, much-needed employment has been provided in the unloading and servicing of the company's ships and the company has contributed substantial sums in harbour dues to various port authorities, without which they could scarcely have carried on.  As has already been announced, the Government hope that Irish Shipping, Limited, will be able to continue after the war and maintain a modern fleet.</P>
    <P>In saying this, I do not belittle the efforts of the other shipping companies trading to or from this country which were in existence long before the war. The numerous vessels engaged in the coasting and cross-Channel services have performed, and are performing, an invaluable function, as are the three shipping companies which for nearly three years have maintained a service to Iberian ports and so helped to keep up supplies of essential imports.  Apart from this, the latter three companies have co-operated in forming Irish Shipping; they manage its ships and their managing directors are members of its board.  After the war, I hope to see this fruitful co-operation continued <Col N="2127" /> and extended, to the advantage of all concerned.</P>
    <P>On the basis of existing taxation, our estimate of tax revenue receipts into the Exchequer for 1944-45 is £39,050,000, as compared with an actual receipt of £37,168,000 for 1943-44, an increase of £1,882,000.  Customs revenue is expected to rise by £217,000 to £11,605,000, which is very gratifying, especially as it shows a drop under practically all heads except tobacco. The greatest loss is in the sugar group, from which we received £241,000 in 1943-44 but can expect only £140,000 in 1944-45.  The duty on imported sugar is likely to show a decrease owing to lower clearances of sugar imported from the British West Indies in the coming year.  I have already said that I rely on tobacco for a yield of £9,250,000.  As regards oil, the yield of duty in 1943-44 was fairly satisfactory, though considerably below that of previous years.  We hope that imports will be maintained in the current year.</P>
    <P>Our stocks of home-made spirits are ample to meet demands for home consumption and to allow exports slightly under the average of pre-war years. Traders, however, are experiencing difficulty in maintaining supplies and, I am afraid, export smuggling is, to some extent, to blame.  We expect to improve on this position.</P>
    <P>Portuguese brandy has replaced the vanished French variety.  Rum stocks are low and must be used sparingly. Imports of gin have ceased but we are producing here a fair proportion of our requirements.</P>
    <P>Our bonded stocks of wine are good but include considerable quantities which are somewhat inferior in quality to that in normal use here, and may be held as a speculation in the hope that export restrictions will be removed.</P>
    <P>Excise prospects for the coming year have been rated high, the estimated Exchequer receipt, at £8,780,000, being over £750,000 in excess of last year's yield.  Beer, spirits, betting and entertainments will, between them, provide £7,030,000 out of the expected total.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2128" /> The consumption of the former two items has shown rather marked expansion in the last 12 months, after some hesitancy in earlier periods when the effects of the heavy increase in taxation were still being felt.  These effects now seem to have worn off and the consumer has returned to his beverage, if not with zest, at any rate, we hope, with satisfaction.</P>
    <P>The yield of entertainment duty will be affected to some extent by the fact that all of Lent in 1945 will fall within the financial year.  As regards the excise duty on sugar, a substantial rise is expected in view of the considerable increase in home production during the campaign recently closed. This increase is fortunate, because further imported supplies of sugar are not likely to be available during the year.</P>
    <P>Inland revenue prospects for 1944-45 may be gauged from the fact that the estimated Exchequer receipt, at £18,215,000, assumes an improvement of £982,000 on the preceding year.  Income-tax is expected to attain a new record figure of £11,510,000.  An increase in commercial profits generally is being counted on, but this assumption may be seriously upset if the acute trading difficulties which have recently arisen become accentuated or prolonged.  Surtax and supertax, which yielded £612,000 in the year just closed, are expected to be slightly less in the current year at £570,000.  In conformity with the expected upward trend in profits, the yield of corporation profits tax has been put at the high figure of £4,060,000 or £279,000 in excess of the previous year's yield.</P>
    <P>The particulars of non-tax revenue, as set out in the White Paper, show as regards the Post Office an expected improvement in all sections&mdash;postal, telegraph and telephone.  As the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs explained in the course of the recent Dáil debate on his Estimate, the restrictions of communications may have a serious effect on income if continued over a period.  I share his hope that they will be shortlived.</P>
    <P>The land purchase annuities estimated receipt is practically stationary at £1,750,000.  The machinery of the <Col N="2129" /> Guarantee Fund, of course, enables the Exchequer to collect the full amount due annually, but it is regrettable that, even during these recent years of comparative prosperity for agriculture, the amount of arrears outstanding has been only gradually reduced.  Farmers are receiving prices for their products which leave a good margin of net income and those of them who are in debt to public authorities in any way should try to clear the amounts which they owe as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>While there has been a considerable reduction in the arrears of annuities during the emergency, from £1,228,500 on 31st January, 1940, to £664,500 on 31st January, 1944, the reduction would have been much greater if the debtors, in general, had measured their repayments by their increased earnings.  The index number of agricultural prices has increased from an average of 105 in 1939 to 183 in 1943. The guaranteed price for wheat at 55/- a barrel is high enough to justify the cultivation of &ldquo;marginal&rdquo; land and must be quite remunerative for farmers working good wheat-growing land.  Dairy farmers are now receiving 10½d. a gallon for milk in summer and 1/- a gallon in winter for milk supplied to creameries as compared with 5.4d. a gallon in 1939-40, and, though production costs have increased, the current price represents a substantial net gain to those who receive the main part of their income from dairying.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands agrees with me that the present favourable opportunity of bringing their payments up to date must be fully utilised by farmers who are in arrear with their payments to the Land Commission.  They should make every effort, therefore, to clear all arrears during the current year.  As a class, they have got off lightly in the matter of taxation, and this, with the halving of the annuities, leaves them no excuse for non-payment.</P>
    <P>Surplus income from the Central Bank of Ireland is expected to show an increase of £20,000 at £300,000 in the coming year and, amongst other items of non-tax revenue, I propose to take £100,000, as on previous occasions, from the Road Fund.  The annuity <Col N="2130" /> payable to the Exchequer by the fund under the Road Fund (Advances) Act, 1926, has ceased and, as this relieves it of a considerable annual liability, there would, perhaps, be less excuse than ever for omitting our annual foray on the fund.</P>
    <P>On the expenditure side, the main items arise in Supply Services, the details of which are set forth in the volume presented to the Dáil on 10th March last.  The estimated cost of the services is £44,983,000, to which has to be added provision for Supplementary Estimates of £180,000 for the Department of Supplies in respect of wheat subsidy; £34,000 for the Department of Local Government in respect of the provision of cheap footwear, and £33,000 for the Department of Industry and Commerce in respect of mineral development.  The original net provision for Supply Services in 1943-44 was £40,696,000, and, as compared with this figure, the Estimate for the coming year is thus up by £4,500,000.  This substantial rise is spread over practically all Departments of State and is regretted by no one more than by the Minister for Finance.  I have tried to keep the increase within bounds and it will, no doubt, be the subject in each case of detailed discussion and criticism during the debates on the individual Estimates.  Even these figures, considerable as they are, contain no provision for further Supplementary Estimates, and experience has shown that a number of these arise before the end of a financial year.  The increase of that number in recent years will, I trust, disappear with the emergency.</P>
    <P>In my last Budget address, I referred to the great increase in the demands of our social services upon the Exchequer.  With the prolongation of the war, conditions of necessity and hardship upon the poorer classes of our citizens have tended to become more marked, and provision is now being made for supplemental allowances to persons dependent in greater or less degree on old age, blind and widows' and orphans' pensions and on national health disablement benefit who are in straitened circumstances and who are not within <Col N="2131" /> the scope of the scheme of food allowances. So far as certain of these classes are concerned, 25 per cent. of the expenditure involved will be borne by the local authorities, the remaining 75 per cent. falling on the Exchequer. Grants towards the provision of assistance in kind to persons in receipt of home assistance and towards the supply of fuel to necessitous families will continue to be made.</P>
    <P>Owing to the complicated administrative arrangements required in connection with the new scheme of children's allowances, it will not be possible to bring this service into operation until the 1st August next, so that the expenditure, apart from administration, to be provided for in the present year will be £1,500,000.  The cost in a full year is estimated at £2,250,000.</P>
    <P>Bonus concessions to State employees, i.e., civil servants, teachers and Gárdaí, will cost £969,000 in the present year as against £635,000 last year.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer burden in respect of food and fuel subsidies is estimated at £3,176,000.  The cost last year was about £2,564,000.</P>
    <P>In all, the special provisions in the various State services to meet the increase in the cost of living may conservatively be put this year at over £7,000,000.  This figure does not include the cost of children's allowances, which is meant to be a permanent social service.  I think it may fairly be claimed, therefore, that we are making every effort, even to the extent of straining our means, to mitigate the effects of the emergency upon our citizens.</P>
    <P>While employment is plentiful in agriculture, the problem of providing and stimulating industrial employment in the difficult circumstances created by the ever increasing shortage of supplies continues to be a source of concern to the Government.  As I mentioned last year, a big effort is being made to develop the native resources of the country and to turn to account their employment possibilities. In connection with the production <Col N="2132" /> of turf alone, an expenditure of not less than £970,000 is being provided for this year.  In view of the steadily deteriorating position in regard to imports of fuel, it is believed that this expenditure will prove to be of a most fruitful kind.</P>
    <P>It is probable that no industry in the country has been more severely hit by the war than the building trade, which, in normal times, provides such widespread employment, and I can only say that the Government has made provision for all State works which it is anticipated can be carried through, having regard to the supplies position. The provision for new construction in the Vote for public works and buildings at £850,000 represents an increase of £270,000 over last year's figure.  The increased provision is almost entirely due to works at the Shannon airport. It is clear that the complete development of this airport, on which much money has already been spent, will be extremely costly, but it must be realised that the airport has to be established and equipped on modern lines if it is to attain, after the war, the importance as a centre of international civil aviation for which we hope.</P>
    <P>No substantial provision will be necessary in the present year for arterial drainage, but the Government's intentions with regard to a comprehensive scheme for the whole country have been made clear, and I need not enlarge on them.  A start has already been made, pending the enactment of the necessary legislation, by the establishment of river discharge and rainfall gauges throughout the country, an essential to the initiation of any comprehensive scheme, and by the carrying out of certain surveys.  It is not yet possible to estimate what rate of progress can be hoped for, as much will depend upon the availability of machinery and the speed at which surveys can be completed.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned just now, provision is being made in the Budget for expenditure of £33,000 on mineral development supplementary to the £21,800 already included in the Estimate for Industry and Commerce.  The company specially set up under legislation in <Col N="2133" /> 1941 to prospect for, and develop, minerals, other than coal, has concentrated on the production of phosphates in County Clare and pyrites at Avoca, and has provided a useful supplement to our limited supplies of superphosphates. The company will receive advances of £50,000 in the current year, and, probably, also prospecting grants, to continue and expand the production of these minerals.  Full provision would have been made in the original Estimate were it not that the statutory limit on advances to the company would thereby be exceeded.  Legislation will, however, shortly be introduced to authorise additional advances beyond the existing limit of £160,000 and to merge with this company the company which was set up at the same time to develop our coal deposits. Authority will be sought for extending the limit of advances to the combined companies to £400,000, which is expected to cover their requirements up to the end of 1945-46.</P>
    <P>It is hardly necessary for me to say that the Government are alive to the difficulties with which the country is likely to be faced in regard to employment in the post-emergency period, when the demobilisation of the Defence Forces and the return of men and women who have been employed outside the State is likely to raise many problems.  A Special Committee of the Cabinet has for some time past been engaged, in consultation with the Government Departments concerned, in the examination of schemes calculated to provide employment on a wide basis for both urban and rural workers.  Apart altogether from considerations of employment, the war years have had the result of creating substantial arrears of maintenance which will have to be overtaken on public works of all kinds, and also of hindering the development of services of national importance.  I need hardly enlarge, for example, upon what yet remains to be done before housing requirements throughout the country as a whole can be regarded as adequately met.  It will, perhaps, be sufficient to say in this regard that increased activities on the part of local authorities <Col N="2134" /> under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts and the Labourers Acts, with consequential heavy demands on the Exchequer for housing grants and contributions to loan charges, must be expected.</P>
    <P>It is clear also that national school accommodation of a proper standard is lacking in some places, and as soon as circumstances permit a scheme for the improvement or replacement of existing schools which are unsatisfactory, either as regards adequacy of accommodation or otherwise, will be put in hand, provided sufficient local assistance is forthcoming.</P>
    <P>Afforestation is another service to which the Government have devoted considerable attention.  I am aware that the view has sometimes been held that progress in this direction has been too slow, and that the service has been cramped by lack of funds, but I am afraid that criticism of this kind has been based to some extent on the belief that the development of forestry is merely a matter of planting more trees. The planting of trees, either for scenic reasons or for shelter belts, is, of course, always to be recommended, and is not too difficult a matter, but economic afforestation&mdash;and afforestation on a national scale must be relatively economic if it is to be justified&mdash; involves problems of which critics of our rate of progress are not always aware.  It is not enough, for example, that land in a particular district should be available.  Not only must land be suitable for planting, but it must be available in sufficient area to permit of the establishment of an economic unit, and it must be available at a reasonable price.  From the point of view of a sound national afforestation policy, the formation of plantations in an indiscriminate way might be little more than a waste of the taxpayers' money. I only mention these points to indicate that, if progress on this important national service has seemed slow, this has not been due to any disinclination on the part of the Government to make money available.  The effect of the emergency has been particularly marked on normal forestry development operations, as, in addition to any difficulties which may exist in regard to the acquisition of land, fencing <Col N="2135" /> materials, tools, seed and plants have been in short supply.  At the instance of the Government, however, steps are being taken by the creation of nursery stocks and the building up of supplies of seed, and by such other measures as are in present circumstances feasible, to secure that the annual programme will proceed to be expanded to the maximum as rapidly as possible after the emergency.</P>
    <P>The development of the tourist industry will, it may properly be anticipated, afford scope for increased activity which will have a social as well as an economic value.  Here, again, the Government are encouraging, by the grant of financial assistance, the promotion of suitable schemes for the improvement in particular of the amenities of our holiday resorts.  It will, of course, be realised that something more than Government help is necessary to make a tourist centre everything it ought to be, but I have no doubt that local effort and co-operation will be forthcoming in full measure as circumstances may require.</P>
    <P>Neither last year nor the year before was the Central Fund called upon to make any advance to the Electricity Supply Board.  In so far as new capital expenditure is being financed temporarily out of the board's own reserves, there is only a postponement of recourse to the Central Fund, but the basic position since 1941 is that development has been severely limited by emergency conditions.  Lack of equipment has held up the commencement of generation from the Liffey.  Increasing fuel difficulties, aggravated by water scarcity in the Shannon, have prevented the full utilisation of existing capacity.  Industrial and domestic consumption has had to be severely curtailed.  A wide and varied programme of development will be initiated as soon as equipment becomes available after the war.  The plans are already prepared, and authorising legislation will shortly be introduced.</P>
    <P>In the first place, it will be necessary to provide for a considerable expansion of demand within the area already served by the board's network.  For <Col N="2136" /> several years before the emergency, the &ldquo;natural increase&rdquo; in demand for current was of the order of 31,000,000 units per annum.  From a total of 43,000,000 units in 1929-30, consumption had risen to 357,000,000 units in 1941-42. In 1942-43, however, consumption had, perforce, to be held down at the level of 1940-41.  But the restrictions on the use of electricity and on the connection of new consumers are creating a reservoir of demand which will, eventually, be released to swell the normal annual increase.  The board consider it wise to provide for an upward surge which will bring total consumption to the level of 800,000,000 units within ten years of the end of the emergency.</P>
    <P>To meet this rise in demand, additional generating plant will be required. The calls on the system were such that, had conditions permitted, generating capacity would have been augmented already, not only by the bringing into service of the Liffey works but also by the construction of a turf-burning station at Clonsast, for which financial provision was made in the 1941 legislation. These projects will be speedily brought to completion as soon as the necessary machinery and equipment can be secured.  But the 30,000,000 units which the Liffey will yield, even when supplemented by the 90,000,000 to be provided by Clonsast, will go only a small way towards meeting anticipated post-war needs.  Some new stations of greater capacity will be required, including further hydro-electric developments, estimated before the war to cost £3,000,000, which would, if carried out, increase capacity by 200,000,000 units.  These works and others incidental to normal development will entail advances from the Central Fund which may amount to £7,500,000 within a few years from the end of the emergency.</P>
    <P>The plans for early execution by the board in the post-war period do not stop there.  The Government have approved a comprehensive scheme for the extension of electrical services to the rural community, generally.  Not only will electricity bring to rural dwellers the benefits of good lighting in homes and outbuildings and the amenities of domestic appliances, radio, <Col N="2137" /> etc., but it will also take much of the drudgery out of farm life by providing motive power in the farmyard for such purposes as driving threshing and milking machines, pumping water, grinding corn, etc.  Rural life should become more attractive and farmers will, moreover, be enabled to secure that reduction in costs which is so essential if our agricultural produce is to meet successfully the competition to which it will be exposed in export markets after the war.</P>
    <P>The financial aspects of rural electrification are important.  At pre-war prices, the capital cost has been estimated at £20,000,000.  Approximately half the rural community could be connected on a basis which would yield an economic return but, in order to extend the supply even further, the Government propose to provide a subsidy.  This commitment is expected to involve the provision by the Exchequer of up to 50 per cent. of the total cost of the scheme (i.e., of as much ultimately as £10,000,000) free of any conditions as to interest or repayment.  The remainder of the cost will be financed by the ordinary method of advances.</P>
    <P>There is thus in view, in the post-war period, the provision by the Exchequer of a total of some £27,500,000 for the Electricity Supply Board, of which up to £10,000,000 will represent a subsidy to rural electrification, costing the taxpayer, even on a 3 per cent. basis, about £500,000 a year for a period of more than 30 years. Already, since the inauguration of the Shannon scheme, the Exchequer has advanced £13.6 million towards electricity development.</P>
    <P>The foregoing services indicate the wide scope of the Government plans for post-war development, and I do not propose to dwell further on this subject beyond saying that, in addition to such schemes, it may be taken that building and constructional projects of many kinds&mdash;in relation, for instance, to hospitals and public health services&mdash;the initiation of which has had to be deferred, will be prosecuted with vigour.  All these schemes will be costly and the extent to which they can be adopted will, of course, depend on the rate of easement which is to be <Col N="2138" /> hoped for in the supplies position, but it is the Government's intention to take all such measures as may be found practicable to promote them or to encourage their promotion during what will probably be a difficult transitional period.</P>
    <P>At this stage, I may say that all the foregoing programme is based on certain assumptions, namely, that the cost of Defence Services will, after the war, be very radically reduced and that emergency services, such as food and fuel allowances and subsidies, will practically disappear.  The country cannot carry the double burden of emergency services and post-war development, and I would not be doing my duty as Finance Minister if I did not declare that such twin burdens would be insupportable.  Our existing debt is of large proportions and its annual service absorbs more than £4,000,000.  Further borrowing inescapably means further taxation and, unless our burdens lighten, as I have indicated, in other directions, our contemplated post-war developments must be substantially curtailed.</P>
    <P>It is no light thing to have embarked at this stage on a most extensive and costly scheme of family allowances, with a permanent addition to the annual burden of taxation of £2,250,000. Many thought, and still think, that such an ambitious scheme should have been held over until our future economic position had become clearer after the war.</P>
    <P>Last year I referred to the increase in the numbers and cost of the Civil Service between January, 1939, and January, 1942.  Census returns for January, 1943, reveal, as I anticipated, a further considerable rise.  During the year to January, 1943, the number of established and unestablished personnel increased by 905.  As compared with January, 1939, there was an increase of 2,306.  The rise in all-in costs as between 1942 and 1943 amounted to £310,000, and between 1939 and 1943 to £967,000.  The all-in cost of the Service as at 1st January, 1943, was at the rate of £6,866,000 a year.  This expansion is sufficient to be in itself, and still more in its implication, a cause of uneasiness.  The growth of the Civil Service since 1939 is largely due <Col N="2139" /> to emergency conditions but, unless the trend of public opinion and of public policy is reversed, there cannot be that considerable retrenchment which we should expect when the emergency ends.</P>
    <P>Though I spoke on the growth of the Civil Service a year ago, I make no apology for referring to it again today, because I regard it as a matter in which members of Dáil Eireann have a responsibility as well as a duty. First let me stress the truth, which, though axiomatic, seems often to be overlooked, that increased State activity is bound to produce an increase in the organisation through which the State directs its activities, that is, in the Civil Service.  I wish Deputies would realise this when they are tempted to press the Government to establish a new service or expand an old one.  He who wills the end wills the means: if it is our will to go on expanding the area of State action, then, if we are logical, we must admit our responsibility for the consequent expansion in the Civil Service.  We are not behaving reasonably or honestly if we clamour for the action and complain of the consequences.</P>
    <P>I must confess that it is the expansion of State activity itself rather than the effect of that expansion on the numbers and cost of the Civil Service that causes me greater concern. Though none of us consciously desires it, we are, as I said last year, drifting steadily towards the all-powerful State.  In modern conditions, it is difficult to avoid this drift, and there are spheres which at one time Governments never thought of entering but which, for one reason or another, they have felt called upon to enter and make their own.  Still, there are limits to this process which the State cannot go beyond without injury to the common good.  It must respect the rights of its citizens; it must avoid courses of action which tend to destroy or seriously lessen incentives to the legitimate enterprise of individuals and groups, and it ought not to assume functions which, granted reasonable initiative, industry and co-operation, its citizens could perform with equal or greater efficiency for themselves.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2140" /> Judged by these standards, how does our State stand?  It has respected the fundamental rights of citizens and, in this regard, bears comparison with any State in the world.  On the other hand, I feel that an impartial examination of State policy leads to the conclusion that some things are being done which tend unduly to lessen incentives to enterprise and that the State has in several matters taken upon itself functions which had better be left to the individual or co-operative action of citizens.  It would not be fair to conclude that successive Irish Governments have been avid for power; their fault has been rather that, often in response to the pressure of public opinion, they were too ready to assume that the common good required the intervention of the State.  The intervention has often brought some direct benefit to the community, or an important section of it, but, on reflection, it seems to me that the benefit has in too many instances been bought at the expense of some degree of demoralisation. As a result, we are on the whole, I fear, a less self-reliant people than we were a quarter of a century ago.</P>
    <P>I recognise that this phenomenon is not peculiar to Ireland.  The encroachment of government on the sphere of the individual or, to put it in another way, the abdication of the human person in favour of the State, has gone much farther in some countries and has involved the forfeiture of essential human rights.  But, if we are on the same road, there is not much comfort in the thought that we have not travelled as far on it as others.  That we have travelled dangerously far is made clear by many signs.  For example, we require an army of State officials and police to induce or compel various classes of citizens to act in accordance with their own and the public interest in such obvious matters as respect for public property, tillage and weeding of land, sale of food in hygienic conditions, proper grading and packing of produce, etc.  The same lack of public spirit and even of active self-interest leaves entirely to the State such tasks as the enforcement of Orders against profiteering and black markets. Another symptom of the evil is the limited extent of agricultural co-operation <Col N="2141" /> and the almost complete absence of a co-operative movement in the towns.  No considerable class in the community is free from this tendency to look to the State to do for it what, without question, it could and ought to do for itself in my opinion.</P>
    <P>In all this we are tolerating and even promoting a state of things in which real freedom can never be secure and ultimately cannot survive.  It is futile to expect that our democratic institutions can save us if we continue on this road: the forms of democracy can coexist with the reality of servitude; they can even be used to promote servitude. I wonder whether in this country we do not sometimes unthinkingly use them so; for instance, when we encourage the people, as I fear we all have at some time or other done, to rely on the State more than on their own efforts. We must try to change all this, and the members of this House can do more, perhaps, than any other body of men to change it by preaching self-reliance, turning the people's thoughts from what the State might do for them to what they can do for themselves, insisting on the truth that only a self-reliant and enterprising people can be truly a free people.</P>
    <P>Deputies will not, I hope, think that these matters are inappropriate in a Budget speech.  They have important implications from the standpoint of economics and of State finance.  The expenditure for which I have to make provision is inflated in consequence of the undue dependence on State action of which I have spoken, and our whole economic future may be imperilled by the relative absence among us of the spirit of self-reliance and co-operation. Within a few years after the war is ended, our agricultural and manufacturing industries will have to meet more intense competition than ever before from countries which, under the pressure of war-time needs, have immensely expanded their productive capacity.  That will be a critical period for us, more critical in essence than these years of war in some ways, and to get through safely we shall need drastically to reduce our expenditure and to apply ourselves with intelligence and enthusiasm to our various tasks.  Above all, as a country of small <Col N="2142" /> holdings, we shall have to recognise the vital need of co-operation in the widest sense of the term in our agriculture. Our chief competitors will be countries where the average farmer has what we would regard as a large tract of land.  They enjoy to an extent to which we cannot attain the advantages of mechanised farming.  If we are to hold our own against them, we shall require to combine a skill at least equal to theirs, and the careful and tireless industry which is the characteristic virtue of the good farmer with the thorough co-operation which can in some measure off-set the disadvantages of small scale production.</P>
    <P>Reverting to our survey of the 1944-45 finances, the Supply Services contain, as in former years, provision for capital and abnormal expenditure usually met by borrowing.  All the items of this character are set out in the Table Explanatory of the Budget, and include £394,000 in respect of various capital works and equipment for the Army.  An expenditure in the coming year of £542,000 which is contemplated on airports covers the acquisition of land, the erection of buildings and the provision of meteorological equipment, all on a large scale.  It is proposed to borrow £319,000 of this sum.  Of the £96,000 devoted to the acquisition of land and cultural operations for forestry, it is proposed to borrow £43,000, and in regard to employment and emergency schemes which were combined a year ago in a single Vote I am borrowing one-fourth of £1,250,000.</P>
    <P>The total of these capital items comes to £1,069,000, which has to be deducted in the usual way from the aggregate figure of Supply Services (including the three Supplementary Estimates already referred to totalling £247,000) to determine the amount chargeable against the Budget.  The resultant figure is £44,161,000, to which we have to add £4,994,000 for Central Fund Services, making a total of £49,155,000.</P>
    <P>To meet this national bill we have the proceeds of tax revenue estimated at £39,050,000 and of non-tax revenue estimated at £6,585,000.  These figures, which are given in the White Paper, <Col N="2143" /> are prepared on the basis of existing rates of tax and charge.  The total revenue thus comes to £45,635,000 or £3,520,000 less than the estimated expenditure chargeable against the Budget.  I do not consider it feasible in the existing circumstances to bridge this gap by additional taxation. Existing imposts are heavy.  There is not, so far as I am aware, any new source of revenue waiting to be tapped that would provide the Exchequer with a substantial amount of fresh income. A purchase tax would add appreciably to the already high cost of living.  A bicycle tax would be most unwelcome to large sections of the community, though it might have a security aspect which would compensate for the financial loss.  The year has been singularly barren of other suggestions for taxation.  Shops have been mentioned to me and auctioneers are described as tax-worthy, but the difficult times ahead make me loath to add to existing burdens.  We have not here conditions of growing national income and full employment such as obtain in the United Kingdom, and, due to an appreciable extent to causes outside our control, we are burdened with a higher cost of living.  Our economic difficulties are becoming more acute.  The lack of raw materials, fuels, chemical and other products, machinery and machine parts is more pronounced now than ever.  It will take the combined efforts of all sections of the community to avoid economic dislocation on a large scale and a fresh dose of taxation is not the type of lubricant desired for such a situation.</P>
    <P>The House, as well as the country, will, I hope, be relieved to hear that no fresh impositions are to be proposed to-day.  There are, however, certain adjustments in regard to income-tax and corporation profits tax which I am submitting to the Committee.</P>
    <P>The passing of the Children's Allowances Act, 1944, necessitates an alteration in the scheme of deduction in repect of children granted by the Income Tax Acts.  Very broadly, the position is that, under the Children's Allowances <Col N="2144" /> Act, a parent gets an allowance of 2/6 a week in respect of each of his children under the age of 16 in excess of two.  At present, the income-tax deduction granted to the parent in computing his taxable income is £60 for each eligible child under the age of 16.  It is proposed, accordingly, to reduce the deduction for each such child in excess of two from £60 to £40.  In the current year, however, since allowances under the Children's Allowances Act will be payable as from 1st August only, the reduction will be from £60 to £47. The allowances payable under the Children's Allowances Act will not be reckoned in computing the income of the parent for the purpose of assessment to income-tax.  A resolution to give effect to these proposals will be submitted to the Committee to-day. It is estimated that the gain in the yield of income-tax will be about £45,000 in the current year and from £90,000 to £100,000 in future years.</P>
    <P>A provision of the Income Tax Act of 1918 has been interpreted in the British courts as having the effect of enabling the lessee of leased machinery to claim the usual allowance for wear and tear of such machinery in cases in which the burden of the wear and tear does not fall on him but is, in fact, borne by the lessor.  Having regard to the manner in which the relevant section is phrased, our courts would probably feel obliged to adopt a similar view of its effect.  The British Parliament has legislated to remove the anomaly.  I propose to do the same, and a Financial Resolution on the subject will be submitted to the Committee.</P>
    <P>In the Finance Act of 1942, authority was given to the Revenue Commissioners by Section 3 to grant special allowances to concerns which erected buildings or installed plant or machinery for production during the emergency of commodities which, prior to the emergency, were not produced commercially within the State, the reason being that such buildings and plant might be of very little value when normal conditions are restored. The section as it stands has proved to be too narrow.  For example, commodities <Col N="2145" /> which were produced commercially within the State in the past may now be produced by plant of a type the use of which might not be commercially possible in normal times; or a shipping company may purchase for the importation of goods which are urgently needed a vessel which, at the end of the war, may have little more than scrap value.  The Finance Bill will include a clause to extend the powers of the Revenue Commissioners so as to enable them to make reasonable allowances in cases of the type to which I have referred.  The clause will have effect for income-tax purposes as from 1939-40, inclusive, and will consequently apply to all corporation profits tax (including excess corporation profits tax) periods as from the beginning of the emergency.</P>
    <P>Section 22 of the Finance Act, 1920, enables an individual who, by reason of old age or infirmity, is compelled to rely on the services of a daughter whom he maintains, to claim a deduction of £25 in computing for income-tax purposes the amount of his taxable income.  It has been brought to my notice that in certain types of infirmity the services of a son rather than a daughter are needed, and I propose to include in the Finance Bill a clause to extend the scope of the existing section accordingly.</P>
    <P>There will be some other provisions relating to the income-tax but as they are mainly of a technical character and do not involve any alterations in existing practice, they are not matters of general interest and I need not refer to them at the moment.</P>
    <P>I feel obliged to take steps to counter certain devices which some companies are adopting to reduce the amount of their profits chargeable to excess corporation profits tax.  One device which is becoming common in the case of family and director-controlled companies, i.e., companies in which the directors hold more than 50 per cent. of the shares carrying voting rights, is to increase the number of directors and also to increase the directors' remuneration. For example, in a family concern a man will arrange to have his wife and daughter appointed <Col N="2146" /> directors at salaries of anything up to £1,000 a year each.  There has been one case in which six directors were in receipt of an aggregate of about £600 per annum in the standard period and, following a resolution passed in November, 1941, their aggregate remuneration was increased to £6,000 per annum as from December, 1940, although there is no suggestion that there has been any appreciable increase in the directors' duties.</P>
    <P>Another device which is being adopted on a considerable scale is to form new companies, with a nominal capital, to take over parts of an existing business.  For example, a company, which already has a substantial standard, forms one, two or three new companies with a capital of anything from £100 upwards.  All the shares of the new companies are held either by the parent company or by the directors of the parent company (itself a director-controlled company).  Parts of the existing business are transferred to the new companies, each of which is then entitled, though the capital in each of them is trivial, to the minimum standard of £2,500.</P>
    <P>One more device which has recently been brought to my notice is something like this: A company has an issued capital of, say, £25,000.  It goes into liquidation, and the liquidator sells the business to a new company for, say, £80,000.  The business remains exactly the same, the proprietorship remains exactly the same, and the purchase consideration consists wholly of shares in the new company, no fresh capital whatever being introduced.  The new company, nevertheless, claims a standard of 10½ per cent. on the figure of £80,000 capital.  It is not clear that a claim in this type of case will succeed under the existing law, but I consider it necessary to legislate to safeguard the position, because, if the device were to succeed, it might be resorted to widely.</P>
    <P>Resolutions will be submitted to the Committee to-day to enable legislation to be introduced to counter these devices.  The legislation will necessarily be complicated and difficult; but I shall not shrink either now or in the <Col N="2147" /> future from asking the Dáil to confer on the Revenue authorities the necessary powers to enable them to ensure that full effect is given to the intentions of the Legislature with regard to the taxation of excess profits arising from the emergency with which the country is faced.</P>
    <P>Of the adjustments proposed to-day, the only one with an appreciable effect on the revenue is that relating to income-tax deductions in respect of children, which gives us an additional £45,000 in the current year.  This will be supplemented by the sum of £100,000 which I already mentioned, as coming from the Road Fund.  These additions result in the lowering of the estimated deficit for the year 1944-45 to £3,375,000.</P>
    <P>It may be objected that we are increasing expenditure without any serious increase in taxation.  This is exactly what is happening, and it should please the expansionists if it does not satisfy anyone else.  In recent years, however, we have been blessed with revenue yields far in excess of anticipations, and these have helped to reduce borrowings much below anticipated levels.  Even if things do not work out that way in the current year, I think our financial structure is capable of bearing the strain. Not that I wish to see inaugurated here a policy of deficit economy which finds favour in some quarters.</P>
    <P>As the figures which I quoted earlier show, we have had some sizeable deficits in the past, and they have contributed their part to the undesirable process of inflation that has been going on.  Before referring to this matter in greater detail, however, I wish to dispose of items relating to the Budget by mentioning the contingent liability about to be undertaken this year by the Exchequer under the provisions of the Transport Bill which is at present before Dáil Eireann.  Under that Bill, as Deputies are aware, it is proposed that the Minister for Finance shall give a guarantee in respect of redeemable debenture stock to be issued by the new transport company up to a maximum amount of £16,000,000.  The guarantee will extend to both principal and <Col N="2148" /> interest.  The amount of debenture stock to be issued by the new company for the purpose of exchange for stock of the Great Southern Railways Company and of the Dublin United Transport Company will be £9,875,556, bearing interest at 3 per cent. per annum in accordance with the specific provisions of the Bill.  The stock will be redeemable not earlier than the 30th June, 1955, nor later than the 30th June, 1960, and, under the guarantee, the State assumes contingent obligations in respect of the capital sums due on redemption and also in respect of each of the half-yearly interest payments, amounting to £148,133.</P>
    <P>In addition to the issue of this 3 per cent. debenture stock to stockholders in the dissolved companies, the company will have power, subject to Ministerial sanction, to issue for its general purposes debenture stock up to a total of £6,124,444 which will bear a rate of interest, not exceeding 3 per cent. per annum, to be approved by the Minister for Finance and, so far as the company exercises this power, the debenture stock will be guaranteed by the State as to both principal and interest.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the Oireachtas shall have full information in regard to the giving of such guarantees in respect of debenture stock issued by the new transport undertaking, and the Bill contains provisions for the laying of detailed annual statements before both Houses.  Moreover, in the event of its becoming necessary to provide public moneys in fulfilment of the guarantee, and if the company does not repay the moneys so advanced within 12 months, it will be necessary for the Minister for Finance to introduce a Vote in the Dáil for the amount in question so that the matter can receive full discussion.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the Bill, the new company is obliged to maintain a fund for the redemption of its guaranteed debenture stock and it is hoped that the company will be able to make substantial allocations to this fund not only out of surplus net revenue but also out of the proceeds of the disposal from time to time of any of the capital assets of the undertaking.  I should also like <Col N="2149" /> to make it clear that, in the event of the State being called upon to fulfil its guarantee, any sum so provided shall be by way of an advance made to the company, which shall be responsible for the repayment of this debt to the Exchequer in accordance with terms to be arranged by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The giving of this guarantee, which has become necessary for the protection and development of an essential undertaking, is one of the most important single financial transactions that has taken place in the history of the State.  No Minister for Finance can assume without misgiving such a heavy liability&mdash;however contingent it may be and however hopeful he is of the prospects of rail and road transport in this country.  In the present circumstances, when the impact of emergency conditions on transport is more severe than ever and may, indeed, grow worse, no Minister in my place can be free from anxiety that the Exchequer may be in the shadow of coming obligations arising from this guarantee.  That is a possibility which must not be forgotten in any preview of public expenditure during the financial years that lie immediately ahead.</P>
    <P>In order that Deputies may understand the relative importance of the addition to the contingent liabilities of the State involved in the issue of debenture stock by the new Transport Bill, I should mention that, at the 31st March last, the total amount of guarantees secured by the Central Fund were somewhat more than £51,000,000. Included in that figure is a sum of over £15,000,000 in respect of land bonds of all series issued for State contributions and the Costs Fund, the service of which is provided from annual Votes and might thus properly be included in the direct public debt.  On that basis, the total contingent liabilities arising out of guarantees given by the State are at present of the order of £36,000,000.  If the full amount of guaranteed debenture stock authorised by the new Bill, viz., £16,000,000, is issued by the company, it will represent an increase of 44 per cent in the total contingent liabilities of the State. Both absolutely and relatively, this transaction is, obviously, one of outstanding importance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2150" /> This measure of assistance will, I hope, help to provide cheap and efficient transport service for the public. Such service is particularly essential to agriculture, beset, as the latter is, with many problems, present and future.  It is anomalous that, even in the middle of a war boom, we are still paying heavy subsidies to help the industry. Increased output per acre and per unit of labour is needed to overcome existing handicaps and to improve the low return on capital.  For this purpose, more and better machinery and equipment, more fertilisers and, generally, a more intensive use of the natural or induced fertility of the soil is desired. On the dairying side, improvement in milk yields is long overdue and, to this end, the avoidable losses caused by retention of poor milkers in herds, inadequate winter feeding and by disease of one kind or other must be eliminated.  This will require the provision of cheaper and wider veterinary services which would also be at the disposal of those who raise horses, pigs, poultry, etc.  We may anticipate in the period immediately after the war opportunities of expanding our markets, temporarily at any rate.  There is, certainly, going to be a great shortage of foodstuffs, seeds and live stock in Europe for several years after the end of hostilities.  Any special types of production for which we are naturally fitted should be developed on efficient lines if we are to take full advantage of the situation then offering, and if we are to contribute our share to the rebuilding of Europe.  Agricultural education must play its part in fostering our development as well as research work into animal and plant diseases. The investment of capital in land must be encouraged and for this purpose agricultural credit must be available.</P>
    <P>This expansionist programme is already involving some increased charges on the Exchequer and will, in future, involve more, but I am prepared to take on the burden in the belief that, given a full measure of cooperation from the many interests concerned, it will turn out ultimately to the national benefit.  The main service, however, that the Government can render to agriculture is to remove the obstacles, whatever they are, in the <Col N="2151" /> way of good farming.  After that, the issue depends on the energy of the farmer.  Industries which provided the instruments of production for the farmer will have to do so more efficiently and more cheaply in the post-war period and so relieve agriculture of the burden of additional costs which had to be borne when they were still in the early stages.</P>
    <P>Agriculture has generally accounted for about 80 per cent. of our total exports. On these exports our strong creditor position has been built up and on their continuance at a high level we must remain dependent for the paying for the vast quantities of essential imports that will be required in the post-war period.  Overhead charges and other costs of agricultural production must, accordingly, be kept as low as possible.  We must also change our somewhat urban outlook and not seek to pile up too many of the amenities and luxuries in the towns, to the detriment, and sometimes at the expense of, the rural dweller.  By making the towns too attractive and neglecting the country or adding to its financial burdens we can ony hasten rural depopulation. The electricity scheme to which I have referred will help to redress the balance in favour of the countryside to some extent.  But the foundations of a sound rural economy in this country are a skilled body of farmers and farm workers, well-equipped farms, enlightened methods of marketing and the development of co-operative principles and practice.  Without these we cannot permanently improve our position in external markets or even hold what we have in the face of competition from countries whose agricultural efficiency has improved under the impact of war conditions.</P>
    <P>As regards the general monetary situation, I spoke at some length on this occasion a year ago about various aspects of the problem of inflation and of the policy that was necessary to restrict this evil to the narrowest compass compatible with the necessities of our situation in the difficult conditions imposed by war.  It is inevitable that, during a world-wide conflict, the pressure of inflationary forces should become <Col N="2152" /> steadily more acute according as the duration of the war is extended and I can only note with regret that, in spite of our constant efforts to hold inflation in check, we have had to witness during the past year a further deterioration of our position in this respect.  The total monetary circulation of the country in the form of notes and coin was 79 per cent. above pre-war at the end of March, 1943, and had increased to 104 per cent. above pre-war at the end of March, 1944.  The actual increase during the past year was, however, slightly less than in the year to March, 1943.  The rise in bank deposits has, throughout the war, been on a more moderate scale, the amount having been 38 per cent. above pre-war for the March quarter of 1943 and 55 per cent. above pre-war for the March quarter of 1944.</P>
    <P>The expansion in the aggregate volume of money is not, however, our major problem in this connection. There is reason to believe that it has been offset in part by a diminution in the velocity of circulation.  Bank debits, for example, for 1943 show only the moderate increase of 23 per cent. above 1939.  A substantial fraction of the note issue is, probably, not in effective circulation but is lying idle as a means of conserving savings.  It would be very much in the public interest, and wiser from the standpoint of the individuals concerned, if they refrained from the practice of hoarding notes and put their savings into the banks or the Post Office.</P>
    <P>In general, it seems that such increase as has occurred in the supply of money has been rather an effect than a cause of inflationary forces. The active factor in inflation has been the upward movement of prices.  The rise of agricultural prices, in particular, was at a marked rate from the early stages of the war.  During the past year, the agricultural price index has again shown a strong forward movement, having advanced from 78 per cent. above pre-war at March, 1943, to 100 per cent. above pre-war at the most recent available date.  A year ago, the cost of living index was 58 per cent. above pre-war; to-day that figure has advanced to 71 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2153" /> The pressure of these increasing costs on the community has made it necessary, through the machinery of the tribunals established for that purpose, to allow emergency bonuses of limited extent to those sections of the workers who could least afford to meet the growing subsistence charges.  In creases in the wages of agricultural workers have also been granted by the Agricultural Wages Board for the same reason.</P>
    <P>The Stock Exchange is another sphere in which the influence of inflationary forces has been somewhat in evidence.  The security prices index published in the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i> shows an advance of 24 per cent. at March, 1944, above August, 1939, for ordinary stocks and shares.</P>
    <P>The trends indicated by the figures I have given are the result of a great complex of factors for which, apart from external forces outside our control, responsibility is shared in varying degrees between different elements in the community.  In its machinery for price regulation and profit and wage restriction, the Government has taken important action to combat inflation and, in doing so, has often been obliged to incur some unpopularity with limited sections through its determination to promote the general good. The results I have mentioned show that, if it has erred at all, the Government has erred by taking measures milder than could have been justified by the situation.</P>
    <P>No State measures, however, according to our conception of society, can suffice to preserve a healthy situation without the continued, whole-hearted co-operation of citizens and organisations in ensuring within their own spheres that the sacrifices necessarily entailed by the war are borne with due patience and that demands are not pressed to an unreasonable degree for higher prices and wages which could only have the effect of aggravating the national difficulties.  In determining the policy of the present time, we should keep in mind the problems that will, assuredly, confront us at the termination of the war.  We cannot hope <Col N="2154" /> to find these problems susceptible in all respects of our own domestic control, but it is for that reason all the more important that, where the discretion rests with us, we should prepare now for confronting the post-war difficulties rather by preventing the further spread of inflation than by choosing the momentarily easy course of yielding to it with the certain prospect of having to submit to painful consequences hereafter.</P>
    <P>The rise in prices of commodities of our own production has now advanced to such a degree that it is imperative to resist by every legitimate means in our power any further continuance of this movement.  The level already attained, being almost double that of pre-war, can only be prejudicial to the outlook for post-war export trade.</P>
    <P>There is an equal need for safeguarding our position by maintaining a rigid check on increases of remuneration. It is a common error to view this matter in the light of reports of current high earnings of labour in Great Britain.  It is not sufficiently understood that increases in British wage rates during the war have been very much more moderate than increases in British earnings.  The aggregate earnings, unlike the wage rates, reflect the results of piece-work and of long periods of overtime, with consequent high output of goods.  The increases obtained in this country have been almost entirely under the serious head of wage rates and are not in general associated with higher output. This is a consideration which cannot be too strongly stressed.  If we can succeed in maintaining a reasonable stability in these matters for the remainder of the war period, we shall, in that way, make the most effective contribution in our power for adjusting ourselves to the requirements of the post-war international situation.</P>
    <P>Some progress is, apparently, being made abroad towards a measure of agreement on the future operation of international monetary exchanges, but it is, as yet, too early to conjecture what its significance may be from the standpoint of the interests of this country.  Our large stake in external <Col N="2155" /> trade gives us material reason for hoping that successful means will be found for ensuring the smooth working in the future of the world's principal exchanges.</P>
    <P>In the meantime we can best promote that result and assist our own satisfactory relationship with the external agencies concerned by refusing to allow the temporary exigencies of wartime to cause avoidable derangement of our price and wage structure and by thus facilitating our eventual resumption of international trade relations on a favourable currency basis.</P>
    <P>I have told you something of our plans for the future and, at the same time, I have uttered what I consider a timely and necessary note of warning. In conclusion, it may not be out of place to refer to the fact that, during its term of office, the Government has been acting as well as planning. Since 1932, a total of nearly 85,000 new houses has been built, with the aid of State grants and State advances by local authorities and by private persons, while over 30,000 houses have been reconstructed with State assistance.  The total expenditure involved has been in the neighbourhood of £39,000,000 of which free Government grants accounted up to the present for £7,000,000.  Apart from this, we have spent over £6,500,000 on county, fever and mental hospitals and on the provision of public health institutions, while, on other public health works, over £4,000,000 has been expended.  No other State that I know of has been so generous in the measure of its assistance to the various important elements in our social welfare and we hope that, in these and other ways, we will continue to promote the happy and healthy conditions which all of us desire.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that one of the difficulties which proprietors of picture-houses all over the world experience is that they find it necessary to relate the tempo at which they show pictures to the intelligence of the audience who come into their houses.  The human fabric being constructed as it is, some people understand more readily what is presented to them orally or visually than others, and owners of picture-houses have discovered some means of determining what is the proper tempo at which scenes should be flashed on the screen for different classes of audiences.  As I have sat here from year to year listening to Ministers introducing their Budgets, I have wondered if we could not get hold of some of these methods or reaction tests to ascertain at what late period this Government will discover new ideas with regard to finance and national economy, that Budget days are no longer, as they used to be, days on which the Chancellor or the Minister for Finance presented humdrum calculations as to the manner in which he can raise certain taxation from the public and how he can spread the money raised in that way, in his efforts towards pauperisation as it is developing here, miscalled social services. Elsewhere there is an appreciation of the fact that Budget day means some sort of inquiry into the whole <Col N="2158" /> national economy and national income, some examination as to what proportion of the national income should be put at the disposal of the State for spending, the use of that spending being to ensure the full development of the resources of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking the Budget here to-day, is there anything approximating to even a very remote approach to that idea? When one has got through all the platitudes in which the Ministerial statement is couched, one comes to this: that agricultural output in these days, which should be ideal for the maintenance of self-sufficiency, is in-volume down by 10 per cent., industrial production is in volume down by 20 per cent., and taxation has got to the point when the Minister thinks it impossible any longer, without cracking the whole economic system, to make further impositions.  We have a situation in which emigration is increasing and increasing, our adult population is being dissipated elsewhere, marriages are becoming fewer and later, a smaller number of children is being born into the country, disease, particularly tuberculosis, rates are rising, and crime is stabilised, according to the statement of the Minister for Justice, at double what it used to be.  If we take the Minister's statement as indicating any attempt to state what the resources of the country are, we find that the liabilities of the State and of local authorities now exceed the assets by some £93,000,000 and we propose to continue the system that has brought that about.  I know one place where the tempo of certain people might easily be tested by this Budget.  If the Minister would betake himself to whatever hide-outs profiteers huddle in, in order to finger in a furtive way their gains, or go to those places where speculators generally boast of what they have been able to make, and attempt to read the Budget to them, he would be told in a few choice phrases to cut the cackle and come to the horses, the horses in this case being excess profits.  Then when they realised that this Budget brought no change in their case the first order would be to dispense the drinks so that these profiteers might drink to many happy returns of the <Col N="2159" /> day on which the Minister had treated them so well.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to England with regard to corporation profits tax, but let people understand the situation there as opposed to here.  In England from the start of the war the Chancellor's idea was to ensure, as was promised here, that there would be no profit-making out of the exigencies of the situation and they collect there 100 per cent. excess profits tax.  If concerns were not able over certain trading years to establish a standard profit for themselves, the Government stabilised the trade profit at £1,000 per annum. Here in such cases we stabilised it at £2,500.  In England the Chancellor has raised the floor of that £1,000 to £2,000 but the standard is still £500 under what we allow here in our generosity. In England there is also 100 per cent. excess profits tax.  A certain amount of that it is true is assumed to be repaid to industry for re-stocking and other purposes after the war.  We are allowing 25 per cent. over the standard profit, if there is anyone who brings out trading results over the standard we have established at £2,500.</P>
    <P>According to the Minister's statement here to-day, the yield from the corporation profits tax as opposed to the yield before this tax was established in any sort of intensity, has risen by almost £4,000,000, while you have a ceiling put upon the earnings of the small man, the civil servant, the small wage-earner, the man earning insufficient wages in the Guards, the Army, the small business man, the small clerk. The ceiling is clapped down upon these people, while the living space underneath it has become somewhat narrow because the means at least for living in that living space have become more difficult to obtain.  On the other hand, the roof is off for the man getting excess profits.  The only thing is that after the Minister has imposed his exactions on the community, the excess profiteer is stimulated to take still further exactions from these people by the fact that the Minister says to him, &ldquo;You collect what you can; pay me 75 per cent. of it and I will give you a handsome tip of 25 per <Col N="2160" /> cent.&rdquo; That is to be continued and we throw that money to these people although three years ago the Minister came into this House and told us that the books and the returns of the Revenue Commissioners had shown him that people were making profits out of the international exigency.  And he still throws that money to them.  This undoubtedly will be a delightful day for them.  This is the best ever Budget from the point of view of these people. They might at least have thought that after the public comment there was on it that even in this year the Minister would attempt to take the full 100 per cent., leaving them to get away with and hoping that they will be able to develop in the future what they have illegally, unlawfully, rather unethically earned over the last three years.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the Minister may also try out the reaction test on certain other people.  The Minister's Budget contained one joke about smoking or snuffing or chewing our way towards certain objectives and one tear, which was manfully repressed and indeed barely dropped at all, when he referred to the intolerable cost of living.  He said: &ldquo;...there are large professional and other groups of various kinds, representing a substantial part of the population, whose income has either remained stationary or contracted.&rdquo; The Minister knows well that their income has remained either stationary or contracted; the Minister and his colleagues are responsible.</P>
    <P>The standstill Order still operates. The last number of the <i>Trade Journal</i> which had relevance to this matter, I think, showed that amongst certain classes, industrial workers, the increase in wages over those who had remained in industry amounted to something in the neighbourhood of 19 points in 100, 1/6 in the £5.  The cost of living has risen 70 per cent., and the £ purchasing value is somewhere between half a guinea and 11/-.  And that is being continued.</P>
    <P>The Minister makes a comparison with the other side which I consider to be misleading.  I think one of the remarkable matters discussed in the Budget on the other side, and which <Col N="2161" /> might at least have directed the Minister's attention to the situation that had developed here, was that the Chancellor in England recently said that he did not consider that it was a sacrosanct point at which to keep the cost of living, somewhere between 25 and 30 per cent. above the cost of living, that is, the point at which they would keep it through subsidies.  Then he remarked that wages have risen by 40 per cent. I quote from the speech: &ldquo;To-day the rise amounted to 40 per cent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the increase in wage rates. Earnings, of course, had increased considerably more but wage rates in England have gone up by 40 per cent., while the cost of living is stabilised somewhere between 25 and 30 per cent. over the pre-war figure.  We have &ldquo;stood still&rdquo; our workers.  The small man, the small housekeeper, the civil servant, the Guard and the man in the Army, the small clerks, are stabilised at a point which allows them something in the neighbourhood of, say, a 20 per cent. rise on the 1939 point, and the cost of living bears down on them with the heavy weight of 70 per cent. above the pre-war level.  I thought that the iniquity of the comparison as between allowing the profiteers to get away with 25 per cent. on whatever they can make over and above what was regarded as their standard profits, and the attempt to stabilise the unfortunate underdogs in the community, representing, as the Minister says, a substantial part of the population, would at last have aroused the Minister's conscience and made him say that he would take, even this year, the full 100 per cent. and apply whatever he got&mdash;and there is £1,000,000 to be got easily in that way&mdash;in some attempt to relieve the almost impossible burdens on the other people.</P>
    <P>The main thing about this Budget is that there is a great deal in it about the future although Deputies will have noticed with interest that arterial drainage is off as far as this year is concerned, family allowances, I gather, are postponed, and the pace with regard to afforestation is obviously not going to be speeded up.  I know of nothing that is promised in the immediate future except, if you please, <Col N="2162" /> tourist development.  What we propose to invite tourists to come to see in this decaying country, I do not know.  We are going to have great tourist development, to get in people from outside or maybe it is to enable us to spend more pleasantly the great leisure we presumably will all have without the money to spend that leisure in any sort of comfortable way.</P>
    <P>The Budget aids in no way towards production.  The Minister attempts to cast his eye objectively on the situation and he sees agricultural output down, industrial output down, taxation at the cracking point, and still we propose to go along in that way.  Everywhere else people are being invited, through the use of finance as an instrument of production, to engage in what are called adventures in prosperity and we, with an enormous amount of resources outside the country, are invited to continue still along what I can only describe as the downright drift to a desperate depression.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in the course of his Budget statement, referred to quite a number of subjects, and reviewed the national position at considerable length.  There was one reference in the Budget statement that I thought unfair to the Minister for Local Government, because the Minister for Finance made a complimentary reference to the development of the Shannon Scheme.  He told us of the growth and utilisation of electricity from that source, and of projected electrical developments in the future, but it is not so many years since the present Minister for Local Government described the Shannon scheme as a white elephant, and regarded that animal as Public Enemy No. 1 in this country.  It is refreshing, therefore, to know that his colleague, the present Minister for Finance, is not at all concerned with the possible depredations of the white elephant of the Shannon, but, on the contrary, takes the view that it was a fair measure of our real electrical development and in fact is a scheme which has provided the impetus for future electrification here.  My complaint about the Min- <Col N="2163" /> ister's statement is that he took up a number of national problems, looked at them, examined them perfunctorily, and placed them back in the Budget statement in exactly the same position in which he got them.  It is true that the Minister theorised a good deal about future development, but not even in respect of the tourist development did he indicate any plans for the future or the Government's intentions. We were told at one stage, in a rather passing reference, that a Cabinet Subcommittee had examined the position of post-war development, but in the fifth year of the war one would expect that the Government would indicate what its post-war development policy was.  Beyond expressing the view that certain matters would have to be dealt with in the post-war period, the Minister left us all guessing as to the lines upon which a solution of these problems would be attempted, and gave no indication of the Government's precise intentions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing the Minister did rather emphasise, and that was the productivity of this country, but it is rather a disquieting discovery in the fifth year of the war, with all kinds of artificial aids in certain spheres of activity, that the volume of industrial production as distinct from agricultural production has fallen compared with pre-war. Obviously that is a very unhealthy position, and it is one on which the State must concentrate its energies if an effective remedy is to be applied, and if the country is to avoid irreparable damage which necessarily goes hand in hand with a fall in the volume of industrial and agricultural production. The outstanding feature of our national life is the low productivity of our people.  If we are to curb that position our national policy and budgetary direction must aim at increased productivity, because it is on the productivity of the land that the standard of life of our people will depend. If we are to have increased productivity then we ought to have a plan for the development of our economic and national life.  The Minister might be expected to discuss that, but he did not give any conception of the <Col N="2164" /> Government's plans for our national or economic life and left us with the impression that our activities are marked by a complete absence of planned economy.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the post-war period and stated that it might be a critical one so far as this nation is concerned.  Beyond doubt it will be a critical period for a neutral nation like this, but in that respect the Minister will find abundant goodwill amongst all Parties in the endeavour to brace the nation for whatever difficulties it may have to meet.  Our best mode of facing the post-war period lies in intensive production, in the gearing up of economic organisation and national productivity to such a state that we can face the future with some confidence in ourselves, and with that self-reliance, the absence of which the Minister deplored in his statement.  We may well be up against other nations as far as free trade in the post-war period is concerned.</P>
    <P>We will also have other problems, as men and women in thousands will be drifting back here from Britain, where they have become used to receiving good wages, a tolerably good standard of living, and with full employment guaranteed to each and every one of them.  When they come back here they may not be willing to go to the employment exchanges, they may not be willing to go to the home assistance officers, but may insist on that standard of life to which they have been accustomed for four or five years, by a demand for the restoration of their national heritage, which would compel the Government to take steps to deal with the situation.  And that applies not merely to returning emigrants; the population at home may see no reason to continue to exist in impoverished conditions in a land which if properly organised would be capable of providing a decent standard of living for all its citizens.  One would imagine that the Minister for Finance, on the occasion of a Budget statement, would have endeavoured to have unfolded what the Government's precise plans were for dealing with these emigrants. Some of them may be sent back whether we like it or not, and if we are to deal with them on their return, perhaps <Col N="2165" /> in thousands from Britain as well as with the people at home, now is the time for the Government to plan and to take the nation into its confidence. The Budget is silent as to the Government's programme in that regard. The Minister rightly made reference to the post-war competition that we may have to meet from countries where, because of the impact of war years, production in the industrial as well as in the agricultural field will be highly mechanised.  That is a situation that would press with considerable rigour on our people, if maximum industrial and maximum agricultural production here did not reach the measure of production of other countries, even in pre-war years.</P>
    <P>If we are to take steps to ensure that this nation is capable of withstanding the worst shocks of the post-war period, then the best way to do so is to strive by every means in our power to intensify both agricultural and industrial production.  That would have to be done, not by telling the farmer what he should do, but by the Government taking the lead, blazing the trail, and using every factor at its command, to insist on the farmer being encouraged to increase production, because that is the nation's best safeguard in the post-war period.</P>
    <P>With Deputy McGilligan, I think that the Minister, whether or not the problem was ghost-like to him, passed very lightly over the Government's wage policy during the emergency.  We were told with a great blare of trumpets in November, 1940, that the Government was going to set its face against any attempt by any section of the community to make a profit out of the war situation.  The Minister has long since abandoned one aspect of that promise.  The Minister has certainly seen to it not only that the workers should not make any profit but he has in fact prevented them from maintaining their pre-war standard of living.  The best evidence for that is found in the Government's own figures of the cost of living.  The Minister says that the cost of living has increased by 71 per cent. since 1939 and the closest possible scrutiny of the emergency bonuses granted since the <Col N="2166" /> Emergency Powers Order was introduced and subsequently amended will show that the average increase in wages does not exceed 15 per cent.  On the one hand you have an increased cost of living of 71 per cent. and on the other hand you have wage increases of not more than 15 per cent. to meet that increased cost of living.  Quite clearly, therefore, the Government has been very efficient not only from the standpoint of preventing the workers making any profit but even of preventing them maintaining their pre-war standard of living.  Every grade of worker whether he works with his brain or with a shovel, in an office or in a factory, has been caught by the net of low wages which the Government cast with considerable skill.  What is the position on the other hand? The Minister has given us a new insight into the methods of industrialists in this country by his reference to the devices employed by them to escape even the taxation imposed by the Government.  A number of devices of a character which obviously offend against any sense of public morality have been resorted to by certain people in order to evade their responsibility to the nation in this time of crisis.  These are ascertained cases. How many have not yet been discovered? The Minister, however, cannot gainsay the fact that whilst he has succeeded in depressing the standard of living of the workers by restricting the wage increases which they are entitled to, by his failure to control prices he has permitted large industrialists to make substantial profits. For example, every worker associated with the drapery industry knows that the drapery traders are making fabulous profits.  Shops and firms which could not pay or barely managed to pay dividends are making such profits that the poor people cannot buy shoes and clothing because the wherewithal is not there to pay the prices charged for these goods.  Every substantial firm is doing well and every worker's family is the poorer to-day. That is the manner in which the promise made when the Supplementary Budget of 1940 was introduced has been honoured by the Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2167" /> Before this Budget is passed I think the Minister should consult with the Government and indicate here that they realise that the workers have suffered severely by the wage policy pursued by the Government since 1941 and that the Government intends during the present year in appreciation of the workers contribution to the safety of the country to ease the low wage policy which has been pressing with such vigour upon the plain people of the country for the past few years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>In finishing his Budget speech the Minister said the Government had been acting as well as planning.  Undoubtedly it would take a lot of acting and planning to make the agricultural community believe that their prosperity is anything like what portion of his statement makes it out.  Whatever Deputies may say of money reform I want to put it before the Minister for Finance as the Minister responsible for money, that there is one source and one source of revenue alone in this country that counts and that is the income that is got from the land.  You may talk about income-tax payers and the people who have to pay surtax, but let me point out that it all comes directly from the men who produce the new money in this country, and the men who produce new money are the people who work, toil and sweat upon the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is certain lamenting going on by other sections these are the sections that get the money easily.  They get it from those that make the new money.  Consequently when you read that agricultural output is down certainly that is a step in the wrong direction. It is no wonder that agricultural production is down when you consider that the Emergency Powers Orders are being used, so to speak, against the producers on the land.  This is the first time since our group came into the House that a Budget was introduced and one thing has been left out of that Budget, and that is arterial drainage. There again we had high hopes that the matter was to be dealt with.  The fact is that thousands of acres of land are under water and how can you expect <Col N="2168" /> production to be increased until that is remedied?  However, I welcome something in the Budget speech&mdash;the statement that the Government were going to develop agricultural education.  Our group welcomes that because it is one thing that will help agriculture and prevent the flight from the land.  No doubt this Budget of £50,000,000 is something that has never been introduced before in our 28 years of native Government.  I will finish in the strain I started and ask the Minister for Finance to turn to the people who make the new money and help them in production. If the Government does that you will have plenty of money.</P>

It brings the income-tax <Col N="2172" /> law into conformity with the laws that have been changed in the County Boroughs of Dublin, Dun Laoghaire, Cork, Limerick and Waterford, where <Col N="2173" /> the poor rate has been changed to a municipal rate.

      <P>(1)  That a children's allowance under the Children's Allowances Act, 1944 (No. 2 of 1944), shall be exempt from income-tax (including sur-tax) and shall not be reckoned in computing income for the purposes of the Income Tax Acts.</P>
      <P>(2)  That where, but for this paragraph, a claimant would be entitled under Section 21 of the Finance Act, 1920, as amended by any subsequent enactment, to a deduction of £60 in respect of any child living and under the age of 16 years at the commencement of a year of assessment, the said deduction in respect of any such child in excess of two such children shall be reduced, for the year beginning on the 6th day of April, 1944, to £47, and for the year beginning on the 6th day of April, 1945, or any subsequent year, to £40.</P>
      <P>(3)  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Resolution arises out of the Children's Allowances Act.  Its object is to make provision for the reduction <Col N="2174" /> of allowances given in the income-tax code in respect of children under 16 years of age, having regard to payments that will be made under the Children's Allowances Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestEdmondsonBenso" hpid="Mr. Benson Mr. Benson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to protest against this Resolution.  I hope that before the Finance Bill is introduced the Minister will give the matter a more sympathetic hearing than I was able to secure from his colleague at the time that the Children's Allowances Bill was being considered by this House.  The effect of this Resolution is to transform the Children's Allowances Act into a Children's Disallowances Act.  The allowance under the Children's Allowances Act is £6 10s. per annum to anybody who has qualifying children and is an income-tax payer at the full rate.  The result under this will be a loss in a normal year of £7 10s.  Can the Minister explain why anybody who has, possibly, been foolish enough to have a large family should now lose £1 per head, while the position of the person earning the same salary as that individual, but not having a large number of children should remain as before? It is a definite disallowance to any full income-tax payer who has a large number of children.  I hope the Minister will give the matter serious consideration before he introduces the Finance Bill, and see whether he cannot make the position more equitable.</P>
      <P>Another point that the Minister might consider is as to whether a simple declaration on an income-tax form that the children's allowance was not being sought, would remove this disqualification.  The Minister would be £1 per child worse off than he will be under this, but as against that he would, obviously, be saved a certain amount of administrative expense.  I imagine that the total cost to the country would be about the same, but anybody who is a full income-tax payer would, I think, rather retain the £60 a year allowance than have to go around collecting a half a crown per week.  Perhaps the Minister would consider these points before the introduction of the Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  That, for the purpose of removing doubts, it is hereby declared that the word &ldquo;remuneration&rdquo;, when used in relation to a director of a company in any enactment relating to corporation profits tax (including excess corporation profits tax), shall be construed as meaning, and as having always meant, all remuneration, whether by way of fees, salary, bonus, commission or otherwise howsoever, payable by a company to a person in respect of a period during which he is or was a director of that company, whether that remuneration is or was payable to him wholly in his capacity as director of that company or wholly in some other capacity or partly in his capacity as such director and partly in some other capacity.</P>
      <P>(2)  That such provisions, in relation to allowances in respect of the remuneration of directors, as shall be prescribed by statute shall, as respects all accounting periods ending after the 31st day of December, 1943, apply and have effect in relation to excess corporation profits tax.</P>
      <P>(3)  That Section 43 of the Finance Act, 1941 (No. 14 of 1941), as amended by Section 18 of the Finance Act, 1942 (No. 14 of 1942), shall cease to apply in respect of any accounting period ending after the 31st day of December, 1943.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also explained this Resolution fairly fully in the course of my Budget statement.  It relates to the existing provisions limiting the amount allowed for the purposes of corporation profits tax including excess corporation profits tax in respect of the remuneration of directors.  That has always been interpreted to include remuneration received from the same company in any other capacity by that director, such as manager or traveller. Recently, this interpretation of the Statutes was rejected by the special commissioners in the hearing of an appeal.  As the case was not one of any importance, the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="2176" /> did not contest it in the courts, as they would normally do, but we are legislating now to make clear what the situation always was.</P>

      <P>Because, as I have said, the special commissioner in an appeal case decided against the inland revenue authorities and against the established practice.  It is necessary to make clear what the law was. In the ordinary way it would have been done by the Revenue Commissioners taking the case to the courts to get a determination.  If that had been done, we think the courts would have decided that what was heretofore the practice was the proper practice, but, as I have said, the case was a small one and the Revenue Commissioners did not think it worth while to take it to the courts.  We have decided to put it right in this way.</P>

    <P>(9)  (a) That a company (in this sub-paragraph referred to as the second company) shall, for the purposes of this Resolution, be deemed to be an auxiliary of another company (in this sub-paragraph referred to as the first company) if</P>
    <P>(i)  the second company is incorporated after the first company, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  the first company holds more than 50 per cent. of the paid up ordinary issued capital of the second company.</P>

    <P>This Resolution is designed to counter the device referred to in the course of my Budget statement to which some companies resort to reduce their liability to excess corporation profits tax by forming new companies usually with a nominal, or very small, capital, most of which is held either by the principal company or by the proprietors <Col N="2181" /> of the principal company, and through which they may get an additional allowance of £2,500, the minimum standard allowance, for each one of these separate companies that might be formed to run part or parts of the business of the old-established company.</P>

      <P>This question of transport is of great national importance. It would be a pity if the House rejected a measure which was intended to improve transport conditions, but it would be far more regrettable if the House encouraged monopolies or stood for the lowering of Christian principles.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce spoke in Portarlington some time ago and used these words: &ldquo;We shall defend the rights of every citizen...Vested interests and monopolies will be kept in their place under our administration.&rdquo; How does that statement, made before the general election, agree with the Minister's statement in introducing this Bill?  I do not at all agree with the introduction of this Bill at the present time, pending the report of the tribunal at present sitting.  The Minister knows that a lot of dirty linen is going to be washed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a most inopportune time for the Minister to introduce such legislation.  I am convinced that the reason the Minister and the Government are anxious to rush this Bill through the Dáil is that they believe the time is opportune for a general election.  They want to be beaten on this and they know that we in opposition are not going to stand for trampling on Christian principles by any Government.  If the Minister reads that great Encyclical <i>Rerum Novarum,</i> he will find that the law should favour ownership and that the policy should be to induce as many as <Col N="2184" /> possible to become owners.  How is that Christian document being followed by the Minister?  If he reads the Encyclical <i>Quadragesimo Anno,</i> issued by the late Holy Father in May, 1931, he will see that the laws enacted for joint stock companies have been the occasion of abominable abuses. Boards of directors, unmindful of their trust, betrayed the rights of those whose savings they administered. What is the Minister doing in this Bill to see that the directors, if and when appointed, will act in the best interests of those whose savings they administer?</P>
      <P>We have not any guarantee that, every year, Deputies will be able to have a stocktaking or review of the conduct of this company.  I would vote for this Bill if I thought the Minister would give the House an assurance that the House would have some say in this every year.  If there were an Estimate to provide a certain amount of money each year, this matter could be discussed here and, if we have complaints to make, we would be able to make them.</P>
      <P>There is a certain company&mdash;I do not wish to refer to it&mdash;formed by the present Minister under an Act of this House.  I requested certain information last October about certain appointments which that transport company was making.  I think I sent to the Minister a copy of a communication I addressed to the company on that occasion.  They replied by return of post saying: &ldquo;We have your letter of the 27th, but regret we cannot see our way to let you have the information requested.&rdquo; I was convinced there were certain corrupt practices being carried on by that company in making certain appointments.  Where was I to air my grievance, to disclose the information I had or get the grievance remedied?  I could not raise it here, as it was an independent company.</P>

We will be told that we should not interfere, that it is none of our business and, if we have a grievance, we can keep it.  That is the first step towards dictatorship.  The Government is rushing this, as they know they will be beaten.  If my vote beats them on it, beaten they will be.  Of course, it is a most opportune time for the Government to go before the people.  It will be nothing new for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to go around the country, in his usual election style, and say: &ldquo;We were trying to get you good and cheap transport and now, with the Opposition in the House, we cannot carry on.  All your transport is at a standstill.  Only for us you would be in the war.&rdquo; The usual election promises were put up, but where are they to-day?</P>

      <P>I only wish some of the election promises the Minister made were in this Bill, and then we would be very near the point.  This Bill is not the product of the Minister or the Department.  I look upon this Bill as a Reynolds Bill, because I am convinced that the directors of the Great Southern Railways Company drafted it for the Minister's Department.  From information on which I believe I can rely, I am satisfied that the man who consulted the Minister on this Bill is the present chairman of the Great Southern Railways Company, and he had the assistance of a non-national, a Scotsman, who knows nothing about transport, and who was appointed to his present position since the Minister appointed the chairman.  The Minister would not allow an Irishman to compete for the position.  I cannot see why everybody was not given an opportunity to apply for this position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite see your point.  I am dealing with this Bill as best I can.  I am anxious to bring out some of the defects that exist under the present administration.  I would not be surprised if conditions were twice as bad under the future administration. Who called for this Bill or for the establishment of this monopoly? Did the licensed carriers or the general public?  They did not.  We have 2,075 licensed carriers as against 333 lorries attached to the Great Southern Railways Company.  I cannot see why the Minister should give compensation to any directors who may lose their employment.  The Government are sympathetic to the directors, but there is no consideration for the working man, as Deputy Corry said last night.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry raised a few points. Among other things, he dealt with the question of compensation for the workers, the ordinary rank and file who may lose their employment.  I hold that the workers are a very important section of the community, more important than the directors, and the Minister would be well advised to make provision for the workers so that they will get fair compensation should they lose their means of livelihood as a result of the operation of this legislation.  Another thing I do not like about this Bill is that the directors are under no obligation to give an account of their stewardship.  There is nothing in the Bill to compel them to do so.  They will be given a free hand, with the assistance of the Minister, to make a very good job of it.  I will oppose this Bill in its present form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What guarantee have we, beyond the Minister's word&mdash;and that would not go across the street so far as I am concerned? We have no guarantee that the hackney owners and taxi owners will not follow along the same lines as the railway workers.  So far as the Minister's guarantee is concerned, it is not worth the air that carries it across the House.  I would like to see <Col N="2187" /> some clause in the Bill along the lines I have referred to.  Deputy Corry dealt with the provision of compensation for those likely to lose their livelihood as a result of the company carrying out the functions outlined here.  Deputy Corry is a member of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I wonder did he put all his points before the Minister at the Party meeting?  If the Minister did not give him a satisfactory hearing, and if he is not prepared to amend the Bill to meet the wishes of Deputy Corry and others in the Fianna Fáil Party, will those Deputies have the pluck to vote against the Bill?  It is all very well to criticise the Minister, but the Deputy, like many of his colleagues, is so much steeped in hypocrisy that he will not vote against the Bill.  He will criticise it all right, but he will make sure to support the Minister in getting it through the House.</P>
    <P>The question of the reorganisation of transport is one to which very sympathetic consideration should be given, and one which the House should take very seriously.  I should like to see legislation introduced to improve the position, but I am not satisfied that this legislation will do so.  It will cause a great deal of trouble, inconvenience, corruption, redundance and annoyance.  With regard to fares, we have no indication of what the fares will be, or whether the general public will be scorched or relieved.</P>
    <P>The railway transport in my constituency was reorganised recently.  In order to bring bacon or agricultural seeds on the railway from Mountmellick to Dublin six weeks ago it would cost 33/9, but under the new system it will cost 36/4.  In order that milled stuffs in six-ton lots might come by rail from Mountmellick to Dublin the cost before they reorganised the transport was 16/5, and at present it is 19/7.  A bag of potatoes weighing 1 cwt. would cost, on the journey from Mountmellick to the city, 2/2 some weeks ago, but under the reorganised system it will cost 3/1. I suppose as soon as the new company is working the cost will be 5/- or 7/6. Will the Minister do something to see <Col N="2188" /> that the company will not charge what they like when they have full control? I have read this Bill and, as far as my common sense, wisdom and understanding will allow me to interpret it, I cannot see anything included in the Bill that gives the Minister such powers.  He would be very wise to examine those points.</P>
    <P>The principal matter is the compensation for the directors.  That is the only thing in which I am interested. Why should they be the privileged class?  Why should the Minister worry himself over those people, while nothing is done for the poor labouring man who may have a wife and family depending on his earnings?  It is the usual procedure, to the best of my knowledge, that such directors have seven, eight and, perhaps, ten jobs. These directors, with whom the Minister's sympathies lie, are not in receipt of 35/- or £2 per week, but £20 or £30 in many cases.  I am very much surprised that the Minister, when he was in my constituency during the elections, did not say: &ldquo;When we get back we will walk you down to the ground altogether.&rdquo; He introduces legislation that will cater for the directors and for the big noises.  There is nothing about the poor ordinary working man who, if his livelihood is taken away after a period of six months, may have to go and join his brother-Irishmen by taking the boat from Dún Laoghaire or Rosslare to the land beyond the Irish Sea in order to eke out an existence there because he will be denied the right of existence in his native land as a result of this Bill when it becomes law.  You will find that this company will only wait for an excuse and, after a period of six months, you will see that hundreds of employees will be turned out of employment and that they will not get one penny.  But the directors are catered for.  Provision is made in the Bill to cater for them, but there is nothing for the poor working man who, in my estimation, is far more important. All men should be treated equally.  Why should the Minister make an exception of one group of individuals and cater for them by giving them compensation and leave out the most important section&mdash;the workers?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2189" /> I wonder is it the Minister's intention that any of the present directors who are in charge of the railway should be directors of the new company? We know well who will be the chairman.  The chairman will be the man who drafted this Bill for the Minister.  The Minister knows well the gentleman to whom I am referring. There is another gentleman, a director at the present time, and, according to rumour, he will be a director of this new company.  That gentleman is also a director, I understand, of the gas company, and the reason he was interested in transport was to have gas used at the railway stations around the city.</P>

Any statement that I make, whether good or bad, intelligent or unintelligent, I am prepared to stand over it.  Another point I should like to raise is the question of these directors being influenced.  So far as the present directors are concerned, the Minister has proof, Deputy Davin has proof, I have proof, and several others have proof that the present directors when approached by certain individuals can do as they so desire.  We had a glaring case of that no later than three days ago when a certain individual made representations to the chairman of the Great Southern Railways to have a certain railway line opened and the railway line was opened immediately for him.  The line I am referring to is by no means a line of any importance. It is a line that is merely connected with a sub-branch line and comes in at a junction.  It leads into a town with a population of 1,122.</P>

      <P>I am just pointing out the manner in which these directors can be influenced and in which they will be influenced.  The Minister or his Department was asked to make representations to have a certain railway line in my constituency opened and the Minister and his Department were absolutely powerless in the matter.  Yet, when one of the directors was approached by a gentleman, a member of this House, because the director was afraid of certain charges which the same gentleman could make against them, if he so desired, in this House, through fear he opened the railway line.  That director could have a say in the transport, whether it was good or bad for this particular area, and yet the Minister was absolutely powerless to get anything done.</P>

      <P>I think I am in no way unreasonable and I would like to welcome any measure that the Government would introduce with a view to improving the present transport situation.  I will vote for this Bill provided the Minister amends it in such a way, first, that the members of this House will get an opportunity of having a stocktaking or review of the activities of this company every year&mdash; at present we are buying a pig in a bag and we do not know what way it will turn out&mdash;and, secondly, if the Minister provides in this Bill that every individual who will suffer any loss through lack of employment or otherwise will be duly compensated, just as he is providing for compensation for the directors.

This Bill, in my estimation, is the first step towards complete dictatorship in its present form and unless it is drastically amended, if my vote puts the Government out, I will vote against it, because I am satisfied that, if we went to the people on such an issue, the people would not stand over a monopoly or a dictatorship and see directors catered for when the ordinary working man is turned down.  I think it would be a golden opportunity for every Party, Fine Gael, Labour and Farmers to show the Irish people that we are absolutely determined in our fight to implement the teachings I have quoted from the Pope's Encyclical in which monopolies, vested interests, etc., are condemned and, secondly, that we want to know what these directors are doing for the people that money should be voted to pay them.  I am quite satisfied that every member of this House, who has respect for his constituency and who wishes to place the ordinary working man before the directors of these big companies and firms, will oppose this Bill in its present form and, if the Government whistle their election tune, I can say without fear of contradiction that those on this side of the House will dance hearty steps to the Minister's election tune.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestEdmondsonBenso" hpid="Mr. Benson Mr. Benson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to join my protest with that of others who have already spoken against the unseemly haste with which the Minister is trying to push this Bill through.  It is a very long measure, a measure which takes considerable time to read, let alone to grasp thoroughly.  Yet, we were given a very short time in which to do that, and then the Minister selects the day before the Budget for the Second Reading, when all of us ought more properly to be turning our minds to the financial situation of the country.  The Minister, in his introductory remarks, made no case for the Bill being produced in this way.  He gave no indication as to anything which could be done immediately, even if the Bill is pushed through in time for the new <Col N="2192" /> company to be set up by 1st July.  He did mention something about its being desirable that the new board should be in operation in order to prepare their plans for the post-war period, but, so far as one can understand, the new board, or, at all events, the effective portion of the new board, is already operating, and there does not seem to me to be any great strength in that argument for this rushing process.</P>
      <P>Everybody must agree that it is obvious that some form of reorganisation of the railway company is necessary. It has got into a bad way.  There is no sense in discussing here and now the reasons for that; the fact is that it is in a bad way, and reorganisation is necessary.  The Minister presents us with a Bill which does to an extent, propose to reorganise the railway company. He does not indicate exactly on what he has based this particular system of reorganisation&mdash;whether it is entirely the product of his own brain, or whether he has taken expert advice in the matter or not.  He has given us no explanation as to how the large amount of money which is to be placed at the disposal of the new company is to be spent.  It is perfectly obvious that that is not one of the matters for which it is necessary to rush the Bill, because the possibilities of being able to spend any money in the near future on rolling-stock, permanent way or anything else are very remote.  I imagine that it will probably be somewhere in the region of from three to five years before there is much possibility of this country being able to buy products of this nature in the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the biggest difficulties which I think the House must find in dealing with this Bill is the fact that they are being asked to guarantee a large sum of money to the company, and yet, having passed this Bill, if they do pass it, they will have no further say as to how that money is to be used, or as to whether they consider it is being rightly used, economically used, properly or improperly used.  That, I think, is one of the biggest objections which this House must have to the <Col N="2193" /> system which the Bill proposes.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney yesterday considered it was most immoral to pay the shareholders the amount which it is proposed in the Bill to pay them.  I do not intend to deal with that aspect, but I suggest that it is far more immoral for the House, as trustees for the country, to hand over a sum of £16,000,000 to the control of one man, with no supervision by this House as to the manner in which it is spent.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his opening remarks, said that he objected to the idea of a subsidy to transport.  I do not propose to argue whether transport should or should not be subsidised, but I should like the Minister to explain the difference between a subsidy to a transport company and the guaranteeing by this House, that if necessary they will pay up to £500,000 per year in order that the company may meet their liabilities. It seems to me that if there is a distinction between the two, it is a distinction without a difference.</P>
    <P>There are various points in the Bill which will be more properly dealt with in Committee, and one of these points which struck me in the course of the somewhat cursory examination I have so far been able to give the Bill, is the fact that the Minister sets up an advisory council which may consider certain matters.  So far as I can see, the Minister may deal with all these matters&mdash;such important matters as charges, and so forth&mdash;entirely on his own.  He need never call this advisory council together, unless he feels so disposed, and that does seem to me to be one portion of the Bill which should be changed, so that it would be obligatory on the Minister to consult this advisory council.</P>
    <P>One of the other big bugbears is the composition of the board of directors and, except for the present condition, which exists by reason of Emergency Powers Orders I should say that it is surely a unique constitution.  One man can be the board; the board cannot be a board without that one man.  It seems to me that, on the whole, the other directors are simply wasting their time in having anything to do with it.  I think, too, that there should be <Col N="2194" /> some means by which, if there is a considerable disagreement on policy between the other directors and the chairman, the Minister can be advised of such disagreement, because, presumably, although the chairman is, to all normal intents and purposes, all-powerful, the Minister is above him, because he is removable by the Minister. All these other directors should have some means by which they could communicate any grave difference between them and the chairman to the Minister, so that the Minister might consider whether the chairman was about to do the right thing or not. As I say, these are matters which can be more properly dealt with on the Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest that this Bill should be left over until after the war.  Even when the war is over, I submit that, though it may involve a subsidy on the part of the State, the employees of the railway company should be guaranteed against losses, resulting from the stoppage of transport, due to the scarcity of fuel or to other causes.  We all know that quite a large number of people are employed in railway services, and I think it would be very unfair that these men should be disemployed as a result of conditions arising out of the present emergency.  Therefore, I suggest that the consideration of this Bill or any similar Bill, should be postponed until after the war, so that employment would be assured for these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My main reason for making this suggestion is that, after the war, as has happened after other wars in the past, many new ideas may be introduced. Always, during a war, many new ideas or new inventions are developed, or old inventions are improved.  We have seen that in the case of the last war; and it is more than probable that after this war we may have very much more up-to-date methods of transport than we have at the present time.  If it were only for that reason alone, I should be anxious to wait for a period after the war when, perhaps, we would be in a better position to expend the money that is proposed here to more advantage than we can spend it to-day. When we bear in mind that, according <Col N="2195" /> to the Minister's own statement, a lot of the rolling stock of the company is obsolete, I think it is obvious that we should not pay this money without a further examination of the question, particularly in view of the fact that, when we go back to a few years ago, it will be found that the railway company bought up the stocks of various small companies in the country.  I know, from my own experience, that a large amount of the interests of stockholders in the smaller concerns was bought up in that way, and I suggest that we are now merely proposing to gamble with the taxpayers' money in a similar way.</P>
    <P>As I have already suggested, the railway company got, to a great extent, a monopoly of the whole transport service of the country, and yet the Minister now says that that company is still complaining.  Well, if that is so, all I can say is that it is their own fault.  From observation of the working of a line in my own county, which was second to none, in my own opinion and in the opinion of others, I would say that the company have not been working the service economically.  For instance, even during the beet campaign, a lorry would have to be sent something like 35 miles if there was a question of a break-down and if repairs had to be undertaken, although we had plenty of motor mechanics and repair men in garages in the vicinity who could do the necessary repair work. Now, it appears to me that if this Bill is passed as it stands at present, those men will be done out of their jobs, and, if that should prove to be so, then I say that it will be very unfair to workers.  It is quite unlikely that the new company will have its own repairing department within a convenient radius, but even so the men of whom I am speaking will get no work, and I suggest that, as a result of bad management, the railway company has not been able to pay their workers.</P>
    <P>Then, again, taking this huge amount of £20,000,000 which it seems will be necessary to put the company on its feet, I would not object so much to giving that money after the emergency if we could be satisfied that a <Col N="2196" /> substantial and efficient transport service would be given to the people of this country.  In such circumstances, I think it would be a good bargain, but as things are at the moment I am afraid that it will turn out to be a damn bad bargain because, in the opinion of the railway employees themselves and of others, the rolling-stock of the company is obsolete and useless.  There is also this question of providing money for the company in order that guarantees may be given to the owners of stock in the company. We are asked to guarantee a dividend to the subscribers to the company, but we are not told whether, if the company should prove to earn money in the future, that money will be refunded to the public purse.  That is not right.  If there should prove to be a loss on the working of the company, the taxpayers, evidently, are expected to bear that loss, but if there should be a gain, there does not seem to be any provision whereby the taxpayers will be recompensed.</P>
    <P>There is another matter about which I as well as other members of the House are deeply concerned, and that is in connection with cases where branch lines are closed down and the traffic diverted to the roads.  As I have already said, when the war is over, conditions may be entirely different, and it might be possible that it would be better, in the circumstances which may then exist, that the bulk of these lines should be closed and that the traffic should be diverted to the roads, but there is no provision in the Bill, so far as I can see, to guarantee the local authorities or the ordinary ratepayer against the loss which may be involved as a result of the increased burden on local taxation, due to the heavy road traffic that may ensue.</P>
    <P>We all know what happens at the present time in connection with rural areas.  Anybody who is a member of a county council is quite well aware that the ratepayers are already overburdened with taxation, and we must all know that, in the present condition of our roads, these roads are not able to carry heavy traffic.  How, therefore, is it that there seems to be no provision <Col N="2197" /> in this Bill to compensate the local authorities or the ratepayers for any loss or abuse that may be due to an increase of heavy traffic on the roads, which, in my opinion, is likely to occur in the next few years?  The local authorities are bound to maintain these roads, and therefore there should be some provision to compensate them for any increased burden.  That is what I am interested in, and I should like the Minister to bear in mind that before this Bill goes through&mdash;and I hope it will not go through until the emergency is over&mdash;the interests of the local authorities and the ordinary tax-papers should be considered in this matter of the possible increased burden on road traffic.  In conclusion, I should like to say that if this Bill becomes law the matter of the maintenance of main roads, carrying heavy traffic, should be the concern of the nation and not of the local authorities which, as I have said, are already overburdened by heavy taxation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. H.M. Dockrell Mr. H.M. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing new in connection with the transport problem that confronts us at the moment.  Some of us can remember that many years ago, when an inquiry into the railways then existing was set up, a railway expert from England gave evidence that he could manage the affairs of the Irish railways in a couple of days in the week and go fishing for another three days in the week. That, of course, was before the days of the motor car, which has increased the problems which have arisen in connection with transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To my mind, however, one of the most extraordinary things about this Bill is that it has really settled nothing as to the manner in which, or along what lines, this money ought to be spent.  Now, I suppose the Minister would say, and quite rightly, that some of us are not traffic experts.  That is quite correct, but it is a new thing for us to draw a blank cheque for £20,000,000 and leave it to somebody else to spend the money.  That is actually what is being proposed here. A bargain was made&mdash;in fact, I think that the Minister has practically agreed&mdash;that the goodwill of the existing <Col N="2198" /> companies will be passed over for something approaching £13,500,000.  It looks as if somebody had suggested: &ldquo;There is £13,500,000, which, with the percentage provided for capital expenditure, makes £20,000,000; so, get on with the job.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Dáil has, up to the present, maintained some control over the way and the direction in which money is spent.  Let us take a parallel instance. If we handed over a substantial sum of money to the Arterial Drainage Board, and they said that they had decided it would be better to spend the money on intensive farming, what would we say?  That is the position with which we are faced.  Let us consider how the transport problem has grown up here.  Many years before the motor car came on the scene, we had a number of small railways operating in their own areas.  Some of them were, possibly, run efficiently and some were run inefficiently.  They were kings in their own domain, and I can remember industrialists who complained that their business had been crushed out of existence by an unsympathetic railway company which would not give them the rates necessary to enable them to carry on.  The motor car came along and that changed the position very materially. The Minister said that there was no standardisation in the case of the railway. I think that he is perfectly right in that, because the growth of the railways prevented standardisation.  But there is nothing in the present Bill compelling standard equipment to be adopted.  Perhaps the Minister thinks that that is not necessary.  Another point on which I should like to have information is: Are the people who are to be in control of this company to be at liberty to electrify the railways? I should not like to receive a sum of £6,500,000 and to be told to go off and electrify the Irish railways.  I may be a pessimist but I should not like to take on that job.  That brings me to the question of the part that railways are to play in the future of the country.  There are certain things that are really laws as regards the railways and railway traffic.  In America, they discovered that a freight <Col N="2199" /> did not begin to pay on a railway until it had gone beyond the 100-mile mark.  I forget whether or not that was the distance, but there was a distance within which the railway company lost money and over which they made money.  If that figure of 100 miles be correct, very little traffic will travel 100 miles here.</P>
    <P>Another point which has a very profound effect on the railways has not been touched upon at all.  I refer to the decentralisation policy of the Government in connection with the promotion of new industries.  They were, probably, quite right in not having one industrial area from which the other areas would be served.  But that is the precise position which would suit a railway company.  All the raw material would be brought to one point for manufacture and would then be distributed from that point. Now, we have a position in which raw material is brought to one point in one case and to another point in another case.  Some evidence was given before the Railway Tribunal&mdash;I do not know whether or not it is in the report; it is, probably, not&mdash;of what the company can not do and what the company will not do.  In speaking of what the company can not do and will not do, I do not suggest that they have a double dose of malice.  They are tied by their own equipment and by their own rules.  It is perfectly certain that there is a lot of traffic&mdash;traffic which has grown up under modern conditions&mdash;with which a railway company cannot cope as efficiently as a specialised motor vehicle.  I shall give an instance of which I, myself, know something. Take a very large sheet of plate glass which is required in a country town. What is the position?  It is so big that you cannot put it into an ordinary truck.  The railway company have what they call a boiler truck. There is only one truck on the system and that has to be brought to the port at which the large plate-glass case comes in.  It has then to be brought to a station where there is a siding and where there is a crane capable of taking that large case off <Col N="2200" /> the boiler truck.  Then, somebody has to look around for a vehicle that can bring that case out to the site. The glass has to be removed and the case sent back.  There is danger to life and limb.  In fact people have been killed in trying to deal with these cases of glass where there were not proper cranes.  I merely give that as one instance.</P>
    <P>There are other specialised cases with which the railway company cannot deal.  They cannot hope to get equipment for dealing with them everywhere as against the specialised motor vehicle which can bring the article to the precise site.  I shall give another instance of a case with which the railway company cannot deal economically; the instance I have given is one in which they cannot deal with the article physically. There is the instance in which a very large amount of expensive packing is required to protect the article in transit by the railway company.</P>
    <P>I know that some wag once said that if you gave a railway company a battleship for transmission by rail, they would ask you to crate it so that it could not be broken.  I do not know how true that is, but certainly very expensive packing is required in certain cases which could be dispensed with by a door-to-door delivery.  There is the third case in which the railway company has not the equipment, or in which the equipment with which they are provided is not sufficiently developed for the needs of the district. They may have a siding at the station, but the wagons are out on the line and cannot be brought in when a person requires them.  These are some of the things that the railway company cannot do.</P>
    <P>What is it the railway company will not do?  The Minister said that the fiercest competition which the railway company had to face arose from the motor vehicle owned by the ordinary private trader.  If you approach the ordinary private trader and ask him why he is competing with the railway company, he will tell you: &ldquo;I do not want to be called a carrying company; I do not want to be delivering my goods.&rdquo; If you ask him then: &ldquo;What <Col N="2201" /> then are you delivering them for?&rdquo; he will reply: &ldquo;Because the railway company will not give me the service I want, or the service that my customer wants from me.&rdquo; Then if you ask him: &ldquo;What do you want, or what does your customer want?&rdquo; the reply will be: &ldquo;Well, we want the stuff collected at one end by the railway company and delivered at the other end by the company, the company being responsible for any breakages.  You will find that the railway company will not do that.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That brings me to this point: The Minister says that the railway company under this Bill are not going to interfere with the right of the private trader to deliver his own goods, but I think I am right in saying that this is the third Bill which this Government has introduced dealing with the railway situation.  I hope that it is not the forerunner of a fourth which might contain many provisions of an unsatisfactory character, and practically abolish the right of the private trader to deliver his own goods.  Looking at what is happening in other places, I understand that in England there are firms who carry out deliveries over a very large area.  Those firms found that they had to run their own motor cars, as they had depots which were practically a day's run from the main warehouse.  From these warehouses they carried out a further distribution of goods.  Are we going to find that things like that are going to be stopped here?</P>
    <P>Some previous speakers have referred to the haste with which this Bill has been introduced.  It would seem that this Bill of 117 sections and 10 Schedules is really only an enabling Bill.  It is putting through a certain transaction, but the Bill is strangely silent about the £20,000,000, how it is going to be distributed, and in what form.  We are apparently not going to have any say on that matter.  It seems there are three classes of traffic with which we shall have to contend when the emergency is over.</P>
    <P>It is not, I think, desirable that the railway company should use motor cars merely to collect stuff to bring it to a station, send it on the railway from <Col N="2202" /> there, and then deliver by motor car from the station nearest to its destination. I have spoken about the laws that prevail in regard to traffic, and I should like to mention something that is almost a law, namely, that every transhipment or handling that takes place means money, increases the risk to the goods and probably increases the chance of errors or disputes.  Around a city such as Dublin there are railway stations at frequent intervals to deal with the passenger traffic.  If one tries to deliver goods along these lines one finds that this system prevails.  One gets a delivery of the goods to the railway by motor car and then a delivery of goods from the station at the other end.  I should like to suggest that one would have to be sending goods about 20 miles at the very least, probably a good deal further-probably you would have to go to Wicklow on the one side and Drogheda on the other&mdash;before it would pay to take stuff out of the motor vehicle that was going to the railway station, put it into the railway wagons and then take it out at the other end.</P>
    <P>At the expiration of the last war the railway companies were appalled at the disappearance of traffic.  One enterprising railway sent an agent around to try to discover where that traffic had gone. He went into a trader in Dublin and said: &ldquo;My company is appalled at the loss of traffic around Dublin.  Can you tell me what you could pay for the delivery of your goods in an area served by our railway company?&rdquo; They decided to take Balbriggan as an instance.  The trader said that he would have to pay about 4/- a ton to deliver the goods to the railway company&mdash;I am mentioning figures merely as an illustration; I do not suggest they are the correct ones; that it would cost 3/- to take the goods to Balbriggan and about another 2/6 at the other end.  That would be a total cost of 9/6 a ton.  Any owner of a motor car who was plying for hire was prepared at that time to do the job from door to door for about 5/6.  That means that there is a great deal of traffic for which the railway company would not be able to compete.  I suppose the Minister will tell us that he has left that to the expert, but the <Col N="2203" /> trouble is that the expert has now a further problem.  I do not know whether I have a Heath Robinson imagination, but one can envisage in the post-war period a ship coming into Dublin and on its arrival being met by amphibious motor cars.  These cars could take goods off the ship and could come up to a ramp somewhere at Tara Street and bring them to Bray or Greystones.  It is possible that in certain specialised types of traffic the railway will have to compete with that sort of thing.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan in a very able speech this morning pointed out that we were going to pay the railway company about £9,000,000 for assets for which there was nothing tangible to show.  The position really is that the company would be buying the goodwill. No conditions are imposed by the House as to whether they are to go on the lines that the railways are to be maintained and that the country will have to foot the cost no matter what happens or whether the railway companies are to be allowed to die and that we are to have motor traffic.  I am not at all sure that a case has been made that the railway companies are absolutely necessary for the economic salvation of this country.  The Minister is perfectly aware that we had a transport problem in Dublin in connection with the delivery of turf. What happened in many instances?  I know that every day one could see four and five-ton lorries bearing names that showed they came from the West of Ireland bringing turf into the city.  If four- or five-ton lorries can be used for the transport of turf at a time when there is an acute shortage of petrol, what is the case for the survival of the railway companies?</P>
    <P>The Minister has not attempted to forecast&mdash;I do not know whether he has even considered it&mdash;what is going to be the motive fuel in this country after the present crisis has past.  Will we get down to an intensive drive in the production of anthracite, which is native to this country, and run our motor cars on producer gas, or will we make charcoal from our native timber and run vehicles on that?  All these <Col N="2204" /> problems seem to have been left.  In fact we are left in the position that we have to trust the expert, and if the expert has gone wrong we may find that we have drawn a cheque for £20,000,000 without knowing what it is intended to buy.</P>

      <P>I should like to apply myself to the Bill proper and to the reasons why this amendment was moved.  In my opinion, the amendment was moved in no antagonistic mood and for no antagonistic purpose.  It was plain from the speech of the mover of the amendment that he approached the matter of the reorganisation of the railways in a sympathetic way.  He only questioned the propriety of bringing these matters before the House because a certain atmosphere had been created in this country during the past few months.  I am limited somewhat by the ruling of the Chair in referring to that particular reason, but the reason was given in very emphatic terms, that there was a tribunal set up by the goodwill of this House on the direction of the Leader of Fianna Fáil, the spokesman of the nation.  As a result of certain matters that arose in a discussion in the House, he felt that offence had been given to the susceptibilities of certain people and that there was a feeling of uncertainty about specific matters.  He was good enough to agree that there was something to be inquired into.  In a publication written only a few days ago he gave this expression to his thought, that he would not have given way to any particular criticism from an individual or small group but that the Opposition&mdash;that is the official Opposition &mdash;had convinced him that there was something to be considered.  He went out of his way deliberately to appoint three very important members of the judiciary to investigate certain charges, suspicions, or implications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely it would be the duty of any Government charged with responsibility, when they had the feeling that something had been aroused in the minds of the people to say: &ldquo;We must ventilate this grievance; we must have an open court at which people can give sworn testimony and express any <Col N="2205" /> opinions they have got or any suspicions they may have.&rdquo; After such charges, statements, suspicions or feelings of disquiet had been submitted to this non-party tribunal they could come to a certain conclusion.  Is it proper that the Government, having taken the responsibility of setting up such a tribunal, and after certain features in connection with it had been exposed, should suddenly come to this House and submit a Bill which is affected by the position created by charges that are now the subject of judicial inquiry? If I was a member of the Bar and was selected to sit on that tribunal, as soon as this Bill was introduced I would have resigned from it.  I had occasion to resign from another commission set up some time ago because of interference by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am leading up to this, that no accommodation should be given to the Minister for the Second Reading of this Bill, in case anybody suggests that something would have to be done with transport.  I agree that something has to be done about it.  It would be only fair to suggest that the Minister appears to be anticipating a judgment, that he is prejudicing the tribunal and its findings.  I shall be glad if the tribunal comes to the conclusion that nothing occurred that would interfere with the activities of any Government or with its power to have legislation of this kind.  I hope that will be the findings of the tribunal. This Bill contains 117 sections, ten schedules and four pages of explanatory matter, and is introduced in a manner that suggested that it must be <Col N="2206" /> disposed of as quickly as possible and was to be in operation not later than January, 1945.  At the same time we were told by the Minister that the purpose of the merging and setting up of this company was really a post-war matter.  There is no indication that something is going to happen now, but it was stated that some change will take place in the post-war period. That being so, what is the hurry?  Why antagonise men of goodwill, all of whom agree that there is a problem to be solved?  What is that problem? It is to make the best use of this country for its people.  It is admitted that a rigid form of transport could be considered the main life blood of a nation.  I do not agree with the views expressed by the last speaker.  The Deputy is a man of integrity and spoke with authority, but I do not agree that the Bill will make a total change in relations in certain quarters, whether amongst trades or individuals.</P>
      <P>I agree that there will be changes in transport.  Any man of vision will agree that there are going to be changes in the methods of transportation of goods and of people.  That view is accepted everywhere.  The world is in chaos, but out of that chaos we are going to have reorganisation.  That cannot be argued against by any reasonable person.  The Minister is very apt, very able, and nobody can challenge his ability.  He is very ready in giving expression to his views, but yesterday he did so haltingly.  He does not often offend in that way.  His statement was a halting one, one sentence contradicting the other.  I hope he will read his opening address and the reasons he gave for submitting this Bill to the House.  If he does he will find that he offended against the intelligence and the ability he possesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why was he hesitating, speaking in a halting way and searching for words? I do not deny that he acquainted himself with the transport problem, but he did not seem to be able to deal with it as one would expect him to.  Whether it is that he was uncertain about his case or that his conscience was in conflict with his mind, I do not know the reason.  He wanted to claim that this monopoly would not interfere with <Col N="2207" /> private enterprise.  People cannot ride two horses at the same time.  We cannot have monopoly and at the same time permit private interference with that monopoly.  The word &ldquo;monopoly&rdquo; is defined as control over certain activities.  The Greek root is something different.  It comes down to a &ldquo;sell&rdquo;, and I think this is the greatest sell-out the people of this country have ever been faced with.  There is nothing to compare with this corrupt bargain.  I put that term to the Minister, a corrupt, vicious, unsound, financial bargain, or, to use the words of our intellectual friend, Deputy Corry, this racket.</P>

      <P>Certainly I am speaking objectively.  I am going to prove it in the Bill or withdraw the words.  I say you are going to give £13,500,000, in the words of the Minister, to a number of individuals who, within the last few months, have taken power to control this company which, on the Minister's own statement, is obsolete, and its machinery and plant are not worth, in round figures, £4,500,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is only before the House.  It is proposed to take £20,000,000 of the ratepayers' money and to acquire a company which, according to the Minister's own very eloquent and colourful statement, is not worthy of consideration.  I am not misquoting the Minister.  I am quoting one of the members of his Party who said in this House that it was a racket, and who went further and said that the acquiring of this company was racketeering.  I think it will be found in the records of the House when it is printed.  I submit to the Minister that he should reconsider this matter and <Col N="2208" /> should not take it on himself to ignore the submission made by all Parties in the House and by members of his own Party that the matter should be reconsidered and the Bill redrafted in line with certain circumstances which may eventuate.  I know the Minister did not intend to make any promise to the private traders, but because there had been an organised political campaign in certain quarters, we have now got this sop thrown to the private traders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I were in the Minister's position I would say&mdash;I am going to have a State monopoly.  That is the only way to give service to the community.  We allowed a new form of transport to come into existence.  We tried to deal with it in 1924, in 1926, 1933, 1934, 1936, and again in 1938.  We found it was hopeless.  We, that is the Government of the country, went to these people and we empowered the railway under the Amalgamation Act of 1924 to buy out these commercial bodies.  They were managed by energetic men who had got their own private form of transport and were competing unjustly and unfairly with the railway, which had particular rights under particular statutory Acts.  This railway company is not one company.  It is a combination of absorbed companies, 26 in number, which in the amalgamated concern got special powers which, in my opinion, were bordering on being outside the Constitution, that is to say, they were interfering with what is recognised by our constitutional law, the right of private enterprise or private exploitation.  But it is true that the men with trucks, lorries and motor vehicles which were taken over by <i>force majeure</i> got compensation in a certain form.  One of the gentlemen who did so sell his interest to this particular merging company is in the foreground of its management to-day. He sold a lot of junk and got a fair price for it, and it is admitted by those who now control the company that a month after they bought that particular lot of running stock, only one vehicle of all they got was in running order.  One Deputy who has spoken said they bought a pig in a poke.  I <Col N="2209" /> do not think there was any pig in the poke, or if there was I think it was a swine, and a pretty scraggy swine at that.  I think it must have the measles. They bought these vehicles, and then found they had no value, but they used some of them to repair other vehicles. A short time afterwards we find there is still unfair competition going on. Then we license certain people.  We give power to private firms to carry goods and then find out that these private firms were not private firms, but were actually carriers, although not public carriers.  They were just black market carriers.  They used the vehicle for their own purposes, and if they carried a few packages for their friends they charged their friends a very reasonable price for carriage. They were prosecuted in some cases, but it was found that the law did not operate.  All they had to do was to go into court, and when they were asked: &ldquo;Did you carry your own goods?&rdquo; they would reply: &ldquo;That is my business.&rdquo; That was the answer.  It was held in law that they were not offenders.</P>
    <P>That went on, and the profits that should have accrued from what I may call the short haulage trade went to them, and with all deference to Deputy Dockrell I say the short haulage trade is the best paying form of haulage.  In the short haulage trade you get a reasonable return, at any rate.  Fifty per cent. of the firms carrying goods on the road were private traders, and were carrying traffic that should have been carried by the legitimate amalgamated railways.  That is true, and it is happening to-day.  There is no way of preventing it except by granting a monopoly under public ownership to the people of this country which will give good service and cheap transport.  But let us go a little further to investigate this problem. Last night I thought Deputy Corry was going to break down and shed tears.  It was harassing to see the way he spoke to the Minister who would never harm anyone.  Deputy Corry made him take on the character of a Torquemada, or some kind of individual who is trying to destroy life. The last thing the Minister would do <Col N="2210" /> would be to offend or deprive any workman of a full chance of life.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry is a loyal member of the Party.  On other occasions he has made some peculiar statements in this House.  We all remember the solution he had for the Six-County problem. His antidote for the intolerance of people up there was to pour prussic acid on them.  Now he suggests that the Minister is trying to deprive poor working men of something.  Some people, when they want to shed a tear in this country, talk about the poor working man.  Deputy Corry is worried about him.  The Minister is worried, too, but in a very minor way.  He is only interested in the redundant workman, to the extent that he gives him six months to get ready for starvation or, possibly, to become an inmate of a workhouse, or it may be to allow him to find a place to carry on his starvation outside of this territory, and so divorce him from his wife and children.  For that six months' limit he may get compensation.  The Minister, however, is very careful to see that the officials and the gentlemen who are allowed to run the railways will be amply compensated if they lose their jobs.  I have some history to convey to the Minister.  Possibly he is not short of it.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan sat on the stool of repentance to-day when he admitted that he introduced the Bill of 1924.  He was young and exuberant then.  His mind was of such a character that it may have been confused by the peculiar times in which we were then living. At any rate, he thought that he had drafted an amalgamation scheme that was almost humanly perfect.  He had all the draftsmen from the old British régime to advise him.  He drafted the Bill, and then brought two Scotsmen and a gentleman from London over. The three were set up as an economy committee.  They proceeded to cut out all wastage on the Great Southern Railways system and they did it with a vengeance.  According to the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, they singled the line from Dublin to Galway.  The Minister, in his opening statement on this Bill, deplored that fact, and suggested that it may have <Col N="2211" /> to be corrected.  Those gentlemen did that on the grounds of economy. Nobody will deny that Deputy McGilligan is a considerate man, that he is a humanist.  He proved it to-day when, like the salvationist, he went down on his knees and regretted certain things that he was committed to because of his association with the 1924 Act.  The Deputy himself went to court and pleaded for a man who made a claim for compensation under that Act.  He admitted that, according to that Act which he introduced himself, in his view the man was entitled to legitimate compensation because of his loss of employment, but the man's claim was estopped by the wording of the Act.</P>
    <P>I had some small acquaintance with that Act myself.  I had occasion to appear for 400 men before an arbitration court.  The court was somewhat sympathetic.  The great bulk of the men for whom I appeared got compensation. In one case I was considerably gratified that the man concerned got compensated twice over.  The court made an error and I did not correct it.  The man got two compensations, and is living and enjoying them now outside in Drimnagh.  The court made other mistakes.  When the court found that certain features were presenting themselves and that men were getting compensation, they corrected that position by bringing in an amending Act. There is a clause in it which says that if the company on the advice of the three experts&mdash;the gentleman from London and the two Scotsmen&mdash;will make the statement on oath in court that any individual was dismissed on the grounds of economy there is no case made: ergo, there is no compensation. Four men who had given over 20 years' service to the company died within a week of that judgment being given.  One committed suicide.  Another who had 35 years' service in the Great Southern Railways died on the street outside of Trinity College.  Men who have been in regular employment for so many years cannot take a rest. The only rest they have is in the grave. The fact is that men who go out on pension after 35 or 40 years' service will not live if they have not something <Col N="2212" /> to occupy their minds and bodies.  Those four men died within a week of that particular ruling being given by the court.  Some of them had been waiting for months to have their cases heard.  One man had been waiting two years.  Deputy McGilligan mentioned the case of a man who had been waiting seven years.  The Deputy appeared for him in court.  I do not think anybody will challenge my opinion that Deputy McGilligan is one of the ablest men at the Bar.  But he admitted to-day that, despite all his ability, he failed to get recognition for that man's claim, and all because of the drafting of that particular Act. After the decision in that case 3,000 men were found to be redundant not, I should point out, over the whole system but in what is called the Dublin area: that is, from Bray to Liffey Junction and to Inchicore.  They were thrown out in shoals, so to speak.</P>
    <P>The economy committee singled the main line from Dublin to Galway and closed down seven branch lines.  They sold the equipment to a certain individual. If he keeps going only long enough, and if the opportunity serves, he will soon own the whole country. He is buying up all the mansions in the country.  He bought up nearly all the plant that was found by this economy committee to be useless, and put the railways into the position in which the Minister says the Great Southern is in to-day&mdash;obsolete and ill-equipped for the task it has to do. These, I think, were the words used by the Minister.  These three experts, as I have said, found that the plant was useless.  They sold it to every Tom, Dick and Harry.  Several tons of railway metal were shipped out of the country to Japan, Italy and other countries at a pound a ton free on board.  I called the Minister's attention to that.  The best of steel was shipped out at that price; in fact, they could not get rid of it quickly enough.  What happened then?  A short time afterwards, after the three gentlemen who formed the economy committee had taken their departure to places unknown&mdash;they have never been heard of since&mdash;the railway company found that they had to buy the <Col N="2213" /> steel back.  I need not mention any names, but the gentleman who bought the metal at a throw-away price did not sell it back to the railway company at the same price.  If Deputies want to know the price at which this metal is selling to-day they can find it in the advertisements in the newspapers. The price is 13/6 a lineal foot for rails that were bought at about £1 a ton.</P>
    <P>I could talk for a long time about the incapacity of this particular company&mdash;that is the governing portion of it.  On the mechanical, the running and the accountancy side of the organisation, I want to say that they have some of the ablest men that any country has been blest with.  I want to tell the House a story.  I appeared one time on behalf of some railwaymen before Judge Cahir Davitt.  I kept the court for a whole day in session.  I was in very good form that day.  I saw to it that all the officials were brought there on subpoena.  There were 21 of them, including the general manager, the mechanical engineer and others. The last question that I asked each of them as they left the box was this: &ldquo;Is it possible that the railways are running to-day?&rdquo; All those innocent victims answered &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and said that the trains were running.  When the 21 officials had passed through the box I said to the judge: &ldquo;You have heard all those gentlemen, who allege that they run the railways, tell the court on oath that all the trains are running and that all the services are continuing.  Here they are all planted, the gentlemen who say they run the railways.  I suggest that the men running the railways are those who do the work and that these gentlemen here may give service, but do not give value. It is the man who takes the engine out of the boiler-house and puts it into service and guides it down the line who is running the railways.&rdquo; It is not this bunch of humbugs the Minister sets out in the Bill who are going to run the railways.  The manager objectively knows nothing about railways, he knows as much about them as the expert who answered my Question to-day as to whether the use of fuel had anything to do with the question of speed mileage.  Later on, during the <Col N="2214" /> course of the debate on this Bill, I may give the Minister a lesson on fuel values, and the gentleman who gave him that information will be sorry, from the point of view of technics. However, there is not time to deal with that now.  I need not tell the House I intend to continue talking until 9 o'clock, if I am in order.</P>
    <P>Is there any reason for this Bill?  Of course, there is.  There cannot be any confusion in our minds about our problem. The Minister has stated it for us &mdash;absolute chaos on the managerial side, obsolete plant, the state of emergency, trains not running to normal time schedules, services cut down. Something has to be done now, but the Minister does not say anything will be done under this Bill now.  No, that is a matter for the present management, during the emergency.  The Minister does not consult with those who are responsible, he does not consult the workers.  He was asked to intervene, to try to create a spirit of goodwill and harmony in adjusting certain difficulties which now present themselves. The Minister spoke of the conditions we may be confronted with after the war&mdash;next year or in later years.  No wise man, not even I, would suggest that the war will finish this year.  The Minister speaks of the post-war period and how does he approach it?</P>
    <P>Is not this a very generous way to approach it?  In 1943, the following prices were paid on the Stock Exchange in Dublin for these properties: Common Stock, 26th March, £9; 25th June, £10; 29th September, £19; in October, £29.  Somebody got a little Christmas box by the end of the year, but on 28th January, 1944, the price was £49; on the 29th February it was £56.  I wonder if agriculturists in this House could get a return from their land based on those figures&mdash;from £9 to £56 in less than a year.</P>
    <P>Who got that money?  I am not allowed by the rules of the House&mdash;the Ceann Comhairle is watching carefully &mdash;to name the people who got that money.  I have a list of them here and, later on, I will see that somebody does know who got it.  However, the widow and the orphan, the thrifty man, the farmer who has saved a little money, <Col N="2215" /> had money invested in this company. The value of that railway was not £26,000,000 on the 1st January, 1943. Nobody knows what the value was but, basing it on the market price of the stock, we know that it was within certain measured figures.  We did not buy and we did not bring in a merger on the 1st January, 1943.  No; we waited while the &ldquo;boyos&rdquo; had used the position of the Great Southern Railways, either by checking down the stock, by rising it, by publicity, false statements, and so on, until people would rush in to buy it and eventually land themselves with stock worth £56.  This took a slight drop and then went back again to £56.  When the House closes the session this week, I would like to tell Deputies who speculate on the Stock Exchange to get rid of the Great Southern Railways stock, as in a very few weeks I think it will go back to £9.</P>
    <P>We suggest that, by giving the people who own these debentures this guaranteed preference stock, we are going to give them £13,500,000.  If you came in here and asked for a loan of £1,000 to put shoes on barefooted children in Dublin, you would be told there was no money for that purpose. In regard to giving a meal to a hungry child at school, you would be told that the Government could give no money and that the ratepayers of Dublin would have to pay for that.  Yet, here are some gentlemen, well-clothed, well-established, some of them with seven, eight or 12 directorships, some of them carrying as much as £1,000 or £2,000 a year for the so-called direction of companies; and these gentlemen are given £13,500,000 of the taxpayers' money to play with.  That is paid for a railway that is junk&mdash;obsolete, as the Minister calls it&mdash;not in a position to do the work necessary and which will have to be almost re-created and renewed as from scrap.  Was there ever a more outrageous suggestion made in any public assembly?</P>
    <P>Al Capone&mdash;and I knew him very well-used to muscle in on other people's territory.  I wonder who is muscling in on the railway territory now?  Al Capone did things in a very friendly way&mdash;he tried moral suasion <Col N="2216" /> at first and only later had recourse to the gun.  If a man here takes up a gun to another man and robs him, he is rightly brought before the courts.  I wonder what kind of gun Fianna Fáil is using here?  I am telling this House, whether it likes it or not, that there are members&mdash;automatons&mdash;who, in their own souls, know they are doing wrong to give £13,500,000 in this way.</P>
    <P>The total Budget of this country, according to the statement to-day, is about £50,000,000.  That has to meet all the household expenses&mdash;the poverty and unemployment problems and all the other problems.  Here, however, are men who are admittedly exploiting their knowledge and who bought shares at £9 which are now worth £56, and we are about to give them £13,500,000.  That is not watered capital&mdash;of course not.  My opinion is that, if any men should be brought to the Criminal Court, it is the men who hold this stock at present; and I think there are men in this country who could prove the indictment, if that were done.</P>
    <P>I do not believe I have heard a more audacious thing ever suggested by anyone.  If I sold a lb. of butter for 1/2d. extra, in some little shop in Dublin, or gave four cigarettes instead of five, for a certain number of coppers, I would be prosecuted.  Here, however, gentlemen come along and say they own the Great Southern Railways Company, including the property of the citizens of Dublin, the Dublin United Transport Company, and we are going to give them £13,500,000. Then, out of the balance of about £6,000,000, will we recreate the transport system of the Twenty-Six Counties? Oh, no, there is one step which we dare not take.  We are not interfering with the best-paying proposition in the country.  That is outside this Parliament.  It is just the Great Southern Railways&mdash;the junk pile.</P>
    <P>One of the best-paying concerns in this or any other country is the animal-packing organisation called the Dublin Transport Company.  Let us turn to the Dublin Transport Company and see what has been going on there.  In 1927 there were certain gentlemen appointed to a position <Col N="2217" /> under the law, and in this connection Deputy McGilligan and his friends will have to take a certain responsibility. There were three commissioners appointed in the City of Dublin.  They were selected to run this little burg.  Of course, they were very able men.  They had with them a town clerk, but they had no lord mayor, aldermen or common councillors like myself.  They made a deal with certain people who at that time got some control.  The same individuals have got control of the Great Southern Railways.  No names, no pack drill, but all of you will know before this little business is through who they are.  A document in the form of an agreement was drawn up and that document did not see the light until a couple of weeks ago, when, more or less by accident, I asked a question and got an answer from a certain official in the corporation.</P>
    <P>I insisted on getting a copy of that document.  It is a legal instrument. I am not an authority upon legal matters, though I suppose I have contributed more money to the profession than many other men.  Any man who ever prosecuted or defended me has always &ldquo;gone up&rdquo;, as they say. On February 3rd, 1927, an agreement was drawn up between &ldquo;the Honourable Lord Mayor, the aldermen and burgesses of Dublin,&rdquo; and other people.  That is a lie, because there was no lord mayor and there were no aldermen or burgesses.  They were &ldquo;acting by the Commissioners of the County Borough of Dublin, hereinafter called the Corporation, of the one part and the Dublin United Tramways Company...&rdquo; May I remind the Minister that in his introductory statement he referred to the right of the Dublin Corporation to the tramways?  He was very emphatic about that; he paused and repeated &ldquo;the tramways.&rdquo; The agreement went on to say &ldquo;... and the Dublin United Tramways Company, 1896, hereinafter called the company, of the other part.  Whereas by Section 51 of the Dublin United Tramways (Electrical Power) Act, 1897, it is enacted as follows...&rdquo; I do not know whether the Ceann Comhairle will <Col N="2218" /> allow me to quote this document <i>in extenso</i>, but perhaps it would be better if I gave the gist of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a lengthy document, but it is very important. With your permission, I will refer to certain relevant passages.  To put it in my own language, this is an agreement between the Dublin Tramways Company and three gentlemen acting on behalf of the citizens of Dublin to give the Dublin Tramways Company an extension of their lease to the year 1966 for a consideration, the consideration being that they would re-open the Lucan tramways, supply power to those citizens of Dublin who live within a certain area of the Lucan electrical power station, and do certain things in connection with the roadways, not only keeping them in proper condition, but proposing under certain provisions of the agreement to put silent pavements in certain streets to the extent of 11 miles in length and to the full space between the trams and 18 inches on each side of the tram lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They bought out the shareholders, who were few in number.  They paid £805 in that connection and they got power to bring in an Act, which was a private Act, a copy of which I have got.  The title of that Act, which is no doubt known to some of the men who read it in the Library, is the Dublin United Tramways (Lucan Electric Railways) Act, 1927 (No. 2). You can buy it for 9d., although it is a private Act.  The reason why it is a private Act is because the group carrying on this little negotiation did not want the public to know.  We did know there was an extension of the lease, and we did eventually get the Act and the agreement.  The agreement covers seven pages.  It is the usual document, drafted by legal lights&mdash;a lot of unnecessary words, every other paragraph contradicting the preceding one, and it takes two or three lawyers to interpret it.  It is very clear to me what it conveyed.  The Dublin United Tramways Company was the originating company.  It is now known as the <Col N="2219" /> Dublin Transport Company, and that company must take all the rights and liabilities over.  They cannot evade their responsibilities; they must take the bad with the good, and they took over this document known as the agreement.</P>
    <P>How did they carry that agreement out?  They did re-open the Lucan tramways with a sort of shadow service and behind the shadow they commenced to operate.  Once they got the owners bought out, they worked the station for a while and then closed it down.  They never did one day's work or spent a penny in respect of the other portions of the agreement, although much of it was laid down as mandatory.  One clause set out that if they failed to do certain things the Minister for Industry and Commerce would be called in to decide whether they had properly carried out the terms of the agreement.  I do not suppose the Minister ever heard of that agreement.  They certainly did not carry out its terms.  I suggest, if all that is true, that any negotiations the Minister has been carrying on with the Dublin Transport Company are null and void.  You have no right to sell out the interests of the Dublin citizens to the Dublin Transport Company and they have no right to the tram lines in Dublin.  I could go further and say that they have no right to use the streets of Dublin; even though they pay £14,000 a year for wayleaves, that gives them no right to run buses on the streets.  They cannot do so except with the permission of the Lord Mayor, the aldermen and burgesses.  There has been no emergency law passed taking the right out of our hands to control the streets.  It is admitted even by the Minister that we have rights of ownership with regard to the tramways.</P>
    <P>Being in a generous mood, he will be good enough to treat with us and possibly come to an accommodation with us.  I suggest that before he does that he should first tell the Dublin Transport Company: &ldquo;Get out of the picture; you have no rights in this thing and we will not discuss the matter with <Col N="2220" /> you.  We will discuss it with the citizens of Dublin, who comprise more than one-third of the 26 counties, the part of the nation we control.&rdquo; Surely that is the honest, businesslike way of doing it.  It may be we could come to an accommodation with the Minister and say: &ldquo;Take control of the transport arrangements of the 26 counties, leaving out the Great Northern for the time being, until we get the hardheaded fellows of the Six Counties to come to a business arrangement.  We are going to meet you and get accommodation with you and never mind the speculators, the stock exchange sharks or the industrial Al Capones. Leave them on one side, deal with the people and the people, we are quite sure, will be reasonable enough.&rdquo; After all, it is only through the Government that this thing can be done.</P>
    <P>This merger is merely a stock exchange merger.  It is not a merger of organised services into a company which will give service for a price.  It is merely giving this gang of speculators, who have got this property under their control by a mischievous campaign of lying, misleading poor adventurous souls who had money to burn, an opportunity to deny the right of the common people to the ownership of that land, rolling-stock, engines and established workshops which should belong to them.  I have been advocating that the service should be in the public ownership.  I believe that out of this particular little controversy that we are having with the Minister something may arise in the way of a business arrangement.  Why does the Minister hesitate about having public ownership of a public utility?  Is there any logical reason for it?  I remember talking to him, in the days when we used to talk pleasantly about these things, just after his getting the office that he holds, about nationalisation.  I did not use the word, but we did use the word in the course of conversation.  He agreed that he believed in it.  He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The only difficulty is the Seanad. We do not think we can get a nationalisation scheme through the Seanad&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2221" /> Then they just blew that body out of existence.  After they had purged their souls, they began to feel the prickings of conscience and to wonder what they were to do with these poor, unfortunate political hangers-on who could not get elected as dog-catchers.  Then they decided to have a new Seanad and started to elect and appoint them.  There are men sitting there who could not get one vote, yet they are getting £360 a year.</P>

      <P>You will pardon me, Sir, for that aside.  I would not offend you for any reason under the sun.  I want to try to be orderly.  I submit that if an approach had been made on the ground that a public utility should be owned by the people, both sides of the House, irrespective of whether or not they believe in public ownership, have come to realise that it is a public necessity that this service would be better under public control than under this bastard form of private enterprise, because that is all it is.  There is no use in humbugging and masquerading and pretending that it is an approach to public ownership.  It is not.  It is building up an impregnable wall against public ownership of a public utility over a period of years until the personnel of this House is changed and men come in here later who will take over the material things of this nation and utilise them for the benefit of the Irish people and not for the benefit of the few.  That day may be a little distant or, in the old Parliamentary phrase, may be in the not far distant future.  But I do not think it is so far distant as some people think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2222" /> When we see an intelligent man coming to the conclusion expressed by the mover of the amendment, because he is forced by necessity to agree that this utility is essentially one that might be called a national concern, Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, an able and intellectual man, agreeing that there is no way out but public ownership, and Deputy McGilligan, who, being a Six-County man, is bound to be an intelligent man, also agreeing that there is only one solution, namely, public ownership, why does the Minister hesitate? He believes in nationalisation; I call it public ownership.  He said the Seanad would be the only obstacle, but there is a new Seanad now.  If we in this House could agree on submitting a plan of public ownership, I believe that they would not only approve of what we submitted to them but would give 100 per cent. support to such a plan.</P>
    <P>That brings me to an opinion expressed by a Dublin trader.  He said: &ldquo;Have you considered the change not only in the minds of men, but in the means of communication between man and man?  Have we ignored this feature of our so-called civilisation?&rdquo; There is no use talking about civilisation these days when millions of men are hurled against each other.  But, whatever kind of social association we have got, we have to live together in this country.  How big is this country? That man was speaking about long haulage and short haulage and how railway companies in America considered that there is no paying haulage traffic under 100 miles.  We have not 100 miles of straight haulage in any direction.  Suppose we call it 165 miles to Cork.  That may be a little too much, but if you take it the other way it balances up.  If we take Athlone as the centre, it would be about 80 miles each way.  We have a peculiarly situated country, and from the transport point of view everything can be done here much more cheaply than in any other country I know.  It is not elongated like what is called the heel of Italy.  Here we have a little country from the centre of which to the sea is about 80 miles in every direction.  You could walk across it in a day.  From North to South, I suppose, it would take three days.  We have this little <Col N="2223" /> problem and we cannot even discuss it as reasonable men.  We bring in our own partisan point of view and do not consider the needs of the people.</P>
    <P>For a fortnight here we discussed the basic industry of this country&mdash;agriculture. We all know that it is the basic industry.  How do we meet the needs of that industry?  The important thing in connection with agriculture is transportation. If we had a system of transportation under which we would not charge anything, either per mile or per ton, for services in connection with agriculture we would be carrying out a good sound economic policy.  Deputy Healy has complained about the way he has been treated by a foreign combine and by this particular railway. It is an axiom in economics that the furthest point has as much right to service as the nearest; in other words, there should be equalisation of service. The man who gets a service from Drimnagh to Dublin should have the same rights as the man who comes from Merrion Square to Dublin, if we ran a proper service, but under private enterprise we charge as we like.</P>
    <P>We have railway tribunals and all kinds of boards where we waste our time arguing against each other, but if we had a publicly-owned service, would we not realise that the people who have to live in Kerry should get a larger share of sympathy and assistance than those who are happily situated in the economic zone of Dublin, and similarly with regard to people in Mayo and Donegal?  Would we not equalise matters, so far as mileage difficulties are concerned, so as to give service to people in the outer fringe of the nation, and make it pay, charging a little more to the person who has more generous facilities than others?  Deputy Healy had a load of fish on which working men were depending.  These men go out on the seas, face all kinds of hazards not the least of which is death, and bring in a large, medium or small catch. These men, all our own citizens, are then subject to the idiosyncrasies of some individual who has no concern with this country, but who sits in an office in Dublin and says: &ldquo;The boat <Col N="2224" /> has gone; the stuff was not at Kingsbridge in time and therefore it can rot.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am pointing out the need for public service and showing that, by a system of public ownership, we could give service to everybody at the same price.  What do we propose to do under this document of 117 clauses, ten schedules and four supplementary pages?  We propose to give some gentleman in Dublin, who never contributed one useful hour's service to this nation, the right to exploit the people of this nation, and to give him, for property rights which, on January 1st, 1943, were valued at something like £4,500,000, a sum of £13,500,000.  Was there ever a case in history of such foolish generosity being extended to people unworthy of sympathy, unworthy even of sustenance, in my opinion, and unworthy of citizenship in a nation such as this&mdash;men who will go out and buy stock from the hard-pressed widow or the thrifty workman who has some £100 invested and whose shares, under pressure of certain public statements to the effect that the railways were in a bad condition and that there was a possibility of no dividends being paid, were suddenly thrown on the market, to save whatever could be saved, at a value of £9, and seized by the greedy commercial sharks.  These are now worth £56.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have sufficient intelligence and sufficient matter to bring forward to make repetition unnecessary, but sometimes a good thing cannot be repeated too often.  I have been intimidated by the bad manners of the Minister who repeated himself half a dozen times, and if I follow him, I think you, Sir, will forgive me. In this case, however, I do not propose <Col N="2225" /> to offend.  I want to talk now about the workers and, if necessary, to shed a tear to move your hearts. What will be the position of these workers under this merger?  It has been stated that certain people in official positions will be compensated, if found to be redundant.  I would use the word &ldquo;useless&rdquo;, and I could prove that they are useless, but let us see how this compensation provision operated in 1926.</P>
      <P>There was a gentleman who had nine years' service as chief mechanical engineer with the company who, having been found to be unnecessary, was entitled to compensation under the Act.  He was not brought before the arbitrator; a private deal was made with him by which he got £9 a week for life.  He commuted the pension and shook the dust of this country from his shoes and departed for places unknown.  When he reached another place, I believe he immediately got a very responsible position at £1,500 a year, but, so long as he lives, he will get £9 a week from this country.</P>
      <P>He was only one.  Another gentleman who was buying agent in England for 15 years got £500 a year for life. He never did one useful day's service. Everybody knows he was appointed for political reasons.  It used to be said that the personnel of the managerial staff of this railway were all gentlemen born.  They used to advertise for gentlemen born who were able to ride to hounds.  One gentleman, the manager of the Midland Great Western Railway, stated on oath that he could manage all the Irish railways and have three days' fishing and hunting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That was some years ago, surely?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I want to show that the outlook of people has not changed.  In 1924, it is true that every official got a private settlement of his claim, but the workers had to go before an arbitrator.  The Minister in this measure is not unmindful of the workers.  He visualises that men who become redundant will be disemployed, and he allows a period of six months after the measure becomes an Act during which these men can claim compensation. <Col N="2226" /> In the light of what happened in 1924 and 1926, and of what happened for seven or eight years afterwards when men failed to get compensation, how can we ask anyone to accept this Bill, unless there are amongst its clauses provisions stating emphatically that any worker in the employment of the company on the first day of 1943 will get compensation when found to be redundant?  There would be some right, some equity about that.  But no&mdash;these men have to submit their cases, and if they go one day outside the six months, they are not entitled to any compensation. Is that fair or proper?  I ask the House on that ground alone to urge the Minister to withdraw this measure and have it redrafted.</P>
      <P>We are told that under the Bill this advisory board, the chairman and the Minister have powers over any portions of our public transport services. The rigid form of transport is the railway, which is a fixed quantity, and, of course, there is always an advantage in a non-rigid form of transportation, which is the reason that road services can always compete successfully with railways.  A man who gets on an engine at Kingsbridge to go to Cork, Ballybrophy or any other centre must keep on two lines, but the man driving a motor vehicle can move around the roads and supply the needs of different areas with his fluid form of transport.  What about the canals? Why were the canals ignored in this matter?  My friend, Deputy Davin, in his humorous way, suggested that it was because Jim Larkin speaks for canal workers.  I speak for many of the canal workers and I have tried to get the Minister to listen to my voice in connection with a body of men working the canals.  But no; he will not listen to anyone who can speak of the needs of the working classes as I can&mdash;blaming them when they are wrong, cherishing them when they are right, and encouraging them at all times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But in this the Minister takes power to deal with that matter.  So far as the Grand Canal Company is concerned, there is a peculiar feature about that matter here.  Certain sections <Col N="2227" /> of this Bill will interfere to some extent with the Grand Canal Company, but since you are going so far, why not take the bulk of the control of the Grand Canal Company?  Surely that company performs a very useful service so far as the transport of goods in bulk is concerned?  It cannot be denied that the canals are able to carry bulk cargo cheaper than any other transport service, and even though I disagree sometimes with their charges, still I must admit that they have the right, under the law as it exists at present, to make those charges.  In general, however, as I have said, I think it will not be denied that they can carry bulk cargoes cheaper than other transport services can carry them.  In connection with the management of the Grand Canal Company, however, there was one gentleman whom I mentioned here&mdash;a personal friend of mine, or at least he says so, but &ldquo;no names, no pack drill&rdquo;, and I should like to point out that the men working for that canal company have practically no protection from the industrial point of view. I admit that they are a pretty hard lot of boys, but they work hard for the small pay that they get.  The one great thing about them is that their outlook on the work they do is not so much from the point of view of their wages as from what one might call the spiritual side of their work, and when they get into a certain mood, they just stop the boat, get a couple of greyhounds, or go and work on their potato plots or turf banks, somewhat like the manager of the company to whom I have referred, and then resume their work on the boat. Accordingly, I say that these are men with a proper spiritual idea and that to that extent they are people with proper ideals of human liberty.</P>
    <P>Why was it that the Grand Canal Company was left out&mdash;the two canal companies, actually, since the only one mentioned is the Grand Canal, and the Royal Canal seems to have been forgotten?  As regards the Royal Canal there is practically no traffic. Of course, under some ancient King's <Col N="2228" /> statute one barge per year must go through.  On every side of that canal, in the country through which it passes, cargo is waiting to be picked up, cargo which is of particular importance now in order to supply the needs of the Dublin citizens.  The canal goes right through some of the biggest bog areas in the country, but yet the canal is not being utilised as it should be.  Go down to the Grand Canal, and what do we find there?  We find a condition that cannot be equalled anywhere. That company exploits this country without any consideration for the public as to the services they can render or the prices they charge, and yet they are allowed to escape this proposed merger.  Why not link them all up?  Why not link up all the various types of transport, such as waterways, canals and so on, that can be usefully employed in the transport of merchandise?  For certain types of traffic you may have to rely on the railways or road services, but so far as bulk cargoes are concerned, such as wheat, beet or turf, why not use our inland waterways?  You have big cargoes coming from Waterford by canal, even such valuable commodities at the present time as tea and tobacco. I suppose the freight on these cargoes is very high, and I suppose there is the possibility that some of the men take their share.  Outside of such cargoes, however, you have turf, wheat and coal, all of which are very important.  I say that the canals ought to be teeming with active units working for the transport of such cargoes, and it should cost very little to work such a system.  All that is required is a little oil in some cases, but in the majority of cases it is a horse-drawn traffic.  In that connection, these canals should be properly dredged.  As was pointed out to-day by a former speaker, in some cases there is a draft of only a couple of inches because no dredging has been done, which makes it practically impossible for the unfortunate horses to drag the barges.  Dredging should be going on all the time all over our canal systems, but I suppose that that could not be done because of the influence of the stockholder to whom I have referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, Sir, I always say that the nearer the bone the sweeter the meat.  However, my contention is that we have no right in this House to submit public utilities to the control of any private concern.  The present proposal amounts to a kind of a stock exchange merger.  We are offering stock.  We are buying junk at a price of about £20,000,000 and giving £6,500,000 to these people to play with, although anybody who knows anything about that concern, or who buys or sells common stock, knows that there is nothing there and that there is no collateral behind it.  In speaking of the canal company, I am speaking of something that I know all about.  I know every line of it and the properties upon it.  Let me show the unwisdom of this.  When a question was asked as to what coal we had in stock, we could not be told.  The House is still waiting for information on that point. Some of us, however, knew what the tonnage was and where it was lying. We know what stocks of coal there were, from the day the crisis arose until to-day.  We know that the country is seriously and badly handicapped in that respect, but when we put up serious proposals to help the Government and try to remedy that position we are treated with discourtesy, and more than discourtesy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that we will have to accept this Bill as it stands now, with a view to passing it eventually into law. When once it becomes law this House will have no further relation with or control over the situation.  You are going to pay £20,000,000 for junk, hand over £6,500,000 for working capital, <Col N="2230" /> etc., and yet you will have no right to say yea or nay in connection with any complaints, once this becomes law, with regard to certain individuals such as, in the first place, the manager and, in the second place, certain people who will be associated with him.  Whatever they do, or whatever plans they may consult together about and devise, nobody can control them.  The Minister can be brought into consultation, but he has no other right of interference, and if the Minister does not interfere, then the manager has all the more freedom to do what he likes.  Did anybody ever hear of any such proposal where public moneys are being involved? You have the same kind of thing in connection with all the other semi-Government companies or organisations, and we should like to know whose was the clever mind that set them up.  They are all the same, and yet they are all different, we are now told.  They never account to this House for any expenditure.  They never explain any of their difficulties to this House.  One cannot call for an account from these shipping companies, sugar companies and companies of that type.  They are so organised that they are beyond our power.  In one case, the Minister for Industry and Commerce has control and, in another case, the Minister for Finance has control.  That is the only link between the taxpayers and these firms.</P>
    <P>I suggest that it is time to change that policy.  Broaden out the terms of this Bill.  Bring into consultation every member of the different parties as well as individual citizens outside and say: &ldquo;This is your property; we want to relate you to it and to associate you with it.  Throw all the energies of your mind and body into this problem of ours&mdash;transportation.&rdquo; None of us here would be so ungracious to each other as to suggest that the present means of transportation represent the last word in that respect.  I may be a dreamer but I visualise a total change in the form of communications. I suggested to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, when his Vote was before the House, that, instead of having those lads at Collinstown and Baldonnel, he should organise an aviation service to carry mails which are <Col N="2231" /> being interfered with by another Government. I know that we have no right to intrude on the territory of other countries but, in our own country, we could organise hops from Dublin to Waterford, Limerick, Galway and Tralee for our own mail.  It would be good exercise for the boys at Collinstown.  Nearly all the leading American pilots in the war, especially those on night fighters, were engaged in carrying mail in the United States. It is a most useful training.  Why should not our boys be trained similarly and why should not urgent messages and fast mail be carried by them?  It would cost very little to put the unemployed in Dublin&mdash;12,000 of them&mdash;to the making of another landing place in addition to Collinstown, though we have got one of the finest fields in Western Europe.  The same would apply to Kilkenny, Limerick, Cork and Galway, and right up to Letterkenny.  We would then have this revolving circus carrying all sorts of urgent and precious commodities. It could carry cream or, if there were a good catch of salmon, it could be loaded up and taken to the market, at which it could be sold at a good price.  There would be no wastage and there would be economy of energy and opportunity, while satisfactory returns would be forthcoming for the service rendered.</P>
    <P>There is another matter&mdash;I think it is an important matter&mdash;to which I wish to draw the Minister's attention. I suggest that the Minister take into his confidence some expert on railways as well as experts on road transport. I do not refer to the type who have got an accountancy kind of mind but rather to actual operators.  There are very good men in the Great Southern Railways Company who would be useful for this purpose.  Ask them for the truth&mdash;not book statements or reports from certain interested individuals.  If you cannot get all the information necessary as to forms of transportation, bring in the experts who are in the country at present, without going, as they did in 1924, outside.  If you make mistakes it is better to make them out of goodwill than to make them deliberately <Col N="2232" /> to injure the credit of this country, as was done in 1924.  I say that with a full sense of responsibility.  There are men of the right type in the public service&mdash;some of them in the Civil Service.  Despite what anybody may say, I have come across men in the Civil Service who are equal to any men in any Government or in any administration in any part of the English-speaking world.  We need never be ashamed of them.  I have met, consulted and argued with them and I know how keen they are to give a large measure of service, though they are tied down by certain regulations and restrictions.  You cannot challenge their intelligence, their ordered minds or their knowledge.  I say that they are equal to any men in any part of the English-speaking world&mdash;and I have travelled the greater part of the world.  Yet, they move around as ordinary, first-class or second-class established officers.  I have heard it said that we should not give the running of a railway to a civil servant.  I could mention one or two civil servants who have proved their capacity.  I would not be fearful so long as the man concerned got power to move and would not be tied up with all sorts of regulations and red tape.</P>
    <P>There is a way out of this difficulty. Take over these utilities, with our goodwill, as public utilities under public ownership and we will support you.  Appoint a manager.  Nobody will say a word against that.  Never mind these humbugs on advisory committees or those who represent certain interests.  Put in a manager and then get the technicians.  Get a chief mechanical engineer for rail transport and a chief mechanical engineer for road transport and all the interlocking men that you require.  Put a man in charge of the canal.  Let them all work in harmony under the direction of that manager.  Let the manager report to the Minister and let the Minister report to this House.  I do not think there is a man on either side of the House who would quarrel with that.  We would vote £20,000,000 without hesitation if we knew that the Minister was going to use that sum of £20,000,000 for the purpose I have <Col N="2233" /> mentioned.  But I propose to vote against the Minister getting £13,500,000 to give to a bundle of speculators and stock exchange sharks.  I say that with every sense of responsibility.  I do not mind if you put in a valuer.  Get the best valuation you can of the industrial capital involved.  Let the valuers go on for six months and value the whole plant&mdash;rails, engines and so forth. When the Minister was speaking disparagingly of the railway, I was thinking of a man here who invented a locomotive boiler which, I think, is as good a boiler, in terms of power and speed, as I know on any railway system here or elsewhere.  If that man can produce that type of power machine, are there not other men in engineering circles in our country who could make engines equal to those produced in any other country if they got the opportunity? But we have neither the will nor the sense to start up a national workshop to make not only our own flying machines, but even mechanical milkers and machines of all kinds.  We do not even make a churn.  We could make these things, but we get no opportunity. Here is a chance for a man of the Minister's vision to see opportunities. Turn Inchicore into a national workshop, every activity in connection with power to be expressed there by men who know how and who can teach others to come along and develop.  Is it not an extraordinary thing that in Sweden, with 7,000,000 of a population, 82 per cent. of their traffic is propelled by power derived from fuel of which we have got more than enough&mdash;either timber or turf? Here we have only a handful of these gas-producer plants propelling our vehicles along the roads.</P>
    <P>We could put ourselves in a position second to no other country in the world if we had only the vision.  We have got the intelligence and we have the ability if we only utilised our national resources in a proper way. We are a creditor nation and if the capital which it is proposed to provide for this undertaking were employed as it should be in providing work for our people, there is not only food for thought but food for immediate action.  Why should we put this money into the banks in the <Col N="2234" /> name and to the credit of the individuals who have exploited the position of this country?  I say it would be a crime.  By all means let us put a value on the railways and the road transport &mdash;I do not care who is the man who does that&mdash;and let us not do any harm to the men and women who held stock in January, 1943.  I suggest that that be the appointed date for the purposes of this valuation and that we pay the ordinary market value of the stock on the 1st January, 1943, to anybody who held stock at that time.  I remember that, in 1928, 1932 or 1933, the Government could have bought the £26,000,000 worth of stock, that was alleged to constitute the property owned and controlled by the Great Southern Railway Company and the other absorbed companies, on the stock exchange market for less than £8,000,000.  They could have sent their agents into the stock exchange and bought all the property for £8,000,000.  The Government did not do that but took other measures which some people alleged was confiscation.  They lowered the values of some of the stock by 90 per cent. and of certain other stock by 50 per cent.  I think that was a courageous thing to do and I think it was well to get rid of the humbug which pretended that the railways were worth £26,000,000.  I do not believe they were ever worth that.  We know that there was any amount of watered capital in the concern and we know that, in less than a few months after that reorganisation, the property that was supposed to be worth £9,000,000, openly expressed, rapidly deteriorated from a market standpoint so that it could have been bought at about £7,000,000.  That property is now worth, in your figures, £13,500,000.</P>
    <P>I say that is not a fair and businesslike arrangement.  By all means get valuers in to value the property or call in an arbitrator.  You are bringing in an arbitrator to deal with questions in which men's lives are involved.  Why not bring in an arbitrator to deal with material things?  The question of whether a man is to get compensation after six months, a question that may affect his whole destiny, is to be submitted to the arbitration of an individual who is to be brought in, but when <Col N="2235" /> it is a question of buying dead matter, you do not bring in an arbitrator or a valuer at all.  You just sit down in your own smug way and say: &ldquo;We shall give you £13,500,000 for that.&rdquo; Is that fair or equitable?  When it is a question of getting men for certain work we try to place a value on these men's services by competitive examination. A man joining the army is examined as to his physical capacity and if he is not a fit instrument for offensive or defensive purposes we do not take him in.  Here we propose to buy what is the industrial heart-blood of the nation, we buy it on a book debt, merely on a statement made that it is worth a certain figure at a certain date.  I think that is a kind of financial suicide and the man who is responsible for this plan should be examined by a psychiatrist.  There are saner men in Grangegorman and Donabate than the man who put that plan before you.</P>
    <P>There is no reason in this and there is no expert to state what is the value of the property.  There is no expert to tell you how he could save the situation and how this organisation could be moulded into a useful adjunct to the rest of our economic resources. None of these things is visualised or set down in the document presented to you.  I suggest that it is an attempt to take advantage of the House, that it is a scheme which would not be put forward in your cool and collected moments.  I suggest that the Minister should again go into the silences and consider the views presented to him from all sides of the House.  I know the representatives of the Government Party are not pledged to oppose the Bill but they are pledged, from what I have heard listening to them, to support Dublin's claims and to see that there is a reconsideration in this measure of the question of the ownership of Dublin's streets and traffic. There are three members of the Fianna Fáil Party sitting with us on the corporation, three men who have always given service to the citizens of Dublin, and if they are honest to themselves, they must vote against this measure.  If they do not vote against <Col N="2236" /> the measure, I suggest to them that political oblivion awaits them because the people of Dublin are aroused about this matter.  I would not suggest that the Minister should join in this protest but, knowing his interest in the city, I think that he should see that he is bound to protect the interests of the citizens.  Surely he should see that our streets, our roads, and our property are being given away, openly, nakedly, and unashamedly.</P>
    <P>What are we going to do with our housing programme?  If you agree to what is set out in this measure, you are denying the thing we have been fighting for, the chief means of communication which convey people to and from their homes to the industrial plants in which they work.  At the present time we have a serious position in Dublin.  The men engaged in the building trade are sending in an appeal asking that arrangements might be made under the present transport system so that they could get accommodation on these vehicles to convey them to and from their work.  Men cannot get to work in the morning and cannot get home in the evening.  They are asking that there should be some relaxation in the regulations so that they might get a service between 6 o'clock and 9 o'clock.  They have not dared to ask for cheaper fares, although I think a good case could be made for that, but at the present moment many of them cannot get accommodation on the buses and are forced to walk two or three miles, some of them even up to five miles, to get to their work and get back in the evening.  We are told that the present service is the best that we can get.  It is not the best we can get; it is only a makeshift.  If we had men who only knew how to run the service there would be no need for mergers.  It is all very well to say we have no petrol, but we know that petrol is needed only for priming purposes.  Again there is any amount of rubber in the city, if an attempt were only made to gather up that rubber.  Even in this House there is rubber that could be replaced by some other material.  We could get this rubber back to the factories to be prepared for use in essential services. <Col N="2237" /> There is hardly a place in Dublin where rubber is not being used.  I do not go into public houses but every time I pass the door of one I see a mat there.</P>
    <P>Nearly everywhere you will find rubber.  Even on the buses you will find rubber steps.  All that spare rubber or waste rubber or neglected rubber could be made to serve.  They do not do that.  They simply ignore the public.  The public try to co-operate. They queue at the bus-stops.  What reward do they get for that?  Advantage is taken of them.  The bus that used to carry, say, 30 passengers is now carrying 60 to 70 passengers.  An Order was suspended by the Minister. Nobody was supposed to stand in a mechanically-driven vehicle.  Now, we have ten and 12 people standing, fighting each other.  People have to pay more for travelling on a bus than they would have to pay on a motor car.  The bus company is earning more per mile than any taxi driver in Dublin.  That is not equalled in any portion of the known earth.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister is taking these matters into consideration. I notice he has got into a somnolent mood.  Possibly, when he does awaken to the facts of the situation he may agree to the amendment which has been drafted by the Leader of the Opposition and supported by men of goodwill on every side of the House. Of course, unfortunately, the women members of this House do not speak. Some day I hope to hear one of them utter a sentence.  So far I have not heard them.  I am greatly interested in women speaking because they always speak with a certain amount of assurance.  I am quite sure the women in the House, on both sides, will be with us in this matter, because it is a woman's question.  It is a question of honesty and probity in public life and I feel sure that, having a sense of responsibility for the nation, they will see that nothing unjust is done and that there will be no denial of opportunity to the next generation.</P>
    <P>I believe that this particular Bill and the idea to merge this particular company with other concerns means building up a rigid wall of privilege. I have fought against privilege all my <Col N="2238" /> days and I hope I shall continue to fight it until I die.  I will not stand for privilege anywhere.  This Bill conveys to my mind the suggestion that it is building up a privileged group of industrial exploiters and financial-mongers. I do not know whether that is the intention or whether the Minister is conscious of it, but I would ask him even now to halt and reconsider the whole position.  He has the goodwill and support of this House.  Nobody will be quicker than the Opposition, the Labour Party, the Farmers' Party and the Independents to support the Minister and to help him in dealing with this problem.  Surely we are worthy of consideration.  After all, we are part of the nation.  The Minister cannot go on forever forcing these things on people.  A breaking point will come.  The Government are relying on our goodwill now because of this emergency.  They are a minority Party in this House.  When the other Parties agree to chasten the Government, when they unite on some common cause, the Government will be chastened.  We know that the Government have taken heavy responsibilities. We all realise the internal enemy and the external enemy.  We have agreed, without exception, even though we may differ on certain points, to support the Government in every particular.  Why does the Government flout us then on a matter of such moment, of grave domestic concern? If anyone dared to assail the Government, every man and woman on this side of the House would rally to their support.  They know that.</P>
    <P>What do we get in return for that loyalty to a common citizenship?  We are charged that we have not a due sense of our responsibility, that we are not facing up to the issues.  That is totally untrue.  I challenge that. I say that if every member of the Fianna Fáil Party were as sensible of his responsibilities as the individual members here, there could be an adjustment, there could be some arrangement arrived at in connection with this Bill.  If there is not accommodation for the Independents and for the official Opposition, I hope there will be a meeting of the non-Fianna Fáil Parties and a determination <Col N="2239" /> that upon this issue there should be no collusion or no accommodation for the Government, that the Bill will be fought line by line, clause by clause, schedule by schedule.  I would be the last in the world to invite any interruption of the goodwill that has been displayed since we came back to this House.  When other Bills were introduced everybody realised that Ministers in charge were trying to approach the matter in a dignified spirit of understanding.  On this occasion one of the principal men in the Government, a man who has more authority in the country than even the Taoiseach, who has more responsibility than any man in the Government, who has filled certain functions, let us say with all candour, as well as any man could, under all kinds of difficulties, is inviting difficulties, inviting opposition.</P>
    <P>Why not, in the few days that will elapse before we meet again, review the criticism that has been offered in good faith and reconsider the whole Bill?  We want to be associated with the Government in bringing to this problem a new point of view, a new determination that we will have no more patch-work business in connection with transport, that, as far as human endeavour can go, we will try to solve this problem.  Why do we have these deliberate attempts to diverge from a common line of action? We may have differences on certain matters but you must differ if you are going to agree.  It may be that the Minister has the solution of the problem.  I do not see it, with all candour and honesty.  I have read the Bill.  I have not given it the attention it deserves because time did not permit but a Deputy of this House whom one might regard as being a man above average intelligence, who has a trained mind, said that he devoted a certain number of week-ends to the Bill and yet had not a full appreciation of what was set out.  It is admitted, I think, that this Bill took nine months to draft.  The Minister might be good enough to tell me if that is correct.</P>

      <P>Would it be possible to <Col N="2240" /> put on the records of the House that we asked how long it took to draft this Bill?  I think it is a perfectly proper question.  However, for the moment I take it that it took nine months to put into this form the machinery that is to deal with this merger.</P>
      <P>We ask to have this matter left over so that we may carry on our daily tasks and digest the contents of this Bill and come back with a clear knowledge of the transport problem.  I do not claim to have more than average intelligence, but I have a grip on the sense of words.  I do not think anyone ever saw me using notes except when quoting.  I have a memory like an elephant and they say the elephant never forgets.  There are certain things in this Bill that I want to forget. I want to forget that any Minister in any Party came to this House with such a Bill.  Would any agricultural expert go into the market and buy an old dry cow for a heifer in calf? Out of a dried up cow you could get some bone and a certain amount of blood.  This Bill is not only dried up but it is full of tuberculosis germs.  It is even bad propaganda.  Who would buy an obsolete plant, one that is not equipped for its task, but for which a good deal is going to be given?  Are we going to buy junk and then try to connect the broken parts?  Nobody would buy a secondhand motor car because they would not know but the cylinders were gone.  They say in America that you buy a Ford car once and then dump it.  Here we are going to buy an obsolete machine that has proved unsatisfactory, and that never earned its keep.  We hear a good deal about the 700-gallon cow and the 450-gallon cow, but here is a cow that never gave any milk.  It should be sent out to grass.  The proposals in the Bill are not worthy of consideration. In the picture that I have drawn of the railway company I did not do it for unkind reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have dealt with the men on this railway since 1907.  I organised them into a group that afterwards became occupants of Emmet Hall.  I know these men, their difficulties and their faults.  I speak for a certain body of <Col N="2241" /> men on the construction side.  Deputy Davin and Deputy O'Sullivan speak for the more important sections, for the accountancy department, the dispatch department, the running department and for milesmen, all-important links in the chain.  I can assure the House that amongst the 14,000 railway employees there are many good friends of the system and many others who are real enemies.  There are individuals running about for the past few months conveying all kinds of stories, and carrying on private intrigues against 14,000 employees with whom there are agreements which are valid in law. These individuals were brought in in the dark of night to consult certain people and promises were given them that if they would do what certain individuals had done in this country in the past they would be all right.  They got promises that they would be well cared for.  The employees were entitled to a pension scheme.  They have been waiting for it.  They were constantly told that there was going to be a scheme the equal of which was never before available.  These poor morons went on although the men who fought for improved conditions, and who made sacrifices convinced different Governments of their right to recognition for services rendered.  Do you know that they were told they could work four days a week at a time when some of them had to work from 14 to 17 hours daily?  The Government was a party to negotiations that resulted in improving working conditions.</P>
    <P>Now the men are asked to work unnecessary overtime.  Overtime is a dead loss to any industry.  There are times when it may be necessary to work overtime, on ships, or when there is a breakdown on the railways, but these things are provided for and breakdown gangs are available.  When there has to be overtime on an ordinary running schedule there is incapacity and bad management.  While the men were being told that, if they did not take four days a week, give up their guaranteed week, and the miserable bonus of 13/6 a week which does not meet present needs, they were actually inviting others to work overtime.  At a time when they were suggesting to the men in the workshops <Col N="2242" /> to work four days a week, they actually sent word to some of the unions catering for the skilled trades to send in more men.  Would you believe in the ordinary realms of fantasy that such a thing could happen?  If Walt Disney put it on his pictures you would laugh yourself to death.  Let us give over the railways to the railway workers, to the men who run the railways.  I do not care if you put in Deputy Corry as manager.  He would make a damn good manager in my opinion.  Put anybody in you like as manager but do not defy this House. Do not say that you will take £20,000,000 of this country's money and give no account of it.  You will either give an account of it in this House or to the public outside.  You may silence people by certain rules and regulations. You may even silence people you do not like by other methods, but there are men in this country who will not be silenced.</P>
    <P>I had to refer to a body of men who went down to the sea in ships who were libelled and the men's statements were sent to the Press, but the Press was not allowed to publish them. They had to compromise with these men and to come to an adjustment, an adjustment which should never have been necessary and should never have arisen.  It is the same in this case.  You have found you have got a problem and we would entreat you to withdraw this Bill and get it redrafted. I will sit here all day and do my own work in the dark of the night, and I know there are others who will give you every co-operation if you base it on proper lines, and give to those who had property rights before the era of speculation an adjustment of their claims based upon the property value of January, 1943.  As far as I am concerned the greatest enemies of this country are the spy leaders and finance-mongers.  I say that coldly and calmly and dispassionately.  There is no more dangerous enemy in days of stress than the gentlemen who exploit the needs of the community.  The man who will carry on in the glimmer and deny another man a chance of getting his supply of gas is a criminal.  I do not care who he is.  The man who will racketeer in food is a criminal. <Col N="2243" /> Everybody is glad to help the Minister to prevent that.  I have never come across a greater or more well-planned scheme than this grave racket.  There have never been greater spoils won by the Vanderbilts, the Goulds or the many thugs of the railway systems in America in comparison.</P>

      <P>Vanderbilt and Gould do not occupy positions of prominence at the moment.  I believe they are now in the place of exterior darkness. Under your correction, I will refrain, but at least we ought to draw an analogy from a sound form of argument although an analogy is not always a good argument because it may be turned against you. In this case I suggest there is an analogy.  I put it to the House and I hope the Press will take notice.  I am quoting the Minister who said that we are buying obsolete plant and an obsolete railway, ill-fitted for its task, and that is not worthy of further use. We have got to get rid of this, not to renovate it.  We have got to recreate our system of transport.  I say this particular Bill stands condemned. There is no other way of meeting our needs than by withdrawing the Bill and redrafting it if you like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a time when the Minister believed in nationalisation.  I do not know how he can believe in nationalisation because we are limited in our national territory and in the control of portion of it.  Let us use the term &ldquo;public ownership&rdquo; of &ldquo;public utility&rdquo;.  The Minister made some reference to other countries that had State control of the means of transport. I challenge him here either in public or in private to prove that there is any case of public ownership ever going <Col N="2244" /> back to private ownership.  You can quote France but France is in a state of war.  Still the railways there are owned by the State although they can be used under licence by private people.  The railways of Belgium are publicly owned and so are the railways of Nazi Germany that so many of you are imitating and so they are in that beautiful paradise, almost clysium Portugal.  I wonder how many of you thought of asking the people who live in the ports about life in Portugal. Some day you will aggravate me and I will paint a picture of Portugal that will give you the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.  Why do you not go down to the ships and ask the men in the fo'c'sle what a kind of nice little place Portugal is?  Go and ask the creatures that waste their lives in viciousness what is the most comfortable place to lead that sort of life in.  Ask the people in the dependencies of Portugal, the poor slaves, what the life is like.  But do not compare us to a lot of spicks.</P>
    <P>The men in this country have got something better in life than to lower themselves to the level of that type of people.  I think the time is nearly over and the referee's whistle is going to blow, but we have played a good game whether you agree with us or not.  You may not have scored many goals, but the goalkeeper on the other side has begun to realise that we have got a team ready for the next match that is going to make them play to the pin of their collar.  That is the only way we can get accommodation.  I believe we are going to fight every stage of this Bill and I hope so. Though I speak individually, I speak the mind of my colleagues, and we will fight this Bill in every paragraph until you withdraw it.  I hope that challenge will be taken up by both sides and that my comrades in the Corporation of Dublin will take up the challenge when it comes to the test.  I challenge the Minister to take off the Whips on this Bill and to let us vote on it as citizens and brothers. I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
