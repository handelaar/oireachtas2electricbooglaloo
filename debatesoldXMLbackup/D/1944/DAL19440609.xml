      <P>Go dtoghtar Proinnsias O Fathaigh agus go dtéighe sé i gceannas na Dála anois mar Cheann Comhairle.</P>
      <P>That Deputy Proinnsias O Fathaigh be elected and do now take the Chair as Ceann Comhairle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is main liom an Teachta Proinnsias O Fathaigh do chur os comhair na Dála mar Cheann Comhairle.  Tá breis agus dhá bhliain déag ann anois ó toghadh Proinnsias O Fathaigh mar Cheann <Col N="15" /> Comhairle den chéad uair, agus d'athtoghadh é cúig uaire o shoin.  Tá, mar sin, sean-taithí aige ar obair na Dála agus ar an slí inar chóir obair na Dála a stiúradh.  Táim cinnte go bhfuil gach Teachta sásta leis an gcaoi a ndearna sé a chuid oibre.  Thug sé cothrom na féinne do gach aon duine.  Bhí sé lách agus cineálta i gcomhnaí.  Sin é an t-aon lócht amháin atá air béidir, go raibh sé rud beag ró-bhog ar chuid de na daoine a bhí ag iarraidh teacht timpeall ar na rialacha agus ar bhuanorduithe na Dála.  Caifimíd go léir cuidiú leis san obair sin, mar tá a lán lán oibre le déanamh anseo agus ceapaim go bhfuil a lán daoine, ar chuma ar bith, ar aon intinn go mba chóir é bheith níos déine ná mar do bhí.  Ach, mar sin féin, tá mé cinnte go n-aontóidh sibh go léir liom gur dheachair éinne níos oireamhnaí fháil don phost ná é.  Tá súil agam go dtoghfar d'aonghuth é.  Mar sin, molaim go dtoghfar Proinnsias O Fathaigh chun bheith ina Cheann Comhairle agus go dtéighe sé i gceannas na Dála anois.</P>

      <P>Ar mo shon féin agus ar son gach dalta liom i bPáirtí Fine Gael, cuidím leis an rún atá curtha os comhair na Dála. Aontuím go mbeidh Proinnsias O Fathaigh ina Cheann Comhairle againn.  Tá mé deimhnitheach leis&mdash; an rud a dubhairt an Taoiseach&mdash;go dtabharfaidh sé cothrom na Féinne do gach Teachta.  Is olc ón Taoiseach a rá go mbíodh sé ró-bhog uaireannta, agus is measa ná sin uaidh a rá go bhfuil súil aige go mbeidh sé níos déine.  Pé Rialtas a bheidh sa tír seo i rith na gcúpla blian atá romhainn, ní féidir a rá ná beidh comhachta iongantacha foirleathana acu, agus ba chóir go mbeadh cead cainte ag an Dáil.  Ní dóigh liom go ndéanfaidh tuille cainte sa Dáil mórán díobhála. Tá na rialacha ann, agus táim deimhnitheach go ndéanfaidh sé do réir na rialacha.  Ní ceart go mbeadh an Taoiseach á iarraidh ar an gCeann Comhairle againn bheith níos déine orainn feasta.</P>

      <P>Ach mar sin féin, aontuím leis an tairiscint ag an Taoiseach go dtoghfar é mar Cheann Comhairle ar an Dáil, agus tá súil agam ná heireoidh le muintir Fianna Fáil greim ró-láidir fháil ar ghnó an Chinn Comhairle chun caint do chose sa Dáil seo.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom díospóireacht i nGaedhilge a bheith againn ach ní thuigeann an chuid is mó de na daoine an méid atá á rá. Mar sin, déarfaidh mise rud beag i mBéarla.  Nuair bhí an Teachta de Valéra ag caint is dóigh liom go ndúirt sé rud amháin go mba mhaith liom rud eicint a rá mar gheall air.</P>
      <P>When the Taoiseach was proposing this motion he referred to Deputy Proinnsias O Fathaigh in terms to which, I think, every Deputy in this House will subscribe: that Deputy Proinnsias O Fathaigh had proved himself to be a good Ceann Comhairle, that he has served this House well, that he has been impartial, fair and courageous in the defence of the rights of every Deputy in the House, from whatever side, and that he will continue to be so. I think that every Deputy in this House, from whatever side, will agree to that, but I suggest that it is early for the Taoiseach to start waving his 76 Deputies about this House.  He can wave them over here as much as he likes, and yet could well cause no consternation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are enough Jack the Giant Killers over here to deal with the 76, but I hold that it is a very dangerous precedent that, on the day this Dáil meets, the Taoiseach should warn the Ceann Comhairle not to be so easy or so lenient with Deputies whose remarks or speeches, in his judgment, are not relevant.  It is not the function of the Ceann Comhairle to agree with what the Taoiseach or the Government say.  The prime function of the Ceann Comhairle is to see that all Deputies in this House, no matter to what Party they belong, get a fair opportunity of speaking their minds.  Even though the Taoiseach can claim to be the owner <Col N="17" /> of 76 seats in this House, there are still a few seats here which are not owned by him, and it is the function of the Ceann Comhairle to see that the Taoiseach will not claim the right to own every side in the House, beyond the 76 seats which he claims to hold. So long as the Ceann Comhairle stands fast on that, we will have peace here, but if he does not stand fast on that, we will have something else.  It is just as well to start on this now, and we should make it clear that the Ceann Comhairle of this House takes no instruction from the Taoiseach and that, on the day he starts taking it, he will cease to have the confidence of the House.  It is just because I have every confidence that Deputy Proinnsias O Fathaigh will take no orders from the Taoiseach or anybody else, that I gladly support the motion.  If, however, some other Deputies in this House should take the attitude the Taoiseach has taken, then I shall do my best to keep, them out of the occupancy of the Chair of this House. It is because I know that Deputy Proinnsias O Fathaigh will refuse to take orders from the Taoiseach, or anybody else, that I gladly support the motion.</P>

      <P>It is 12 months since I had an opportunity of listening in this House to tributes then paid to the Ceann Comhairle.  On that occasion I stated that as a Galway man I was delighted to hear such grand things being said about him.  I had no experience of the House then, but I was delighted that a Galway man had merited such fine tributes in this House.  Since then we, as a new Party, have had 11 months' experience in this House, and all I can say is that the Ceann Comhairle was more than lenient towards our group. I do hope that no Deputy will run away with the idea, as some people seemed to think, that that was because the Ceann Comhairle is a Galway man and that I happen to be one also.  He has always carried out his duties towards us in the manner of a father towards his children.  He was ready to help us as best he could.  For that leniency it is my duty to-day as Leader <Col N="18" /> of the Party to say that we are very grateful.  We believe that no better man could be got from any Party to fill the Chair of this House.  We hope that he will live long to hold the Chair of Dáil Eireann, and we feel confident that he will prove a credit to this Dáil.</P>
      <P>Question&mdash;&ldquo;That Deputy Frank Fahy be elected and do now take the Chair of the Dáil as Ceann Comhairle&rdquo;&mdash;put by the Clerk and unanimously agreed to.</P>

        <i>Whereupon the Deputies rose in their places and remained standing while the Ceann Comhairle proceeded to the dais.</i>
      </P>
      <P>Standing beside the Chair, the Ceann Comhairle, addressing the Dáil, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>A chomhtheachtaí, táim an-bhuíoch díbh go léir as ucht mé d'ath-thoghadh mar Cheann Chomhairle.  Tá dóchas agam go bhfuighead comhar agus cúnamh ón Dáil chun dualgaisí na hoifige do chomhlíonadh go ceart agus tá súil agam go mb' fhiú mé an mhuinín atá curtha agaibh ionam anois.</P>
      <P>To my fellow Deputies, I am grateful for having elected me for the sixth time as Ceann Comhairle.  I rely with confidence on the co-operation of the Dáil in the discharge of my duties, for without that co-operation my task would be impossible.  I trust I shall be worthy of the confidence now reposed in me.  To remarks made regarding my duties, I do not propose to reply beyond stating that I consider it to be the duty of the House to transact the nation's business and, consistent with that, to have freedom of discussion impartially within the rules and the Standing Orders of Dáil Eireann.</P>

Agus, ag comhlíonadh an dualgais sin dom, táimse á rá, ar mo shon féin agus ar son Fine Ghael, sa Dáil seo, nach bhfuil aon iontaoibh againn as Eamon de Valéra mar Phríomh-Aire os cionn Rialtais.</P>
      <P>We have all our functions and our duties to the various sections of the people to discharge here.  In the discharge of these duties, we on the Fine Gael Benches are desirous, in so far as discussions are carried on here, to be informative, to be clear, to be honest and to be outspoken and, in so far as we contribute to decisions in this House, to be clear and straight in these. As regards the proposal that Deputy de Valera should be Taoiseach in the present Parliament, we have discussed in various ways throughout the country the reasons why we think that should not be so.  There is no occasion to develop that discussion now, but there is occasion for us in a clear and formal way to express in Parliament here our lack of confidence in him as Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>There was never an occasion to my mind when the rank and file of the Fianna Fáil Party spoke with clear outspoken voices on the problems that confronted this House.  I have repeatedly myself from these benches challenged the seats of silence behind the Fianna Fáil Ministers and asked them individually and collectively to play the part in this House that they were sent here to play.  Week after week and month after month, through very difficult times here, I appealed to those on the Fianna Fáil Benches to be outspoken on Irish affairs.  One of the most sinister, disturbing and destructive things in our time has been the silence of the Fianna Fáil Party.  However, I did not rise to go into that matter here.  I am anxious to state the case simply.  I do not desire to go into the past.  Deputies on the other side may, by interruption or otherwise, desire to lead the discussion further than I do at present but I shall try to avoid that.  Deputy Kennedy has indicated that he does not want to go into the past of the Taoiseach.  Nobody wants to do that.  Nobody, realising the critical circumstances of the world, having regard to our function here and to the critical situation which may lie in front of the country, ought to want to go into the past.  When I speak of our lack of confidence in Eamon de Valera as Taoiseach, I necessarily base my lack of confidence on the happenings of the past but I do not bring my mind to bear on that past. It is in relation to the present and the future, and because we want to be outspoken and clear, that I make the statement that we have no confidence in the Taoiseach as leader of a Government.  Though that statement <Col N="21" /> is based on happenings in the past, I have no desire to go into the past.  The Government of to-morrow will have very big jobs to do and will have a very serious responsibility.  But, in my opinion, the job that will fall to the lot of the Opposition Parties in this House will be bigger and graver and may easily be more responsible.</P>
      <P>No Government in any country has greater powers than the Government here has.  With two exceptions, every single power that any group of men serving as a Government might require the members of the present Government have.  As regards the two exceptions, they are explicitly prevented from imposing taxation without reference to Parliament and they are explicitly prevented from imposing conscription, industrial or military, without reference to Parliament.  These are the only two powers they cannot exercise without reference to Parliament.  I anticipate that a Fianna Fáil Government will be set up under the leadership of Eamon de Valera.  That Government will have a majority in this House.  There will be nothing to prevent them from imposing, by weight of that majority, either taxation or conscription, so that, so far as the Government is concerned, they will have all the powers that any set of men could have.  They will, therefore, have the fullest possible facility for tackling their work.  They will have the complete support of the people in doing anything that will be for the good of the country.  Ever since this emergency occurred, that has been made perfectly clear from every side of the House and that support will continue so far as this side of the House is concerned. In the case of a Government equipped with such powers, a Government that may in the future show the spirit that the Fianna Fáil Government has shown in the past, occasions may arise upon which a very serious responsibility will fall upon opposition Parties to defend the liberties and the interests of the people generally.  We hope that those occasions will not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one fundamental difference between our Party and the Fianna Fáil Party.  The Fianna Fáil Party in the past, and in its presentation of <Col N="22" /> matters during the election campaign, developed, by propaganda and otherwise, the idea of one-man government. Serious and necessary criticism either by members of the Oireachtas or by persons outside was represented as personal.  Normal, natural, called-for criticism in the public interest is degraded by propaganda and it is suggested that it is inspired by personal motives.  Most of us have been long enough in the public life of the country and have engaged in pursuits ourselves and called upon others to carry out work of so serious a kind that we should be given credit for being above mere personalities.  We should be given credit for being concerned with the real interests of the country.  When we get up and criticise here, I hope that we will get away from certain difficulties which arose in the past and that we will be given credit for offering definitely-stated opinions on definitely stated facts entirely in the public interest.  If we have any sense of personal dignity or personal responsibility and if we have regard for the difficulties of our own people and the shocking difficulties under which other people are labouring, we should be completely lifted above personalities of any kind.  When I say on the part of our Party, and on my own behalf, that we have no confidence in Eamon de Valera as Taoiseach, I do not say that in a merely personal way but as a matter of grave public policy and as a warning, if warnings can be of any use that those things which inspired that want of confidence in the past on our part ought to disappear.  If he, and the other members of the Fianna Fáil Party, were fully sensible of the position which requires to be dealt with and of the fact that only the people as a whole can deal with it, I believe they would rise above the feelings, actions and policies which have caused that want of confidence and which have led to loss of opportunity for the country.</P>
    <P>Whatever assistance we can give to the Government, by advice or otherwise, we are prepared to give.  I think that every member of the Fine Gael Party has in the past given full and complete proof of that.  We believe <Col N="23" /> that a Government lifted up to a sense of the Christian and democratic dignity of life and its responsibility should deal with our present situation here.  We have been recently concerned for the safety of Rome.  Why?  Our concern for the safety of Rome is only convention and humbug if we do not relate it to our Christian faith.  We believe that the policy which Fianna Fáil have run with regard to one man is contrary to the Christian and democratic way of life and outlook on life.  Propaganda is used to dull and obscure the minds of our people and to demean them in their own opinion.  While it is customary on the part of some Fianna Fáil leaders to charge other people with being Communists, the whole technique on the political side of the Fianna Fáil Party has been to breed in the minds of our people that lack of confidence in themselves, that lack of appreciation of Christian and human dignity, which our faith should keep clearly before us, which goes to create Communism.</P>
    <P>The main difference between us is that we stand for a democratic way of life, for the democratic lifting of our people, by making them face the facts of Irish life and realise that they have their part, either as individuals or in communities of one kind or another, to play in both defending and building up the country.  The attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party is the other way, to make it a one-man Government, and through Party favouritism of one kind, and Party patronage in business, in commerce, in the Civil Service, and in every other way, to build up a machine that will serve the one man, controlling the national life.  It is for that reason that in a formal and clear way we desire to show our lack of confidence in the Taoiseach as Leader of an Irish Government, by voting against this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much regret to say that I feel that the Twelfth Dáil has opened with what I consider to be a bitter note.  As an Irishman I believe, for the sake of our country, that that should not be the case at the present time.  We have had a lot of talk.  Many people are inclined to look to the past but, as the leader of a <Col N="24" /> Party with ten months' experience in the Dáil, I have no hesitation in saying that it is looking back on the past has left this country in the position it has been in since we got our freedom. What we should do is to forget the past and to look to the future.  If we did that we would be doing something, no matter what Party is in the ascendant&mdash;Fianna Fáil, Labour, Fine Gael, or Independents, because it was for that purpose the people sent us here. Last year the Party I have the honour to speak for was the most criticised Party that ever existed in this country, because of their attitude in the Dáil. We were told that we were no good; that we did not do this or do that. All sides in this House made propaganda out of our attitude.  Some people said we were henchmen of Deputy de Valera, and later on before the year was out Fianna Fáil was saying that we were henchmen of Deputy O'Higgins.  As far as we are concerned our attitude in the Twelfth Dáil will be that any business that comes before the House that we consider to be for the benefit of the country, regardless of the Party or of the individuals it comes from, will have our solid support. If we consider that it is not in the interests of our people, then it will definitely have our opposition.</P>

      <P>It is not our intention to follow the example of the Leader of the Fine Gael Party.  We will adopt the very same attitude that we adopted ten months ago, when Fianna Fáil was elected as the largest Party in the House and as such were entitled to elect the Taoiseach.  The same thing applies to-day.  That Party is definitely entitled to do that.  I could criticise the Taoiseach as head of the Government and the Government Party as regards their attitude towards agriculture and other things, but there will be plenty of time for that.  Criticism will come from these benches.  This is not exactly the time for it, but this Party expects and believes, in view of the shattering events that are happening near our shores, that our attitude here, as far <Col N="25" /> as possible, should be to show that there is no disunity within this House. One appeal that I make to the newly-elected Taoiseach and to all Parties is to remember that this Twelfth Dáil will have an opportunity of smashing the Border that now divides this country.</P>

I hope if the opportunity does present itself during the life of this Dáil, that we will be all standing to have that scar in the life of our country removed.  Our attitude regarding the election of the Taoiseach is the same as it was last year.  We believe that the largest Party in the Dáil is entitled to elect the Taoiseach, and we are not voting against the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The result of this election has given the Fianna Fáil Party a clear majority, and knowing the Fianna Fáil policy or knowing the Taoiseach I have no doubt that majority will be used to instal a Fianna Fáil Government to-day. That, of course, puts on the Fianna Fáil Party the responsibility of electing a Government.  Having had experience of the Government's handling of economic and social issues during the last five years, experience of the muddling of price control, and having regard to the efficient way in which it kept wages low, and forced down the standard of living of the workers, and having no evidence whatever of the Government's policy for the next five years, the nomination of Deputy de Valera as Taoiseach does not commend itself to this Party.  It is quite clear now that this Parliament will last for another five years.  These will be exceptionally trying and critical years as far as this nation is concerned. They will be years during which this country will be exposed to enormous dangers.  On the one hand, one has only to survey the course of the war to realise the repercussions that will flow from the gigantic military struggles which are at present <Col N="26" /> taking place, to realise that during the next five years our economic structure here will be tested as never before. Having regard to the weakness of our economic fabric it is very doubtful, unless all Parties unite in its defence, whether our economic fabric can stand up to the insistent impact upon it as a result of the present economic and military situation throughout the world.  It seems to us that in the period through which we are about to pass the goodwill and the co-operation of every Party in this House will be necessary in order primarily to ensure to whatever Government is elected and, secondly, to the people, the maximum possible measure of co-operation that can be given.  As far as the Labour Party is concerned its voice and vote in this House will champion every good cause and plead for the support of legislation which will make for national well-being, and which will have as its object the raising of the standard of living of the mass of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as this Government is concerned, probably no other Government in the world has got more co-operation in the matter of military defence and of unity against external danger than has the Fianna Fáil Government.  I think it will, and should, continue to get that support in the face of external danger.  I would go further and say that, even in the field of economic and social endeavour, the circumstances through which we are now passing demand that there should be generous support for a social and economic policy calculated to enrich the people and calculated to overcome the many social and economic difficulties and evils which beset them to-day.  But I am very doubtful whether the Government want any co-operation in the economic field at all, or whether they want any co-operation in difficulties other than in military and defence difficulties.  We had an example of the Government's attitude only this week. We had a statement by the Minister for Supplies on Wednesday night last telling the Parliament and the people through the wireless of certain difficulties regarding a shortage of electricity and a shortage of coal supplies. That was not the first occasion on <Col N="27" /> which the Minister for Supplies utilised the radio for the purpose of conveying information that ought to be told to the nation through the people's Parliament, and I have no doubt that during the next five years the same Minister for Supplies will utilise the radio, or a Fianna Fáil Cumann, as a means of communicating to the nation information which ought properly be conveyed to the nation through the people's Parliament.</P>

      <P>If there is shortage of electricity, or if there are fuel difficulties, I would suggest that these are not merely the difficulties of the Fianna Fáil Government, but are difficulties that are common to the whole nation. They are difficulties which the whole people ought to be assisted to bear by united action amongst all political Parties in this country.  I suggest to the Government that in the circumstances of a fuel shortage, of a shortage of coal, with a consequent serious repercussion on employment, the Government ought surely have sought in this sphere economic co-operation; the same kind of unity that they sought in the sphere of defence difficulties.  What we have been used to from the Fianna Fáil Party are just purely Party decisions, and then an appeal to everybody to support the line taken by the Government. Any attempt to criticise the Government's line, because of its shortcomings and its obvious imperfections, has usually been met by the charge of sabotage.  The criticism which has been directed against the Government's policy has been criticism based on the belief that the Government were not handling these problems correctly; it was based on the belief that there were other and better courses which could be adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the Government ought to do in present circumstances, particularly in the circumstances through which we are now passing, is to seek in the economic and social sphere the same kind of co-operation as it rightly sought, and justly got, in the field of military defence.  I put it to the Government, and to Deputy de Valera <Col N="28" /> especially, that the Opposition Parties in this House are a part of Parliament, a part of the nation, and are entitled to be consulted, especially in these days of trials and difficulties, on economic and social matters, in the same way as they have been consulted, and their co-operation secured, in matters of military defence.  I know, of course, that it is very easy for a Party, with a clear majority in this House, to be an arrogant political Party.  This Government may be that&mdash;or it may not be that&mdash;but whatever it is it ought to remember this: that its total vote in the recent election was less than the total vote of all other Opposition Parties.  It ought, at the same time, to realise that the Opposition Parties, and every Deputy in this House, is as much a part of the Parliament as the Government is, and is as much a part of the nation as the Fianna Fáil Party is part of the nation.  As I have said, the nomination of Deputy de Valera as Taoiseach does not commend itself to this Party because of its want of a positive policy in the past.  We have no information and no knowledge of what its future policy is to be.  We have no knowledge of what the Government's policy is to be in the event of a cessation of military hostilities over the world.  We have no knowledge of what the Government's plans are for dealing with the enormous economic problems which will be thrown up for solution the moment our people start to drift back from Britain.  Because of a want of confidence in the Government's policy, particularly its complete inability to control prices, and at the same time its sustained attack on the standard of living of the masses of our people, we are not prepared to support the nomination of Deputy de Valera as Taoiseach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In opening, I would like, if I may, to express my admiration of the lofty tone and dignity with which the leader of the Opposition announced the attitude of the Fine Gael Party in regard to this motion. I often marvel at his patience and resolve to keep pronouncements of that kind on the level which he succeeded <Col N="29" /> in doing in the face of the not infrequent provocative interruptions of some of the less reputable members of Fianna Fáil.  I confess that if I had to deal with them I doubt if I would have been able to maintain his patient calm.  I have no hesitation in declaring that it is a service to public life in this country that he has been able to do so.  There is one patent fact outstanding in the present situation, and that is that the astutest politician since Machiavelli has won a general election.  That is a fact which Deputies applaud, but it is certainly true.  Now, generations of Irishmen fought to ensure that the Irish people would have complete freedom to do wrong if they wanted to do wrong. The theory that the Irish people have no right to do wrong began in the Fianna Fáil Party, and I pray to God that it will end there.  I admit the right of the Irish people, under God, to do wrong.  They never did a worse wrong than they did on the day they elected Eamon de Valera, but they did it.  That is where I differ with Deputy Donnellan.  In the Eleventh Dáil they did not do it.  They returned to this House a majority against Eamon de Valera, and if that majority had combined together and formed an alternative Government our modern Machiavelli would not have got his chance for his midnight ride to the Park.  Therefore, a very different verdict might have been given by the people in an election when they had time to consider the issues truly joined between the Parties. But, in the Eleventh Dáil, certain Deputies of this House not fully foreseeing the nature of the gentleman they were making Taoiseach, failed to take effective action to prevent his being chosen, and so we had the midnight ride to the Park.  Now we have 76 Fianna Fáil Deputies.  With these, there is a majority of this whole House returned in support of Eamon de Valera, so that no combination of Parties can to-day prevent his being elected Taoiseach.  Therefore, I say the Irish people have decided that he is to be Taoiseach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I re-affirm the right of the sovereign Irish people to do wrong <Col N="30" /> in the sphere of politics, if they want to do wrong.  It is the one fundamental right in defence of which every section of this House is prepared to combine against outsiders whencesoever they may come.  Self-government is infinitely more important than good government. The Irish people, by electing and returning 76 Fianna Fáil Deputies, have done wrong.  All my instincts are to vote against Deputy de Valera as Taoiseach, as I know what a disaster it will be to this country if he should be elected Taoiseach; but the fundamental principle remains that the Irish people have the right to do wrong, Deputy de Valera notwithstanding.  He was the first man in this country to say that the Irish people have no right to do wrong, and to act accordingly.  I reject that doctrine and I affirm that they have that right to do wrong in the sphere of politics, if they wish to exercise it.  Though all my instincts are to vote against the motion to appoint Deputy de Valera as Taoiseach and though I am convinced that his election is a great disservice to the interests of the nation, a higher principle is at stake and that is the right of the Irish people to do what they please in the sphere of politics.</P>
      <P>In this election, the Irish people have clearly chosen the worst candidate in the country for Taoiseach.  Very well, they have chosen him.  I do not challenge their right to make that choice and I will not vote against it.  If we had, by a combination of all the other Deputies, a majority of one, I would exhort that majority to join with me in putting out Deputy de Valera; but inasmuch as he has a clear majority, put there by the Irish people, who have the right to do wrong if they wish, I will not, by my vote, challenge their decision in that matter.  I deplore it, I regret it and I foresee great and lamentable consequences for this country as a result of that choice; but our job is to accept the decision and to do what we can to make its consequences as little disastrous as we can. It is not in our power to alter that decision and, inasmuch as it is the decision of the Irish people, I will not oppose it by my vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In abstaining from voting on this <Col N="31" /> motion, I do not want a shadow of doubt to be on the minds of anyone in my constituency or in this House that I detest the prospect of Deputy de Valera being appointed Taoiseach. Anything I could do to prevent it, prior to the election, I did; and if there were a majority of one on the Opposition Benches, I would do everything I could to prevent his election. My abstention from voting is in no sense any kind of assent to the proposition that he is the proper person to elect.  My abstention is due to one thing only: the supreme principle I desire to vindicate is that the Irish people have the right to do wrong if they wish.  They have done so this time and I will do nothing, in this House or outside it, to challenge that sovereign right, for which so many generations of Irishmen fought so hard.</P>

      <P>I regret that on this occasion there should be any opposition to the nation's wish to the appointment of Deputy de Valera as Taoiseach.  This year, above all other times, the Taoiseach will be dependent on the support of all sections of this House and should receive that support in the grave situation with which this country may be confronted in regard to external affairs.  For that reason we, as a small Party&mdash;but representing a large section of the people&mdash;are prepared to go into the Lobby and vote for the people's choice of Deputy de Valera as Taoiseach of the Irish nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I disagree with the Fianna Fáil policy, but this is not the time to criticise it.  There will be an opportunity on another occasion to fight and protest against the low wages Order.  There will be opportunities to protest against many of the things I believe should be protested against, in the interests of the people I represent; but this is not the occasion to draw in a red herring.  We do not know what is happening now in other parts of the world or what may happen, and we may want the support of all sections of the community.  The people have decided, in a free election, where it wishes to place the power.  I did my part in pointing out the faults of the <Col N="32" /> Fianna Fáil Party, but the people have decided in their favour and I am prepared to accept the people's choice and opinion.  I believe we are interpreting the people's wishes by voting for Deputy de Valera as Taoiseach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to refer to Fianna Fáil policy, as did Deputy Norton and Deputy Donnellan. I am quite confident that I am going to be here for five years to refer to that policy, so there is very little use in occupying the time of the House by referring to it to-day.  The question before the House at the moment is the proposition by Deputy Kennedy, seconded by Deputy O'Sullivan, that Deputy Eamon de Valera be elected Taoiseach.  Deputy Mulcahy has opposed that.  Deputy Dillon says that if his vote could prevent Deputy de Valera from being Taoiseach, he would put him out.  If we vote against Deputy de Valera, where will we find a better man to vote for?  I know that he is wrong, as wrong as could be, but where is there a better?  I would not vote for him, nor would I dream of voting for Deputy Mulcahy as Taoiseach. I would not vote for Deputy Dillon, Deputy Donnellan or Deputy Norton, nor would I take the position myself.  It does not matter one iota to the people on top of the Slieve Bloom mountains or on Clonsast Bog, who put me in, whether Deputy de Valera is Taoiseach or not.  It does not matter to this House, nor does it matter to the nation, who is Taoiseach. There is going to be a continuance of poverty, debt, emigration, low wages, starvation and destitution, no matter who is Taoiseach under this administration.</P>
      <P>I assume that, as Deputy de Valera has 76 men behind him, he will be chosen by them.  He need not thank Leix-Offaly for that 76, as they gave me 10,000 votes to come up here to ballyrag him every time I can, although Deputy de Valera himself came down to Leix-Offaly and plotted to undermine my position and have my seat taken from me.  He even came to my own town to use his influence, but he failed and I was elected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, if Deputy de Valera is elected as Taoiseach, my <Col N="33" /> words will come to pass at the end of this term of five years, the same as they came to pass at the end of the Eleventh Dáil.  At the opening of the last Dáil, I said that that Dáil would fail to fulfil its obligations to the Irish people.  That has been so.  I am not a prophet, but I am going to prophesy that the Twelfth Dáil will fail no matter who is Taoiseach.  If Deputy de Valera is elected to that post, he will have to bend the knee to Sir John Keane and the banks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>In conclusion, I may as well say that I am not going to vote against him, nor will I vote for him. I find it impossible to support him and there is no better man to vote for; therefore I will not vote at all.  I have explained my views here and also to the labouring men in my constituency who have heard the Fianna Fáil policy preached during the election. There are high rates and taxes and the cost of living has gone up by leaps and bounds, while wages are going up with the speed of a snail.  That is what we have as Fianna Fáil policy and, so far as I am aware, there is no plan.  Their only plan in Leix-Offaly was the plan to put Deputy Flanagan out, but that failed.  They had nothing constructive to put before the people and they got their answer in Leix-Offaly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite certain, with respect to the Chair, that it is all the same who is Taoiseach.  Let us do our best to get something done for the people, to raise their standard of living and to make Ireland a land where our people will have happiness and comfort.  As <Col N="34" /> far as the Taoiseach is concerned, I do not care who he is, as it is not going to make the least difference.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. B. Maguire Mr. B. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever case was made, or could have been made, justifiably, last year for the election of someone other than Deputy de Valera to the position of Taoiseach, I do not see on this occasion that any argument can justifiably be made for refusing his nomination.  Undoubtedly, the people have expressed in no uncertain way their desire, at this juncture, to elect Deputy de Valera and his Party. The verdict given was an unmistakable one and Parties or individuals here who would attempt to interpret the decision of the electorate otherwise would not be acting justly, nor would they be interpreting the feelings of the people they purport to represent here.</P>
      <P>There may be, as a result of the election, a danger that the Fianna Fáil Party may take the verdict given by the people last week as indicating approval of their general policy.  I may say, speaking as an Independent, that the verdict given for the Fianna Fáil Party was strong and undeniable and it confirms the desire that Fianna Fáil should continue as a Government, but I suggest that verdict was given for reasons other than approval of the general policy of Fianna Fáil.  I am not suggesting that the members of the Fianna Fáil Party are not in as close touch with the needs of the country as I am, but I suggest that there are many of them who do not understand the position as well as I do and I believe it would be a serious mistake if the Government Party were to accept the verdict given last week as indicating approval of their economic policy generally. It did not.  I suggest that considerable reform will be necessary and very serious attention will be required from the Government in order to deal with the reasonable requirements of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry to find, in connection with this motion, that a degree of bitterness has been expressed from some sections of the House.  I think the time has come when the people will not be prepared to tolerate any criticism that has <Col N="35" /> for its object merely the discrediting of opponents.  We have seen that sort of thing practised in many elections. Smart action that may, in the opinion of members of a Party, be serviceable to them in the event of an appeal to the country, has on occasions brought results that were not very beneficial for those concerned.  The desire of the people is that their representatives, regardless of Party, should interest themselves in submitting serious suggestions for the betterment of the community.  If debates and criticism were carried out in this House on those lines, much better results might accrue and greater rewards might come from the people during general elections.</P>
    <P>I trust that, in their strength, the Government Party will listen with as much earnestness to the depleted Parties&mdash;some of them are depleted now as compared with their position after the 1943 election&mdash;and consider their arguments with as much seriousness as if their position was much more powerful.  Speaking as an Independent, I hope that the suggestions put forward by myself and by others similarly situated will receive as much attention from the Government as if we were appealing for Parties just as powerful as some other Parties in this House.  I was hoping&mdash;but it appears that it will not now occur&mdash;that the motion to reelect Deputy de Valera as An Taoiseach would have unanimous approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to endorse most of what Deputy Maguire has said. His contributions in this House are always to the point, very rarely out of order, and usually of a constructive character.  I also had hopes that this Vote would go through unanimously, that there would not be a division, but when I heard that another candidate was to be proposed, or rather that the re-election of Deputy de Valera was to be opposed, I felt that the opposition might be expressed in the speeches of the Leaders of the different Parties in the Dáil, mainly the Fine Gael Party, the two sections of the Labour Party and the Farmers' Party, with possibly one speaker from the Independent Benches.  I never anticipated that we would have such a <Col N="36" /> spate of oratory as we have had on this occasion.</P>
      <P>I really think too much has been made out of what may be thought elsewhere over the opposition to the re-election of An Taoiseach to-day.  Too much stress has been laid on what foreign opinion will be on this action of ours.  That is the sort of thing that I think Deputies should get out of their minds as quickly as possible. The fact of the matter is that foreign Powers do not give two hoots about what we do here.  We have been trying to make ourselves a lot more important than we are.  I think the nation has shown that we are 100 per cent. behind An Taoiseach when we are faced with a serious problem such as that of defence.  He had the support of all Parties in his attitude on that matter.  But he was not the only person in this House who was instrumental in putting us in the position that we could say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the British and the Americans or any other Government. What enabled us to do that was the Statute of Westminster, as is well known.  I am not going to deal with that matter now.</P>
      <P>I think that some people are laying too much stress on the ill-effects of opposition to the re-election of Deputy de Valera on this occasion&mdash;to the effect it will have, particularly, on foreign opinion.  We are really taking ourselves too seriously.  Everybody knows &mdash;people in foreign countries included &mdash;that there are 76 Deputies on the Government side and 62 Deputies on the Opposition Benches.  Surely foreign opinion is not so unenlightened that it does not know that?  This is my attitude in relation to this proposal. Deputy Mulcahy, the Leader of the principal Opposition Party, and Deputy Norton gave expression to views which I hold very strongly.  At the same time I feel it would be more effective for all Parties in the Dáil to vote for the re-election of An Taoiseach, to keep him in his present position.  Anyway, he will remain as Taoiseach in spite of all our opposition. But, as an Independent Deputy, I am not going to absent myself from voting.  I declare that I will vote for Deputy Eamon de Valera as Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>I would like, perhaps, <Col N="37" /> to be in the position to follow Deputy Anthony into the Division Lobby to support the re-election of the Taoiseach, but there are, however, some very definite reasons why I could not adopt that attitude.  It was made quite clear, in the course of the election campaign by myself and other members of this Party, that we do not believe in, and do not approve, the system of one-Party Government. All during the emergency we have made it clear that we consider it is the duty of all Parties to co-operate in the carrying on of the government of the country, and since that is the duty of all Parties, it is the duty of the head of the Government to invite all Parties to co-operate with him in that essential task.</P>
      <P>Now the Taoiseach has had a long and distinguished career in this country.  His career has been crowded with much achievement and with much good fortune and I think it would be the crowning act of that career if he were to avail of this opportunity to heal the old sores which have existed in this country since the establishment of the State by inviting prominent members of the Opposition Parties into the Government and thus giving the Government a more representative character.  If the Taoiseach or his Party during the election, or at any time, had declared their intention of so doing, I would have been very enthusiastic in supporting the election of Deputy de Valera to the position of Taoiseach. Because, however, it is apparently the intention of Deputy de Valera and the Fianna Fáil Party to adhere to the narrow Party system of government, to exploit every difficulty and every emergency for the advancement of Party, because they are determined to advance along those narrow lines, I cannot support the nomination of Deputy de Valera.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that Deputy Dillon to-day has seen the wisdom of adopting the same course which we adopted last year, that is, of realising that it is not possible at the moment to form an alternative Government and, realising that, of offering no opposition to the nomination of the Taoiseach. We cannot, however, support that <Col N="38" /> nomination.  We cannot support it because of the policy that was pursued in regard to agriculture during the past year, a policy which it is foreshadowed will be pursued during the coming year.  We cannot support Deputy de Valera's nomination because of the manner in which the national emergency and difficulty was exploited in order to gain support for the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>Just a few months ago, when a Note was presented to this country by the American Government, I met a member of the Fianna Fáil Party and he told me: &ldquo;The only thing we want now is a general election and Deputy de Valera will sweep the country.&rdquo; That was the first plain hint I got that the Fianna Fáil Party were going to cash in on the Cordell Hull note.  They have cashed in on that Note and reaped some advantage from it and they are welcome to it.  One thing they have to do now is to undo some of the harm they did to this country's national interests during the election. During the election the Fianna Fáil Party preached throughout the length and breadth of the country that the nation was in serious danger of attack when the American Note was presented to it.</P>

As that propaganda was used, there is an opportunity now to rectify the matter by publicly declaring&mdash;and we want that declaration to come from the man who is being proposed as head of the <Col N="40" /> Government&mdash;that there never was at any time any threat to the neutrality of this country from the United Nations.  We want to see him making every attempt to preserve, maintain, and extend good relations between this country and the neighbouring State.</P>

Is eol do chuile dhuine nach éadtrom cúramaí na hoifige na laetheannta so ach déanfad mo dhícheall mo dhualgaisí do chomhlíonadh mar ba chóir, agus iarraim ar na Teachtaí go léir, ó gach dream atá sa Dáil annso, cúnamh a thabhairt dom.  Ba mhian linn i gcomhnaí comh-oibriú leis na páirtithe eile chomh fada agus is féidir.  Tá fhios ag chuile dhuine nach é an tuairim chéanna atá againn go Iéir i dtaobh a lán rudaí ach, buíochas le Dia, go bhfuilimid ar aon tuairim i dtaobh cuid des na rudaí is tábhachtaí agus isé mo thuairim go leanfaidh sé mar sin ar feadh an téarma atá le teacht. Ní dhéanfad aon tagairt do na rudaí a dúradh nuair a bhí an díospóireacht ar siúl.  Caithfidh mé dul agus a chur in iúl don Uachtarán go bhfuil mé ainmnithe agus, mar sin, ní mór dom a mholadh go ndéanfar sos ar obair na Dála go dtí 5.45 a chlog.

      <P>I am proposing the following Deputies as Members of the Government:</P>
      <P>Seán T. O Ceallaigh; Seán F. Lemass; Seán Mac an tSaoi; Séamus O Riain; Proinnsias Mac Aodhagáin; Tomás O Deirg; Gearóid O Beoláin; Oscar Mac Tréinfhir; Pádraig O Caoilte; Seán O Maoláin.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="43" /> As I have said in Irish, they have worked well, both in their individual Departments and as a team.  Individually, they are known to every member of the Dáil.  They have been working for our country, most of them, from 1916 to the present time, and some of them also even further back. I do not think there is anything I could say that could possibly add to their reputation.  It is known to every member of the House as it is to me. I have more than pleasure in proposing that they be again members of the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, according to the Constitution and the law, they are nominated and selected as members of the Government, and then it is the duty of the Taoiseach to assign Departments of State to them.  When it is possible to indicate in advance the Departments to be assigned to the members of the Government it is perhaps well to do it, and I can indicate that I propose, at the moment anyhow, to assign to them the same Departments that they had just before the dissolution. I should also like to indicate that it is my intention to nominate Deputy Seán T.O Ceallaigh as Tánaiste, but, strictly speaking, that does not come before us immediately for consideration. The point is that they are being appointed really as members of the Government, and it is as such that the agreement of the Dáil is required to my nominations.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Taoiseach for the additional information which he has given, and I think it is only natural that we should ask for that information.  As the Taoiseach has indicated, it is proposed then that the Ministries in the new Government will be held by the same persons as held them in the last.  With that information in front of us, and realising how much the future depends upon production in this country and upon education <Col N="44" /> in this country, without individualising or going into any discussion of any of the Ministries there I think the implications of the Taoiseach's statement, from the point of view of production and from the point of view of education, are such that our consciences would not be satisfied if we acquiesced in any way in the making of those general appointments.  Therefore, I propose to divide against the proposal before the Dáil.</P>

      <P>We would not have felt disposed to challenge a vote on the Taoiseach's nomination of his Ministers were it not for the fact that unfortunately for the nation the Taoiseach has seen fit to include Deputy Seán MacEntee as a Minister.  It is because of the fact that Deputy Seán MacEntee has been included in the team on which the Taoiseach proposes to rely for the next five years that we find it necessary to challenge a division on the Taoiseach's nominations.  I think it is well known even to the decent minded Ministers and members of the Fianna Fáil Party that Deputy MacEntee is a specialist in throwing election muck. That is his only qualification for inclusion in the Fianna Fáil Government. Everybody knows that the Minister indulged in the most deliberate misrepresentation of his political opponents in the last election, and particularly of the Labour Party, which seems to annoy Deputy Seán MacEntee to an almost limitless extent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to give the decent minded members of the House the reasons why the nation's money ought not to be spent on paying a salary to and ultimately providing a substantial pension for this person whom we are now asked to swallow as Minister.  Everybody knows that Deputy MacEntee during the last election indulged in calumny and abuse of his political opponents.  If one were to read his speeches even in that organ of truth known as the <i>Irish Press</i>, one would discover that he had no policy whatever except abuse, downright and deliberate and <Col N="45" /> dishonest misrepresentation of his political opponents.  Deputy Seán MacEntee is thoroughly unfit to hold Ministerial rank because of the recklessness and irresponsibility which he has shown in the House from time to time and in which he particularly excels when he is on election platforms. I think his political dishonesty is highly dangerous, but I think his political imbecility is still more dangerous from a national point of view.  In the present tense international situation, everybody ought to weigh very carefully the views which he expresses on international matters. Every possible care should be exercised to ensure that nothing is said which is calculated to bring the might of much more powerful nations down on top of us here.  If there is any one point upon which care and prudence and caution should be exercised, surely it is in expressing opinions on international matters, and yet we had Deputy MacEntee strutting around the country during the last election almost challenging the British and the Americans to send us more Notes so that he would show the people how the Taoiseach would deal with them.  I should have thought that the Taoiseach, during the election, would have found an opportunity of repudiating the irresponsible vapourings of the Minister for Local Government, but the Taoiseach's silence on that matter seems to give approbation to the idea that even the Government might welcome more British or American Notes, with all that they imply, so that Deputy MacEntee might get votes for himself in his new home of Imperialism.  I know, of course, that it is extremely difficult to muzzle the ex-Minister for Local Government and Public Health, and I know the anxiety which some of his colleagues feel when he thinks fit to deliver himself on international matters.  In peace times we could afford to allow him at large with a reasonable measure of liberty, but I think in a tense international situation Deputy MacEntee is a dangerous person to hold Ministerial rank, and to be permitted to deliver himself of such reckless utterances as those to which he gave vent during the recent election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="46" /> It seemed to me that Deputy MacEntee was simply bursting to get more international pressure put upon us here so as to be able to show the way in which the Fianna Fáil Party would deal with the international situation and with all those powerful belligerents, and to show that that was a reason why Fianna Fáil should get more votes at the recent election.  I think that the high-water mark was reached by him when he suggested that there was a conspiracy to defeat the Government on the occasion of the Transport Bill and, if you do not mind, he said that that was linked up with the Allied offensive in Italy. In effect, the Minister said that the defeat of the Government was arranged to coincide with the start of the Allied offensive in Italy.  One can plumb many depths, but there is no plumbing the depths of imbecility and recklessness of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  He said, in effect, that the moment the British Army went on the offensive in Italy, that was the moment that was availed of by the Opposition Parties for bringing about the defeat of the Fianna Fáil Government here.  Did anybody ever hear such a puerile, reckless, and irresponsible statement as that?  Yet, that is the Minister whom we are asked to vote for now.  That is the Minister we are asked to put into office again, to steer this country through the very complex and dangerous situation that now exists.</P>
    <P>I regard that Minister as the greatest liability that this country could have.  I am firmly convinced that he should be muzzled.  I am firmly convinced that he should not be at large.  I am firmly convinced that he will do the Taoiseach terrible damage&mdash; even more damage in the future than he has done in the past&mdash;and I say that in the difficult and dangerous circumstances with which we are now confronted the appointment of such a Minister would be a national liability which the Taoiseach should not be asked to bear.  I, therefore, would appeal to the Taoiseach to suggest to Deputy MacEntee that he should draw his Ministerial pension and go into Ministerial retirement.  After the magnificent work he has given to the <Col N="47" /> nation, I suggest that he is entitled to go into retirement on a Ministerial pension, and I believe that if the Taoiseach will take that advice the nation will benefit by it; but if the Taoiseach insists on having such an irresponsible Minister in his Government, then we have no alternative except to vote against this proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Personally, I feel that it is very hard, on a motion of this kind, to speak about individual Ministers when they are presented to the House <i>en bloc</i>, but it would appear that that is the rule and, accordingly, it cannot be got over at the moment. It is especially hard, when you have to try to single out particular Ministers, because, when you try to give the usual expression to your views, first and foremost you will be asked: What about the Minister for External Affairs?  Now, with regard to the policy of the Minister for External Affairs, and the policy of this country in regard to external affairs in general, I want to say, speaking on behalf of this Party here, that we are in full agreement with that policy, because we believe that it is the only real, sound, honest and honourable policy for this country.  In the recent election, however, when talking about individual Ministers, you were asked: Whom do you want to put in as Minister for External Affairs?  As I am on that point, I may say that I do not want to say anything in connection with that particular Ministerial post, but there has been the question of singling out certain Ministers.  No doubt, to use a phrase that was used last year, and that was used over and over again in this election, the election might have resulted in a certain mixum-gatherum kind of Government, but so far as we, the people representing the land, are concerned, we certainly have got to single out one Minister, and that is the Minister for Agriculture.  There is no doubt that agricultural production in this country has not reached the standard which it should have reached. There can be no doubt at all about that, and we feel that the major blame for that must rest on the Minister for <Col N="48" /> Agriculture, because it would appear that he is not able to fight his cause in the same way as other Ministers can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear that if other Ministers want millions of pounds for this, that or the other purpose, those millions of pounds can be got, but when it comes to a question of the bed-rock industry of this country, agriculture&mdash;the industry that supplies 80 per cent. of this country's wealth&mdash; it has &ldquo;to go fish&rdquo; every time.  I want to throw out a warning with regard to this year, and I hope the Minister is listening to it.  You are going to have less butter this year than you had last year, and you are going to have stricter rationing.  Why?  Because of the cheese-paring that went on in regard to the dairy farming industry in this country.</P>
      <P>Take, for instance, also, tillage farming in this country.  Certain things happened during the lifetime of the Eleventh Dáil, that, I think, never happened before in any democratic assembly in the world.  For instance, when a motion was put forward by a Deputy last year to help tillage in this country there was not even a reply from the Minister.  The Minister sat down.  Now, that was a direct insult, and it certainly was not a good headline to set in what is called a democratic assembly.  Again, take what happened as regards wool prices in this country.  Over-night an Emergency Powers Order was issued&mdash;just as you would draw a razor across the wool producer's throat&mdash;and yet the Minister for Agriculture was quite dumb: not a word from him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, there is nothing personal about this, but our idea is&mdash;and it is the views of the people I represent in this House&mdash;that a Government that refuses to accept the principle that 80 per cent. of this nation's wealth, the very life blood of this nation, comes from agriculture, should not be supported, and I think that until the time comes when you have a Government that is prepared to accept that principle in this country, our country will not be what it should be. <Col N="49" /> I have listened to a number of plans put forward by different Ministers, for which millions of pounds were asked, but it would appear that there was no plan at all from the Minister for Agriculture. Certain Ministers have been telling us that £9,000,000 or £10,000,000 would be required for building, reconstruction work, and so on, and we all know that something like £16,000,000 was asked for in connection with a private transport monopoly in this country.  Millions of pounds are asked for in connection with various industries in this country, but there is not one word at all about anything to help the industry that is the foundation of the whole lot.  I would ask this question of the Minister himself: How is it that every Minister can get away with what he wants, except the Minister for Agriculture?</P>
    <P>Definitely, there is nothing personal about this, but we feel, as I said here before, that in these circumstances we are bound to vote against this <i>bloc</i>, because we think that the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dr. Ryan, is not making the fight for agriculture that he should make.  Again, I believe, and I do sincerely hope that this great Government majority will be used in the best interests of the country, but we feel bound to vote against the <i>bloc</i> that has been presented to us by the Taoiseach, because we think that the Minister for Agriculture has not been making the fight he ought to make.</P>
    <P>There is another Minister against whom we shall also definitely vote, and that is Deputy MacEntee, who as Minister for Local Government and Public Health, within 24 hours of his election, issued an ultimatum dissolving the Roscommon County Council, although the Fianna Fáil Party escaped there with a very slender majority.  A majority of farmers was represented there, and it was a democratic assembly that was doing what was best for the taxpayers and ratepayers of the county, and I should like to know why, if it was necessary to dissolve that council, the Minister did not do so before the election. These are some of the reasons why we feel that we must vote against this <Col N="50" /> proposal.  There are two chief reasons. One is that we feel that the Minister for Agriculture has not been making the fight that he should make for the basic industry of this country, namely, agriculture; and the second reason is that the other gentleman adopted such a dictatorial attitude the moment he found himself at the top again.</P>

      <P>When this Dáil was electing the Taoiseach to-day it gave me a queer kind of satisfaction to see the Irish people exercising their sovereign right to do wrong, albeit in the very hour in which they were doing gravely wrong.  I remember, as many other Deputies do, people like the late Arthur Balfour undertaking to provide for the &ldquo;contemptible Irish&rdquo; a good Government and pointing out that if the Irish people were allowed to choose their own Government, they would choose a bad one. Our reply to that was: &ldquo;What the hell has that to do with you; clear out of the country and let the Irish people choose what Government they wish.&rdquo; That was the right we exercised to-day when we watched the Irish people do wrong, as was their sovereign right.  Now we come to another point. The Taoiseach has been graced with many titles.  Indeed he has described himself as a man who encompasses the whole Irish people in his heart and says that he has only to look into it to discover what they wish.  I suppose it is in pursuit of that process that he has submitted this rather moth-eaten list to us this evening.  It rejoices me to have the opportunity to tell him that his heart deceives him.  His list of Ministers reflects no credit on any people and it is a privilege to be afforded the opportunity of voting against it, as I propose to do.  I do so with special reference to three of them: Deputy James Ryan, Deputy MacEntee and Deputy Aiken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do so in regard to Deputy Ryan, because he must be the most incompetent Minister in Europe, if not in the whole world.  Every agricultural <Col N="51" /> activity upon which his malevolent glance has fallen has withered under his evil eye.  If I could exorcise the devil in him I should be happy to do so, but I do commend to Deputy Ryan that he should withdraw from Ministerial responsibility voluntarily, that he should consult his conscience on his own record and realise that whatever other functions he can discharge in this country, the Ministry of Agriculture he should avoid like a plague.  He planned pigs; he planned butter; everything he has ever planned has vanished like snow in summer sunshine. There are not any pigs in the country, and there is practically no butter.  In due course, if he is allowed to continue planning in this country, he will achieve the prodigy that was once achieved by a special pet of the late Sir Horace Plunkett who was established on a farm in County Meath to demonstrate to Irish farmers modern methods of agriculture in accordance with the new philosophy. He achieved the prodigy of stripping the land of Meath of even blades of grass.  I prophesy that if Deputy James Ryan is allowed to function in this country for another five years as Minister for Agriculture, not a single farmer will be able to earn his living. They will be all on the dole, every one of them.</P>

      <P>There are a good many of them on the dole as it is.  It has been often said that the poor love de Valera.  It has been said in reply: &ldquo;Well he made a whole lot of them in this country and that accounts for his majority.&rdquo;  Is that not true?  Every broken-down creature in this country believes that he must vote for de Valera lest the dole be withdrawn.  We on this side of the House ambition a situation in which the farmers can live without being under any compliment to Taoiseach de Valera or anybody else.  Remember they lived in this country without being under any compliment to Fianna Fáil for hundreds of years before Taoiseach de Valera <Col N="52" /> was ever heard of, and, please God, we shall create a situation in this country in which there will be prosperity on the land hundreds of years after the name of de Valera has been providentially forgotten.</P>
      <P>Let us now turn to Deputy MacEntee.  Deputy MacEntee has done many indiscreet things in his time.  I confess I am not a good hater because when I work myself up to hate anybody, the hate never lasts for more than about three minutes, and I quite forget about it.  I would find it very hard to hate Deputy MacEntee because in many ways he is a silly man and nobody will deny that he is an agreeable man, but there are limits to the depths to which politics can be brought in this country.  It is 12 years since the Fianna Fáil Party took out of a speech of Deputy McGilligan in this House a paragraph in which the words occurred: &ldquo;If people die of hunger in this country, it is none of the Government's business.&rdquo;  Deputy McGilligan, having used those words, then turned to the Labour Benches and said: &ldquo;Some people will advance that view but nobody on the Labour Benches and nobody on the benches on our side, will ever accept that philosophy.&rdquo; The proposition was stated for the purpose of condemning it, but the words were extracted and plastered all over the country as representing Deputy McGilligan's private opinion. That dirty, foul slander was repeated in general election after general election and, after it had been publicly exposed several times in this House, there were creatures to be found on the Fianna Fáil Benches to use it again. In this election Deputy Norton delivered a speech down the country in the course of which he said that this was a time of grave danger, and that no responsible man who had any regard for the safety of the country would take any action calculated to divide the people.  He went on to say that this attempt to disrupt the country, this attempt to set one man against another&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Having quoted these words he promptly condemned the suggestion <Col N="53" /> and reflected harshly on the Taoiseach's conduct in doing these very things.  I am not arguing whether he justly condemned the Taoiseach for doing these things, but having stated these things he condemned them categorically.  Deputy MacEntee, well knowing the full text of Deputy Norton's speech, extracted from the speech the condemnation of splitting the country.  He took out the words &ldquo;This is the time to split the country; this is the time to cause confusion and to break up national unity&rdquo;.  He published them as a positive statement of Deputy Norton's views as to what should be done at the present time, and he asked: &ldquo;Would you vote for a man who gives expression to these views?&rdquo;  That conduct is dastardly. It is shameful.  It is shameful that any man in the public life of this country should stoop to such contemptible conduct.</P>

      <P>I do not but there are limits beyond which this House should not go.  I say let us by all means be excused for the things we say. Some of us, I am aware, may in the heat of the moment say a little more than we intended.  Very well, we must answer for that to the people provided we say these things.  Public men in any country are held responsible for the things they say and the deeds they have done, but what is dastardly, iniquitous and corrupting the whole public life of the country is that a responsible public man, a man bearing the dignity of an Irish Minister, should go out and deliberately falsify the truth in an effort to seek to sway the people to a certain course of conduct.  If you take some little robin-round-the-ditch or some little fellow of no significance you may say: &ldquo;He is an inexperienced fellow; he does not realise the gravity of what he is doing&rdquo;, but here was a man who was a Minister of an Irish Government, who knew well what he was doing, who was not carried away in his speech, or did not allow his recollection to betray him.  He got the <Col N="54" /> extract; he actually cut it out, got the printer to set it up and, after he had examined the proofs, tendered it for publication.</P>

I myself say fairly rough things, and I do not quarrel with anybody who, in the heat of an election speech, says a little more than he intends. I am glad to say that no freer or more democratic election was ever held in any county than the election. I fought in County Monaghan.  I could say anything I wanted to say.  Every conceivable protection for which a public man could ask, so as to be absolutely free to say what he wanted to say, was afforded me, and I believe that that was done on the express instructions of the then Government.  I do not want to misrepresent them.  I am not referring to words spoken in heat.  All of us make mistakes of that character.

I want clearly to distinguish between words spoken in heat and words printed with the cold-blooded intention not only of deceiving the electors but of blackening an honourable man's reputation. Deputy Norton and I agree about practically nothing.  We have said harsh things about each other, and, probably, will again.  That does not matter.  What matters is that men going out to contest political elections should be able to expect that they will not be deliberately traduced and slandered in cold blood by their opponents.</P>

      <P>An effort is being made to obscure the significance of what I am saying by interruptions.  The Ceann Comhairle has long experience of Parliament and so have I, and skilful interruptions are not going to obscure my point, if I can make it clear.  It is because Deputy MacEntee stood for that conduct during the last general election that I name him as one of the persons on whose account I am going to vote against this proposed Government. The last person I name is Deputy Frank Aiken.  I have had a good volume of support in condemning Deputy MacEntee because his misconduct <Col N="57" /> was manifest and obvious. Deputy Aiken I condemn for his scandalous misuse of the censorship to bewilder our people at home and misrepresent our people abroad.</P>
      <P>I consider the administration of the censorship in this country to be a grave scandal and a wicked disservice to our people.  I have, on the occasion of the Estimate on which the responsible Minister's salary is borne, ventilated that matter exhaustively.  I do not propose to go into it in detail now but I should not be honest and I should not be frank with the House if I did not make it quite clear that the presence of that man in the Government should, in my opinion, condemn the Government before our people and before the peoples of the world, because those who, by his activities, are offended will resent his membership of the Government and those upon whom he fawns by his activities will despise him.  I deplore his continued association with the Government and I should have wished that, when the Taoiseach was choosing what he describes as his &ldquo;team&rdquo;, he had omitted that serious blot upon their jerseys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I knew that when the people chose Eamon de Valera as Taoiseach they were making a very grave mistake. This is the first consequence of that mistake.  Well, the people have elected to do wrong.  As I said, at an earlier stage, the duty of the Opposition is to do all they can during the next few years to mitigate the deplorable consequences of that error.  We have pointed out to the Taoiseach the names of three of his most obnoxious choices. Possibly, the words we use to-day will sink in during the next year or so and the Taoiseach may drop them from the Government.  If he does not that will not be our fault, but we have a clear duty to point out not only how utterly unsuitable these men are to continue as members of the Government but to reinforce those representations by our votes, so that the Taoiseach will remember that nobody outside the servile 76 whom he controls and who depend on his coat-tails for the seats they hold approves the choice he has made <Col N="58" /> of Ministers to assist him in his Government.</P>

      <P>I had hoped that the Dáil on reassembling after the result of the unholy combination that succeeded in delaying the work of this House for over a month would get back to business, and would not have the election fought over again in this Chamber.  Apparently we are to have it fought over again.  One would think that if there was to be any impeachment of the Minister for Local Government it would be on his work as Minister for Local Government.  Apparently no leader of any responsible Party in this House dared to impeach the work of the Minister in the Department of Local Government during his period of office.  Every proposal the Minister brought to this House during that period met with the unanimous consent of all Parties.  We had also an attack on the Minister for Agriculture, and that extended from Deputy Donnellan as Leader of the Farmers' Party to the representative of the Unionists in Monaghan, Deputy Dillon.</P>

I could quite understand an attack being made on the Minister for Agriculture or on any other Minister by other Deputies, but not by a Deputy whose object since he came into this House was to prevent the policy of the present Minister to provide bread for our people in this emergency bearing fruit. A certain policy was deliberate on his part and had a sinister object.  We cannot close our eyes to his action when deputy-leader of the Fine Gael Party, when he told us about the mouldy flour produced from Irish wheat.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to discuss agricultural policy now.  I am only dealing with points in the attack that was made on the Minister for Agriculture by the leader of the Farmers' Party.  I want to deal with nothing else.  We heard little talk about butter from the Farmers' Party despite the fact that more butter is produced now than in pre-war years.  We heard talk about millions being spent <Col N="61" /> on everything but agriculture.  I am a farmer, and I did not hear any talk about the millions that have been spent on agriculture from 1932 to 1940, in order to induce our farmers to grow wheat so that the people of this country would be fed during the emergency. Last year we know what happened about beet and how the Sugar Company acted.  Let us be sensible and let us give credit to the Minister for Agriculture for what he has done for farmers.  It is a credit to him to have put this country into the position that we were able to tell foreigners that, thank God, we have sufficient bread for the needs of the Irish people.  After all, that is the main thing for any Irishman to look to at the present time.  It was the Minister for Agriculture that introduced that policy and that carried it through despite the opposition on other benches.  Let us give credit to the Minister for that.  As a farmer I freely give Deputy Ryan credit for being the best Minister for Agriculture that this House ever had.  I say that openly and frankly.  I am speaking now not as a Fianna Fáil Deputy but as a farmer.</P>

      <P>When we hear from the benches opposite the statements about the election speeches, we can all very well remember what was shouted from every public platform throughout the Twenty-Six Counties during the past month, when the people were being asked for their verdict.  They were asked for their verdict on the conduct of these gentlemen here.  They were asked for their verdict not only on Eamon de Valera but on the Ministers and their administration as well, and they gave it with no uncertain voice. It was not my intention to speak to-night, but I could not sit here any longer and listen to the concentrated venom that was being poured out. Any time that they do that again they will get, as far as I am concerned, better than they give.</P>

      <P>I am sorry for the course that the debate has taken. Deputy Donnellan stated in the beginning of his speech that he was accused last year of coercing Deputy de Valera and his Government.  He also said that he is going to vote against the Ministers to-day.  Last year Deputy Donnellan had the chance of changing the Ministers, and if he had used the power that he had last year the farmers would not have got into the difficulties that he maintains they are in to-day.  Deputy Donnellan, in my opinion, is not straight in doing what he is doing to-day.  Last year he had the power of knocking out the present Minister for Agriculture but he did not use it.  He knows that he has not that power to-day.  Therefore he is only trying to blind the farmers of the country by voting against the Minister for Agriculture.  I am not surprised at Deputy Corry or Deputy Killilea.  These two farmers, with their big pensions, have been bolstered under every Act passed by the Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture.  If there was a contract to be got for seeds or otherwise, Deputy Corry was the first man to get it.</P>

      <P>With regard to the policy of the Minister for Agriculture, I want to warn the Taoiseach about certain things.  The policy of Deputy Ryan, while he was Minister for Agriculture, has left the country in the position that it has not 1 lb. of butter to export.</P>

      <P>It is because lard has completely disappeared from this country.  Where has it gone to?  We are not able to give a lb. of butter per head to our people.  Seven or eight years ago we used to export thousands and thousands of sheep every Thursday to England.  In the last two years we did not export a sheep.  Our cattle boats are going out half empty.  There you have two branches of agriculture which are going down and down.  I want to warn the Taoiseach that by the time the war is over there will be a shortage of all these things on the Continent. I ask him to see that millions of pounds are made available for the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;I know that Deputy Ryan is going to be appointed Minister again&mdash;so that he may bring about a situation which will enable thousands and thousands of lbs. of butter to be exported, and thousands and thousands of cattle and sheep to be <Col N="65" /> exported as well.  The present position is that we have nothing to barter so far as other countries are concerned. We have no surplus in any branch of our agriculture to export.  I also ask the new Minister for Finance to throw thousands of pounds into the Department of Agriculture so that what I have just suggested may be done.  I know the Minister for Agriculture will be reelected and personally I have nothing to say against him.  I would like to stress the future we have in front of us for the export of a surplus of agricultural produce and I would ask the Government to do something to increase that surplus enormously.</P>

When I heard Deputy Dillon, and heard also a remark made by Deputy Coburn, I felt I could not leave this House without replying. Deputy Coburn said across the House to me that I bought an evicted farm. I want to tell Deputy Coburn that I did buy the farm.  I have no interest in the farm and no interest in land; but in regard to anyone who stands for a no rent campaign or no rate campaign, in as far as in my power, I will see they are dispossessed and I will see that the land of this country is of the same value as the house in city or town.  When men have obligations to meet, I will see that they meet them.  I make no apology to anyone in this House or in the country for my action in buying that farm.  I do not want that farm or any farm; I do not want any interest in land or ownership of land.  So much for Deputy Coburn.</P>

We heard from the lips of Deputy Dillon that there was something scurrilous said in my county from the platforms in Cashel&mdash;which Deputy Mulcahy knows all about&mdash;that there was bribery and corruption, which Deputies know all about.  I would have challenged Deputy Mulcahy or his henchmen in Cashel to prove that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I stood up to speak on four occasions, and I should be allowed to express my views briefly.  The team which has been proposed to form the Government has, in my opinion, not given full satisfaction. Last year when this question of approving of the Taoiseach's nomination of Ministers was submitted to the House, we of the Farmers' Party took up a certain attitude.  We said: &ldquo;The Government Party are now in a minority.  We consider that the Fianna Fáil Party, though they have been unsatisfactory in the past, should be given an opportunity to carry on as a minority Party in this House, and of showing whether they are prepared to co-operate with other Parties when those other Parties are in a majority&rdquo;&mdash;as we were in the last Dáil.  We had hoped that a better spirit would prevail. <Col N="70" /> We had hoped that the attitude which we took up when we came into this House would be reflected by other Parties.  Instead of that, we found that our attitude was venomously misrepresented throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fagan said that we had a chance of defeating the Government last year.  We certainly had, but for the purpose of giving an opportunity to the Fianna Fáil Party to adjust themselves to a new situation, a situation in which they were in a minority, we allowed the Government to be formed.  In the light of 12 months' experience, we regret that we allowed that Government to be formed.  We found every measure adopted by the Government was not in the interests of agriculture but was hostile to agriculture; we found that every measure proposed by the Government was to the detriment of agriculture; we found that every proposal put up by our Party and submitted in a reasonable manner to the House was turned down, completely ignored.  The representations we made in this House were publicly, insulted.</P>
      <P>I understand that Ministers are not supposed to intervene in this particular discussion, but the Minister for Agriculture did intervene with the observation &ldquo;To Hell with exports.&rdquo; How can we expect agriculture to progress if we have our Minister for Agriculture&mdash;or the Deputy who is proposed for that position&mdash;shouting here &ldquo;To Hell with exports&rdquo;?  Surely we have to import some goods and surely it will be recognised that there is nothing we can export except agricultural produce.  Yet we have the man who is proposed for the position of Minister for Agriculture shouting here &ldquo;To Hell with exports.&rdquo;  If that is to be the position, there is little future for agriculture.</P>
      <P>I have no intention of dwelling upon the charges made against Deputy Breen, but Deputy Breen made a charge against certain individuals who are not in this House.  He accused the farmer, whose farm he purchased, of being engaged in a no-rate campaign. I know from personal knowledge that there is no truth whatever in that statement.</P>

      <P>We as a Farmers' Party cannot support the team that has been proposed by the Taoiseach.  First of all, there is the Minister for Finance, who publicly stated that the farmers were getting off too lightly in the matter of taxation.  He publicly proclaimed his policy of taxing them still more severely.  How could we stand over the election of such a Minister, or over the election of the proposed Minister for Industry and Commerce, who has made a small group of people so wealthy that they are determined to keep Fianna Fáil in power for all time through the power of their purses?  How could we support the man who is proposed as Minister for Local Government and Public Health, the man who has ruthlessly suppressed one of the best county councils in Eire, a farmers' county council?  These are the persons the Taoiseach has proposed and these are the men we will oppose in every possible way.</P>

      <P>I regret the direction that this discussion has taken.  We have had frequent references to the elections and the speeches made during the elections. I have taken my part in the elections and I criticised the Ministers and their policy, but the people accepted not my view, but the view put forward by the Government.  The Taoiseach has been appointed and he has the right to select his team to form a <Col N="72" /> Government.  For that team I am going to vote, not that I agree with the proposed Ministers in their policy, but because I accept the verdict of the people.</P>
      <P>No concrete case has been put up against the efficiency of any particular Minister, though various speeches have been made.  There was a speech made against the Minister for Agriculture. He represents one of the best agricultural constituencies in Eire.  He has been returned at the head of the poll for that constituency.  If the people in that area have elected him at the head of the poll, I suggest that we should meet their wishes by supporting the team which includes the Minister for Agriculture.  I am prepared to use my position in this House in criticising the policies of different Ministers when their Departments come under consideration, but I am not prepared to misinterpret the views of the electors, which were given in an unmistakable manner when they elected Fianna Fáil in such numbers, notwithstanding all the arguments we put up to try to convince them of the mistake of electing that Party.  I am prepared within the next five years to try to convert the people and to show them the mistake they made.  At the moment, however, I and the members of this Party, representing a rising section of the community, are prepared to vote for the team proposed by the Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>The opening of the Twelfth Dáil has been very disappointing, judging by the speeches made here to-day and the reactions of the various Parties.  I do not intend to go over the election campaign.  If I and other Deputies did so, I expect we might have to remain here all night. We were not sent here for that purpose, anyway.  I would like to protest very emphatically against the action of the Minister for Local Government in dissolving the Roscommon County Council.  We have nothing against the Minister as an individual, but as Minister for Local Government we feel that he acted in a very high-handed manner. After all, the Roscommon County Council was an elected body.</P>

      <P>If it is only as a Minister, as you suggested, I will agree with your suggestion.  But I will say this much: that he is not fit to occupy a position as Minister.  That is my candid belief, and it is also the belief of many other members of this House.  So far as Deputy Dr. Ryan is concerned, as an individual he is all right, but we are of the opinion that a better man for that position could be found even on the Fianna Fáil Benches, because he has not handled the agricultural position in the way we would like him to have done.  A Fine Gael Deputy made it quite clear to us that we got a chance to remove Deputy Dr. Ryan but that we did not avail of that opportunity.  I should like to remind the Fine Gael Deputy that we gave Deputy Dr. Ryan a chance.  Being here as a Party for the first time, it was only reasonable and democratic to give him a chance.  We gave him that chance and we found that he failed in his stewardship.  We have not the power to remove him now, but we will protest by going into the Lobby and voting against Deputy MacEntee and Deputy Dr. Ryan as prospective Ministers.</P>

If the people outside knew what has gone on here to-day, I think we would need more than ponies and traps to take them to the polls next time to vote for any Party.  It is a disgrace and I want to register my protest.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That it is expedient that legislation be enacted to give statutory effect to certain Financial Resolutions passed on the 3rd day of May, 1944, by Dáil Eireann in Committee on Finance and to make provision for other matters relating to or connected with the said Financial Resolutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dáil is probably aware of the consequences that followed the suspension of the business which was before the House when the dissolution came.  The dissolution brought to an end the business that was before the Dáil, financial business and various Bills.  It means that all that work which had been done has to be begun all over again in the new Parliament. Four of the Resolutions passed in Committee on Finance on 3rd May last, that is, on the day of the Budget Statement, were given statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act as from 6th April last, that is, as from the commencement of the current income-tax year.  That Act, however, provides that Financial Resolutions to which statutory effect is thus given shall cease to have statutory effect on a dissolution of the Dáil.  A gap has, therefore, come into existence which, if it were not bridged, would result in a position of confusion and uncertainty being created which would affect not only the revenue but also thousands of persons throughout the country, in relation to deduction of income tax from payments of ground rents, mortgage interest, dividends, etc.  The Collection of Taxes (Confirmation) Bill, 1944, with which the first Resolution on this White Paper deals, is designed to put an end to any such uncertainty, and to restore the position to what it would have been if the Budget Resolutions <Col N="80" /> in question had continued to have the force of law up to the date of the passing of the Finance Bill.  It will be observed that the Bill gives to the Resolutions a purely temporary life.  All the Resolutions with which the Bill deals will be introduced afresh prior to the introduction of the Finance Bill, which will contain clauses to the same effect as the Resolutions.  The Finance Bill, however, cannot become law for some weeks, and it is essential that the state of uncertainty to which I have referred should not prevail in the meantime.  I think the House will agree that, in the circumstances, it is obviously a matter of urgency that the ordinary business of the deduction of taxes from mortgages, dividends, and so on, should be properly put in order and legalised during the short interval which will elapse before the putting into law of the Finance Bill.</P>

    <P>(2)  That where&mdash;</P>

    <P>the second company shall also be deemed, for the purposes of this Resolution, to be a subsidiary of the pre-appointed day company.</P>

    <P>(6)  (a) That where the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that part of the issued capital of a post-appointed day company, which is deemed by this Resolution to be a subsidiary of a pre-appointed day company, would, if the said capital had been issued by the pre-appointed day company as its own capital, have entitled the pre-appointed day company either to a deduction from profits under Section 41 of the Act of 1941 or to any increase in its substituted standard under Section 39 of the Act of 1941, they may, for the purposes of the said sections, deem the said part of the issued capital of the post-appointed day company to be capital issued by the pre-appointed day company.</P>

    <P>(a)  the pre-appointed day company and each of the post-appointed day companies shall be liable jointly and severally to pay the excess,</P>

    <P>(9) (a)  That a company (in this sub-paragraph referred to as the second company) shall, for the purposes of this Resolution, be deemed to be an auxiliary of another company (in this sub-paragraph referred to as the first company) if</P>

      <P>(2)  That without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred by paragraph (1) of this Resolution, the powers conferred by the said paragraph shall extend to&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the charging with corporation profits tax of companies which, but for the adjustments, would not be chargeable with any corporation profits tax or would not be chargeable to the same extent,</P>

We are all, however, familiar with the fact that, no matter how carefully a Bill is drafted, skilful lawyers may discover some lacuna in it if the reward for such a discovery is sufficiently high, that is to say if a matter of £10,000 or £20,000 in the income-tax were at stake.  It has rightly been laid down in this House, that, where a citizen derives under a Bill a benefit which this House never really meant him to get, and if he has gone into court and has got judgment in his favour, the House is extremely reluctant to upset the decision of the court, albeit they may take precautions <Col N="93" /> to ensure that the judgment in that man's favour will not be used as a precedent for further judgments.  Would it not be well to have a declaration&mdash; of which judicial notice, of course, cannot be taken but still the public could make a note of it&mdash;that, in connection with this measure, if any proceedings are instituted designed to derive a benefit which would not have been available if the dissolution had not taken place, this House intends to legislate <i>ad hoc</i> to prevent any citizen from securing such a benefit, and that we propose to take <i>ad hoc</i> any steps that may be necessary hereafter to ensure that not only the letter but the spirit of this measure shall be given full effect to?</P>

      <P>The only thing I should like to say with reference to Deputy Dillon's remarks is that if any such point is likely to arise it might be well if the matter were considered before the Bill reaches the Seanad, so that the necessary amendment could be introduced here.  There is considerable objection to the idea of retrospective legislation.</P>

      <P>We have a precedent to guide us in this matter.  We had a similar situation in 1938, when the Finance Bill had not been passed for that year.  I think it was in the month of May that the dissolution took place then.</P>
      <P>I am advised by those who are more competent in this matter than I am, that if this Bill is passed to-day it is most unlikely that anybody will take advantage of the position.  However, we shall examine the matter, as put forward by Deputies Mulcahy and Dillon, and if there is any lacuna we shall endeavour to meet it.</P>
