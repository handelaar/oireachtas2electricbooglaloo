      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if there is any officer, representative of the Éire Government <Col N="2044" /> in the United Kingdom, who is charged with the supervision of the welfare of Irish workers engaged in industrial employment in the United Kingdom; and, if not, whether he will consider the appointment of such an officer.</P>

      <P>No specific appointment has been made for the purpose referred to by the Deputy, but matters affecting the welfare of Irish industrial workers in Great Britain are constantly being dealt with by the staff of the High Commissioner's Office in London.</P>
      <P>I have no evidence that the existing machinery is inadequate, but I am prepared to consider any representations which may be made to me on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that there is an officer charged with keeping in touch with some of our people&mdash;the migratory workers?  I should like to point out that their numbers are small compared to the numbers of industrial workers.  There must be at least 110,000 to 117,000 men and women without anyone representing this Government to look after their welfare.  The Commissioner's Office in London, to my own knowledge, is not doing so. I suggest that the Taoiseach might, at a later stage, reconsider this matter and appoint some officer, a man or a woman, who will interest himself or herself in the welfare of our citizens over there.  I am asking that as an urgent matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that there is an officer looking after the interests of the agricultural workers.  I understand that a certain section of the staff at the High Commissioner's Office in London is charged with dealing with any complaints of Irish workers, getting in contact with them and doing the various things required by correspondence. There is no field officer. so to speak.  I might say that the matter was under consideration&mdash;the possibility of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will consider the introduction of amending legislation to the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1939, to provide for the granting of annual leave with pay to casual workers, such as casual dockers, storehands, etc., who at present are held to be not entitled to such annual leave under the provisions of the said Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>Dockers, carters and other port workers come within the provisions of the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1939, provided they fulfil the conditions as to continuity of employment and the number of hours' work performed for the same employer.  The difficulty of bringing casual workers, who have recurring periods of unemployment, within the scope of the Act is, however, obvious.  This difficulty is accentuated in the case of casual dockers who are not infrequently employed by different employers on different days in the same week.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the difficulty created by the discontinuity of employment amongst such workers has not been reduced by the circumstances caused by the present emergency, and for this reason I do not at present consider it practicable to attempt the amending of the Holidays Act.  As I intimated on a previous occasion, I am, however, prepared to consider any practical suggestion put forward on behalf of such workers in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that, in respect of a large body of workers who are employed as casual workers by the same employer, they have fully complied with all the provisions of the Holidays (Employees) Act except for one technicality, namely, that they are paid off at the end of each day and, therefore, it is held, technically, that the employer does not terminate their employment. Surely that situation could be remedied, in view of what the Minister said yesterday, that it is necessary to ensure that the intention of this House is embodied in the original Act could be introduced.  If the intention of the House has not been given effect to, thus depriving the workers of a benefit to which they are entitled, surely amending legislation should be introduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of the intention of the Legislature in passing this Act, which was to provide holidays with pay for all workers in continuous employment.  I think the difficulty of extending such benefits to casual workers is obvious.  I do not think the suggestion which the Deputy put forward would touch more than a small fringe of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely a worker who has worked 2,200 continuous hours comes within the intentions of the Parliament responsible for that particular Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say so, but clearly the whole problem of applying the Act to casual dockers is much wider than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>How is it that we could arrange to do this with the casual workers in the building trade?  There was no difficulty there.  We have shown the employers on more than one occasion how to meet this difficulty. The Deputy who submitted the question mentioned the case of a man with over 2,000 hours of continuous service; a man needs only 1,800 hours to qualify but, in the case of casual workers, they are paid every night.  I suggest that advantage is being taken of this Act by the employers.</P>

They got that advance in 1940, but received nothing extra since, although their claim has been in for some time.  Why has there been such delay in sanctioning a further increase in view of the fact that an agreement was arrived at between the union and the employers concerned?

      <P>(a) The numbers of unemployment insurance books current during each of the five insurance years 1938-39 to 1942-43 inclusive were, respectively, 432,316, 432,127, 440,756, 439,457 and 420,728.  (b) The numbers of unemployments insurance books issued to persons entering into insurable employment for the first time during each of these years were, respectively, 44,687, 43,731, 53,631, 45,979 and 45,618.  In regard to (c) of the Deputy's question, it should be pointed out that the number of books current during an insurance year represents the number of books exchanged together with the number of new books issued.  The exchange begins on the first day of the insurance year and continues throughout the year; about 80 per cent.  of the exchange takes place, however, in the first month of the insurance year.</P>

      <P>Mr. Shiel's appointment as part-time branch manager at Enniscorthy was subject to three months' written notice of termination given on either side without cause assigned, the Minister reserving to himself the power, in certain circumstances, to terminate the appointment either summarily or at shorter notice.  Three months' written notice terminating his appointment without cause assigned was issued to Mr. Shiel.  His services terminated on 24th January, 1944.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the usual procedure in such cases, payment of the balance of remuneration due to Mr. Shiel is being withheld pending completion of the audit of the Enniscorthy Branch Employment Office accounts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Redmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if, in view of the fact that the custom of steam-rolling and tar-spraying the entire width of roads renders them extremely dangerous to horse traffic, he will direct local authorities to leave a margin on each side of such roads suitable for such traffic.</P>

      <P>I dealt with this matter in concluding the debate on the Vote for my Department on the 4th November last.  My views are set out on page 1659 of the Offical Report for that date.</P>
      <P>So far as new roads are concerned, I indicated in a recent speech which I made to the county surveyors that, under the comprehensive plan for the modernisation and improvement of our road system, upon which the Department's engineering staff has been engaged, it was intended, with the exception of new class 4 roads, that the proposed verge width on all new roads would be sufficient to allow a surface strip suitable for horse-drawn traffic to be laid at each side of the carriageway.</P>
      <P>So far as the present roads are concerned I indicated in the debate referred to that we cannot take any liberties with them by altering the present lay-out.  We have to try to keep them even as they are until such time as circumstances will permit of their eventual reconstruction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It emerged from the investigations which were made in connection with the suggested scheme of footwear that the position was dependent to a very great extent upon securing an increase in the present supply.

      <P>The Minister will recall that on a former occasion when he replied to a similar question, he indicated that public assistance officers had a certain power in respect to the issue of relief in kind.  Subsequently I asked the Parliamentary Secretary if he would draw the attention of public assistance officers to the fact that they possessed these powers, and he stated that he did not think it necessary to do so.  In the meantime, I find that a number of applications was made to public assistance officers in Dublin, and they stated that they had not these powers.

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Town and Regional Planning Act, 1934, and regulations made thereunder, provide that notices in relation to the making of a planning scheme should be published at least once in each of two successive weeks in three newspapers, of which at least one is a daily newspaper circulating in the planning district of the local authority concerned.  Subject to compliance with these requirements, the arrangements for publication of the notices are a matter for the planning authority.  Other than making the regulations under the Town and Regional Planning Act, 1934, and the issue of a general circular explaining the terms of the Act and regulations, no further instructions as to the procedure which should govern the issue of advertisements were issued to local authorities.  It was stressed, however, in the circular how important it was for the local authority, in the making of a planning scheme, to get the public generally to understand the nature and purpose of the scheme and to secure the full co-operation of all interested parties, particularly the owners of land, those engaged in transport, in private building, and in commerce and industry generally, and also organisations and agencies engaged in social welfare, education, and the provision of recreational facilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

The Minister has thought it necessary in his reply to-day to quote from that circular which was sent to the authorities concerned.  Will he now say why he thought it necessary in the first place to issue the circular, why he thought it necessary to quote from it to-day and why he refused to take any steps to have the procedure mentioned in that circular carried into effect?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  It is a small Bill which contains no new principle or any point of great importance.  Since the main Act, the Fisheries Act, 1939, which deals with inland fisheries, was passed by the Dáil and Seanad, we have discovered that there were two omissions which we want to have put right.  In the first place, in Section 23 of the 1939 Act, there is a prohibition against the use in any lake, river or estuary of any light or fire of any kind or any otter, spear, gaff or other instrument of a similar kind for the purpose of taking salmon or trout.  That clause was taken from the Fisheries Act, 1842, but in that Act the words used were &ldquo;salmon or other fish&rdquo;.  A mistake was made in the course of drafting, and we find now that if a person found with any of these instruments on the side of a lake or river pleads that he intended to fish only for pike, perch or some other fish, there is no offence, and it is very hard to get a conviction in certain cases in which a conviction would probably be justified.  We want to have the words in the Principal Act changed from &ldquo;salmon or trout&rdquo; to &ldquo;salmon or other fish&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point has to do with substances which may injure fish in a river. Section 26 of the 1939 Act provides a penalty for the use of lime, spurge or any narcotic, irritant or poisonous substances, or any explosive, for the purpose <Col N="2070" /> of injury to or destruction of fish in any river, lake or estuary, whether it be a public or private fishery.  This does not quite cover the case, and, as a matter of fact, in drafting the Act of 1939, Section 80 of the 1842 Act was put into the Schedule of Repeals, through an oversight, with the result that it is very difficult to get a conviction in such cases.  In substance, we want Section 80 of the 1842 Act back into operation.  Clause 3 of this Bill has that effect, as it deals with the discharge of certain poisonous substances into rivers.</P>
    <P>It will be observed, however, that the Minister concerned with fisheries, the Minister for Agriculture, has power to grant exemptions under certain conditions, after consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, but, in granting an exemption, he can prescribe any conditions he thinks fit, because in certain cases grave hardship might be caused by not granting exemption under certain conditions. These are the two points which we want to have set right and, as I have said, both these clauses were in operation before the 1939 Act.  In the transfer of certain clauses from the old Acts to the new Act, these mistakes were made.</P>
    <P>I think I mentioned on a previous occasion that my Department is concerned with the consolidation of all the Fisheries Acts since 1842 up to the present.  There have been 100 years of legislation and more than 25 Acts have been passed.  We want all these Acts consolidated into one Act.  The work has been proceeding, and, although it is a very big job, we hope we may be able to have the Bill before the Dáil within 12 months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. F. Lynch Mr. F. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I am concerned, I am prepared to welcome the Bill because, from the fisheries' point of view, I think it is necessary, but I understand that some of my colleagues are rather alarmed about Section 3, with regard to the growing of flax. Section 2, of course, is a purely verbal amendment to meet a slip in the 1939 Act, but I was wondering what was the necessity for the amendment provided in Section 3.  I had forgotten that the Minister had repealed the appropriate <Col N="2071" /> clause of the old Act in the 1939 Act. I knew that under the old fishery laws the putting of any of these deleterious substances into a river, no matter for what purpose, or allowing them to go into a river through any neglect in running a factory or something of the kind, was an offence punishable under the fishery laws.  I realise now from what the Minister has said that it is necessary because of the repeal of the clause which provided for it in the old Act.  So far as I am concerned, from the fishery point of view, I think it essential that it should be re-enacted and I would be prepared to support the Minister in the matter.  I have not consulted my colleagues&mdash;I had not an opportunity for the last day or two &mdash;but I know that at least one Deputy has some fears in regard to it.</P>
      <P>I was glad to hear from the Minister that the codification of the Fisheries Acts is in progress.  I think it would make matters much easier for the Department and boards of conservators through the country if our fishery laws were all brought within the four walls of one Act.  To find out what the law is on fishery matters now is a very laborious task, because you have to search in order to discover what has been repealed here, there and everywhere. It is a very difficult matter to find out what the law is on any particular point.  It will be a very great value to the Department and to the boards of conservators to have the law consolidated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister with reference to the exemptions to which he referred, could he give any idea as to what these exemptions are?  Has he any particular exemptions in mind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this Bill should have the unanimous support of all Parties in the Dáil.  The Minister said that he is codifying all the other Acts of Parliament passed from time to time in this one measure.  That in itself is an achievement.  There are so many Acts dealing with fisheries, particularly inland fisheries, of which several sections have been repealed either by the British Government or the Government <Col N="2072" /> here, that it has led to a good deal of confusion even for boards of conservators.  Like the last Deputy who has spoken, I feel that we should have some explanation as to how these exemptions will be granted. There can be no question but that some of these effluents, particularly from sugar factories, are very harmful to fish.  As a matter of fact, they have a very ruinous effect which continues for very many years after the offensive stuff gets into the rivers.  I suggest to the Minister that, before this Bill becomes an Act, he might, with some advantage, consult with some of the boards of conservators, if he has not already consulted them.  I know, of course, that some communications have been sent to his Department with regard to the matter.  There are, too, a number of anglers' associations throughout the country who could give very useful advice to the Minister which would serve to make the passage of the Bill easier and help the Minister in what he has in mind.</P>
      <P>I should like to stress the point with reference to the effluents.  For many years dangerous effluents have been getting into the rivers and spoiling the fishing in various districts.  I should like to ask under what conditions these exemptions will be granted. Does the Minister propose, for instance, to allow these effluents to be discharged into the rivers at low water or at high water?  Does he propose having some method of carrying these effluents across a stream and having them emptied, say, into a cesspool of some kind or another?  I think that particular section is the one which will more vitally affect fishing than anything else, as it includes the use or misuse of these dangerous instruments that he speaks of and the use of explosives and other methods of catching fish illegally.  I should like to have some information on that point, although I am satisfied that this measure will serve a useful purpose, particularly in regard to the inland fisheries.</P>

      <P>I should like to know what effect Section 3 will have on local authorities who contemplate carrying out housing schemes in the post-war <Col N="2073" /> period.  Apparently, the discharge of sewage into rivers from housing schemes constructed by local authorities is more or less hampered by the fishery laws.  While recognising the value of fisheries to this country, at the same time, I think the Minister should bear in mind the value of housing, especially to the working class and the middle classes in the urban areas.  I think that, in certain circumstances at least, sewage in small towns should not be prevented from discharging into open rivers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to get some information from the Minister with regard to Section 3 (2), which provides that any person who steeps in any river or lake any flax or hemp shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £10 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for any term not exceeding six months. I should like to know if it is intended to carry that out in its entirety.  The Minister is encouraging the cultivation of flax in this country and, to my mind, if this is put into force, it will prevent the development of the flax industry, because if you are to produce flax of proper quality and if its cultivation is to pay farmers the flax must be steeped and dried and scutched.  Dams must be built convenient to the rivers or streams.  It is not possible to build a dam a distance from the river.  When the flax is steeped, the water must be let out of the dam, particularly at the present time when flax is very extensively grown.  I admit that this water has a bad effect, that it is bound to suffocate the fish for a distance along the river.  The distance in which it will affect the fish or stream all depends on the volume of water in the river or stream.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this is put into effect, everybody growing flax who steeps it in a river or stream will be liable to a fine of £10 or to a term of imprisonment.  I should like to know if the Minister can find any way out of that.  I am keen on encouraging fishing, but I am keener still on encouraging the development of the flax industry. How we are to reconcile the two is <Col N="2074" /> the difficulty.  It would be an impossibility for flax growers to store water in the dams.  With the present cultivation of flax, it would be necessary in that case to steep four or five or six lots of flax in the same dam.  You cannot steep flax in the same water a second time.  The water must be allowed to drain off.  It is only in one case out of a hundred that a steeping dam is situated in such a position that the water can flow off 50 or 60 or 100 yards over a meadow.  In the other 99 cases the water has no outlet except into the stream.  I want to know if the Minister can find any way which will prevent flax growers from being fined £10 where a lot of flax has to be put into a dam.  That water will have to be let out of the dam after each steeping of flax.  There is no possibility of steeping it properly otherwise. Has the Minister any scheme by which tanks could be used for steeping flax or has he any other system in mind?  If we flax growers are to be compelled to drain off the water on to the land, we will have to build drains for, perhaps, a distance of 100 yards, and flax growers who are doing such a big service to the State at present should be compensated for that.  If the Department is preventing us from handling the job in the manner in which it has been handled for generations, we should find some way out of it.  It says, of course, in another section, that the Minister, after consultation, may grant licences for the purpose of sub-section (3).  If the meaning of this is that every flax grower in the country will get a permit to steep his flax for the time&mdash;it is only a month or six weeks&mdash;that would meet the situation. I hope something will be done as, if not, you cannot develop both industries.</P>
    <P>As far as West Cork-which I know very well&mdash;is concerned, Deputy Anthony will agree with me that, in the flax growing districts there, the fishing is not of any importance.  It is the concern only of a few men of leisure, who may go out with rod and line.  I cannot speak with the same authority in regard to Donegal or Cavan, although I have been in each <Col N="2075" /> of them, but it would not affect us very much.  I am satisfied that the Bill is right but, if it is not going to meet the situation I have put up, I certainly would have a decided objection to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea of putting in this clause with regard to exemptions from these poisonous fluids, and so on, is principally to deal with mines and minerals.  If there is any work being done on the development of mines and minerals, it may be extremely difficult to provide any sort of treatment for the effluent from those mines, for some time, at any rate.  I have not the same sympathy for factories.  If a factory is being built, it is going to be in the same place all the time and there is no reason why the necessary measures should not be provided to <Col N="2076" /> deal with the effluent.  With regard to the sugar factories, we have been in continuous negotiation with them and they have done a lot to deal with the effluent.  We are not altogether satisfied that they are doing enough, but I am sure that will be made satisfactory in time.  The same applies to all factories.</P>
      <P>With regard to a few specific points which have arisen as regards local authorities' housing, and the flax in dustry, there is no change in the situation.  There is, of course, if you like, a nominal change in the law in the last four years but, in reality, there has been no change since 1842 in the legislation dealing with flax and dealing with sewage from housing schemes.  In the case of sewage, we sometimes have representations from the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, but we generally get over it all right; and I do not think any housing scheme has been held up owing to any unreasonable attitude being taken by the Minister for Fisheries.  In the case of flax, there has been no change in the law. As Deputy O'Donovan pointed out, the flax is steeped in standing pools but, of course, they have to be emptied out from time to time.  In the ordinary way, the water in which the flax had been steeped would go into the streams and rivers.  Our inspectors have frequent conferences with the flax inspectors and get over the difficulties as best they can.</P>
      <P>I think the House will agree that a Minister for Agriculture, also being Minister for Fisheries, will try to see that neither the flax industry nor the fishing industry is injured, at least by any regulations made.  We have to get over the problems as best we can.  I do not think there is any danger that we will injure the flax industry.  We may have to take certain precautions. The suggestion made by Deputy O'Donovan, for instance, that the Flax Board might pay some contribution to the treatment of the effluent is a very good idea and it might be possible to do something of that kind.</P>

      <P>I disagree with the Deputies who have described this measure as a political Bill.  This is only one of the many measures which, as far as I can remember, have been promised by the Fianna Fáil Party previous to and since the 1932 General Election.  The Parliamentary Secretary is shrewd enough as a politician to know that some, at least, of the many promises made over such a lengthy period are expected to be carried out, either in the way in which those promises were made, or to some extent, at any rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill and I consider it a long overdue measure.  If it is put into operation inside a reasonable period, it should carry out very useful, essential and, in some cases, urgently needed works of national improvement.  The many measures of this kind which have been brought into operation, both by the British Parliament and by this House since it was established, enabled the Board of Works and the local authorities to carry out many useful measures of this nature.  The value of the constructional work under many of the previous Acts has been destroyed, or partially destroyed, by the failure of the maintenance authorities&mdash;in some cases, the Board of Works&mdash;to carry out the necessary maintenance work inside a reasonable period.  There is a clear example of that in regard to the failure of the responsible authority to commence the work of maintenance inside a reasonable time in the case of the Barrow Drainage Act.  As the Parliamentary Secretary knows, that has led to considerable dissatisfaction and a good deal of trouble amongst the owners of land in the catchment area.  I hope that this measure will <Col N="2079" /> avoid many of the difficulties that have had to be overcome in previous measures, especially in connection with the maintenance side of the rivers which have been drained.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the Barrow Drainage Scheme has not been brought into the general framework of this measure.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will explain the reason why the Barrow Drainage Scheme is to be dealt with as a separate maintenance undertaking in the future, and whether there is any good reason for not including it in the general scheme outlined in this Bill.</P>

      <P>I read the speech of the Parliamentary Secretary very carefully and while he dealt, in passing, with the present position in regard to the Barrow drainage, he did not explain why it is to be excluded and dealt with separately, as distinguished from any other scheme carried out under any previous Act.  I welcome the introduction of this measure because it proposes to set up a central authority which will carry out the constructional side of the work.  It gives powers to that central authority to carry out surveys, initiate schemes and carry out those schemes and it is a great improvement on any kind of machinery which has existed up to the present for this purpose.  The financial side of the scheme raises very serious considerations.  I listened with very great attention to the replies by the Parliamentary Secretary to the four or five questions addressed to him by Deputy McGilligan in connection with the administration of this measure.  So far as I could learn from the replies, nothing definite is being done at the moment to bring this very useful measure into operation within a reasonable period.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary was asked, in Question 6 on to-day's Order Paper, to indicate what <Col N="2080" /> preparations, if any, have already been made to build up the maintenance organisation referred to in the report of the Drainage Commission.  I have not the written reply before me, but I think that the Parliamentary Secretary indicated that machinery has not been set up for that purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>That was dealt with in another question.  A maintenance organisation is quite a different matter from a surveying organisation.  I think that the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that, even in the case of the Barrow scheme, which I know a good deal about, and a number of other schemes, the maintenance work is considerably in arrear.  It is a serious matter if the Parliamentary Secretary, admitting that maintenance work is in arrear, has to confess that no maintenance organisation is in existence to carry out the purpose for which this Bill has been introduced.  Will the Parliamentary Secretary deny that maintenance is in arrears in many areas?  Is not that a reason why a maintenance organisation should be set up, apart from the question of survey work, which is different?  The Parliamentary Secretary also admitted that the estimate of £7,000,000 to cover the cost of the many schemes proposed to be carried out under the terms of this measure over a period of, possibly, 40 years is merely a speculative figure and said that no estimate could be made of the increased cost of carrying out such schemes even if the organisation were there to commence the work.  Who are the people who were responsible for furnishing the Parliamentary Secretary and the members of the Drainage Commission with the figure of £7,000,000?  How was that figure arrived at, even if it is admitted to be a speculative figure?  The House is entitled to that information and I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will, if he has the information at his disposal, place it before the House when replying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The financial aspect of this scheme must be very seriously considered. <Col N="2081" /> Assuming that the cost of carrying out the proposed schemes on the basis of the 1944 cost of materials, wages and other items is between £10,000,000 and £12,000,000, as compared with the estimated figure of £7,000,000 furnished to members of the Drainage Commission some years ago, on the present cost of money the eventual cost to taxpayers, ratepayers and the people in the drainage areas will be in the region of £30,000,000.  I base that calculation on the cost of the Barrow drainage scheme?  The total cost of the Barrow drainage scheme was £547,518 and half of this sum was provided by the State.  The remaining half was handed over as a liability to the ratepayers of the Counties of Leix, Offaly and Kildare, and to the landholders in the catchment area of the River Barrow.  The ratepayers are being charged a yearly figure of £21,571.  That is to be reduced by roughly two-thirds under the terms of this Bill.  According to the information supplied in the White Paper, the period of repayment in the case of the Barrow drainage scheme is 35 years. At the end of the 35 years, the ratepayers in the three counties I have mentioned and the land-owners in the catchment area will have repaid, so far as I can ascertain, the enormous sum of £754,985.  The capital sum for which they were asked to undertake liability was £273,759.  The amount of interest to be paid at the end of the 35 years, in addition to that figure, is £481,226.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The banks could not be poor on that standard of payment.  In order to carry out a work costing £547,518, £962,452 will be paid in interest to the poor bankers.  If this class of work is to be carried out by the Government of to-day or tomorrow on an economic basis and at reasonable cost to the taxpayers, ratepayers and adjoining landowners, the price to be paid for money will have to be considerably reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is there any good reason why development work of this kind could not be carried out by the provision of interest-free credit?  Surely, when one <Col N="2082" /> considers the economic value of arterial drainage, land reclamation and development works of that kind, they should be carried out, through the agency of this democratic institution, by the provision of interest-free credit.  Will the Parliamentary Secretary deal with that in his reply, or will he, if he can, justify the high price which has to be paid for money by all concerned in order to carry out work of this kind over a long period of years?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will not deal with that.  The Parliamentary Secretary will deal with the Drainage Bill which is before the Dáil.</P>

      <P>The Drainage Bill includes provisions to obtain money to carry out this work, and he will have to justify these provisions if he can. I suppose the reason why he will not attempt to do it is because he cannot. In my opinion, at any rate, he should attempt to justify the financial sections of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I have referred to the Barrow scheme, to the cost of it and to the effect of it upon those concerned in the three counties that I have mentioned. The Parliamentary Secretary is not very long in his present office and may not be fully acquainted with the agitation which has gone on in that area for a long time.</P>

      <P>I disagree entirely&mdash;I said so in the presence of the people concerned&mdash;with the leaders and members of the Barrow Drainage Ratepayers' Association on that matter. There are big farmers in that particular area who say that there was no useful work carried out in it under the Barrow Drainage Act.  I would have to be blind if I could not see the value of the work that was carried out in some of the counties concerned.  In 1923, this House set up the Inland Waterways and Canals Commission, of which I happened to be a member.  It was responsible for having a survey made of the Barrow, the Shannon navigation and other areas.  The commission <Col N="2083" /> made certain recommendations and I am glad to have lived long enough as a Deputy to see these recommendations, which I and other members of the commission signed, carried out within a reasonable time. I appreciate the value of a good deal of the work carried out by the Board of Works in connection with the Barrow drainage scheme.  I have said so publicly, and I have said it in committee rooms in this House in company with my colleagues.  But if there is any justification for the agitation which has been carried on by those people&mdash;and there is to some extent&mdash; it is in the unfair value that, for taxation purposes, has been put upon the work carried out.  In some cases, land owners were expected to pay a drainage rate of as much as 7/6 per acre on land which, in the local market, could only be let at 2/6.  These cases have been quoted and are, I imagine, on the files in the Parliamentary Secretary's Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Barrow Drainage Ratepayers' Association, which consists of some thousands of very small farmers as well as of some very big farmers, has been making the claim&mdash;I do not know whether it has done so officially or not &mdash;that the occupiers of holdings in the Barrow drainage district should, in future, be relieved of their capital charges.  There is a reference to that in Section 160, page 47, of the Drainage Commission Report.  The Parliamentary Secretary is aware that representatives of that body gave evidence before the Drainage Commission. Arising out of their evidence, certain recommendations were made which, I see, are not being fully provided for in the Bill as far as I can see.  The association, in my opinion, also made a very strong case to have the contribution for the annual maintenance fixed at a maximum of 25 per cent. of the assessed annual improved value of the land.  The assessments made, they allege, have proved to be in no way related to the actual amount by which the land has been improved.  I do not profess to be able to discuss that aspect of the case.  The Parliamentary Secretary, when replying, might deal <Col N="2084" /> with that particular aspect of the scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be impossible for me to reply to all these points at the end of the debate.  I do want to say, however, that we have gone in this Bill even further than the authors of the document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be a considerable reduction in the maintenance charge previously proposed to be collected, but which was not collected, from the ratepayers and landowners in the three counties concerned. There was also a grant previously paid for maintenance work.  I think I am correct in saying that it disappears under the terms of this Bill.  Will the Parliamentary Secretary, when replying, deal with the request, or if you like, the demand, made by a large number of the farmers concerned relating to the proposal to fund the six years' arrears which have not been collected, but which have been passed on as a liability to the ratepayers of these three counties?  There was an organised refusal, on the part of a large number of landowners in the Barrow valley area, to pay this drainage rate, for two reasons.  In the first place, they said it was excessive and not in any way related to the improved value of the land.  The second reason&mdash;this is an important one&mdash;was this: that the maintenance work, which the charge represented or purported to represent, was not carried out: that it was not commenced until about a year or two ago instead of seven years ago.</P>
      <P>I desire to draw the Parliamentary Secretary's attention to Section 43 of the Bill under which the central authority is given power to get certain work carried out by contract. Sub-section (1) of the section says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Whenever the Commissioners are authorised by or under this Act to execute any drainage or other engineering or building works, they may, in lieu of executing such works themselves by their own officers and servants, contract (with the sanction of the Minister) with any person for the execution of the whole or part <Col N="2085" /> of such works by such person and may for that purpose enter (with the sanction aforesaid) into such contracts and agreements as may be requisite.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I strongly object to that section because, in my opinion, if this general drainage work is to be undertaken by the central authority, namely, the Board of Works, then it should be carried out in its entirety by that body.</P>
    <P>I object to the giving of any powers as proposed in this section to the Board of Works to get portion of the works carried out by contract.  If that section is to be retained in the Bill, I want to know from the Parliamentary Secretary, who is responsible for its introduction, whether he is prepared to have inserted as another sub-section, the usual fair wages clause generally attached to a contract carried out on behalf of any Government Department. The Parliamentary Secretary is aware, I am sure, that that is the usual kind of protection associated with any kind of legislation passed by this House wherever it is proposed to hand over to a contractor a job which should be done by a Government Department.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, as I said in the beginning, I welcome the Bill as a whole, and the only thing I have to regret is that the carrying out of the schemes proposed under this measure will extend over such a long period, and that the cost, in my opinion, under the present-day conditions of getting money, is entirely prohibitive. Surely, the Parliamentary Secretary, in his reply, can give us an assurance that the maintenance organisation will be set up without further delay, and that the first job to be undertaken by that body will be to get on immediately with maintenance work in many of the drainage areas of this country?  That is the kind of work that would give useful and very valuable employment, employment of a kind which contains a very high labour content.  I hope that when he is replying, the Parliamentary Secretary will give us more details as to how the figure of £7,000,000 was arrived at, and that he will give us an assurance, which he did not give in his introductory remarks, <Col N="2086" /> that the schemes proposed to be carried out under this measure will be carried out in a reasonable period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahRyan" hpid="Colonel Ryan Colonel Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in this measure mainly from the point of view of my own county.  If this Drainage Commission had not been set up four years ago there would have been an outery and a campaign in the country about drainage problems.  I welcome the measure wholeheartedly in every way, but I realise that it is rather an intricate matter for any single Deputy to deal with.  In fact, reading the whole Bill, it seems nearly impossible for an ordinary Deputy to try to amend it, but there are a great many things in the measure which I suggest might be improved.  One point in the Bill is this: it is impossible to grasp the idea of extending drainage over a period of 28 years. The sum of £7,000,000 is mentioned, but I believe it is not nearly anything like adequate to do the job.  The Parliamentary Secretary has decided, apparently, that he will follow the lines laid down by the Drainage Commission four years ago and spend £250,000 each year.  Something may be said for that expenditure in the first year, but if the line is going to be followed in the succeeding years, drainage schemes will be only glorified employment schemes.  I feel that after two or three years, the Government and the central drainage authority, the Board of Works, should be in a position to spend more than £1,000,000 &mdash;perhaps a couple of millions&mdash;per year on drainage.  They should be able to find technicians and the other workers required for drainage schemes. In certain big schemes, they might ask where they would find the labour and tell us it is not to be got here or there or in another place, but while men are being paid unemployment assistance and similar benefits in one part of the country or another, they can be found for work on drainage schemes as easily as they are found for the bogs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that, in dealing with this problem, he should not approach it as if it were a glorified employment scheme, but he should regard it as a <Col N="2087" /> revolutionary scheme necessary to the farmers and others in this country, and should insist on seeing that it will benefit the country and give plenty of employment.  We hear of other schemes at the moment, vast road schemes, which, to my mind, might cost £20,000,000, although they are not at all as necessary as a drainage scheme.  I think this is the most urgent thing from everybody's point of view in this House.  But an extraordinary thing is that, during the past four years, according to the Parliamentary Secretary, since the production of the Report of the Drainage Commission, most of the time was spent on putting machinery into repair. I hope something more than that has been done.  At the same time under the 1925 Act a good many small surveys have been carried out with a view to small schemes for small streams.  These small schemes do a great deal of good by giving a lot of employment without requiring machinery.  I hope that these small schemes which, in many cases, would benefit only a few hundred acres will not be overlooked when the commissioners start their operations.</P>
    <P>With regard to Section 8, which deals with the payment of advances, sub-section (2) (b) and (c) states that all drainage districts cease to exist from a certain day,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;but nothing in this section shall operate to relieve the council of a county for liability (if any) for any payments to the commissioners in repayment of any advance made under any Act by the commissioners for the said existing drainage works.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It looks well to read it, but taking one county with another, I wonder if it is really just.  From the point of view of drainage, there is a variation in many parts of Ireland.  Some counties have got mulcted fairly heavily under the 1925 Drainage Act, where county councils tried to carry out schemes under that Act, some of which were not very workable.  Before this proposal comes into operation, I suggest there ought to be some amendment of the whole thing, and I think <Col N="2088" /> that the Parliamentary Secretary and the commissioners should consider the position of each council with a view to seeing whether the amount they committed themselves for was reasonable or not.</P>
    <P>The matter could be dealt with on the same lines as the Barrow drainage scheme, with a view to examining to what extent each council should be relieved.  Later on, perhaps, I shall have something to say on the Barrow drainage scheme, but I think that in other areas where schemes have been carried out, councils should not be made responsible for capital charges. In fact, since the Drainage Commission was set up, some of the schemes were carried out, after discussion with the responsible authority here, on the understanding that when the report of the commission was made and the Bill introduced, they would be relieved of the capital charges in connection with those schemes.  I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary and the commissioners that they deal with each council and body as a whole, see what they are committed to, and see if they can be relieved in some way or another.  Let me take any one county which has not committed itself to any scheme during the past 16 or 17 years.  The council in that county is not mulcted in any way.  Any council which has committed itself to a scheme is mulcted with the full amount, and I think that is very unfair.</P>
    <P>As regards the maintenance of completed drainage schemes, I believe that is where this measure will fail.  All through the Bill runs the suggestion that the county council will be responsible for the maintenance.  The Parliamentary Secretary or any engineer in the country has no idea of what this maintenance will cost.  I hold that if these works, once they are executed, are not properly maintained, it would be much better that they were never carried out.  I also hold that it is very unfair that the local authorities should have to bear the entire maintenance charge, because it will then be placed on people many of whom have no say in the matter whatsoever and derive no benefit.  This Bill leaves them merely a collecting body, collecting <Col N="2089" /> the money for the central authority, the Board of Works.  If a very heavy call comes upon the ratepayers, you will have trouble at county council meetings; you may have councils refusing to strike the rates. Therefore, I suggest this should be a fifty-fifty charge.</P>
    <P>In this Bill there is a section under which you amend the rateable valuation of any lands that are improved. If you do not agree to a fifty-fifty charge&mdash;a national charge and a county council charge&mdash;you should at least agree that no money should be collected locally above the annual value of the land that is improved.  I think a fifty-fifty charge would be quite reasonable, but I would prefer that you would not mulct any county council with more than the annual value of the improved land.  If you amend the Bill in that direction I believe you will get the county councils to help you in having the work carried out.</P>
    <P>I agree with the compulsory provisions of the Bill, because I feel that without compulsion you cannot deal properly with drainage.  There is one small point relating to compulsion to which I object.  It comes under Section 48 and deals with the repairing of watercourses.  In the past this has been most troublesome from the point of view of drainage.  You have many people interested in watercourses; these watercourses run through many people's lands, so that the cleaning of them in many instances becomes, as it were, nobody's job.  People who might like to have them cleaned are prevented by other people from carrying out the necessary cleaning.  I know one watercourse that runs for at least a mile through a man's land and it comes direct from a bog.  This man has no interest at all in the watercourse. It is no good for his land; in fact, he would like to stop the bog being drained through his land.  I am sure there are many cases like that. Why compel that man to clean that watercourse when it is of no benefit to him?  I am citing this as an instance of the situation that exists in many areas.  I am sure you will find many cases of this kind.  Why should that man be compelled to clean a watercourse <Col N="2090" /> that runs for at least a mile through his land when he derives no benefit from doing so?</P>
    <P>I know of at least three cases, but in the case I have mentioned the cleaning is being done in the interest of the Land Commission.  The Land Commission will not clean the watercourse, and surely that man should not be compelled to clean it for them.  Under Section 48 of this Bill he will be compelled to clean it, to keep it open, to keep it as the Board of Works and the Land Commission want it.  It may seem a very small thing, but I consider that the section is an important one from that particular point of view.  All over Tipperary there is trouble about watercourses.  I would like to see compulsion in most cases, making people clean their drains; but I hold that the man who has to clean one in order to help somebody else should be safeguarded in some way.  How it is to be done, I could not tell you, but I hope this matter will engage the serious attention of the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <P>I hope the Bill will be amended radically, at least in some of its provisions. I am not against the compulsory powers that are sought, except as regards the section to which I have referred.  I believe that, generally speaking, some compulsion is necessary; otherwise you will have no drainage of a satisfactory kind.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will see to it that the Bill will be put into operation at the earliest possible moment and that it will not be relegated to the position of a glorified employment scheme.  I hope it will not be regarded purely as a political scheme and that when it is undertaken the work will be carried out earnestly.  I hope the scheme will be revolutionary in this way, that the work will start in the very near future so that men who are now idle will have an opportunity of doing something.  The men who are drawing unemployment assistance should be put to work wherever it is considered necessary to engage them. We all agree that this is a very necessary measure and we trust that our expectations in relation to it will be justified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been introduced to deal with a very difficult situation, a situation that is so intricate that it was found necessary to set up a commission to go carefully into it and examine it in every detail. It is rather difficult to get a comprehensive view of the situation that will exist when this Bill becomes law.  I am satisfied with the authority which the Bill will give to the central body to deal with drainage.  It does not, however, contain any power compelling the central authority to carry out drainage within a specified time.  In my opinion that is the proper procedure to adopt, because I believe that there is not any economic necessity to compel people to drain land.  We have not the same economic necessity to compel us to drain land as the Dutch people had in their successful efforts to keep out the sea, or as the Italians had when they drained the Pontine Marshes, because we have the paradoxical situation here of having arable land that we do not want to drain, on which there are comparatively few people, and, at the same time, 200,000 acres of flooded land on which people are trying to exist.  If we have 200,000 acres on which people could be settled, then it is absolutely necessary that the Government should drain that land so that it could be occupied.  If figures as to the cost of drainage that were given here are even approximately correct, it might be cheaper to take people from flooded lands and to place them on land that is not subject to flooding.  That would mean a change in the economy of the country, and the Government might then be faced with the problem of either draining land or letting people remain on other land that is partially flooded during portions of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of drainage was dealt with by several Deputies.  One Deputy stated that it would take £17 to drain an acre of land of which the ultimate value would be £9.  Various values are placed on land.  They include purchase value, commercial value, especially in time of war, and proximity value when it is near large centres of population.  There is also the value put on land that has been drained so that people will be able to live by it. <Col N="2092" /> Land that has to be worked by hardworking people cannot be valued at £9 or at any price per acre.  That land has a value for people who are living on it.  As this Bill covers the whole field of drainage the Parliamentary Secretary is to be complimented on bringing it before the House.  I am sure it is the result of months of consideration of every aspect of the powers that are to be assumed by the central authority.  When the Parliamentary Secretary is concluding I should like to know what type of organisation it is proposed to establish for drainage maintenance.  I presume it will deal with the maintenance of new schemes as well as with schemes that have been completed.  Maintenance organisations directed by the county engineers are operating in some places but according to statements that were made here some of them have broken down.</P>
    <P>I should like to know if the services of resident engineers attached to county councils will be availed of in the organisation that is to be established, or if a separate organisation is to be established with resident engineers in each catchment area, or in different counties, and whether the services of county council workers will be availed of.  I should also like to know if it is to be a permanent establishment and if the workers who will be recruited for it will be given permanent employment, or rotational employment to which there has been so much objection.  I am interested in this matter because of the fact that in my constituency we are not going to benefit very much by this Bill.  Drainage in that part of the country is practically complete, and what remains to be dealt with may not be reached until the end of the period indicated in the Bill.  I believe that the organisation to deal with maintenance work should be a permanent one, and that those employed should have permanent positions so that work could be carried out properly.  The Land Commission is another central authority that has to deal with the employment of labour for the carrying out of various work.  Unfortunately, the amount of money devoted to the making of roads and similar work by <Col N="2093" /> that central authority is not sufficient to provide decent jobs for working people.</P>

      <P>There is a kindred subject closely associated with drainage which, I think, has not been dealt with so far.  Without water we would need no drainage, but it strikes me that in most places in Ireland Coleridge's <i>Ancient Mariner</i> has been very clearly exemplified: &ldquo;Water, water everywhere, and not a drop to drink.&rdquo; There is a drainage scheme in the eastern part of the county from which I come.  I do not quite understand the conditions there, though I am on the county council, but I know that it is a very vexed problem whenever it comes up for discussion.  In the midlands along the Nore and the Barrow there are, of course, very extensive schemes. When the Shannon scheme was introduced into this House many people railed against it, including, I believe, <Col N="2094" /> the Deputies who sat on these benohes at that time.  Many people said that it was going to be a white elephant but I think that in the course of time it has proved its worth.  It was introduced principally for the purpose of providing employment after the last war.  Although we have the Suir running through the centre of my county, Coleridge's <i>Ancient Mariner</i> is, as I say, clearly exemplified in conditions obtaining in the county.  In many places the people have to travel three, four or five miles to obtain drinking water.  I think that before the Shannon scheme was introduced or collateral with it, a scheme should have been formulated to provide drinking water for houses in rural Ireland.  Gas works and electric works were scrapped in every town in Ireland when the Shannon scheme was put into operation and electric works were scrapped in capital for these works were refunded only 20, 30 or 40 per cent. of the money which they originally invested in them.</P>
      <P>We would, however, have been in a sorry plight four years ago if the Shannon scheme were not in existence. It has justified its existence in every way, and we can take off our hats to the men who conceived it.  The men who evolved that scheme were very far-seeing, but why they did not bring in a scheme collateral with it, or after it was completed, to supply water to the farmhouses of Ireland, is beyond my comprehension.</P>

      <P>Some of us do not care what we call a thing when it suits our argument for the moment.  The beet factories were also called white elephants, but I think they have proved their worth.  The man who never made a mistake never made anything.  The Suir flows through the centre of Tipperary, and yet within a couple of miles of it in many districts there is not a drop of drinking water. I put it to the Parliamentary Secretary: are the rivers of Ireland meant to be sewers?  We have the sewage of three towns in my county flowing into the river&mdash;Cahir with a population of 1,500, Clonmel with a population of <Col N="2095" /> 15,000, and now we have the sewage of the beet factory.  Birmingham and Sheffield are without rivers of any kind and yet they solved their drainage problem by bringing water from the Welsh hills, 180 miles away, and they have pure drinking water.  Brinsley McNamara in his <i>Valley of the Squinting Windows</i> has dealt with the problem of pumps in rural Ireland. Pumps, we are told, are the dead relics of hydraulic inefficiency.  A farmer who gets land in the British colonies has provided for him as his first requisite drinking water.  The first thing they do is to sink a pump.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to pump some sense into the Minister.  We are told that under this scheme 600,000 acres will be reclaimed but I would suggest that out of the 10,000,000 arable acres and the 5,000,000 non-arable which it is estimated we have in this country&mdash;the Minister for Agriculture is doubtful about the exact amount&mdash;there are at least 6,000,000 acres without a drop of drinking water.  A previous speaker referred to the catchment areas, but I say that if catchments were made of all the water necessary to supply our farmhouses with drinking water, all this drainage business would be solved.  We are going to spend £7,000,000 on this scheme.  We have been called hewers of wood and drawers of water, but we do not deserve the name of the dirty Irish. There are farmers who are obliged to work like negroes in order to provide their houses with a sufficiency of water.  I have myself 179 statute acres and I have a gravity water supply in the yard.  There is a national school situated about 400 yards from my farm at which a very large number of pupils attend and they have not a drop of water to drink.  At 4 o'clock in the morning you will find eight or ten carts waiting their turn to transport water to the various farms.  There is a Guards' barrack at Ballylooby, succeeding the old Constabulary barracks <Col N="2096" /> which at one time existed there and for the past 60 years water has had to be carried three miles to that building. There is a stream running through that village but it is simply used as a sewer.  There is not a drop of drinking water in the district and, as I say, you will see eight or ten carts waiting in the morning to carry drinking water to various homesteads. That is a more important question in my opinion than the question of drainage.</P>
      <P>Another point that should be mentioned is that when this war is over our cattle will be subjected to a very close veterinary examination before being allowed into England.  How many are going to pass the tuberculosis test if the cattle are to be condemned to drink out of stagnant, foetid pools?  I know recently one case in which a lovely young bull did not pass the tuberculin test.  If our cattle are to be subjected to tests of this kind going into England, I would respectfully suggest that a proper water scheme for rural Ireland should be a collateral consideration with the drainage scheme.  There are at least 6,000,000 acres in Ireland waterless at the moment, in the sense that there is no proper drinking water provided on them.  We should have pure water for man and beast.  We do not want a future generation of snowy-breasted pearls; the homes for consumptives are already overflowing with inmates, largely due to the drinking of impure water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest that the Minister might see his way to have a survey carried out in connection with this Bill with a view to having a sufficiency of pure water provided for rural homes. On my suggestion the Tipperary County Council recently passed a resolution, which was subsequently adopted by 18 out of the 27 councils in the State, suggesting that a national survey of the water supplies of Ireland be made with a view to getting a pure water supply into every home in rural Ireland.  That resolution formed the subject of a leader in at least one prominent daily, and it got leaderettes in most of the other papers.  I have got a mail that a film star would envy. I got at least 500 letters congratulating <Col N="2097" /> me.  I do not want to have any more on my epitaph than that I was the man who helped to get a pure water supply for rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>We are as much entitled to it as the town and city dwellers.  They can get what the countryman is not able to get. Eighteen county councils adopted a resolution calling for a national survey. There is a good deal of public opinion in favour of such a survey.  I am not throwing a spanner in the works.  I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary. He is handling a big job and I think he is just the type of man to make a success of it.  He has my sympathy. I suggest that a water supply for man and beast is of paramount importance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two points that I should like to mention in regard to this Bill.  I feel that the Bill is hardly worth all the time that is spent on it, for this reason, that the period over which the £7,000,000 is to be expended is so long.  At that rate, very few of the members of this House will live to see the £7,000,000 expended. In my opinion the question should be tackled by the Government in a more vigorous manner.  Thousands of our people are forced to leave this country to seek employment.  In this scheme we have an opportunity of giving our people work at home.  Most of the expenditure under the Bill would be on labour.  Therefore, the scheme presents a great opportunity of giving employment to our own people in our own country with a view to the improvement of the nation.  I think any money expended would give a very good return.</P>
      <P>I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that at the present time men are sent to work on the bogs from certain portions of Ireland.  They are debarred from leaving their own country. They work on the bogs in the summer time and in the winter time have to go back to where they came from, where they are given a miserable, starvation dole, or otherwise they flock into the cities and towns, depriving somebody there of a day's work that may be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2098" /> Why not tackle this question in a big, broad manner?  Why not give these people work at home in their own areas and, when they have finished work on the bogs, give them a decent living wage, not the wage that has been given under any Government scheme such as those sponsored either by the Land Commission or the Board of Works?  No man will work on these schemes if he can get anything else, because the wages paid are not sufficient to maintain himself, much less his dependents.  That is the suggestion I make to the Parliamentary Secretary. Some part of this money should be expended at the present time.  There is no need to wait until the war is over to tackle this scheme.  The need for the work exists; the men are available.  If other countries can find money for the manufacture of implements of destruction, surely in this country we should be in a position to find money for doing something for the improvement of the country and for the employment of our people at a decent living wage.</P>
    <P>As far as County Dublin is concerned, it will benefit very little by this scheme.  The amount of drainage needed there is small.  In connection with this scheme I think no preference should be given to any particular area except those areas in which the people are debarred from emigrating.  I agree that it is right that they should be so debarred, but when they are debarred they should be given a living wage in their own country the whole year round.  What is the position of those men who are sent to the bogs?  I wonder does the Government consider their case seriously at all?  No greater injustice was ever done to any person. The residents of the cities or towns are free to go if they so desire and earn big money outside, but in certain areas the people are debarred; they must work on the bogs, producing the fuel for city and town residents and in the winter time they can go home and starve.  Here is an opportunity for the Parliamentary Secretary to recommend to the Government that these people should be given employment at a decent standard wage.  Deputy Flanagan said that he would recommend £3 10s. 0d.</P>
    <Col N="2099" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>If we did say £4 0s. 0d., the Parliamentary Secretary would not maintain that it would be entirely unreasonable considering that the average number in family is five and that it takes £1 5s. 0d. to keep one inmate in the Dublin Union.  Another point is that if you put men to work at the miserable rates of wages paid under these Government schemes, you will get no return.  If a man feels that he is not getting fair recompense for his labour, he is not going to exert himself or give a return.  In any case, he is not fed or fit to give a return.</P>
      <P>Several other points have been raised by other Deputies.  The point I wish to emphasise is that instead of the proposed £250,000, the Government should spend £2,000,000 on this scheme.  In certain areas the need for drainage is so great that there should not be any difficulty in spending the money.  There should not be any difficulty as far as engineering is concerned.  As far as the drainage of certain portions of the country is concerned, no great engineering skill would be involved.  I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to tackle the question and to spend £2,000,000; to give our own people employment in their own country at a living wage.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary realises what a living wage should be at the present time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Department responsible for the introduction of this Bill on the consideration that is extended to Deputies in accompanying the Bill by a White Paper.  That is a practice that I should like to see more generally followed.  It is not a very intricate Bill but it is a rather lengthy one and one that has reference to so many previous Acts, that, I think, each of us found the White Paper particularly helpful in the historical survey it gave us and in saving us the time and labour of looking up previous Acts.  That certainly was appreciated by the majority of Deputies. In addition to that, I think <Col N="2100" /> the Parliamentary Secretary's method and manner in introducing the Bill is worthy of appreciation.  We had this Bill introduced by a person who gave every evidence of regarding Parliament rather than Government as the legislating authority, the real authority.</P>
      <P>All too frequently we have Ministers coming before us and introducing legislation in the style of people who, in laying something before Parliament, tell Parliament either to take it or leave it, that there is no view but the one view, that is, the view of the man introducing the Bill.  We had a Parliamentary Secretary introducing this Bill, who gave every evidence of the fact that he appreciated that this body was a deliberative Assembly, that it was the legislative Assembly of this State, and that the Deputies were present as representative people and people who had some knowledge of the question before the House.  I heard very general appreciation of the manner in which it was introduced and I think it is well to put it on record. I should like to see some of the Ministers as understudies to the Parliamentary Secretaries rather than the Parliamentary Secretaries as understudies to Ministers.</P>
      <P>This Bill has been discussed to a very great extent as if it were either a drainage scheme or a drainage plan. There is no drainage scheme and no drainage plan in this Bill.  What is in the Bill is an essential and desirable preliminary to any drainage plan or scheme.  In the main, it is a kind of machinery Bill, a Bill which clears the way for, as we all hope, a multiplicity of drainage schemes or plans. The Bill does away with a multiplicity of drainage boards and I think drainage is a national problem which has to be centrally designed and centrally controlled.  The multiplicity of drainage boards, with a great number of separate charges, were in their time worthy of trial, but I think the underlying idea of this Bill is a sound essential to any general advance with regard to drainage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like other colleagues of mine who spoke, I happen to come from a county which has experienced the great blessings <Col N="2101" /> which can come through a drainage scheme.  One of my carner recollections is a picture of the village I was born in as an island, with miles and miles of water on every side.  Deputy Flanagan has referred to the fact that he recollects in his own area going to school knee-deep in water.  I remember driving my father, who was a doctor, to calls at one end of his district and, for months of the year, when he got out of the trap there would be an upturned tub with a plank leading to another upturned tub and across that plank he would reach the house, the inmates of which would have retreated upstairs on account of the flooding below.  All that has been changed through a drainage scheme, and I agree with the Deputy who says that no value in cash can be placed on the different living circumstances of people who formerly lived in a flooded area and who now live in a comparatively dry area.  The amenities secured for these people have a value which cannot be reckoned in pounds, shillings and pence, quite aside from any enhancing of the value of the land.</P>
    <P>There are certain aspects of the Bill which may not justify some of the great hopes expressed.  I heard one Deputy in his enthusiasm for the Bill, with a kind of bland and simple faith which I certainly cannot share, urging the House to let the Bill through rapidly so that the work could be begun.  I envy that kind of simple faith and enthusiasm, but when I see that the operative factor inside the Bill is the Board of Works and that the confirming Minister is the Minister for Finance, I do not think that speed will be the outstanding feature.  The Board of Works is a body which does sound and excellent work, but I think all Deputies will agree with me that the words &ldquo;Board of Works&rdquo; and &ldquo;speed&rdquo; are not synonymous.  Neither is the Minister for Finance the particular Minister whom one would pick out to be the confirming authority when it comes to the speedy and lavish expenditure of money.</P>
    <P>The initiating department to initiate a drainage scheme and the planning department, after the Bill becomes law, will be the Board of Works, and the only authority which <Col N="2102" /> can confirm a scheme will be the Minister for Finance.  I do not see speed enshrined in the Bill and I do not see expenditure on a lavish scale.  However, at least, it plants somewhere the power to initiate and build up schemes, but let us not overlook the fact that, where the Bill gives power to the Board of Works to initiate schemes and to the Minister for Finance to confirm schemes, at the same time it gives the opposite&mdash;it gives power to the Board of Works to hold up schemes and power to the Minister for Finance to hold up schemes.</P>
    <P>My experience of Governments, present and past in this country, and my experience of Governments in other countries, is that any expenditure governed by the Department of Finance will necessarily depend on the times, and after every war it is reasonable to expect that there will be a slump phase, a phase where economy rules the roost.  Do not let us forget that, with that phase in front of us, the only authority which can confirm a drainage scheme after the passage of the Bill, the only authority which can say &ldquo;Go,&rdquo; is the authority which will be most cautious, most conservative and most nervous with regard to public expenditure.  I think it is regrettable that inside this scheme all the powers of initiative were taken from any other body and confined within the one body.  However, I am prepared to accept the fact that the pros and cons have been very fully considered, and if I had to choose between leaving the powers of initiative inside every county, the financing to be done mainly from within that county, the country to be drained piecemeal, and a national plan, in spite of my criticism, I would rather have the central idea and the national plan.</P>
    <P>There are portions of this Bill that have given rise, I am sure, to discussion of a controversial kind within every Party, and the same applies outside the Parties.  One of the big things that this Bill is doing with regard to the future is abolishing the past system of special drainage rates and replacing that by a common flat rate within an administrative area.  We hear the argument <Col N="2103" /> that a number of people who do not benefit will have to pay.  I think it is true to say that that applies to nearly every public scheme at the moment.  It is true also to say that the areas that are most heavily and most permanently flooded are, because of these very conditions, the poorest areas and, if drainage were to depend on the capacity of the poorest people to pay the major share of the cost, it would be nonsense to talk of going ahead with a drainage scheme.  On the whole, reckoning the thing from the point of view of the man in the distant town and of the farmer who is not directly benefiting, I think that the fairest scheme is the scheme adopted in the Bill.  It is the only scheme which will make general big scheme drainage possible in this country, namely, to meet the maintenance charges by a flat rate.</P>
    <P>When discussing the abolition of special drainage rates, I said that the areas most subject to flooding are the places where we get the poorest people. The same applies to counties.  The counties most cursed with swampiness and flooding, stagnant pools and bogs, are the counties in which drainage will be most necessary.  A suggestion was made by one Deputy that in future there will be an outcry against the striking of the rate in these counties.</P>
    <P>I would not sympathise with that kind of thing, but I would suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary, between this and the later stages of the Bill, might give special consideration to counties where a full-scale drainage scheme might impose a drainage rate that would be unreasonable in such a county, and that, while adhering to the policy of a flat rate charge, he might consider in certain counties having a maximum over-riding rate. When that particular rate is reached, then any maintenance charges over that rate would be met, we will say, out of central funds.  I would imagine that if an alteration along such lines were adopted by the Parliamentary Secretary, it would apply to very few counties, if any.  The maximum rate should be a reasonable rate, and, except <Col N="2104" /> drainage rates are very costly inside any county, the maximum over-riding rate should be very rarely passed.</P>
    <P>There are some portions of this Bill to which I take a certain amount of exception; it is more an exception on the lines of principle.  With regard to the maintenance of drainage works in future, we are laying down the principle that the maintenance work will be carried out by the Office of Public. Works, but that local funds will pay. That raises a principle of a certain amount of importance.  The generally accepted theory or standard in democratic countries is that you do not pay without a certain amount of representative control.  Here we are adopting the policy of &ldquo;pay and have no control&rdquo;.  Control goes out of the hands of the county councils, as I read this Bill, and their particular privilege in future will be the privilege of paying the bills.  We are preparing the way to launch a scheme of national drainage, planned centrally, carried out centrally, maintained locally; all local bodies are completely passed over until it comes to writing the cheque. It strikes me that there are a number of rather obvious links between the Office of Public Works and the rivers that are to be drained that are passed over entirely in this Bill, one of the most obvious being the county surveyor and his staff of assistant surveyors.</P>
    <P>Like everyone else, I look at it from the angle that I would understand.  If we were introducing a national tuberculosis scheme, where the central authority was going to plan to make provision for treatment, and the maintenance of patients afterwards was to be left to be financed by the local ratepayers, but with no control, supervisory or otherwise, I would oppose that scheme on the ground that it would fail from birth because the local tuberculosis officer in each county was completely omitted from the scheme.  It would fail.  Now we have a drainage scheme.  That scheme will be centrally planned.  We are all with you there.  The work will be carried out centrally and paid for centrally.  I think that is sound.  The maintenance afterwards will be paid for locally and <Col N="2105" /> directed centrally.  In dealing with that drainage, I put it to the Parliamentary Secretary that there is no group of persons in this country with more knowledge of drainage requirements, drainage problems, the supervision and direction of maintenance, than is to be found inside the body of county surveyors and assistant surveyors in each of our counties.  I think it is in one of the minority reports that it was suggested that a resident engineer should be appointed for each drainage zone.  I do not know whether it is necessary to go as far as that. But, with regard to the planning of schemes, with regard even to having some function in carrying out of schemes, certainly with regard to the maintenance of schemes, I think that somewhere inside the four corners of the Bill room should be found to make use of the knowledge and experience of county surveyors.</P>
    <P>There have been references to the Barrow drainage scheme.  I do not propose to go back into that.  The Barrow drainage scheme as an engineering achievement was a mighty successful piece of work.</P>
    <P>It was an example that gave courage to this Parliament to go further with drainage schemes.  I remember, as a child, people from my neighbourhood going over, year after year, to London every time there was a change of Government. The same people went across &mdash;the M.P.'s. for Leix, North Offaly and South Kildare, and a number of representative local people&mdash;to try to get the Barrow drained.  Every time the Government changed across the water, over they went again and every time they came back with the same reply&mdash;that it was too costly a scheme, too vast an engineering undertaking. Having grown up in that atmosphere, it is certainly a proud recollection to look back and think that, before this country had a Parliament for as long as four years, that great scheme that was too vast an engineering undertaking and too costly a scheme for the mighty British Parliament was undertaken and put through.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear Deputy Davin say that, no matter what agitation was on <Col N="2106" /> down there, he always held and expressed the view that the scheme was a success, that it benefited all the affected people to a greater or less extent.  If there was any fault in that scheme, it was a fault of optimistic finance, thinking that the percentage that was to be levied off those who benefited could be met through a special rate.  The finance of the scheme was too heavy to be met in that manner and this Bill is correcting that to a very great extent.</P>
    <P>There is the question of arrears.  If the faith and hope that Parliament has shown in this Bill is to be justified, if we are going to have drainage on a scheme based on a comparatively rapid expenditure of £7,000,000, then I think the scheme should not be, as it were, open to criticism because of its tightness with regard to a few years of arrears.  In the Barrow drainage area, for one cause or another&mdash;either through lack of maintenance, through incapacity to pay, to the extent of one man standing beside another, through all these cases mixed together&mdash;there is at the present moment an accumulation of six years' arrears of a very heavy rate.  I am mentioning this now as it has been dealt with to some extent; but other Deputies know that, even at the height of a general election, when possibly it might have gained votes, I resisted in public at every meeting the total demands that were made by that body.</P>
    <P>I am putting this to the Parliamentary Secretary now.  There are six years of heavy arrears unpaid.  If there were only one or two years' arrears, I would say it was a matter to be taken seriously by the individuals.  If any of us here owes a few hundred pounds, that is a subject for worry; it is a subject that keeps us mentally active planning how to pay it off; but if any of us owes a couple of million pounds, we would not lose a minute's sleep about it: it is too fantastic to think of us paying a couple of millions.  That is a fair illustration of the situation which has grown up along the Barrow valley. Big finance was involved in the scheme at its inception.  This is a scheme boldly proposing to tackle drainage problems in a big financial way.  Do <Col N="2107" /> not have it held up here, there or anywhere by niggling with regard to arrears.  The annual charges have been substantially reduced.  The Parliamentary Secretary has sufficient files in his Department to know what the problem of arrears amounts to.  I am not putting forward a demand, as I do not like basing a case on the fact that bargains, contracts or laws have not been complied with.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary, at a subsequent stage, would be in a position to make some provision for this.</P>
    <P>With regard to the panel of drainage arbitrators, I know that it takes some nice balancing to decide whether to have part-time men who are engaged in professional practice or a few men who would be, as it were, in a judicial capacity, paid an adequate salary and prohibited from practising.  On the other side of the water, the policy adopted is the policy of arbitration through independent individuals, who are not in competitive practice and who are under no obligations to individuals.  I do not know which is the sounder way to go about it.  In very major questions, such as the loss of water power for immense industrial organisations, brought about through the lowering of water as a result of a drainage scheme, it is scarcely reasonable to leave that entirely to the views of a part-time arbitrator and deny the individual any right to appeal to any court in the land.  If we are adopting a system of part-time arbitrators, a man who just functions now and then, a man whose main interest is advancement in his professional practice outside and independent of drainage schemes, when big money is involved, when big losses may have to be faced by an individual, the least we should allow is the right of appeal to some of our courts.</P>
    <P>I would like the Parliamentary Secretary, in the further stages of this Bill&mdash;and I think it is necessary to say this&mdash;not to confuse criticism with opposition.  There has been a vast amount of criticism.  All the criticism was directed towards the production of a better Bill.  The Bill <Col N="2108" /> is generally welcomed.  If there are doubts as to what will happen after the Bill, then, giving expression to those doubts may, possibly, tend to expedite Departments that are not customarily very swift and to rendering more swift those Departments which show a certain celerity at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>During the time the Drainage Commission was sitting, certain evidence was given as regards the Erne drainage and I should like to know if there has been any conference between the people in the north and our people here in that connection. As the Parliamentary Secretary knows, the members of the board which existed at one time in connection with the Erne drainage resigned because they could not carry on under the new circumstances.  I should like to know if there is any possibility of this board being re-established or if anything will be done by the Board of Works in connection with the drainage there. Unless something is done in respect of the Erne drainage, there will be a considerable lodgment around that end of County Cavan.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows the circumstances, and I think that he would be well-advised to try to make some arrangements in connection with this matter.</P>
      <P>There is another question to which I should like to refer.  I have been agitating it for some years.  I refer to the drainage of the Ballyconnell river. Nothing has been said about it in connection with this Bill and, evidently, nothing is being done about it.  Many of the Deputies, and particularly the Parliamentary Secretary, know of the condition of that river and of its unhealthy reactions on the town, All sorts of stuff are being washed down by it, and I think that the Parliamentary Secretary should do something to remedy the present state of affairs.  I do not know whether or not he can do that under the present Bill, but, in any event, I should like him to give some attention to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all prepared to give the Parliamentary Secretary any assistance within our power to make <Col N="2109" /> this Bill a success.  Drainage is one of the topics on which there is fairly general agreement in this House, and, in operating the Bill, I do not think that the Parliamentary Secretary will find that his difficulties are underestimated by any section here.  I appreciate that there may be problems confronting the Parliamentary Secretary with regard to rivers flowing over the Border, in the solution of which he will not have the last word, because questions of high policy may cut across what would, ordinarily, be good drainage policy.  Provided he is left freedom of action in regard to such rivers, I think the sooner the Parliamentary Secretary puts his mind to the business of opening negotiations with the authorities of Northern Ireland with a view to arriving at some <i>modus vivendi</i> with them, so that effective steps may be prepared in consultation, the better.  It may well be that he will first undertake schemes exclusively within our own jurisdiction, but, even while those are in course of preparation or execution, it would be expedient to discuss the Border's drainage plans, because the settlement of the basis on which co-operation can be secured between ourselves and the authorities in Northern Ireland may present some difficulties which it will take a protracted period of negotiation to surmount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the principle of central maintenance in this Bill.  I recognise the force of what the Leader of the Opposition said in regard to leaving the local authority with no responsibility except to sign the cheques.  On the other hand, my experience, living in the country as I do, is that very frequently when you want to get something done, you are sent from pillar to post.  It is extremely difficult to fix responsibility anywhere for the purpose of a specific task which it may appear necessary to get done.  I think that it will be a great help, if some maintenance matter arises which appears to be of urgency, that one will be able to get in touch with the headquarters of the drainage system at once and ensure that, if a true emergency arises, effective measures will be taken without delay.  The Leader <Col N="2110" /> of the Opposition said that he believed the Board of Works were overlooking the outstanding link between themselves and the river to be drained&mdash;the county surveyor and his staff.  I differ emphatically from the Leader of the Opposition in that regard.  I think that the county surveyors and their staffs have plenty to do as it is.  The practice has grown up of giving the county surveyor and his staff all sorts of ancillary tasks&mdash;cutting turf, surveying relief schemes and doing a hundred and one jobs which the county surveyor was never appointed to do.  It is true that extra remuneration and, very often, temporary staff is provided to enable him to get over the additional work.  If you are in an emergency and trying to patch up a remedy to deal with a transient problem, that may be a legitimate way of dealing with it but this Drainage Bill is not a transient measure.  It will be a permanent part of our social set-up for the future and I should be long sorry to see either maintenance duties or any other important functions under the board dumped on to the shoulders of the county engineers.</P>
    <P>I trust the board will have its own maintenance staff and will be prepared to accept full responsibility for all construction and maintenance work that may be done in the future.  I hope that we shall not be informed by the Drainage Board, in the event of plans being made, that we must refer to the county engineer or his deputy and discuss with him whatever problem presents itself.  I am conscious of the danger of having one's words twisted and misrepresented and so I desire to say in parenthesis that I have no desire to reflect on the efficiency of the county engineers or their staffs.  I have good reason to know that, in most cases, they are men of the highest probity and efficiency.  I have merely pointed out that you cannot continually dump odd jobs on a man who has quite enough to do to discharge the ordinary duties which he undertook when he accepted the position of county engineer.</P>
    <P>Frequently, quite good drainage schemes, albeit small ones, have been discredited very largely because farmers <Col N="2111" /> in the adjacent areas, which should have been greatly benefited, have not done their share in draining their own land.  All of us know to our bitter cost how exasperating it can be if you drain your own land exhaustively, if you dig your own ditches, and then find, when you come to the mearing, that there is a kind of sand bar on our neighbour's ditches which banks up the water not only into your ditches but into the flag drains you may have made in your own land.  Therefore, I urge on the Parliamentary Secretary that, when he embarks on the construction of a drainage scheme in a drainage area, he should invite the co-operation of the Department of Agriculture to ensure that local farmers whose land should be benefited by the general drainage scheme will avail of the farm improvements scheme, or any other schemes which the Department of Agriculture may be operating, adequately to drain their own lands, so that, when the arterial drainage system is completed, the field drains will be there to carry the water from the land into that system.  There is no use in having an arterial drainage system to improve land if the land itself is waterlogged and the outlets for the water completely blocked.</P>
    <P>I have heard Deputies describe, with passion in their voices, the glorious prospect that this code holds for the employment of unskilled labour.  I see growing up already in this House a tendency to impress on the Parliamentary Secretary responsible for this scheme the desirability of converting the whole thing into immense relief works. I want to say to him that, right from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo;, he should dismiss from his mind absolutely the labour-content of this Bill as a matter of prime concern.  If it happens to have labour-content, all very well, but the purpose of this Bill is not to create an unprecedentedly large relief scheme. The purpose of this Bill is to drain the land of Ireland and, to do that properly, the Board of Works and the drainage authority should equip themselves with the most modern machinery and should use the most effective methods conceivable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2112" /> They should search the world for advice as to what are the most effective and economical methods for getting the best results in the shortest time.  If that results in our employing less unskilled labour than was at first hoped, let us devise other schemes for the employment of unskilled labour and do not clog up this immensely important economic reform by a desire to substitute a Drainage Act for a new minor relief scheme development. There should be no element of relief scheme in this Bill, and I urge the Parliamentary Secretary to be utterly draconian in his refusal to harass those who are carrying through schemes under this Bill by imposing on them the obligation to employ manual labour if they believe that the job can be better and more cheaply done by the employment of machinery.</P>
    <P>I do not think that we should depart from that aspect of the Bill without calling to mind the Board of Works' mentality on the subject of drainage schemes.  I must say that I have great respect for the ability of the officers of the Board of Works. I remember once going on a deputation to the Board of Works on behalf of the Lough Gara and Mantua Drainage Board with a suggestion for certain works in that area which we thought were of a very minor character but which we believed would confer a benefit out of all proportion to their apparent size.  A day was appointed for us to meet at the offices of the Board of Works, whereupon they produced large maps, carefully coloured, and informed us that, if the Exchequer were to provide 99 per cent. of the cost as a free grant, the remaining 1 per cent. would impose an intolerable charge on the land to be benefited. Now, according to our view, the land to be benefited would derive a benefit sufficient to pay practically the entire cost of the scheme.  Doubtless the Board of Works knew more about it than we did.  I invite the Parliamentary Secretary to look up the records of that interview.  It was the last deputation that waited on the Board of <Col N="2113" /> Works from the Lough Gara and Mantua Drainage Board.  I invite him to look up the records to see if that view is correct and is in future to prevail, because I find it very hard to believe that drainage in this country is possible at all if it is true&mdash;the Lough Gara and Mantua Drainage Board was set up under the 1846 Act and a drainage scheme put through &mdash;that putting a scheme which is already in existence into a state of thorough repair would involve a cost, 1 per cent. of which would constitute an intolerable burden on the land to be improved&mdash;if that view is correct, then I think the future of drainage in this country is very gloomy indeed. However, I invite the Parliamentary Secretary just for interest-sake to review the whole episode and, bearing in mind that extremely conservative approach to drainage by the board, to consider whether perhaps their whole approach to this problem in the past has not been too conservative. I believe that, if effective drainage is done, the increase in the value of the land is probably far greater than the Board of Works realises, and it is for that reason that I welcome this Bill.  If I accepted the Board of Works' view as to the relative value of the improvement of the land and the cost of carrying out drainage, I would regard this Bill as an extremely improbable measure. It is because I do not accept that view that I believe it is right to go ahead with this Bill and to put the works contemplated under it in hand.</P>
    <P>The last point that I want to make deals with the question of compensation referred to in sub-section (3) of Section 16.  The sub-section provides that where water-power rights, or fisheries, are destroyed or compulsorily acquired under the drainage code, the compensation for the person injured by the acquisition shall be determined by an arbitrator nominated by the Minister from the panel of drainage arbitrators whose decision both as to the right and the amount of such compensation shall be final and conclusive.  Now, I want to make this representation to the House.  We cannot close our eyes to the fact that when we first got control of government <Col N="2114" /> in this country, and indeed for some years before, we took a rather cavalier view of people's rights to fisheries, to water-power rights and so forth, on the broad general principle that they did not come by these two rights too honestly, and that if they did not do too well out of them when they were being taken from them, then the devil mend them.  That might have been right or wrong.  I think that very often it went too far.  But let us now realise that most of these rights&mdash; power rights and so on&mdash;are vested in nationals of this country, in our fellow men and women who were born here, grew up here and made their careers here.  They are as valuable properties to the people who hold them as a house or a farm or any other asset that a citizen of this State may hold.</P>
    <P>When one thinks of water power, one thinks of wealth in magnificence. There is one mill which at once springs to my mind.  It is operated by water-power, and in fact would not be functioning at all if it had not water-power. I refer to the Providence Woollen Mills in Foxford.  I do not think in any event that drainage operations will affect the water-power to that mill.  I think that the principal problem that the mill owners there have is this: that the tail race is not deep enough, so that drainage would help rather than hinder them.</P>
    <P>But there are other mills in country towns which could not operate at all except on the basis of the water power at present available to them.  If that water power is destroyed as a result of a drainage operation, and it may be necessary to destroy certain sources of water power in order to carry through drainage schemes effectively, these people are deprived of their livelihood. Now, observe what happens.  They have to go before an arbitrator nominated by the Minister from a panel of drainage arbitrators.  The panel of drainage arbitrators will probably consist of half a dozen or a dozen men versed in this work, part-time men who, when their drainage arbitration is over, will go back to their professions and hope that when some other arbitration is held they will get called again so that they will honourably earn another fee.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2115" /> Suppose you have two arbitrators, A and B, and arbitrator A is appointed to assess the value of a water right in County Mayo.  He gives the property owner 25 per cent. more than the Drainage Board thinks he ought to have got.  Then, along comes arbitrator B and he gives the property owner 10 per cent. less than the Drainage Board offered in the first instance.  The result is that arbitrator B. is overworked. He will be dragged off whenever an arbitration is required, and men, being human, will see for themselves that the task of choosing the arbitrator is in the hands of the Minister for Finance so that he is in effect an arbitrator nominated by the Minister.</P>

A is picked by the Minister for the first arbitration and proves to be more generous than the Minister anticipated.  The Drainage Board complain bitterly to the Minister that A has given a fantastic award.  Then, the next time, B is picked and B gives 10 per cent. less than the Drainage Board expected he would give.  A will never be picked again for the panel, but arbitrator B will be overworked.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is as it may be. It is a difficulty that is going to arise no matter what plan you adopt, but there is a safeguard, and that is to give the property owner a right of appeal to the High Court.  Some people may say at once &ldquo;What on earth do High Courts know about water power?&rdquo; but, after all, if I am <Col N="2116" /> living next to Deputy Hughes and I have a water mill and Deputy Hughes diverts my water supply, or otherwise destroys it, my ordinary remedy is to sue him at civil law and if I satisfy the court that I have a claim in law, it becomes the duty of the court to assess the value of my loss and to award me suitable damages against him.  I think we will find, in practice, that these arbitrators will do sufficient justice in the vast majority of cases, but what we have to bear in mind is that if we are going to take another person's property or interfere with another person's liberty, we have not only to do justice, but we have to do our best to convince the person from whom we take property or liberty that we are doing justice.  It is not enough to do what we think would be fair; we should go the limit to carry conviction to his mind that he has had a square deal.  I do not think we could do that if we leave the question of arbitration to an arbitrator who functions under the threat that if he gives a verdict in favour of the owner of the property he may never get another job.</P>
      <P>All of us, certainly the senior members of this House, know how strenuously we objected to removable magistrates, the temporary magistrate who could be kicked out of office if he did not do what the British Government wanted him to do.  We felt that whatever chance there was for a man who held his office on judicial tenure, the fear of being sacked if he did not give the right verdict prevented justice altogether.  These removable arbitrators stand in the same place unless it is provided that where a property owner is deeply aggrieved he can go from the arbitrator to a High Court judge.  It may be said that everyone will then go to a High Court judge, and that you might as well cut out arbitrators, but it does not work out that way.  No sensible man would encumber himself with a heavy bill of costs if he believes he could get 2 or 3 per cent. more than an arbitrator gave him, but the knowledge that there is an appeal to a High Court judge eliminates from the mind of every man the feeling that he may be made the victim of grave injustice without any remedy at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2117" /> I think it would be a great pity if we embarked on this admirable plan, however it works out in practice, resolved in the initial steps to withhold from the minority, a very vulnerable minority, their bare rights.  Now, the Parliamentary Secretary knows as well as I do that if he chooses to trample on the rights of persons who own fisheries and water power and the like in this country, there will be very little public outcry.  It is very easy to trample on microscopic minorities but there is always the danger that we ourselves may belong to such a microscopic minority and when we contemplate dealing with microscopic minorities let us try to deal with them as though we were among them.  I am not urging privileges for these people or for any special concession&mdash;all I am asking is that in the last analysis they will be given the same right against the Drainage Board as one citizen would have against another if the fishery or water power were interfered with.</P>
    <P>I venture to prophesy that in 90 per cent. of cases the matter will never go before the arbitrator but in the remaining 10 per cent. reference will be made to a High Court judge.  So long as we have made such a provision I am prepared to say that no single citizen has good ground to complain.  If we do not give them such a tribunal, then I cannot but feel that we have brushed their rights aside unnecessarily, just because they were so small a section of the community that we were sure their voice could not be made effectively heard in the community.</P>
    <P>In this House we are the protectors of minorities, and if we do our duty we should be as jealous of the rights of minorities as we are of our own.  I do not lose hope of the Parliamentary Secretary sympathising with my view and amending the section and, if he does&mdash;there are a lot of other matters in the Bill which other Deputies have mentioned&mdash;so far as I am concerned, he carries with him my best wishes for the future of the various undertakings embarked upon in the Bill.  With the assistance I know he will get from the Board of Works and through others co-operating with him, I have every reason to hope that his <Col N="2118" /> efforts will be crowned with a very suitable measure of success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are only two matters I wish to refer to on this Bill. I hope that when the board are carrying out its provisions they will take into account any hydro-electrical development that is contemplated in the country after the war, and that there will be full co-operation between the planning of constructional drainage and the Electricity Supply Board, so that they will not be working at loggerheads afterwards.  I assume that some portion of the drainage will have been begun before the termination of the emergency, and as far as I know the plans of the Electricity Supply Board will not be put into operation, for want of material, until after the emergency.</P>
      <P>In drainage proper and in the maintenance of drainage, I would like to see more thorough methods employed. I am acquainted with the Upper Inny Drainage Board.  There was a Lower Inny Drainage Board at one time but it has lapsed, with the result that the Lower Inny regions are very much flooded during portions of the year, and land around the lower reaches has become useless for many forms of husbandry. I assume that will be tackled along with the Upper Inny drainage, and as the Upper Inny extends into the neighbouring constituency of the Parliamentary Secretary I have great hope that he will look favourably on that river.</P>

      <P>Very good work could be done in the Lough Sheelin and Derravaragh areas.  I would like to see the river boat employed.  I have seen drainage in England, and they scoop the bed of the river as well as the sides, and do it in a thorough fashion.  In our methods we go along the sides of the banks, and the men put on waders and go out as far as they can.  I would like to see them employing more of these river boats which are in use in England, where they do very effective work in the rivers.  I welcome the Bill because I come from a county where <Col N="2119" /> we suffer very much from floods.  It is a very flat county where the Brosna and Inny rivers flow.  Except in the northern portion of the county, it is one of the flattest counties in Ireland, and I hope the Bill will be brought into operation very soon.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to see that a fair wage clause is put into this Bill before it leaves the House.  Some Deputies have said here that there are no unemployed and that we may have to wait until after the emergency to carry out these schemes.  According to the daily papers for the 19/2/1944, the number registered in Eire as unemployed was 71,914.  I wonder if any Deputy thinks that these are all young girls who are signing up at the exchanges and that we have no men.  I do not think we should wait until after the emergency. I had experience of a similar scheme introduced by Deputy Cosgrave's Government for the drainage of the Sow river and the wage paid was 30/- a week.  The men employed had to get lorries to travel the long distances they had to go to work.  When this scheme comes into operation I hope that nothing like that will happen, and that the workers will be provided with adequate transport.  The workers are to be drawn from all over the country, and we have been told the total amount to be advanced by the State is £7,000,000.</P>

      <P>To delete Section 47 (2) and substitute the following new subsections:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  Rules for the purposes of this section shall provide that a midwife employed by a local authority shall not be required to attend any course of instruction to which the rules relate except in accordance with the arrangements made by the local authority in pursuance of sub-section (3) of this section.</P>
      <P>(3)  A local authority by whom a midwife is employed shall, in accordance with such directions as the minister may give from time to time&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  grant leave of absence to the midwife to attend any course of instruction to which rules for the purposes of this section relate, and</P>
      <P>(b) pay a substitute for the midwife during the attendance, and</P>
      <P>(c)  pay to the midwife travelling expenses in respect of the attendance (including subsistence allowance during the period of the attendance) in accordance with the relevant regulations under sub-section (1) of Section 19 of the Local Government Act, 1941 (No. 23 of 1941), and any relevant authorisation under sub-section (3) of that section in like manner as if the attendance was part of the official duties of the midwife.</P>
      <P>This amendment is a redraft, making specific provision for leave of absence to attend a post-graduate course.  The amendment provides for payment of substitutes and payment of travelling expenses, including subsistence allowance.  In connection with the amendment and the discussion we had on the issues at stake in this section on the Committee Stage, I would like to say that it has been the policy of the Department to make the provision that is being set out here.  Deputy Corish mentioned a case from Wexford where, apparently, we refused to sanction the maintenance allowance.</P>

      <P>On the 8th June, 1943, a circular letter was issued to local authorities in connection with this matter of post-graduate courses for midwives.  In the course of that letter it was stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am to call your attention to the Department's previous circular letters pointing out that midwives in the employment of local authorities should be encouraged to attend such courses.  I am to state that the Minister is prepared to sanction payment of reasonable expenses to midwives in dispensary districts for travelling and subsistence, in addition to the remuneration of substitutes whom it may be necessary to employ during their absence.  Subsistence expenses in excess of £2 10s 0d. a week would be considered excessive.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We pay the substitute; the salary continues during leave of absence, and we give a subsistence allowance up to a maximum of £2 10s 0d. a week. I think that is a reasonable provision.</P>

      <P>With regard to subsistence allowances, I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary is aware that little girls from the country who are trained here, and whose parents have spent a certain amount of money on their training, are receiving by way of salary something like £48 or £50 a year.  If they are to maintain themselves decently in a district, they must pay at least 25/- or 30/- a week for their upkeep.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to consider this point.  It is not mentioned in the Bill, so far as I can see, but I think it is unjust to the girls who are asked to do this work.  They are young women who have the lives of the mothers of this country in their hands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy has not observed the full purport of the amendment before the House.  We are dealing with the question of post-graduate courses for midwives.  Under this Bill midwives may be called upon by the Central Midwives Board from time to time to attend post-graduate courses.  The amendment makes provision for payment during leave of absence, for the payment of a substitute during absence, and for the payment of travelling and subsistence expenses.  In a circular letter issued to the local authorities on 8th June, <Col N="2126" /> we mentioned that the maximum subsistence allowance that would be sanctioned would be £2 10s. 0d. per week. I think that sum would be regarded as generous.</P>
      <P>As regards salaries, I am not aware that there is any midwife on as small a salary as Deputy Carter has mentioned. All I can say on the matter at this stage, with the permission of the Chair, is that a salary of £40, £42 and £50 a year is, in my opinion, entirely inadequate.  It is a matter for the local authority, in the first instance, to pay these officers a reasonable salary.  Some of the salaries mentioned here&mdash;that is, if they do operate at all&mdash;are entirely unreasonable.</P>

      <P>The ceiling has not been pushed up or disturbed by any local authority so far.  It will be time enough to discuss that when we reach the stage when a local authority wants to raise the ceiling a little higher. There are, to my knowledge, many midwives in the employment of local authorities whose salaries are inadequate and, within reasonable limits, if local authorities face up to their responsibilities I do not think there will be any difficulty about having these salaries improved.</P>

      <P>A midwife's expenses, while doing a post-graduate course, might be left to the option of local authorities, because some of them would like to give an adequate maintenance allowance for that week.  If the salary is small&mdash;less than £100 yearly&mdash;a midwife could not be expected to maintain herself while doing a post-graduate course that would be in the interests of patients. These officials should be given full maintenance expenses.  With a return railway ticket to Dublin they get £2 10s. 0d. for seven days.  They may have to spend more than seven days when travelling to and from Dublin. Everybody knows that £2 10s. 0d. would not cover the outlay on board and lodgings for seven days.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should leave it to the option of a county manager to decide what maintenance expenses should be given.</P>

I suggest to Deputy Allen that the rate should be a uniform one.</P>

      <P>I am sure Deputy Allen is aware of the cases that I mentioned last night.  It is not too much to ask the Minister to agree to the payment of the full expenses of these officials.  It would cost more than £2 10s. 0d. a week to live in Dublin.  As Deputy Allen pointed out, anybody who has to visit the city knows that £2 10s. 0d. would hardly cover maintenance for three days in <Col N="2128" /> a decent place.  I ask the Minister to agree to the payment of full expenses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the pressure that is being put on the Minister, I cannot help remembering that these officials, when they come to Dublin, are to get £2 10s. 0d. a week in addition to their salaries.  We all hope that the salaries will be put on a more permanent basis, and that they would be something like a minimum of £2 a week.  They are to get £2 10s. 0d. subsistence allowance and free travelling facilities.  Some of us are not so ancient as not to remember that when we came to Dublin for a special course, we did not spend our whole time at that course.  We might often indulge in a picture show or some mild activity of that kind.  Under average circumstances, a person who had to spend five or six days in the city, and started out with a free return ticket and £4 10s. 0d., would not be doing too badly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to point out that this Bill does not fix the amount.  I have explained what our policy in the past has been and what I expect it will be in the near future. Deputy Allen advocated a more generous maintenance allowance, but I think Deputy Dillon answered him effectively.  I should like to supplement Deputy Dillon's remarks by reminding the House that these are not whole-time nurses-anything but whole-time. As mentioned previously, the number of dispensary cases they attend in the year is small, but, because of the possibility that their services may be called upon, we have to provide nurses in the different districts.  It is to these nurses' own advantage that they should return to Dublin from time to time for post-graduate courses.  The training and the brushing-up of ideas on such post-graduate courses will be an asset to them when they go back, and will assist them in regard to private practice as well as with the poor whom they <Col N="2129" /> will be called upon to attend under the Public Assistance Acts.  I would be quite happy about the whole matter to find that the majority of local authorities would be prepared to pay their nurses the maximum maintenance allowance mentioned.</P>

      <P>I join with other Deputies in paying tribute to the Department concerned with this measure. In paying tribute to the Department over which the Parliamentary Secretary presides, I think it will be agreed on all sides that we should extend a <Col N="2131" /> tribute also to the Drainage Commission for the painstaking manner in which it examined the large volume of evidence that was submitted to it before bringing in this report.  I expect that every member of the House has still a copy of the Drainage Commission's Report of 1940, but it is no harm to recall the fact that representatives, of 28 different local authorities, 15 drainage boards' trustees, seven miscellaneous bodies and ten other witnesses gave evidence before that commission.  As well, the commission heard evidence from a certain number of Departments of State, for instance, the Department of Agriculture, the Office of Public Works in its various branches, the Department of Finance, the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Department of Lands, the Department of Local Government and the Valuation Office.  The commission held 41 meetings, and there were 19 sub-committee meetings.  I think the fact that all that evidence was given, drawn from all counties in the State, should silence the criticism that has been made here up to the present that the Government have been lax in their duty in not bringing in this measure sooner.  I think that the best advice on this very important measure would be to hasten slowly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with speakers who recommend the Parliamentary Secretary not to be led away by the idea that there will be a solution for the unemployment problem beyond a certain danger line provided by these schemes, because I do not think on close examination such a view would be justified. I believe that a large number of our unemployed will find work on schemes promoted under this measure but, at the same time, I think that on the major rivers and the major arteries throughout the country room will have to be provided for the employment of mechanical apparatus, otherwise the cost of drainage would be prohibitive. I prefer to think that the vast bulk of our unemployed in the various counties will be absorbed by the farmers in their respective areas in making use of the outlets which these major drainage works will provide.  Coming from the <Col N="2132" /> Midlands, I should like, with other speakers here, to pay tribute to the magnificent engineering work carried out in the last 15 years in the drainage of the Barrow.</P>
    <P>I can bring any member of the House into the Barrow valley area and point out the magnificent farm improvement work going on there, where land has been brought under tillage and where meadow land formerly submerged is now made available.  I can throw my mind back to drainage works carried out under the 1924 and 1925 Acts and I know what a vast amount of improvement work may be expected in future under the farm improvement schemes conducted by the Department of Agriculture as the result of the opening up of a main waterfall to take the water away from the countryside.</P>
    <P>I would ask that every member of the House should try to concentrate, by constructive criticism, on making this scheme one that, as years roll on, will require little amendment.  The size of the job that is to be undertaken in this comprehensive scheme is indicated by the statement in the report of the Drainage Commission that 650,200 acres will be improved as a result of this measure.  Under the Drainage Act of 1924 work was executed all over the country and large schemes were also carried out under the 1925 Act.  Fifty-one schemes were carried out, and it is stated that approximately there were 230 drainage districts.  I refer to that because the experience that has been gained over a period of years of the conduct of all concerned&mdash;the benefiting ratepayers and the local authorities&mdash;in regard to the maintenance of work done, goes to show that the Government are wise in their decision that the local authorities should undertake the extra burden of maintenance. Magnificent schemes have been carried out all over the country in the past 20 or 30 years, even since the 1924 Act, and the benefiting ratepayers in the respective areas have grumbled about paying for the valuable work carried out, work which made it possible to unload the waters that were making their land unmanageable and sodden and even affecting grazing and meadowlands.  I cannot understand <Col N="2133" /> the mentality of people who refuse to pay a few shillings, 1/6 or 2/6 an acre, in respect of such work.  The Government are wise in giving charge of the drainage problems of the future to one central authority who will expect from the local authorities wholehearted co-operation in discharging their obligation to provide maintenance.</P>
    <P>I am glad, therefore, that the controversy about the payment of drainage rates is being brought to an end because in the County Laoighise you have, on the one hand, a body of farmers who, in the majority of cases, have undoubtedly derived real benefit from the magnificent Barrow drainage scheme and who have during the past years been putting up objections to paying the drainage rates.  The estimated improved value of the land amounted to roughly 2/7 or 2/8 per acre.  On the other hand, there is a number of smaller drainage schemes, of equal importance to the drainage ratepayer concerned, where the cost was much higher.  For instance, three drainage schemes were carried out in connection with the Douglas, the Erkna, and the Cush, under the 1924 and 1925 Acts.  In the Douglas area the estimated improved value was 4/2 per acre; in the Erkna, South Laoighis, the estimated improved value was 5/8 per acre; in the Cush it was 1/8 per acre.  In connection with these three schemes, when the work had been completed, prior to 1930, there was some grumbling that the benefiting ratepayers had not got value for their money, but since then, the ratepayers have been bearing the full cost of the necessary maintenance work.  In the case of the Barrow, there was a dispute and the local authority paid annually to the Board of Works the necessary instalments and the arrears due by the Barrow ratepayers, amounting to an accumulated arrear of £18,000, were put back upon the shoulders of the general body of ratepayers.</P>
    <P>It is clear, therefore, that anyone associated with a local authority has cause to be glad that such disputes and discrepancies will be brought to an end by the wise decision of the Government <Col N="2134" /> to appoint a central authority. Undoubtedly there was disparity in regard to the striking of the rate in County Laoighise.  In one case the Government were helping to the extent of 50 per cent. of the cost of maintenance and in the other case the local farmer ratepayers were paying the full cost. According to the Bill, it is proposed that the collection of arrears will be referred to the local authority.  I daresay, at a later stage there will be an opportunity of referring to that matter again.  In one sense, it is not very desirable that that matter should be left to a local authority, but, on the other hand, the members of a local authority must play fair as between one section of ratepayers in a particular county and another.  I think the House should appreciate that fact.</P>
    <P>On the question of the fixing by the central authority of the yearly maintenance charges to be met by the local authority I think&mdash;and other Deputies have referred to it&mdash;that it is a matter for consideration whether some amount could not be fixed as the maximum burden that a local authority should bear by way of maintenance charges.</P>
    <P>There is another point in regard to which I am anxious to have some information from the Parliamentary Secretary: Supposing a large amount of bank erosion takes place as a result of a heavy flood following a heavy fall of snow, will the burden of replacement and of rebuilding the banks and putting the river into a normal state of repair, involving, perhaps, thousands of pounds, fall on the shoulders of the county ratepayers, under the heading of maintenance, in the succeeding rate?</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen stated, and rightly so, that the drainage that has been carried out and that will be carried out in the future will have a very beneficial effect on the health of our people.  I have seen in my own area, even as recently as last week, districts where flooded conditions still obtain.  Until extra work is carried out in the Barrow area, where main tributaries of the Barrow require to be opened up to take off the water from certain localities, flooded conditions will remain.  I have seen a pump hole in a certain yard that was <Col N="2135" /> flooded and the overflow was flowing into the pump hole.  The people of the house were using that water for domestic purposes.  That is common in many places.  In Mountmellick and Portarlington it would have been impossible to instal waterworks or sewerage schemes under the conditions that existed prior to the drainage of the Barrow because there was no outlet for the sewage and disgraceful conditions were often found at the rere of houses and near houses owing to the pollution of the river and the obstruction of the system of sewerage then existing.</P>
    <P>Down further, there is the important town of Athy, which, I think Deputy Hughes will agree, was possibly similarly placed.  On the whole, we must put it up to the people to realise that there will be a direct bearing on their general health and well-being by having large scale drainage carried out, because if an epidemic breaks out in a town, due to bad water supply or to any lack of proper sewerage arrangements in the summer months, that epidemic will find its way into the country districts. The country people have to visit the towns to get their goods, and the more co-operation and goodwill which can be brought about between country and town on these public health matters and matters of common concern the better, because, in the last ten or 15 years, with the huge increase in social services and particularly the installation of sewerage and waterworks schemes all over the country, a burden has been thrown back upon the rural ratepayer as high as 1/- or 1/6 in the £.  There can be a certain reciprocity in the whole matter when the burden is being spread. When the National Exchequer is to bear the full cost of new work, it is reasonable, within the limits I have referred to, to expect that local authorities will play their part so far as possible.</P>
    <P>There is good ground for joining with those who have asked the Parliamentary Secretary to inquire into the possibilities of a survey of the country on a much larger scale and, <Col N="2136" /> if you like, the establishment on a fair basis of a priority list of the works which are most essential, because, when the Bill goes through, there is bound to be pressure from every area to have particular works undertaken, and, unless there is some plan devised to select the most important, the most far-reaching works at the beginning, there will be clogging of the office of the Central Drainage Board by unnecessary clamouring for the undertaking of works which could not possibly be undertaken.</P>
    <P>I have been referring to new works and I now refer to the taking over and maintenance of old works.  As the House is aware, an appointed day will have to be fixed for the taking over of the various old boards and drainage districts.  All these cannot be taken over at the same time, and it must be made perfectly clear to all concerned that just because this Bill goes through in March, 1944, every drainage district must not clamour at the one time for the taking over of their district and the carrying out of reconstruction work, because it would be quite impossible. Some ordered scheme for the taking over of such works will have to be devised, and I am satisfied that it will be good policy for the people in the areas concerned to look at the generous assistance provided in this measure and not to grumble about paying whatever contribution is required of them to keep works in reasonably good repair until the fixing of the appointed day for their respective areas.</P>
    <P>In connection with the taking over of the various districts, I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that there could be valuable co-operation between the Board of Works and the Drainage Commissioners on the one hand and the county engineers on the other. These county engineers will have found out, in connection with a number of drainage schemes carried out in the last ten or 15 years, much useful and valuable information which, I think, should pass into the hands of the Central Drainage Board.  Ways and means should be devised by which that information could be gathered in, in a spirit of sincere co-operation between <Col N="2137" /> both parties, for the benefit of the entire community.  We have in various districts men who have had years of experience of drainage matters.  These men have become specialists at their work, and some special provision should be made whereby they would automatically pass into the employment of the central drainage authority when it takes over.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that, as a result of this comprehensive and valuable measure, thousands of acres can be reclaimed through drainage, and I am satisfied also that the Parliamentary Secretary and his officers will find that, once the central machinery is put in motion, it will be possible, as well as desirable, that work should be pushed ahead at a quicker rate than that indicated by an expenditure of £250,000 a year. There is scarcely a county wherein certain works could not be usefully undertaken.  In some cases, it will simply be a matter of reconstruction and maintenance of works which have fallen into disrepair and, in other cases, it will be a matter of new works, but, whichever it is, I am satisfied that there is room for a greater expenditure than £250,000 when the commissioners get properly to work.</P>
    <P>At the outset, we shall have to go easily and to remember that we are living in abnormal times, when facilities for obtaining machinery, parts, etc., are very few.  At present even the quality of the spade and shovel, so much needed in agriculture and on the bogs, is very much below that obtainable a few years ago.  We shall have to make allowances for such difficulties.  We cannot expect as high a standard during an emergency such as that through which we are passing as would obtain in normal times, when there is keen competition between manufacturers to produce the best article for sale to the public.</P>
    <P>With regard to appeals, I think there should be some form of arbitration as between the central authority and the local authorities on certain questions, because I and every member of the House can foresee that differences of opinion and arguments as to the amount of money which should be devoted to <Col N="2138" /> maintenance work in a given year are bound to arise.  That is bound to happen.</P>
    <P>There is no use in people shutting their eyes to that fact, because the experience of the last ten or 15 years will prove that that has been the case. On examination of the report of the Drainage Commission, dealing particularly with the evidence taken from the representatives of the county councils, it will be seen that it is clearly set out there that such a state of affairs is bound to arise.  Consequently, I think that to avoid long drawn-out controversy it would be better to have a proper form of arbitration set up which would hold the balance fairly as between the central drainage authority and the local authority, with the same powers of veto.  There are certain powers of veto given to the central authority where the local authority refuses to pay its fair share.</P>
    <P>I welcome this measure on behalf of the constituency I represent, as in County Offaly there is wide scope for drainage work and also in the County Laoighis.  I should like to say, however, that it would be well, in starting off, that certain extra work that is required to be done on schemes carried out since the 1925 Act and on the Barrow drainage scheme, which in fact is only 70 per cent. complete, should be carried out.  We have to remember that the lower regions of the Barrow from Carlow down have not got any benefit so far from that scheme.  Many thousands of tons of water have been released by that scheme and flow freely down to Carlow and the country below it.  Whether it is correct or not, I have been told that certain flooding has occurred below Carlow.  We have to be fair in this matter, and I say that important works like that should receive early attention.</P>
    <P>In the districts where the Barrow drainage scheme has been carried out there are tracts of hundred acres of land where, by preparing a scheme of additions to the work already carried out and pushing tributaries further in from the river, an additional 600 yards here, a 1,000 yards there, and half a mile in another place, it would be possible <Col N="2139" /> for the farmers of these districts to proceed with the work of improving their lands.  In that area there are some hundreds of acres of arable land that could be improved and brought into good condition if that work were carried out.  But until these main tributaries are opened up the farmers will not be able to do the necessary farm drainage.</P>
    <P>As to the powers that are rightly taken in the Bill to compel certain landowners to clean up drains on their land which are holding up the drainage of their neighbours' farms, I do not think any fair-minded farmer will disagree with that power.  It is a necessary power.  There again, however, I think there should be a proviso inserted. One farmer might have a main drain or artery flowing for 300 yards through his land and another farmer might have one for half a mile or a mile through his land.  The job of opening up such a watercourse would be beyond the capacity of the farmer to bear.  Such matters will require careful consideration from the central authority when the time comes for dealing with them.  Now, when the measure is before the House, I think is the time for us to make what we think are fair and reasonable suggestions and to call the Parliamentary Secretary's attention to them so that they can be properly provided for before the Dáil gives its full assent to the measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Like others who have spoken, I want to pay a tribute to the Parliamentary Secretary for his clear explanation of this Bill and also for the memorandum which accompanies it.  At the same time, I think it is right to say that it is high time that we had a Bill of this kind, as any drainage legislation which we have had since we got our own Government was of a very piecemeal nature.  Nothing but dissatisfaction emerged as a result of that legislation.  Those who are alleged to have benefited by the different drainage schemes carried out were always dissatisfied and, in a great many cases, refused to pay the rates levied on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2140" /> On reading certain sections of the Bill, one might get the impression that the county councils were to be consulted before any drainage was carried out in their districts.  On closer examination, however, we find that the drainage work in the particular area of a county council will be a <i>fait accompli</i> before the county council have anything to do with the matter. I think it is not good enough merely to tell the county council what is going to be done, and then, when the work has been done, to ask the county council to levy a rate in the area under their jurisdiction.  I may be drawing a wrong inference from the Bill, but that is how I see it.  Surely it is not too much to ask that the engineers of the Office of Public Works should enter into consultation with the local engineers, who are more familiar with the position so far as want of drainage in their area is concerned than perhaps abler men in the Office of Public Works.  I suggest that some kind of consultation should take place before any scheme is undertaken.  After all, the maintenance charges will be placed by the county council, by compulsion from the Government, on the ratepayers in the area under their jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>I agree with the last speaker that we need not look to this measure as a relief of unemployment to any appreciable extent.  Anybody who examines the figures will have to agree with that. It is suggested, and, I think, even definitely laid down, that the amount of money to be spent each year is £250,000.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary said something which would lead us to infer that it would take 40 years to spend the amount of money which will have to be spent before drainage is carried out to any appreciable extent in this country.</P>
    <P>If we take £250,000 and divide it between 26 counties, it will be found that there is only a sum of £9,615 for each county.  The Parliamentary Secretary may say that the major schemes will be only in certain counties, but I suggest there is not a county in Ireland which does not need some drainage work carried out at once.  If we relate that to what Deputy Gorry has said, <Col N="2141" /> everybody will have to agree that, as far as the relief of unemployment is concerned, this Bill will create a very, very small impression on that vast problem, which has confronted us for a number of years.</P>
    <P>I notice in one section of the Bill that the Board of Works is entitled, and perhaps wishful, to arrange that work of this kind be given to a contractor. If that is to be the policy of the Government, the least we can expect is the insertion of a clause stating that any contractor who takes on work of this kind is compelled to pay a decent living wage.  There were Housing Bills and other Bills passed here, in which the Government agreed to insert such a clause.  This is very heavy work, work of a very dirty nature and of the kind that everybody would not like; and I hope the Board of Works will not try to have it done on the miserable wages paid under the minor relief schemes.  Time and time again, this Party has raised the matter of wages paid on minor relief schemes. I hope the mentality which prevailed in regard to the wages paid on that particular work will not prevail in this instance.  I ask the Minister to agree to accept an amendment, on the Committee Stage, which will be moved, to ensure the payment of decent wages to the men who will be employed.</P>
    <P>In Section 5, the commissioners are obliged to publish in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and &ldquo;such one or more newspapers as they shall consider appropriate, a notice&rdquo; and so on.  Where a drainage scheme is about to be carried out in a particular county, the least that can be expected is that the local newspapers&mdash; each and every one of them&mdash;be asked to give notification of that fact.  The people in the rural areas do not see the Government paper, and very few see the daily papers.  It is the local papers that are important, so far as they are concerned, and it is in the local papers that the notice should be published.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gorry referred to the River Barrow.  As far as I can ascertain, £500,000 has been spent on the upper reaches of the Barrow.  Not being familiar with the geography of the <Col N="2142" /> place, I am not in a position to judge what good has been derived from the expenditure of that money.  I do know, however, that the River Barrow comes down from his particular county into mine&mdash;Wexford&mdash;and empties itself into the sea.  In consequence of the fact that these banks have been built up, the energy of the water has been harnessed to a great extent and, as a result, it comes rushing down into County Wexford, overflowing the banks of the river and lodging an amount of silt, especially in the vicinity of the town of New Ross.  Anybody who knows New Ross knows that the people's health has suffered as a consequence. There is no need for me to say at this stage from what particular disease they have suffered.  The flooding that is created there always leaves a fog in the immediate environs of the town.  It is hoped that the remedying of that will be one of the first works undertaken by the Board of Works, as soon as they get the necessary permission to proceed.</P>
    <P>I have said I could not find anything in the Bill to show that a consultation would take place between the local authorities and the Board of Works before a scheme is undertaken.  I would also like to know whether the county council mentioned is the actual county council or the county manager. Under the County Management Act, the county manager is often referred to as the county council.  Is this a &ldquo;reserved function&rdquo; of the county council, or is it the county manager who will decide for himself what action should be taken by the county council in connection with any work of this nature?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasCarter1921" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish, in the first instance, to congratulate the Minister on introducing this Bill, and also to congratulate his Parliamentary Secretary. This is the greatest Bill that has been brought before the Parliament of this country since it was founded.  It will confer great benefit on the poorer people, living along channels in various districts, who cannot go out to till their land for want of drainage.  I have heard the various arguments put forward by Deputies here, and I think that, in the main, we should leave the <Col N="2143" /> principle of the Bill to the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary.  I am sure they will provide all the necessary safeguards for people who might be badly handled.</P>
      <P>I know small millers in various parts of the country&mdash;the Parliamentary Secretary knows them in his own constituency and I have some in mine&mdash; and, if there is not a certain amount of drainage done there, it may hurt these millers in another way.  That may be the biggest problem this House has to face.  In any case, in regard to what Deputy Corish has said, I think this drainage scheme should be worked through the county council and not through the county manager.  In every county council there is a representative from each district and there is not a single representative who has not his own trouble.  I have been a member of a county council for more years than I should care to confess, and I know well all the troubles that members of those councils have.  They have no greater trouble than this drainage question.  I think that if the Minister accepted the advice of the general assembly here as regards the county councils he would be acting wisely.  Of course, there might be a veto by the county managers.  Deputy Corish spoke about the wage which would be payable. I hope the wage will be a little bit better than that paid on the minor relief schemes.  I think that that wage is a disgrace&mdash;and I speak as a member of the Government Party.  I hope that every member in this House will support me in that.  I am sure they agree with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gorry, speaking about engineers, said that men of ability and experience were required.  We have a large number of men in this country who are fully trained as engineers.  We have ten or 12 such men in Longford town at the moment. The services of these young men would be very much appreciated if they went abroad.  But they have remained with us.  They are in our Army and in our L.D.F.  Are we going to turn down those young men? It would, no doubt, be well to have an old and experienced man in charge <Col N="2144" /> but these young men could work under him.  I do not see why we should not avail of their services.  I have no doubt that this Drainage Bill will prove itself and that it will be the greatest boon this country has ever seen.  But I do say to the Minister that the members of the county councils have the best knowledge of drainage.  It is not because I am a member of a county council that I say that; I shall never stand as a candidate for a county council again.  The members of these councils are small farmers or labourers and they have a good knowledge of the drainage of their areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it will be agreed on all sides of the House that the question of draining the flooded lands of this country is not one of keen political controversy here.  All Parties are anxious that our drainage problem should be tackled comprehensively. There is agreement on all sides that the problem should be tackled with speed, vision and courage.  If this Bill would approach the problem from the point of view of implementing the recommendations of the Drainage Commission in a speedy manner, I think it would have a warm welcome in the House.  But the opening speech of the Parliamentary Secretary and the general acceptance of the viewpoint that it will take about five years to get the machinery going and, possibly, three decades before the scheme of drainage throughout the country is completed, has enshrouded the Bill in an atmosphere of despair.</P>
      <P>It has led to the belief that nothing very speedy will be accomplished so far as this Drainage Bill is concerned. I think that the Parliamentary Secretary and his Department will get very considerable support for a policy of speeding up drainage in every possible way.  The drainage problem which we have to-day is the result of years and years of neglect.  It is because of the neglect of the past that the problem is so acute to-day.  Any delay in implementing drainage schemes throughout the country will only intensify the problem which confronts us and will necessitate the expenditure of larger sums of money in remedying the position. Generally, it will be calculated to intensify the national loss which flooding inevitably causes in this and every other country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding that I fear the Bill will be implemented in a rather slow-moving manner, I welcome it in its broad aspects.  It is highly gratifying that we are getting away from the befuddled mentality which was responsible for the local drainage schemes, <Col N="2146" /> as we have experienced them in the past.  For the first time, this Bill does make a real effort to deal with drainage as a national problem.  To that extent, the Bill will be welcomed by all Parties and all sections of opinion.  Existing arterial drainage machinery is hopelessly cumbersome. If any machinery were ever devised so as not to work satisfactorily, it was the arterial drainage legislation in operation to-day.</P>
    <P>These Acts were based on two fatal errors of thought.  The first was that they could only be implemented on the local initiation of affected persons, and, secondly, that folk who objected to being levied for the improved value of the land could torpedo completely any proposal to implement an arterial drainage scheme, no matter how beneficial it might be from the standpoint of their neighbours, the county in which they lived, or the country.  I am glad, therefore, that this Bill gets us away from the local drainage districts and the local drainage Acts, because I think these were calculated to impede any serious attempt to tackle the drainage problem of the country. I welcome the setting up of a central drainage authority.  I think that if the Board of Works, with the talent it is capable of applying, tackles this problem it should be possible, given adequate encouragement by the Government, to make a rapid impression on our drainage difficulties as they exist to-day.</P>
    <P>I think that the State is wise in accepting financial responsibility for the expenditure to be incurred in carrying out drainage schemes.  Any attempt to throw that responsibility either on the local authorities or on the potential beneficiaries in catchment areas was bound to result in failure. By breaking away, therefore, from the huckstering mentality which has characterised previous drainage Acts, and by accepting central State responsibility for financing drainage schemes, I think the State has taken a very wise step, one which later on will prove to be even wiser than it may appear now to be.</P>
    <P>I was rather surprised at Deputy Dillon asking the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="2147" /> to be draconian in his attitude towards mechanisation in regard to such drainage work as will be carried out.  I am afraid the Deputy's passion for efficiency in this respect does not do him justice.  I regard drainage as a type of work which will provide considerable employment for our people in the rural areas where employment is scarce, and where it may become much scarcer after the war.  If we have a vast drainage problem to deal with we ought to utilise our idle man-power for its solution in the different areas.  It might, perhaps, from a financial point of view be more efficient if these drainage schemes were highly mechanised. Frankly, I have no use for a concept of life in which we should buy elaborate machinery from other countries and utilise it for drainage schemes, while at the same time our local unemployed people were seeking out the home assistance officer or were travelling to the labour exchanges looking for the employment which they could not get, and all because of our passion for highly mechanised schemes of employment in rural areas on drainage schemes.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the proposals contained in this Bill will provide a fruitful source of employment in the rural areas.  I hope that aspect of the matter will be kept in mind by the Department responsible for its administration. If we are going to have any really satisfactory drainage scheme, and not constant cycles of drainage schemes with long periods of quiescence from the point of view of activity, I think we had better link drainage with afforestation.  I have seen drainage schemes carried out in certain countries in Europe.  The one thing about them that struck me was the manner in which the reclaimed land was utilised after it had been drained. Those countries recognised, apparently, that afforestation goes hand-in-hand with a satisfactory scheme of drainage because the land drained is usually low-lying land.  It is often below sea level.  One of the best methods of using it after draining it is to reclaim and plant it.  In that way you obviate future flooding, because <Col N="2148" /> reclaimed land, which is planted with trees, is less subject to flooding than land which is merely reclaimed and left there.  The flood water drains in on it, and usually the bad condition of the reclaimed soil is such that it is not capable of dispersing the surface water underneath.</P>
    <P>I suggest, therefore, to the Parliamentary Secretary that the utilisation of reclaimed land for afforestation purposes ought to be examined from the standpoint of obviating the necessity of having to go back again to drain land on which a considerable amount of money may have been spent in the early stages.  I think that drainage, apart from the utilitarian value of it, is a means of improving land and increasing the fertility of the soil.  I think also that it has a very considerable psychological benefit from the standpoint of our people.  I do not think there is anything more despairing for people who live in rural areas than to be subject to constant flooding for almost six months of the year.  During that period they are looking on flooded land, flooded roadways and have to traverse flooded boreens.  They are surrounded by that dreariness and bleakness which goes hand-in-hand with constant flooding.  I think that probably the greatest barrier to progress is the flooded condition of land. Very often when you try to encourage people in those areas to engage in certain kinds of activity on their land they say to you: &ldquo;Ah, what is the use; the land is of no use; it is always flooded&rdquo; Inevitably, the flooded condition of those lands has a corroding influence on the mentality of the people who live in these areas.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I welcome the Bill from the standpoint that it breaks new ground.  It is calculated to give us a national drainage board and, if implemented with efficiency and with a desire to bring this problem of drainage to a satisfactory conclusion within a measurable distance of time, will enrich the national estate by improving our lands and improving our lives.  At the same time it will provide our people in the rural areas with a fruitful source of employment.  There is one point I would like to emphasise, <Col N="2149" /> and it is this, that the Parliamentary Secretary, instead of being satisfied with the mentality to spread this work over 30 years should see that an effort is made to implement the scheme of the Bill with the utmost expedition. Once having embarked upon a national scheme of drainage all the efforts of the central drainage authority ought to be concentrated on pushing the work ahead as vigorously as possible, recognising that the completion of that work will mean a better life, better land and better prospects of employment in those rural areas where drainage schemes must be undertaken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on having introduced this Bill.  I noticed a welcome departure in his introductory speech from that of other Ministers bringing forward new legislation.  He invited suggestions from Deputies, and said that he would be prepared to accept improvements which they suggested. One important aspect of the Bill is that it proposes to deal with submerged land.  A good deal of employment could be given in that direction. The Bill in its present form is going to impose some heavy burdens on the ratepayers.  I appreciate the Government's difficulty in fixing the area of charge for the works that may be undertaken.  The proposal to levy a county-at-large charge is going to inflict a heavy burden on people with accommodation land in urban areas. They may have ten or 12 acres on which they keep cows for the purpose of supplying the townspeople with milk.  The owners of this land, unlike land occupiers in the rural areas, do not obtain any relief from the agricultural grant.  They have to pay both urban and county rates.  Therefore, if the extra burden foreshadowed in this Bill is going to be imposed on them, it will be more than many of them will be able to bear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to make some effort, perhaps on the Committee Stage, to exempt the owners of land in urban areas&mdash; there is only a small number&mdash;from the county-at-large charge.  I agree with <Col N="2150" /> other Deputies as to the desirability of a central authority.  The question of maintenance is an important one.  In the case of our main roads, there are grants of 40 and 50 per cent. given for maintenance purposes, and I think in the matter of drainage there should be some encouragement given to our local authorities.  At the moment, with the county manager system operating, the position is somewhat different to what we were accustomed in the past.  At the same time, I think there should be some inducement offered to county councils.  We should encourage them to strike a rate for maintenance purposes and in that connection I suggest that there should be a contribution somewhat similar to that given in respect of roads.  That might induce the councils to agree to take over portion of the maintenance.  I think there should be some consultation with the county councils on this subject.  When the demand for maintenance comes up, they will be asked to strike a rate and I think it would be well to consult them, on the matter beforehand. Unless you give them some inducement, I can foresee that when the demand for maintenance comes you will meet with considerable opposition.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate it was stated that there will be no control in this House over the expenditure on the drainage scheme.  It will be necessary each year for the Government to introduce an Estimate, for £250,000 or whatever the amount may be, and there is nothing to stop a debate on the question of drainage and Deputies, if they are not satisfied with the amount of money proposed to be expended, will have every opportunity of asking the Government to increase the amount, if they consider there is room for further employment.</P>
    <P>On the question of wages I suggest that, in order to get the co-operation of all Parties, and in order to make this national drainage scheme a success, we should have a consultation with every trade union, with the people catering for organised workers in the drainage districts.  In that way we can reach agreement as to a reasonable <Col N="2151" /> rate of wages.  I believe if the Parliamentary Secretary adopts these suggestions there will be no disputes, he will have the co-operation of all sections of the community, and he will be able to provide in each drainage area employment just at the time we require that employment, and we will be in a position to give reasonable wages to the men who will carry out the work.</P>

      <P>It is with great diffidence, as a new Deputy, I address myself to a Bill of such dimensions as the Arterial Drainage Bill, which runs into 40 pages, contains 57 sections and which has been already responsible for a debate covering 100 columns of the Official Report.  I have no desire to delay the House with any lengthy contribution to the debate.  I fear if I did attempt to delay the House the Parliamentary Secretary might carry out his threat to flood County Louth, and that would be very disastrous for my constituents.  The only spark of hope I see amidst the gloom that surrounds the observations of many Deputies here is that an Ulsterman has charge of the Bill and, if there are any people in the country who have a reputation for getting things done, even in their own dour way, they are the men of the North.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will utilise his energy, enthusiasm and skill in implementing this Bill in the most rapid manner possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies who have spoken&mdash;I think Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney was one of them&mdash;have asked for co-ordination between the Electricity Supply Board and the board which will be in charge of arterial drainage.  I think it is absolutely essential, owing to the importance of hydro-electric undertakings, that these two schemes should be related.  I agree with what Deputy Norton suggested, that we should also seek for the co-ordination of the Department of Lands in a scheme such as this.  It is strange, to my mind, that the Department of Lands is ignored in a Bill dealing with arterial drainage. Undoubtedly, they should have something to say in the matter, particularly <Col N="2152" /> having regard to the relationship between afforestation and drainage.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to detain the House long on the subject of afforestation, because it is an exceedingly large subject, one on which much has already been said.  But, when you consider this question as a whole, when you consider the principle, you ask yourself why there is a necessity in such a fertile land as ours for such a scheme of drainage as is adumbrated in this Bill. It would appear to me, as a simple layman, not as a technician, that there has been some upset in the balance of nature.  I do not think the existing situation is natural.  I think it has been brought about by man; it is a legacy of the past; it has a historical origin, and it might be as well that I should refer to it now.</P>
    <P>I suggest that there is not only an economic cause for the need of drainage in this country, but there is also a political cause.  Up to the end of the 17th century this country was very largely wooded.  We were then, of course, a subject nation, and the powers that existed then were acting in every possible way detrimentally to the interests of our people.  The landed aristocracy did not look after the economic interest of the country.  They hewed down the trees, denuded vast tracts, and as a result we have to-day this need of drainage.  They were supported in their actions by the political powers, because those woodlands were the natural resort and refuge of the Rapparees and the political rebels of the day.  There was a double purpose served&mdash;cutting down the trees and leaving our mountain-sides bare.</P>
    <P>The result was that in the catchment areas, with which we have now to deal, there are no trees to gather a large percentage of the falling rain and absorb it, nor is the soil left in the condition which would enable it to retain a great percentage of rainwater. The result is that there is a very large overflow in many places. Now that we are legislating for the benefit of the people, we should endeavour to remedy some of the ill effects of that policy.  I would strongly urge the Parliamentary Secretary to consider the advisability <Col N="2153" /> of securing the co-ordination of the Department of Lands and to couple their afforestation plans with whatever drainage scheme is formulated.</P>
    <P>While I am in favour of local initiative, and criticise the Government for taking too much power in local affairs, in a matter of national and widespread importance I think, on the whole, there should be central direction.  In this respect, having read through many of the debates, I cannot see a reason for the differentiation between central control in regard to the initiation of schemes, and the local payment of maintenance charges.  We might have made a good job of this while we were at it. While I should like to hear the argument to the contrary, I cannot reconcile any good case being made for making maintenance charges a local one.  It would be better to have that a widespread charge and, in that way, avoid a dispute as well as agitation that will probably arise owing to the different interests involved, and the degree that localities consider they have benefited by this measure.  In the same way there will be a conflict of principle between local autonomy and central control that can be investigated on other stages.  One matter to which I want to direct attention will cause discussion.  It is concerned with the section dealing with bridges. Section 49 gives the commissioners control over any existing bridges and over water courses.  It is difficult to see why they wish to have such power over watercourses.  I imagine their concern would be about watercourses relating to drainage schemes existing or pending.  They take power to direct the authorities how they should carry out construction work or alterations on watercourses.  It would appear as if they seek too much power there, by wishing to have too much control over industrial companies, railways and local bodies.  I cannot understand what concern it is to the Drainage Board how a canal bridge in Dublin is to be reconstructed or altered.</P>
    <P>In regard to the method of announcing proposals Deputy Corish mentioned defects regarding notification to do certain work on the part of the commissioners. <Col N="2154" /> That is to be done in such a way that it may affect smallholders detrimentally.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to look into the matter again, and to see to it that notification of intention to do certain works should be published in the local Press and read by smallholders who may be adversely affected.  That should not be overlooked.</P>
    <P>I wish to associate myself with the remarks of other Deputies regarding the wages to be paid.  It is a serious defect not to mention in this Bill that standard trade union wages will be paid.  There should be inserted in it what is known as the fair wages clause. Omission of that provision will react very detrimentally on the prospects of those who will be employed.  The financial provisions have been referred to by other speakers.  It is not necessary to say any more than to point out that there are no definite financial regulations.  This Bill is just an attempt to show how work could be done, and speculation on the financial provisions would be beside the point. We could make a good case concerning the provision of national credit for such work, but I do not think it could be done by piecemeal methods.  It could not be applied to drainage alone, but applied nationally and would require a complete review of our whole financial and economic philosophy. Until that day comes the object of this measure will fail in its final effects, as it will not produce the good that could be got out of it if we had men of good intentions to put them into effect.</P>

      <P>This has been a fairly protracted discussion, and the number of Deputies who participated in it can be taken as a fair indication of the importance of this problem of drainage.  I listened carefully to all the points made by the different speakers and I took a fairly elaborate note of them.  Some were of a critical nature, and others were directed towards obtaining further information concerning certain provisions in this measure.  I do not propose to cover all these points now, but I shall try to select those to which the <Col N="2155" /> greater number of Deputies referred.</P>
      <P>One criticism I would not mind if it had been offered by inexperienced members of this House, but it came from members with long experience here.  They complained that these were merely machinery proposals.  This Bill was called a machinery measure, an enabling measure, and was referred to as a promise to drain land.  That is the very thing we want to do.  This measure was introduced because the machinery that was in existence was inadequate for the task.  The Act under which we were operating for a number of years was found to be insufficient, and it was because of that fact that the Drainage Commission was set up.  It was as a result of their inquiries, investigations and report, that this measure, which is, in fact, a machinery and an enabling measure was introduced.  The criticism was carried a stage further by experienced Deputies who said that there were no financial provisions and nothing to indicate that, from the financial point of view, the Government is committing itself to anything.  I think that criticism is unfair and misleading, for the very good reason that when the Government set up a commission to deal with a problem of this kind, when that commission reports, and when the Government, having carefully examined, not only the majority but the minority reports, deliberately commits itself to acceptance of the main outlines, and follows that commitment by the introduction of these proposals, and when the Minister for Finance, in the name of the Government, takes those steps and conveys those very positive indications to the public, there can hardly be any question as to the manner in which money to enable the drainage authority to give effect to the provisions of this Bill will be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am on that point I should like to say that the manner in which the finances of this measure were to be provided should have been clear to Deputies because that is covered by Section 3 of the Bill.  There has been projected into this discussion the suggestion that because the Minister for Finance controls the purse and provides <Col N="2156" /> cash, not only for the drainage authority but for all other Departments, he will not be anxious when schemes are submitted to him for his sanction by the drainage authority, because of the fact that there might be a strain on the public purse, to afford the necessary sanction.  The further suggestion was made that when this measure receives the approval, in its present or in an amended form, of this House, the House will have lost all control and that we will have lost all initiative.  When I think of the number of hours that have been spent, and wisely spent on the Second Reading debate, indicating as I said at the outset the importance of this problem of drainage, anyone can ask himself and find for himself the answer: how could any Minister for Finance, even if he had the desire, which is something that I am not prepared to admit, resist the demands that will be made in this House, having regard to the fact that the machinery for doing the job will be at hand?  How could he resist the demands of the House to provide all the necessary money to enable that machinery to be fully operated?</P>
    <P>To those then who criticise these proposals because of the fact that there is not, as they claim, any indication of the Government's commitments from the financial point of view, to those who criticise the proposal from the point of view that we are losing control and initiative and handing these over to the drainage authority, I would say that the method by which it is proposed to provide the money in Section 3 of the Bill gives to this House a control that this House should be very glad to get.  It may be suggested, and it has been suggested, that the sums that would be required when the drainage authority has set up its organisation would be fairly large in any one year.  In last year's Estimates for the Office of Public Works, £250,000 was provided for the reconditioning and the improvement of schools and the building of new schools.  I think I am correct in saying that if the circumstances of the times permitted and if materials were available, the Minister for Finance&mdash;anxious and all as he would naturally be to protect the <Col N="2157" /> public finances&mdash;would be very glad indeed to provide a much larger sum for that very deserving and desirable work.</P>
    <P>I say that if a sum of the magnitude of £250,000 was provided last year and almost £250,000 the year previously, for works such as school building and school repairs&mdash;work which is in itself no doubt important&mdash;then it is certainly unreasonable to think, having regard to the public demand that has been displayed in this House for the last couple of weeks in relation to the problem of drainage, that the Minister for Finance, whoever he might be, would have any qualms about providing £250,000 for that work, or even more, if it were possible to set up an organisation that would be able to spend that sum.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to the matter of the rate of progress to be made, and they seemed to have the impression that there was something vague in what I said.  I have not since then read the report of my statement and I do not know how it may have read, but I know what I should have said, whether I said it or not.  I did not commit the Board of Works, the central drainage authority, myself, the Minister, or the Government to expend £250,000 per annum.  I merely gave to the House what was given to us in the report to which I have referred.  There are many people interested in this drainage problem.  I am personally as interested in it as any Deputy in this House.  Apart altogether from the fact that I happen to be at the moment in the Office of Public Works and that, as a person charged with responsibility, I will try to discharge it to the best of my ability, I have an interest in this matter of drainage at least equal to that of any other Deputy from any part of the country, and I am anxious as a Deputy, apart altogether from the responsibilities to which I have referred, to see this matter of drainage being tackled in the most energetic manner.  But, there is no use in going out to the country and allowing a feeling to be created and to get abroad that something can be done which you know cannot be done.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2158" /> I believe that in a matter of this kind the wisest and best course for a public man to pursue, especially a person who has well, a limited amount of responsibility, is to ensure, if possible, that he will in performance exceed that which he promises.  No Deputy will be more pleased than I if, with the passage of time, we find ourselves in a position to reach a much greater speed than has been indicated as possible in the report of the commission.</P>
    <P>I had another purpose&mdash;and I tried to make that clear also&mdash;in giving that warning, as I intended it to be, to the House.  As a person with experience equal to that of most lay people, I knew that many of these flooded areas were suffering largely because of the amount of neglect that had resulted from the failure of the authorities responsible to maintain them in a proper condition.  And, knowing that on the appointed day these boards and trustees would be abolished, and knowing that as and from that day these areas would be transferred to local authorities for maintenance, I was anxious to secure the support of all those Deputies in this House who are members of local authorities, so as to press those local authorities for a much higher degree and much higher rate of maintenance than had prevailed for a number of years.  I deliberately set out to give the House and the country an idea of the enormity of this programme of work.  No matter how energetically or expeditiously it is tackled, the time factor is there and cannot be got over. It was because I realised that that I gave that warning, in the hope that it would result in securing on the part of these local authorities a much higher degree of maintenance than had obtained when these drainage districts were being looked after by the drainage boards and trustees.</P>
    <P>During the course of this discussion I was asked a number of questions, such as, what is an arterial drain. I was asked also to give an idea of what would be the cost per acre of all lands that would be improved under these proposals.  I have told the House already that, like most members of the House, I am a lay <Col N="2159" /> person.  The Drainage Commission was composed of engineering experts of the Board of Works, experienced and competent county surveyors and men who were competent farmers and, taking them all in all, they were a body of men and women who, if a question of that kind could be answered, would be likely to produce an answer.</P>
    <P>They, apparently, were not able to define an arterial drain and, if Deputies look at the report, they will see that they said they had given some thought to it but that in a matter of that kind it would have to be left to the judgment of the engineer who was in charge of the preparation of the proposed scheme for the catchment area.  The general approach to the question of what is an arterial drain and as to how far drainage should be carried out is that the object of a drainage scheme is to carry out such works as will enable all the landowners in the drainage district to make contacts with these main rivers.  That is as near as you will get to a definition of what is an arterial drain&mdash;a question that I was asked by many Deputies.</P>
    <P>On this matter of what it would cost per acre, the same difficulty arises.  A Parliamentary Question was addressed to the Minister for Finance to-day seeking information as to a more up-to-date estimate of what the drainage proposals envisaged in this Bill would cost, having regard to a number of factors that have entered into the situation since the report was prepared. Again, if the report of the commission is carefully read, it will be seen that there is nothing firm about the figure given there by the commission. They went out of their way to protect themselves in their estimates as to cost and as to the amount of land that was likely to be relieved as a result of the expenditure of that sum of money.</P>
    <P>Although there is nothing positive about the figures, to show the House how correct they were in taking that attitude, I will refer to the Brosna area which is at the moment being surveyed. <Col N="2160" /> The Minister for Finance was to-day asked a question in that connection, and the reply was that survey work has been proceeding for the last 12 months in the Brosna catchment area and that some 600 miles of rivers had been surveyed, affecting in all 300,000 acres.  When our engineers went down there, the area which was estimated to benefit as a result of the drainage scheme on the Brosna was somewhere in the neighbourhood of 30,000 acres, and, while I cannot give any firm figure as a result of the investigations and the survey work done there, I can say that in all probability that acreage will prove to be in the neighbourhood of 40,000 when the scheme is carried out.</P>
    <P>It would not then be either feasible or wise that a meticulous survey of the whole country should take place, having regard to the fact that when that survey, which would extend over a great number of years, had been completed, there would not be the organisation necessary to tackle the work and that by the time the end of the work had been reached, some of the reports, some of the surveys would be out-of-date and it would be necessary to have them all done anew.</P>

      <P>I have not set myself any such problem.  That is not how I arrive at the figure of 40,000 acres, of course.  Some members of the Labour Party and, I think, one member of this Party also, referred to one matter with which I should like to deal, that is, the insertion somewhere and somehow in these proposals of a fair wages clause.  I do not know what they meant by that.  I will tell the House what I think about it.  Just as I should like to see drainage undertaken so, too, would I like to see every man in this country getting a living wage, just as well as Deputy O'Leary and Deputy Carter, but soft talk about living wages does not get anybody anywhere.</P>

      <P>Now let me deal with <Col N="2161" /> this matter and the Deputy can deal with me if and when his opportunity comes along.  There is one thing which I cannot, and never could, understand about these demands for certain standards of wages on arterial drainage works.  I never could understand how you could justify paying to an unskilled labourer a higher wage for reclaiming land so as to put it into production than is paid on land which is already fertile to a worker who is engaged in producing the things we eat, the things which keep soul and body together.  I can see that when you bring workers together, when you group them together, whether on bogs or on arterial drainage schemes, you will always give an opportunity to somebody to agitate and organise, but if any man can show me how you can justify paying a higher rate of wages for trying to bring land into a condition in which it can be used for the production of food than you can pay on the uplands which are already fertile to men who are engaged for longer hours, I should like to hear him make the case.</P>

It is, of course, a grand thing; I have heard it not only in this House but at meetings of local bodies where men stand up and say: &ldquo;We will give them this and we will give them that,&rdquo; but if the Agricultural Wages Board decides that agriculture is in a sufficiently prosperous condition to enable it to pay £3 per week then I certainly say that unskilled men employed on drainage are entitled to that wage, and, as the agricultural <Col N="2162" /> wage goes up, I will admit that men employed in the reclaiming of land in this manner are entitled to a similar wage: but it is nonsense to suggest that a higher rate of wage should be paid for the reclamation of land which perhaps can never become as fertile as the land on which only the standard rate of £2 per week is now being paid.</P>

If, as a result of their examination tomorrow, they find that agriculture can afford to pay a higher rate of wages than the present rate, well and good. If you are trying to convince me that it is sound economics to pay a higher rate of wages for trying to reclaim rather doubtful land than can be paid on the fertile lands of this country in the production of food, etc., you will never succeed in convincing me that that policy could be sensibly pursued.</P>
