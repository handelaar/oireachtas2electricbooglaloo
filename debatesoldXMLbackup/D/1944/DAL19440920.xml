      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he will state what representations, if any, have been made by other Governments that refugees or wounded from war zones should be received in this State, and if he will indicate the nature of the proposals and the extent to which they have been agreed to.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to Section 1 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1923, and Section 4 of the Superannuation Act, 1936.  He will observe from these sections that the decisive date in determining the claims to establishment of civil servants of Dáil Eireann is that of the Truce, that is 11th July, 1921.  I am not aware that any pre-Truce Dáil civil servant who fulfilled the statutory requirements (including requirements under the Civil Service Regulation Acts, 1924 and 1926) is serving in an unestablished capacity.</P>

      <P>The pensions of employees of local authority electricity undertakings who were transferred to the Electricity Supply Board when those undertakings were acquired by the board, fall into two categories:&mdash; (1) those which were based on a &ldquo;flat&rdquo; or fixed salary, and (2) those which consist of two elements, namely, (a) a <Col N="1655" /> fixed basic sum supplemented by (b) a bonus based on the cost-of-living index figure.  In the first-mentioned case the pensions are not variable and in the latter case the amount of the bonus payable has been stabilised by the Emergency Powers (No. 244) Order, 1942, at the index figure applicable before the 1st January, 1943.</P>

      <P>The Corporation of Dublin as sanitary authority was responsible for the investigation of this outbreak.

During his investigations it was ascertained that butter, cornflour and milk were mixed and boiled and a raw egg subsequently added.

      <P>The number of persons who are subject to permanent tithe rent-charges and perpetuity rents and mortgages on landed property comprised under the head of Church Temporalities in Ireland is about 4,800 and the present annual rent is approximately £12,000. In addition there is a terminable revenue from tithe annuities and land annuities payable to the Church Temporalities Fund to the amount of approximately £5,000 per annum, payable by about 800 persons.  The accounts of the Land Commission in respect of Church Temporalities in Ireland, showing particulars of receipts and expenditure, are published annually and presented to the Oireachtas.  The income of the Church Temporalities Fund is applied to meet the remaining statutory payments charged upon it and appropriated to State administrative and educational purposes.</P>
      <P>The reason for the collection by the Land Commission of tithe rents and similar charges on landed property in this country is that they are now similar to State revenue and have no religious significance whatever, constituting a purely secular charge on the lands to which they are appurtenant. As such, the payers thereof have been accorded the benefits provided for in Section 18 of the Land Act, 1933, on lines similar to the reductions given to payers of land purchase annuities.</P>

      <P>I desire as a matter of privilege, with your permission, to raise a question arising from a reference made last evening during the Transport Bill debate by the Minister for Industry and Commerce which has been held by many to be of an offensive character and not in keeping with the dignity of debates in this House.  Is the word objected to to continue to be used as a Parliamentary expression in the House and will other Deputies be entitled to use it at their discretion or will it continue to be a Ministerial monopoly?

We wound up a debate last night, in which we were dealing with rather important matters, with the Minister for Industry and Commerce calling Deputy Norton a &ldquo;sucker&rdquo; and calling Deputy McGilligan a &ldquo;perjurer.&rdquo;  I think the matter cannot stand at that.</P>

      <P>A certain word was used with reference to Deputy Norton which, I understand, in America has one signification, but quite a different one here.  I am not <Col N="1671" /> sure as to the sense it was used by the Minister, but, presumably, in the American sense.  'Twere better it were not used in any sense.  As regards the exchange of interruptions between the Minister and Deputy McGilligan, they were both at fault.  Deputy McGilligan's interruption was reprehensible; the Minister's, much more so.  It is really too bad if the time of the House is to be wasted in getting a perfunctory &ldquo;I withdraw&rdquo; from present or former occupants of front benches.

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>On Section 8, Sir, last night we were dealing with the incorporation of the company under this section.  We expressed our own views and stated our own position with regard to the financial structure of the company and the peculiar type of control set up under a board of directors, and the future financial success of the company has been very seriously questioned by a number of Deputies in this House.  The Minister gave an assurance to the House that he had given very serious consideration to this aspect of the proposals and that he could satisfy the House that it would be possible, under this new reconstruction and reorganisation of the Transport Company, to make that company a financial success.  I think that there are many Deputies in the House who are not convinced, so far as that is concerned, and I do not think the Minister has made any serious effort to convince Deputies that the company can be made a financial success, from our point of view, because we are taking into account not merely the financial success of the company itself, but its relation to industry and, particularly, to agricultural industry, in the country, and the sort of service that we expect a national transport company to give to our primary industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our chief contention and alarm about this is the value of the old stock and the value of the substituted stock&mdash;the fact that the Minister proposes to give new stock on a £ per £ basis at par; new stock of a completely different type, equal in face value to the old stock, at a lower rate of income, it is true, or a lower rate of interest.  That, however, is of little or <Col N="1673" /> no material value because the stock of the new company carries a State guarantee so far as the liability for capital and capital repayment is concerned, and the State now bears the responsibility of footing the bill for that.  The Minister suggested that, notwithstanding the fact that in his detailed review of the condition of the company on the Second Reading of this Bill, emphasising the condition of the wasted physical assets and the obsolete state of the company's property at the present time, it is absolutely unreasonable to suggest that the value of the old stock should be taken at stock market quotations, and that a value of £4,500,000 for the old stock would be altogether undervaluing it.  He went on to say that because some people were prepared to sell at a low price in a depressed period, it does not follow that all the shareholders were prepared to sell at that price.  In any case, he made no real defence to the allegations that were made as to the obsolescent state of the company's property before he found it necessary to put in a manager under the direct control of the Government.</P>
    <P>I think there is another way of looking at this question of the value of the old stock, and it is this: that under the old control and the old ownership and management we tried to bolster up and preserve the Great Southern Railways Company for many years by simply eliminating the normal, healthy competition that had been there.  But for Government intervention the company would not be there at all, and just immediately before the war situation was precipitated upon us, so far as the company was concerned it had arrived at a financial crisis.  As a result of that, the Minister had to put in a manager, in the person of Mr. Reynolds, and of course he has tried to clap himself and Mr. Reynolds on the back by saying that since the introduction of Mr. Reynolds as manager the company has achieved wonderful results in the way of earning capacity and all that sort of thing&mdash;pointing to the earnings of the company last year, and so on&mdash;but of course it must be remembered that that occurred in an emergency situation.  In normal times, <Col N="1674" /> it would not be so.  In these abnormal times, of course, the company did make earnings because there was no other means of transport for either passengers or goods, and the company charged what they liked.  The Minister tries to show that there was no appreciation in the cost of transport. Will he tell the House that there was no appreciation in the charges for the carriage of passengers or of goods? Not merely were the public fleeced on the railway charges alone, but where there was delivery at the other end by lorry into an individual store, the charge was multiplied three and fourfold. The individual concerned had no choice; he was glad to get the goods anyway, and he passed on the extra charges to the consumer.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that this company is going to be a financial success. Examining the whole organisation as it stands, I have no doubt that the Minister is right, but it has been seriously questioned by Deputies, and particularly by Deputy Norton, whether we are going to have a postmortem over this company again in a few years' time.  I can say to Deputy Norton that it will be a financial success if you ignore the burdens that industry, and particularly our agricultural industry, will be faced with.  The Minister, in the machinery that he proposes here and which he asks the House to approve of, has ensured that the company will be a financial success. Take one example.  Take the case of the Railway Tribunal, whose principal function was to fix rates of charges. That was an independent body, giving judicial decision on the evidence submitted to it.  Now this whole organisation is centred around the Minister.  We have heard a lot of talk about a dictator, but so far as I can see, the dictator is the Minister himself. He can kick out the manager any time he likes.  He has taken power to fix charges himself, and if he is responsible for the success of the company and for the fulfilling of its financial commitments to the State, he is going to ensure, while he is in office at any rate, that the charges and the conditions for the carriage of goods will be such that they will result in financial <Col N="1675" /> success so far as the company is concerned.</P>
    <P>That is an aspect of the situation about which I am alarmed.  We have precedents for it in the past.  The Minister has a record of setting up monopoly institutions in this country. He has left the country at the mercy of these monopolies and permitted them to produce goods, sometimes in a very inefficient way, and to charge what they liked for them.  Are we going to have that principle applied to the transport organisation in this country in future and have at the head of it, in an absolutely dictatorial position, a Minister who feels himself proud of the responsibility of commiting the country to a guarantee on £20,000,000, building around the transport organisations in which he has these dictatorial powers rates and charges which he will be in a position to influence?  I think that that is not a position in which a politician should be put at all.  We should not place in his hands powers of that sort to make a decision on rates for the carriage of commodities.  Surely it is a body set apart from the Minister that ought to make decisions of that sort. However there is another section in the Bill dealing with that matter and we shall then get an opportunity of discussing it.</P>
    <P>Our chief alarm arises from the fact that the Minister has not satisfied us that the valuation on a par basis of the old capital and the wasting assets of the company which is now going to be reorganised is justified.  The holders of that stock are going to get on a par basis capital carrying a full State guarantee.  There is no use talking about the difference between 3 and 4 per cent.  All that stock carries a full State guarantee.  I suggest that the Minister having created that situation is going to set himself up in a position in which he can determine freight charges so that he can ensure, what he contends, will be the financial success of this company.  I suggest it can be a success only because it will throw a very big and almost impossible burden on industry and particularly on agriculture.  These <Col N="1676" /> are the financial aspects of the company with which we are concerned and the Minister has not attempted to convince Deputies that their fears are unfounded.  He has certainly given us no information that would help us to make up our minds that there is some hope of success and at the same time some hope of securing what he describes as cheap and efficient transport, so far as this company is concerned. He quotes the example of the Dublin Transport Company but it became a success only when competition was eliminated and passenger rates went up.  It became a success when a monopoly organisation was established.</P>
    <P>Coming to the constitution of the board of directors and bearing in mind the description that the Minister gave the House&mdash;the ignominious failure of the old directors to do their job and the fact that they were responsible to a very large extent for the complete financial collapse of the Great Southern Railways Company&mdash; one would expect that, having judged them in that manner, the Minister certainly would not trust them any further in the matter of control, so far as the new company was concerned.  I do not think they have got very many new powers in the company, but the Minister described from the fullness of his own experience how this organisation should be controlled.  First of all, he said that civil servants were not the proper people to place in control of such an organisation; they had no financial interest, they were dependent for re-nomination on the Minister, and not having any financial interest, they were not the best type to ensure the financial success of the undertaking. Further, he said that the directors elected by the common stockholders would have that financial interest that would stimulate their activity and ensure that they would be active in making the company a financial success.  Of course a peculiar construction of the company is the fact that the debenture stock will be redeemed.  The final position will be that the Transport Company will be owned by a group of common stockholders. That is an extraordinary <Col N="1677" /> position so far as a company of this sort is concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister apparently satisfied himself from his 12 years' experience that directors elected by the shareholders would be more useful and more effective to ensure financial success. He made no attempt to explain how they can exercise any control whatever, taking into account the peculiar constitution of the board and the extraordinarily strong position in which the chairman is being placed.  He is a quorum in himself.  The board can make no decision without his concurrence. The board cannot form a quorum or do any business when he is not present and whatever decisions are made are certainly decisions of the chairman.  Taking all these aspects of the case into account, we feel that the House is entitled to be very dissatisfied with the Minister's attempt to defend his proposal.  I submit that we are entitled to a more detailed explanation from the Minister, a more convincing effort on his part to satisfy this House that we should commit the people of the country to this very heavy financial undertaking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was endeavouring last night to show that the main burden of complaint against the Bill, and particularly against this section, is the fact that by giving a State guarantee of 3 per cent. per annum for redeemable stock until redemption, the Minister had provided a scale of compensation for the debenture holders in this company which was extravagant and which was unjustified by any reference either to the stock exchange quotations or to the assets of the company, as acknowledged by the chairman of the company and as ascertained by the tribunal which was set up in 1939, to investigate the whole question of transport in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nothing that the Minister, or anybody else, has said to the contrary would convince me that we are not tying up the public of this country to guarantee a rate of interest and a stock valuation to these debenture holders which is thoroughly unjustified by whatever assets they are putting into what has been described as this transport pool.  If the Minister's story <Col N="1678" /> of the financial resurrection of the railways, as indicated by his attempt to justify these compensation provisions last night, has even a grain of truth in it, there should not be another bankruptcy in this country.  The Bankruptcy Court could be closed down entirely; nobody could be compelled to go into compulsory liquidation: nobody need ever be in doubt so far as the Companies Acts are concerned of their ability to pay their way in future because the railway company has provided a simple recipe for every known financial difficulty that a company can possibly encounter.  All you have to do, if you are running a company which has wasting assets, one that has seriously depleted stocks and no money to buy coal or provide for renewals or repairs, is to get hold of a Minister and get him to put in a chairman.  The chairman then holds an annual meeting of the shareholders to denounce the company as being in a financially dilapidated condition.  The moment you do that you then play the bogeyman to all the shareholders who have been carrying the baby for years.  You frighten those people into getting rid of their stock.  Having got them to throw their stock on the market the next thing is to get someone to buy the stock&mdash;in golf clubs or elsewhere&mdash; and then all the financial wiseacres will get to work.  In a short time the assets and activities which were denounced by the chairman as being so unprofitable suddenly become valuable. The assets and the activities of the depleted stock which were down to zero on the stock exchange jump up very high, and immediately the company is rehabilitated financially, to such an extent that you can even get the Legislature to give the stockholders of the company twice the stock exchange value of the company's stocks five years ago, and £3,000,000 more than the stock was valued at in March of last year.  It seems a very simple remedy.</P>
    <P>These are the methods which have been blatantly and nakedly attempted in our financial rehabilitation of the Great Southern Railways Company.  I do not believe there is any rehabilitation there at all.  I believe this is a dud company which is giving its stock <Col N="1679" /> a value it has not got.  The best proof that the assets of the company are not worth £13,400,000 is that we are writing them down.  Let the present directors and the present chairman go out on the public market to-morrow with an advertisement offering even the redeemable stock of 4 per cent, and see how much they will get if they offer, as an appendix to their advertisement, the minority report of the Transport Tribunal of 1939.  That minority report shows beyond all doubt that by windfalls and compensation paid by the British Government in respect of damage to rolling stock on previous occasions as well as by refunds of overpaid income-tax and rates, the company managed to pay its debenture holders, but that it was only possible for the company to do that because it made no provision for renewals and repairs had been made on a scale comparable to the depreciation of the assets of the company, the company would never have been able to pay a dividend, even on its debenture stock.  It is because the company cannot get £16,000,000 or £7,000,000, as the case may be, or even 3 per cent. redeemable stock on its own name and assets, that it is necessary for the State to come in and provide, at the expense of the community, a State guarantee under which the stock is redeemed at the rate of 3 per cent. per annum, so that the capital invested in the redeemable stock can never deteriorate. At the very worst, the debenture holders will get 3 per cent. per annum always, with the chance that there may be a prospect of selling the stock at a profit on the exchange if there is any unusual change in the money markets here.</P>
    <P>I want to know why the ordinary citizens of the country should have their credit pledged to guarantee 3 per cent. per annum on the debenture stock when, in fact, we are writing that stock up to a value that it has not got now, and that it is not likely to have, although the management of the railway company is a private capitalist monopoly.  I object to the financial provisions of this Bill and to <Col N="1680" /> the effort to copper-fasten them in Section 8.  I think that the valuation that we are putting on the stock of the Great Southern Railways Company especially is extravagant and is not justified by anything that we have heard from the Minister or from the Transport Tribunal which reported in 1939.  I venture to say that, having regard to the chairman's own view of the assets of the company, and the Minister's view when he described the position in May last, no tribunal, even one disposed to be generous to the shareholders, would possibly put on the assets of this company the valuation which we are putting on them in this Bill.  I think the Minister ought to recognise, since there has been so much complaint about the over-valuation of the stock of the company, that he should pause and consider at this stage, that he should get expert advice as to whether he was not in fact pledging the public credit for an asset which is not worth what it is claimed to be in this Bill, and whether he is not pledging the public credit on behalf of an undertaking which will be run as a purely private monopoly.  Whether it is run efficiently or inefficiently, it will carry for all time, so far as the debenture stock is concerned, a guarantee at the people's expense&mdash;a dividend of 3 per cent. per annum.  Even when the stock itself is ultimately redeemed&mdash;if that position is reached and that, apparently, is the desideratum of the whole matter from the point of view of a judge of a good financial company&mdash;then the ordinary stockholder will walk into an asset which may be worth £20,000,000, with a stock holding of perhaps £3,500,000.  I never heard of such financial proposals.  I think it will not be long before the Minister, or his successor, will have to come to the House and confess that we have been unreasonably generous with the debenture holders.</P>

      <P>The Minister, in making a case for the retention of this section, asserted again that the financial success of the Dublin United Transport Company in particular, and of the Great Southern Railways Company <Col N="1681" /> since February, 1942, was mainly, if not altogether, due to their efficient management under the control of the present chairman-director.  I do not think that is so.  I think there is plenty of evidence to disprove that statement.  The Minister, for instance, talked at some length about the financial success of the Dublin United Transport Company and associated with that the improvement in the conditions of the workers in the company which is true.  It was not correct for the Minister to say that the fares of the Dublin United Transport Company were reduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody knows perfectly well that we have recent evidence to disprove that.  When the trams to Terenure and Dalkey were replaced by buses, the Dublin United Transport Company was allowed to increase the fares by 50 per cent.  That disproves the statement that the fares of the company were reduced while at the same time the revenue was increased and the conditions of the workers improved.  The Minister knows perfectly well that the financial success of the Great Southern Railways Company since the emergency is mainly due to the fact that traffic was fired at them, that there was not sufficient petrol to enable the road services, carried on during the pre-emergency period, to be continued during the emergency.  Is it not true that there is a priority list for the conveyance of traffic by the Great Southern Railways for some time&mdash;a priority list which, I understand, is approved by the Minister and which means that traders cannot have certain classes of traffic taken from them for conveyance by rail unless the company so decides?  That is due to the fact that they have not sufficient wagons to take by rail the traffic tendered by traders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that Deputy Hughes is somewhat misinformed when he suggests that the railway company has been bolstered up to an undue degree.  If he listened to the replies given here a couple of years ago&mdash;information on the subject was given to the House by <Col N="1682" /> the late Deputy Flinn&mdash;he would have learned that turf traffic carried by road cost from 50 to 100 per cent. more than it would have cost if carried by rail.  I do not know what the reason for that is but the Minister can give it to us and then we shall have a little more reliable information.  Why recently was a large number of wagons withdrawn by the railway company from the carriage of turf&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the same policy is pursued under the terms of this Bill, there will be very little left for the railway company to carry.  Apparently, road transport will get the preference so far as the conveyance of traffic under this Bill is concerned.  I rose not to prolong discussion on this section, but to point out to the Minister that there is no foundation whatever for the suggestion made to this House that the Dublin Transport Company was able to improve its services and, at the same time, to improve the conditions of work of its employees.  It was wrong for the Minister to state that the fares were reduced at the same time that conditions of work were being improved.  I have referred to one very recent example.  When the trams were withdrawn from the Dublin-Terenure and Dublin-Dalkey lines, the fares charged to passengers were increased by 50 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dwyer</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the debate on this section of the Bill with great interest.  One outstanding feature of the debate is that every criticism, so far, has been destructive. Not one constructive suggestion has been made up to the present, so far as I have heard.  Deputy Norton suggested that shares in the company were boosted in golf clubs.  Deputies received a report this morning which rather contradicts that suggestion.  As <Col N="1683" /> a businessman, I have endeavoured to make myself acquainted with the provisions of the Bill and with what has been done by the Minister.  The history of this company is well known to all of us.  The Minister and I have not seen eye to eye for many years, but it seems to me that there were only two alternatives open to him.  One was to set up a body like the Electricity Supply Board&mdash;in other words, to nationalise the railways&mdash;and the other was to do as is being done: to appoint Mr. Reynolds to take charge of the railways.  Mr. Reynolds has an amazing reputation as a businessman in Dublin.  I think that the Minister was quite correct in choosing Mr. Reynolds as chairman of this company, or as dictator, as he has been called.  I assume that Mr. Reynolds has had a good deal to do with the framing of this Bill.  I have very little respect for the late directors of the railway company, not from the point of view of their moral character, but in respect of their efficiency in running the railway. Mr. Reynolds has been running it for some time.  Most of the directors are heads of big businesses and have a good deal of business experience, though they have failed in the case of the railway.  Mr. Reynolds is prepared to work with them.  My own experience is that it is a very good thing to have the head of a business and a lot of &ldquo;dummy&rdquo; directors.  I am all for the &ldquo;dummy&rdquo; directors in this case.  I think that the whole transport position is in a state of transition.  The Minister assured us yesterday that we should get an opportunity in ten or 12 years to review the whole position if the present company was not successful in its work.  I do not think that it is going to be as good as the Minister believes, and I do not believe it is going to be as bad as Deputy Norton and Deputy Hughes say it will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another viewpoint as regards the value of the company's shares.  They have been valuing them on the stock exchange and, apparently, some astute &ldquo;fly-boys&rdquo;&mdash;I hope that expression is not unparliamentary&mdash; have made a lot of money recently. There are assets in the railway company <Col N="1684" /> which have not been mentioned here.  There is its monopoly.  There could not be another railway company. You could not bring in a foreign company to run another railway, though a number of traders might like to do that.  Then you have the permanent way which you can hardly value.  In the <i>Irish Times,</i> a few days ago, I noticed that the building of the Nelson Pillar cost £7,000.  What would it cost to-day?  You can hardly value the permanent way of the Great Southern Railways.  I am sure the Minister took those matters into account when he was arranging the amount the shareholders were to receive.  In addition, the railway company has 16,000 skilled workers.  Those three things and the fact that the people put their money into the undertaking when it was being established do make the railway company an amazing asset.  It would be almost impossible to get a valuation of the railway company.  The stock exchange valuation is a very poor one. The Minister may have been too generous but, from another standpoint, he may not have been generous enough. I shall vote for the Bill and support it as far as possible.  I do not know of any alternative to the appointment of Mr. Reynolds at present and I think he should get the freest hand possible in selecting his board.  It should create a great feeling of confidence in us that we shall get a chance to discuss the whole position again.  If we cannot be constructive, we should not be merely destructive.</P>

      <P>I should like to say my last word on this section, although it is very hard to say the last word as the section covers so many aspects of the subject.  When we were discussing the section last night, we were trying to find out why the Minister selected those different classes of people who are to be the directors of the company.  We saw that his idea with regard to that shifted.  From the information available up to this, and the newspaper reports of the evidence given at the stocks tribunal, I understood that the Minister's original idea was to provide the company with a capital of <Col N="1685" /> £10,000,000, and that it was going to buy out the Great Southern Railways Company.  Apparently the idea was that the debenture holders were going to get the full value of their holding and what was left would give 65 per cent. of nominal value to other shareholders.</P>
      <P>From the report that reached us this morning we find that the Minister's actual proposals for the £10,000,000 was to buy both the Great Southern Railways Company and the Dublin Transport Company.  In page 61 of this report we get the information that throughout consideration of the proposals it was estimated that at least £2,000,000. would be required to purchase the shares and debentures of the tramway company, so that when £2,000,000 was taken from the £10,000,000, only £8,000,000 was left to buy out the Great Southern Railways. In fact, it was felt that there would be only £20 10s. 0d. left to pay for each £100 of nominal value to the shareholder, so that the Minister's valuation of all the interests of the preference and ordinary shareholders in the Great Southern Railways, pre-September, when he changed his mind, was rather small.  We have no idea why he changed with regard to that value, or why he particularly selected people, in respect of whom he changed his mind, as owners of the company. We can get no further information from the Minister with regard to that. He seemed to suggest last evening that it was rather unnecessary and undesirable that we should be allowed to see somewhat what was at the back of the mind of the Minister, the Department, the railway company and the chairman in the development and formulation of these proposals.  I think that is an entirely wrong view of the Minister's responsibility, and of the circumstances, if the House is to give him the greatest possible assistance in dealing with this problem.  We should have some explanation as to why the change was brought about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we examine the interest that ordinary stockholders of the railway company had in the past, we see that <Col N="1686" /> they took substantial dividends that were not earned out of the company and took substantial dividends when there were substantial losses, leaving the necessary fabric of the railway unbuilt up.  I feel that I am now entitled to ask the Minister with a view to getting a picture of what kind of plant it is, what its characteristics are, so that we may know what he expects these people to earn out of the company during the next ten or 15 years.  Is their ownership of stocks that are being allotted to them in the Bill going to be worth anything inside the next ten or 15 years?  There are very heavy financial proposals in the Bill and the House is asked to saddle the taxpayers with very substantial guarantees in respect of the greater part of the capital of the company. From part of the £3,500,000 or £4,000,000 we should like to know, in respect of those owners of the company, what income they may be expected to get yearly during the next ten or 15 years.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister has not put these proposals before the House without very elaborate financial examination of the commercial possibilities of the scheme, the income and expenditure, what is going to be left for distribution, what is going to be put aside for reserves of one kind or another, and what will be expended on extending the system.  These estimates must have been made.  The Minister did not tell us.  We did not expect him to do so, but we expected him to lift the veil a little, and to give us some idea of what ordinary shareholders in the new company are estimated to get out of it during the next ten years.  If they are not going to get anything, we are building up a gigantic company, with very great responsibility on people who do not deserve much from past experience. Within the last 12 months personnel has changed probably to the extent of 10 per cent. or more, and for the next ten years they do not expect to get anything.  If that is so it is a queer kind of basis.  It would help us if we knew what the commitments of the company are likely to be, and what burden is likely to fall on the users of transport.  I appreciate the approach <Col N="1687" /> of Deputy Dwyer to this matter.  He thinks the chairman is exactly the right man for the job.  We do not want to discuss personnel in any kind of way, but we are concerned with the approach and with the handling of things.  Certainly, if the approach and the handling of the finances of the railway company in future are going to be anything like the approach and the handling of the finances of the Tramway Company, from the point of view of the users of transport in the City of Dublin, as we are beginning to see it now, the fears of Deputy Hughes are justified.</P>
    <P>I draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Public Transport Tribunal Report of 1939 pointed out at page 108 that the Dublin United Transport Company at that time intended over a ten years' period to repay £1,100,000 of capital and debentures and they issued a warning to the Minister, and through the Government to the House and country that</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the company should not be empowered to charge such fares as may be necessary to earn a net revenue sufficiently large to enable this proposal to be carried out.  In our opinion it is unreasonable to expect that for the next ten years the community residing in the areas served by the company should be obliged to pay, not only for the current cost of provision of the services placed at its disposal by the company ... but also to provide out of current revenue in such a short period so substantial a sum as £1,100,000....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As far as we can see, from the date of that report until now, that £1,100,000 has been squeezed out of the users of transport in the City of Dublin.  Anybody who looks at the report of that tribunal will see at page 105 that the capital of the Tramway Company was: ordinary stock £660,000, 6 per cent. preference stock £600,000; debentures £682,100; bank overdraft £268,832. This Bill provides for giving substitute stock in respect of the ordinary stock and the 6 per cent. preference stock. That money is going to be paid and the Dublin Transport Company, as far <Col N="1688" /> as we can see, is only going to gather stock worth £1,260,000 shown there.</P>
    <P>It is to be compensated at the rate of £145 per £100 of stock.  What has happened to the rest of the money? What has happened to the rest of the capital which the Dublin United Transport Company had, according to the report at this time.  Paragraph 246 says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The capital and the borrowings of the company on 31st December, 1938, were as follows: Total, £2,210,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>£1,260,000 is being provided for here, and as it is being provided for at the rate of £145 for £100 of stock, it looks to be £1,800,000 in the Bill, but the tribunal consisting of Mr. Ingram, Mr. Beddy, Dr. Kennedy, Mr. O'Brien and Mr. Diarmuid O'Hegarty, which was set up to examine the transport situation at that time, warned the Minister and the Government that charges by the transport company in the City of Dublin which would take £1,100,000 more out of the people in ten years than the cost of running the service in an ordinary reasonable way would warrant, should not be allowed. That apparently has been taken out of them, and it is a magnificent business touch that the citizens of Dublin, through unnecessarily high rates on their travelling, have had to pay it.</P>
    <P>These charges have been felt by the people who travel from Crumlin, Drumcondra and Cabra into the centre of the city, and so far as we are able to say, from the information gradually coming before us in our discussions here and from the documents we are getting into our hands here, the citizens of Dublin during the past ten years have paid back £1,100,000 of capital over and above what they ordinarily and reasonably ought to have been charged for their transport.  That is to be applied to the rest of the country, but, as well as getting that dose for the last ten years, the transport users, the ordinary passenger traffic of the City of Dublin, are to be shifted over and to have scooped out of their pockets additional moneys by that system to help a transport undertaking throughout the country, built <Col N="1689" /> up on the magnificent direction of the type of directors which the Great Southern Railways had.</P>
    <P>It is very hard, when discussing a section such as this, which bases the ownership of this company on a certain class of people, to know where to stop in turning up any particular aspect of the case; but we ought to be told, as some guide to us, as to where we stand with regard to the finances of this company and the effect there is likely to be on our people, in respect of the people who are to be made own this company&mdash;the owners of £3,500,000 of stock are to be made the owners of, perhaps, £16,000,000 or £20,000,000 worth of property&mdash;how much money the Minister expects they will be able to get out of their stock in the next ten years.  If we knew that, it would be a base line from which we might examine some others of the financial proposals; but if the Minister is unwilling or unable to tell us what these stockholders who are to be made the owners of the company under this section are likely to get in the next ten years, Parliament is being treated with contempt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dwyer has suggested that there are only two alternatives with regard to the constitution of this company&mdash;either a company as envisaged in the section or a company on the lines of the Electricity Supply Board.  If these were the only two alternatives before the House, and I do not admit they are, it would be far preferable to have directors nominated by the Minister.  There is safety in numbers, and it is unlikely that four or five directors would, prior to the publication of the Government scheme, go around to a number of people and inform them of what the scheme was to be, as did happen in the case of one dictator.  I hold that if it is decided to have one dictator in control of this company, it is far better in the public interest that he should stand alone rather than that he should be surrounded by what Deputy Dwyer has described as dummy directors. Standing alone, he at least would be exposed to criticism for any of his misdeeds, but, protected by a smokescreen <Col N="1690" /> of dummy directors, he can evade responsibility to a certain extent.</P>
      <P>The safety of public money, the safety of this great transport industry, demand that the operation of such a colossal business should not be delegated to one individual.  That is why I think that, in the constitution of this company, it is entirely undesirable that we should have, as is contemplated, a number of dummy directors, so that the chairman, as a pocket battleship, will be surrounded by a smokescreen of elected directors who have no power and no responsibility. There is, I believe, a great danger attaching to the form of company envisaged here&mdash;a concern of which ownership is vested in people who have no power and controlled by the State through its nominee.  There is also a big danger in dragging civil servants into it, because this nominee of the Minister must be a civil servant since he is the paid nominee of the Government. It is bad to have that association between the nominee of the Government and a company such as this.  We have seen and noted with alarm the fact that prominent members of the Civil Service have been dabbling to a very great extent in stocks and shares and the fact has caused grave misgiving amongst the ordinary citizens.  It must cause Deputies approaching the consideration of this Bill and other measures of the kind, in which there is an association between State ownership and private ownership, to view the whole proposal with grave misgiving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is, I think, rather an original system of control of a public company. I think it is the worst possible system that could be envisaged.  It would be even better if the State were to acquire ownership of half, or more than half, the shares, and thus secure a majority on the board of directors. That would be preferable to the present system.  I think if we are to choose between the alternatives that Deputy Dwyer indicated, it would be far better to have the ownership in the hands of the State, in addition to control.  The system is bad&mdash;it is rotten&mdash;and while any shrewd businessman <Col N="1691" /> might like, as Deputy Dwyer pointed out, to be surrounded by a number of dummy directors, it would not be in the public interest that such a smokescreen should be provided.</P>
    <P>This new company, because of the huge financial commitment which is involved in its creation, presents a real danger and would be a menace to all other forms of transport which have not yet been taken over; it does constitute a real menace to all industries which depend upon transport&mdash; and that is practically 100 per cent. of our industries.  It represents a particular menace to the agricultural industry, which must have cheap and efficient transport, because its very existence depends upon such.</P>

      <P>Before the section is put, I should like to point out that it merely provides that the holders of the proposed substituted common stock will be made into a body corporate to be known as Córas Iompair Éireann. There is nothing in the section concerning the financial obligations or <Col N="1692" /> powers of the proposed corporation, the constitution of the board, or the powers of the chairman.  Although Deputies spoke about those matters, they do not arise on this section, and the observations I have to make on these matters will be made on the appropriate sections.  In so far as we have had a general discussion upon the main provisions of the Bill, there are some things that should be stated in order to put Deputies right and so avoid what might be a useless repetition of inaccuracies at a later stage, thus wasting time.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton frequently used the expression &ldquo;compensation&rdquo; in relation to the proposals for the substitution of stock in the new company for stock in the existing Great Southern Railways Company.  We are not proposing compensation in any sense, nor did we determine the arrangements for exchange on any basis of assessing the market values of existing stocks or the value of the fixed assets of the company. It is proposed to set up a new corporation in which will be absorbed the existing Great Southern Railways and the Dublin United Transport Company.  So far as the Great Southern Railways shareholders are concerned, they are getting in the new corporation shares of the same nominal value as their present holdings.  There will be certain differences arising out of the fact that the new corporation will have only two kinds of shares, whereas the Great Southern Railways Company have four kinds.</P>
      <P>Debenture holders with £100 in the existing company will get £100 debentures in the new company.  The new debentures will carry interest at the rate of 3 per cent. instead of 4 per cent, as at present.  In the case of the guaranteed shareholders who have got, although irregularly, the 4 per cent. guaranteed to them when their money was invested, they will get as to half of their holdings the new 3 per cent. debentures and, as to the other half, common stock.  The ordinary shareholders will get pound for pound shares in the new company&mdash;common stock in the new company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have not attempted to assess the market value.  I do not think the question arises.  The decision was not <Col N="1693" /> to attempt a further reduction in the nominal value of the holdings of those shareholders.  We did in 1933 reduce the nominal value of their holdings. We do not think a further reduction of the nominal value is necessary and, therefore, the proposal is to give shares £ for £ against the existing shares, the only difference being that, in so far as the debenture holders are concerned, they will get 3 per cent. instead of 4 per cent. and the ordinary shareholders will be limited to a maximum dividend of 6 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is it necessary to put in a State guarantee of 3 per cent.?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Because we think that the people who have 4 per cent. and who have agreed to accept a 25 per cent. reduction, should get something in return.  There was no reason to assume they would not get 4 per cent. in the future.  Deputies may make deductions as to the position of the company, based on the experience of individual years, but if we take the experience of last year the holders of Great Southern Railways debenture stock had the probability of receiving their debenture interest regularly. They could reasonably assume they would not lose it in the future.  If we ask them to agree to accept a 25 per cent. reduction in the amount of interest due to them, we have to give them something in exchange, and we propose the security of a Government guarantee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I repeat what I said yesterday, that we regarded it as desirable in dealing with the debenture holders that we should proceed, if possible, by way of agreement with them?  Conceivably, as Deputy Mulcahy suggested, we might have established a judicial tribunal to assess with greater accuracy the relationship between the value of the 3 per cent.  Government guarantee and the existing Great Southern Railways 4 per cent. debentures, but we did not think it necessary to do so.  We considered it was a fair arrangement which was proposed for the debenture holders, and the fact that it was accepted <Col N="1694" /> voluntarily by the debenture holders should, we feel, recommend it to the House.</P>
    <P>I do not know on what basis one would assume the value of the fixed assets of the Great Southern Railways Company.  I have asserted that the fixed assets of any transport organisation can give no indication of its earning power.  Study the balance sheet of the Dublin United Transport Company.  Deputy Mulcahy has referred to its capital liabilities.  Look at the other side of the balance sheet. Does the Deputy contend that the capital liabilities are represented by fixed assets on the other side?  They are not.  Of the items on the credit side, goodwill represents 60 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the value of the managing director&mdash;is goodwill included in that figure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be hard to assess that.  There is no question of the ability of the company to earn a revenue capable of remunerating the capital invested in it.  The same surely must apply in the case of the Great Southern Railways Company.  It may be that the rolling stock is obsolescent. It may be that their system of working will require considerable organisation. It may be that a number of the branch lines and some of the stations upon which capital was expended in the past will not be capable of earning revenue in the future, but there are assets there of some kind, assets the replacement value of which would be difficult to determine.  It is an open question whether, if some catastrophe abolished all those assets, we would attempt to replace them, but, assuming that we would consider it necessary to replace those fixed assets, in whole or in part, what would they cost now?  I suggest that they would cost substantially more than the nominal value we have placed upon the capital of this company. That is a question of opinion, but I do not think it is necessary for us either to determine the current market price of the shares of the company or the replacement value of its fixed assets in deciding the basis on which we are going to give shares in the new company in substitution for <Col N="1695" /> shares in the old company.  I am sorry that Deputy Norton thought it necessary, despite the very emphatic report of the tribunal of inquiry, to repeat his insinuations against the chairman of the Great Southern Railways Company.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's interpretation of his remarks is somewhat different from that of any one who heard him.  I also think it is foolish of Deputy Davin to try to contend that the very substantial improvement which took place in the financial position of the Dublin United Transport Company was not due to its managing director.  It was due to its managing director.  It was entirely due to the organising ability he brought to bear upon that company's problems, and to the changes he made both in its financial structure and in its operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Those changes have been sensational in their effect.  In the case of that company there was, following his appointment, an all-round reduction of fares; there was repayment of certain capital liabilities, not the entire loan liability of the company, as Deputy Mulcahy has assumed, but some proportion of it; there was a substantial improvement in the wages of its employees; there was considerable development of the facilities given to the public; and despite the difficulties created by the war, higher costs of fuel and restrictions in operation, it is, so far as I can find out, the only municipal transport undertaking in Europe which has not increased its fares during the war.</P>

      <P>They were higher than the tram fares.  It is undoubtedly correct that the substantial improvement in the financial position of the Great Southern Railways Company revealed at the annual meeting this year was attributable in part to emergency conditions, but only in part.  I have already explained to the Dáil that the increases in freight charges which were sanctioned last year were in no way responsible for the ability of that company to pay dividends upon all its stocks.  The total of the increase in revenue which could be attributable to the increases permitted in freight charges was £300,000.  Last year, for the first time, the Great Southern Railways Company appropriated to depreciation the sum of £550,000.  It will be seen, therefore, that the whole of the revenue which came from the increased charges was more than off-set by the making of an allocation to depreciation for the first time in many years, and that all the additional revenue which was available to the company, and which was used to pay dividends upon ordinary stocks and arrears of dividends upon guaranteed stocks, was due to the economies effected by better management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1697" /> It is quite true that the railway company had to fight less hard for traffic during the war than it had previously, but, if the Deputy is trying to assert that the new management had no responsibility for the improved conditions, how is he going to explain the fact that the new set-up was only created at the beginning of 1942, after the war had been two and a half years in existence, during which period the company, instead of finding itself in an improved position, was rapidly deteriorating into such a deplorable state that it could not be relied upon to meet even the essential transport needs of the community?  It is quite obvious to every member of the public who has had to use the transport system of this country that, following 1942, despite the accentuation of emergency problems, there has been a substantial improvement in the management and operation of the Great Southern Railways Company's transport system.</P>

      <P>Deputy Muleahy got himself into a considerable mess, from which I cannot hope wholly to extricate him.  We never proposed to buy out the shareholders of the Great Southern Railways Company.  Although the Deputy has got information as to the tentative proposals considered at various stages during the preparation of this Bill, he must not misinterpret the changes in view which occurred during that preparatory period.  The original scheme contemplated the establishment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of a statutory organisation to be known as Córas Iompair Eireann, with one class of stock.  We considered giving stockholders of the Great Southern Railways Company and the Dublin United Transport Company fixed interest stock&mdash;to give them all the same kind of stock.  We considered originally that the total nominal value should be £10,000,000.  Later I decided that £10,000,000 could not do it without far too drastic a cut in the nominal value of the shares held by the existing Great Southern Railways shareholders, the nominal value of whose shares had been previously drastically cut under the 1933 Act.  The nominal value of the stock which will be created on the establishment of this company will be £13,500,000, not £20,000,000. £20,000,000 is the limit fixed to the capital liabilities which this company can accept.  The actual capital liabilities with which the company will start off will be £13,500,000, of which less than £10,000,000 will represent debenture liabilities, that is <Col N="1699" /> redeemable debentures in respect of which the obligation to repay will arise.  In so far as the Dublin United Transport Company is concerned, it had, in addition to its ordinary share capital, preference share capital, loan capital.  There are debentures to the nominal value of £300,000, redeemable in 1947, which will be transferred to this new company and become an obligation on the new company.  It is not necessary to make special provision for that in the Bill.  It is covered by the incorporation of the Railway Clauses Act, 1863.  Those debentures could be redeemed now, but they could only be redeemed at 110 per cent.  It is obviously better value to carry the debentures and redeem them at par in 1947, when they become due for repayment, than to exercise the right to buy them in at 110 per cent. now.  Some part of the loan capital liabilities of the Dublin United Transport Company were redeemed since the Transport Tribunal was established, but they were redeemed without any increase in fares.</P>

      <P>I merely state these matters in order to try to make them clear.  I think we could more conveniently discuss them in detail on the appropriate sections.  I want Deputies to understand that we are not proposing <Col N="1700" /> to determine the stock market value of all the shares of the Great Southern Railways.  The market quotation is no indication as to what would be a fair price for all the shares, nor is it any indication of the price at which you could buy all the shares.  Deputies will see from the report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Great Southern Railways Stocks, that, in the whole of the period investigated by them, not more than 10 per cent. of the nominal value of all the shares of the Great Southern Railways ever appeared on the stock market.  In respect of the other 90 per cent., there were no transactions at all.  The price at which a small fraction of the shares may be bought or sold is no indication of the price at which you would buy up the bulk of the shares, the holders of which bought to hold and have no intention of selling.  If you established an arbitration tribunal to try to assess a fair value, you would have to tell the arbitrator to proceed on the basis not merely of a willing buyer but also of a willing seller.  It is obvious, on that basis, that a fair person would have to fix on the shares thus treated, a cash value substantially above the current market value or the average market value for several years past.  However, we have made no attempt to determine the cash value and are merely proposing to give stock of the new company in replacement.  New debenture stock at 3 per cent. will be issued instead of the old at 4 per cent., and the new common stock will earn what the revenue of the company entitles the shareholders to receive.</P>
      <P>I could not attempt to forecast, as Deputy Mulcahy has asked, what dividends will be paid to the holders of this proposed common stock.  It would be impossible to make any such forecast, although it is obvious that the reduction in debenture interest, apart altogether from other economies that result from the amalgamation, and the benefits of better management will make it easier for the new company to pay dividends on the common stock than it was possible for the Great Southern Railways in the past to pay dividends on its ordinary stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The holders of the common stock <Col N="1701" /> will be the present ordinary shareholders of the Great Southern Railways, plus the present preference shareholders and the guaranteed preference shareholders, who will be receiving for 50 per cent. of their holdings of guaranteed shares in common stock in the new company.  Under the Great Southern Railways amalgamation scheme, which followed on the 1924 Act, the persons entitled to be present and vote at the annual meetings of the company will be the holders <Col N="1702" /> of all stocks of the company other than debenture stocks.  The effect, therefore, would be that the persons entitled to be present at the annual meeting of the company and participate in the election of directors and other functions of the annual meeting will be the present holders of the ordinary stocks, preference stocks and guaranteed stocks of the Great Southern Railways.</P>

    <P Just="Center">SECTION 9.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1) (a), line 34, before the word &ldquo;transport&rdquo; to insert the word &ldquo;public&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>If this amendment is accepted it will make it clear that the intention is to operate a public transport service. One cannot imagine this company operating anything but a public transport service but as the section is drafted it seems to me to be capable of being used to enable the company to provide a fleet of private motor cars or a fleet of small buses or, perhaps, river or coast yachts and run them or hire them out to private people.  I am sure that is not contemplated, but in order to make it clear that the company is tied down to operating a public transport service I suggest that the word &ldquo;public&rdquo; should be inserted before the word &ldquo;transport&rdquo; in line 34. That would make it clear beyond all doubt that the operation of a public transport service is intended.  It may be that the Minister is satisfied that the insertion of this word is not necessary. If the Minister is fortified with legal advice along those lines, the amendment will not be necessary but, if I am correct, I think in another amendment the Minister acknowledges the necessity for putting in the word &ldquo;public&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I think the Deputy is under a misunderstanding.  The Great Southern Railways Company, in the halcyon days before the war, did operate a private bus service.  They hired buses for private purposes for which no licence was required under the Road Transport Act.  The insertion of this word here would also prevent them from operating a mail contract or from providing transport for their own staff and supplies.  I do not think it is desirable that the company should be limited to public transport and I see no good reason why they should be prevented from entering into contracts with the Post Office for the carriage of mails or from operating a transport service for their own supplies or staff or even, as they have done to a limited extent in the past, operating taxi-cars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister think it desirable then that this public transport company, or what purports to be a public transport company, should in fact engage in the provision of private motor cars, for instance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The company has a number of private motor cars which are used by members of the company's staff on inspectorial work or for conveying men to their work and so on.  They also have a number of lorries for the conveyance of their own supplies, and, in addition, they provide for contract work, such as the mails contract.  They also engage in the business of hiring private buses and taxi cabs for private purposes, and I see no reason why they should not be allowed to engage in these activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I see a definite objection to a public transport company operating services of a private character.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the objection?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The objection is that the company is either a public transport company or it is not a public company.  If the Minister wants to have a public transport company, then that company should engage only in public transport activities and not in the provision of services which are not normally operated by a public transport system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1705" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>But I submit that such services are normally operated by the company.  I have already given instances to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the contract for the mails, but obviously public transport interests are involved there.  I am referring to private transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy misunderstands the whole matter.  The company have occasionally run private trains.  For instance, they ran a private train for a number of years under contract with the daily newspapers&mdash;a train on which nobody could travel or no goods be carried except the property of the newspapers. They have run mail trains for very many years under contract with the Post Office Department, and they have also provided trains and buses for the exclusive use of the people who hired them.  They are not public services in one sense; they are private services connected with the business in which the company is engaged, in the same way as such services are provided by other people engaged in a similar business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the services referred to by the Minister are not private services at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not public services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, why not make an arrangement for services of that particular kind, such as the railway company provided in respect of its buses? I do not think it is desirable for a public transport company to operate in private ways to the extent that the Minister has suggested, such as providing private taxi cabs for hire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, we understand that.  If the chairman wants an umbrella, nobody wants to give him a <Col N="1706" /> nationalised umbrella, or if he wants a walking-stick, nobody wants to give him a nationalised walking-stick.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest, however, that in a matter of this kind it is desirable to limit the functions of the transport company so far as public needs are required, and not allow it to be a public company one day and engage in private business the next day.  The company should not engage in activities which do not indicate that it is a public transport company, or engage in activities which are normally the sphere of private undertakings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree with the Deputy.  I think there is no objection to the company carrying on this sort of private hiring in which it has been engaged in the past.  For instance, the company provides taxis at various stations for the convenience of passengers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite possible to arrange with the railway company at, <Col N="1707" /> say, Dublin, to wire ahead to places such as Killarney, Parknasilla, Glengarriff, and other such resorts, to have a taxi or a bus meet the train at the particular destination concerned.  These are not private buses or cars in the ordinary sense.  For instance, in normal times, I can go to the Great Southern Railways Company and hire a bus to take my friends or my family to the seaside or on an excursion. That is not a public service, to the extent that anybody may travel on that bus or car.  If what Deputy Norton suggests were to be agreed to, the company would be prevented from engaging in that type of business.</P>

      <P>Because, in so far as they are public transport services, there is at least a certain measure of control, but in respect of private services of this nature they cannot be subject to public control or regulation in any effective way, and no regard may be had to the public interest whatever.</P>

      <P>Yes, I know that, but in a public transport company of this kind, fortified by a State guarantee, the company ought to confine itself to the provision of public transport and not enter into a realm of business which is, or could be, catered for sufficiently well by private undertakings. My fear is that if the railway company is permitted to operate, in some respects, in the sphere of private activities, they will have no regard, in operating these activities, to the public interests.</P>

      <P>I should like to mention that this amendment was inserted only for the purpose of endeavouring properly to prescribe the activities of this national transport company.  In putting down the amendment, there was no intention of depriving the company of their existing rights or privileges&mdash; whatever rights or privileges they already have under existing legislation. It is well known, of course, that the transport company had road transport services for the carrying of mails and so on, even before the 1933 Act, and that in different parts of the country they had small buses and cars for the convenience of passengers and guests staying in their hotels at Killarney, Glengarriff, and similar places, but I am wondering whether the Minister is quite definite on the point that a passenger coming from Cork can wire to the Great Southern Railway headquarters and arrange for a taxi to meet him here in the city&mdash; a taxi of the same type as those that are to be found at the Kingsbridge platform&mdash;for the purpose of taking him wherever he wants to go.</P>

      <P>This company will be restricted to the powers given under this Act and in Section 9 there are only two powers mentioned.  One is to operate a transport service and the other is to carry on any ancillary or <Col N="1711" /> supplementary business.  All, therefore, that can be carried on by the company is a transport service or a business which is ancillary or supplementary to the transport service.  I think there might be very great difficulty in bringing within the scope of that definition some of the matters to which the Minister has referred, and I think he might perhaps take some advice on the matter.  Personally, I think it desirable that the company should have the powers the Minister says he thinks they have.  That is a personal view of my own but I am not quite sure that under the term &ldquo;ancillary or supplementary&rdquo; the company will have these powers.  I doubt, for instance, whether a hotel would be ancillary to transport.</P>

I think myself that the phraseology used here is that used previously and it was held to cover a hotel business which the railway company had carried on previously. There is no question in my mind that, in addition to public transport services, they should be empowered to operate the type of transport business in which they engaged previously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise the door he is opening for the railway company by permitting them to engage to such an extent as they so desire, in the provision of private transport services?  I gathered from what the Minister said that it is possible for the new transport company to put a fleet of taxis on the street and operate them.  It is possible for them in a provincial town to put out hackney cars there and to compete against local people for such traffic as is available.  If they can do that under the Bill, because of the fact that they are entitled to operate any type of transport service under Section 9, I think what you are doing is that you are throwing a highly capitalised company of this character, fortified by a State guarantee, into competition with private services which might be left to the small private taximan or car-owner who cannot be expected to compete with a gigantic private monopoly of this kind.  I think it is highly undesirable to give the company that power.  One might understand a nationalised scheme of transport for the whole country, but if the Minister says that the company has power to operate for private transport, then you have a situation where you have on the one hand a mammoth privately-owned monopoly going into competition with the small taximan in the City of Dublin or hackney car-owners in provincial towns.</P>

If, however, the Deputy has in mind that the arrangements already made under existing legislation for the operation of air services should not be changed without fresh legislation&mdash;that they should not be changed under the omnibus provision in sub-section (3) or this Section&mdash;then I am prepared to amend the Bill to see that that will not happen.</P>

So far as the private individual using motor transport to carry his own goods is concerned, there is, in normal times, no restriction upon him.  It is not proposed by this Bill to impose any restriction on him.  The person who carries goods for hire was subjected to a licensing system by the 1933 Act and his undertaking could be acquired by the Great Southern Railways or the Great Northern Railway or any of the other statutory undertakings.  A number of them were compulsorily acquired.  A number of them were not acquired because of the type of business they undertook or because the area they served was not one in which the railway company was prepared to give a reasonable service.  The power of compulsory acquisition is there, and has been there since 1933.  That applies only to persons licensed to carry on the business of hauling for hire.</P>

      <P>The situation is the same as it was previously with regard to the person carrying his own goods. He can be driven off the roads by competition. Whether this company earns certain dividends or not, the taxpayer is going to come to its rescue.  It can afford to run a certain amount of competition against the private man and drive him off the road.  The Minister says that, if the rates go up, that man can come back into the business. Has the Minister investigated the outlook of those people who, prior to 1939, were carrying their own goods by road and who, by various devices, have been driven off the road?  Any of them I have been in contact with are looking to the buying of new vehicles of their own.  They did put aside their vehicles at one time, because they could not get parts or because the screw was put on as regards petrol. The screw can be put on again by competition.  When they are put off the roads, the Minister says that, if the rates go up, they can always get back into road transport.</P>

      <P>In fact, I do not know how the company could compete with a person using his own lorry to carry his own goods any more than it could compete with a person using his own car for his own purposes.  Assuming I were a person requiring a great deal of transport&mdash;if I were, for instance, a commercial traveller&mdash;I should buy a car for my own use only if it were cheaper to use it than to use public transport.  If public transport were cheaper, I would use it.  The trader using his own lorry is in the same position.  He will use the public transport service if it is cheaper than his own would be.  There is no intention of preventing him from using his own lorry.</P>

Certain other trades will find it convenient to have transport facilities at their own command, but so far as a large volume of traffic carried by private lorries before the war is concerned, I believe it will be possible to give better and cheaper facilities than these lorries will be able to provide when public transport is properly organised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that something extra will have to be done in connection with this amendment, and amendment No. 14.  I suggest the effect will be somewhat lost by the insertion previously of amendment No. 11.  Sub-section 3 contains considerable danger:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Any person carrying on a transport undertaking may, notwithstanding any enactment or agreement, sell the whole or any part of, or share in, that undertaking to the company.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Take the case of an ordinary company. Any proposal to get rid of the property would have ordinarily to go before the shareholders at a general meeting.  It would appear to be possible here for a board of directors to effect a snap sort of sale to a new company, because they would not be controlled by enactment or agreement.  The situation has been discussed already with regard to air transport services. The company is precluded by special Act from getting rid of property, but that special Act will not prevent them getting rid of property in future if that is the meaning I read into these words. I do not know even if the words mean a shareholder or property owner in the company or the board.  In any event, shareholders of a statutory company may off-load the whole concern without the Dáil knowing anything about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-section (2) says that the company may acquire by purchase or by exchange property.  So far, there has been one approach to this by way of anticipation.  The Minister apparently gave sanction, or something in the nature of sanction, to the dissolution of the Dublin United Transport Company and to its amalgamation with the company now proposed.  We are <Col N="1723" /> still at a loss to know on what basis the dissolution of the Dublin United Transport Company was arranged.  I take it from the Minister's remarks in connection with the Great Southern Railways Company that no real valuation was put on the property of the Dublin United Transport Company, that no attempt was made to assess what its revenue-raising capacity was but that someone hit on the bright idea of giving debenture stock to all who held any common stock in the Dublin United Transport Company.  The peculiar thing in the end is that the property in this whole concern, which is going to take over the railway and the tramway system, is going to vest in those who held common stock in the railway company.  There were common stockholders in the Great Southern Railways and common stockholders in the Dublin United Transport Company.  The common stock in the Dublin Transport Company is being wiped out, but the common stock in the least successful of the two concerns is being kept, and the owners will, eventually, emerge as proprietors. Why that distinction between common stockholders was made, I do not know. In any event, what it probably means is that something amounting to the Minister's sanction was given.  I want to find out what is intended by the phrase &ldquo;with the sanction of the Minister&rdquo;.  The sub-section says that the company may, with the sanction of the Minister, acquire the whole or any part of any transport undertaking and the property and assets.  What is in the Minister's mind with regard to sanction?  What would he contemplate?  Is it that he would be looking to see some sort of provision, as in this Bill, for the substitution of one class of stock for another, and if so, on what basis will the calculation be made?  What is the distinction operating in his mind in discriminating in such a peculiar way adversely to the common stockholders of the successful concern?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the arrangement for the acquisition of the Dublin United Transport Company is concerned, it was the result of negotiations. <Col N="1724" /> I can quite easily understand the attitude of ordinary shareholders in the Dublin United Transport Company in deciding that they would not be satisfied with common stock in the new company.  They had a profitable undertaking which paid dividends with regularity.  There was only one year in which it did not do so, and that year there was a strike lasting six months. Naturally they had also in mind the rather unfortunate history of the ordinary shares of the Great Southern Railways.  The ordinary shareholders of the Dublin United Transport Company wanted some assurance that they would get not merely stock of equal value on the market as the stock they were parting with, but something else. They elected to have Government guaranteed debentures for their common stock.  The determination to effect the substitution of £145 for every £100 of stock was the result of negotiations. It was a decision which, I think, the directors were prepared to recommend.</P>

      <P>There was a difference of opinion about that.  As I stated in the Seanad on a motion introduced there by Deputy Mulcahy, who was then Senator Mulcahy, the proposal was such I felt that I could defend it. That was the only basis.  The intention behind sub-sections (2) and (3) is that in certain circumstances it might be possible to contemplate&mdash;and I would contemplate it&mdash;the transfer of some of the road services in the metropolitan area from the Great Northern Railway Company to Córas Iompair Eireann.  I do not know if the Great Northern Railway Company are prepared to agree to transfer some of their metropolitan services to the new company, but, if they proposed to do so, I would sanction it.  I told the directors of the Great Northern Railway Company that I would regard it as a more desirable arrangement that the metropolitan services should be under one company.  We are not proposing compulsorily to acquire these services, but we want to facilitate an arrangement <Col N="1725" /> of that kind if it can be made. There may be similar services, such as the road transport services of the Grand Canal Company, and others operated by the Great Northern Railway Company in areas adjoining those in which the Great Southern Railways operated services in the past.  An adjustment of services of that kind may be possible by agreement, and, if agreed to, may be desirable.  The purpose here is to provide for the transfer being effected if such agreement appeals to the parties concerned.</P>

These words strike me as being capable of having an effect, perhaps, that is not intended.  I might put a hypothetical case to explain the point which I wish to make.  If &ldquo;A&rdquo; operates a transport service and proceeds to sell to &ldquo;B&rdquo;, if &ldquo;A&rdquo; thinks he can get a better price for that service, then &ldquo;B&rdquo; is crushed out.  &ldquo;B&rdquo; is left high and dry, as it might be contended that the agreement was broken by the wording of sub-section (3).  Probably that point would not arise, but the wording could operate to invalidate an agreement that would, otherwise, be valid between two parties, and enable one party to break it with impunity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday evening, when discussing this motion, I was dealing with the types of county managers.  There are county managers who co-operate fully and give every assistance and support to the county council.  There are even managers who ask the advice and opinions of councillors on matters of importance connected with county administration; but, on the other hand, we have a county manager who would not think it worth his while to consult the elected representatives, but who carries out his duties in accordance with the strict letter of the law and who does as he so desires.  As I stated yesterday, we cannot have good, sound local administration if the county manager does not work in harmony with the elected representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I entirely disagree with Deputy O'Higgins when he says that the system has not yet had a fair trial. We have had experience of it since the last local elections, and I, as one who has served on a county council since those elections, am thoroughly disgusted with the attitude adopted by county managers with whom I have come in contact.  For instance, in the <Col N="1727" /> case of the county manager of my own county, we find that on the occasion of practically every quarterly meeting he is on holidays.  He administers the affairs of two counties, Laoighis and Offaly.  Laoighis gets two days and Offaly two days, and he has the remaining three days to himself.  While that manager is on holidays, both counties are at a standstill.  The payment of road workers' wages is held up and there are no finance meetings for six weeks on some occasions.  The attendants in the mental hospitals under the care and charge of the manager are due to get their salaries, but, while the manager is on holidays, the signing of the pay orders has to await his return.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>In referring to this matter, I made no reference to the county manager being on holidays every month.  The county council meets only every three months.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Allen wants to make a speech, he should get up and do so and not indulge in ignorant interruptions while another Deputy is speaking.  It was stated here by Deputy Donnellan or Deputy Cogan that the reason the Government introduced this legislation was as a step towards the preventing of corruption. It was not very hard to find out the corrupt actions of 20, 30 or 40 men, but it was some job to find out the corruption of one man working behind closed doors.  There should be a clause in the Act to provide that, if any member of a council demands information, he will be given that information.  The Act lays down that a council as a body <Col N="1728" /> or the chairman of a council can get all the information they require, but if an ordinary member of a county council, sent into the council by probably 500, 1,000 or 2,000 votes of the ratepayers to look after their interests, goes in to seek information, he can be told by a paid official to clear out, that he has no right to get information.  I, as an elected representative on a county council, was refused information by the county manager of my county, but when another gentleman who was not a member of the county council went in to get information, it was freely given. I condemn such an attitude in the strongest possible manner.</P>
      <P>The Minister is quite well aware of the case to which I refer as I have had correspondence with him in regard to it time and again.  The Minister sent me copies of the section of the Act which debars me from getting the information, but the result was that in my own constituency, in my own parish, the ratepayers suffered a severe financial loss.  I do not propose to refer to the matter here because I shall take another opportunity of doing so, but the ratepayers and the poor of the county suffered a severe loss.  If that information had been placed at my disposal, the official or officials concerned would have been dealt with in an able and efficient manner and this corruption which has been proved beyond yea or nay would not have been allowed to continue.</P>
      <P>We have power under this Act to strike a rate.  When we strike that rate, we have no authority to say in what way the money is to be spent. Paid officials, such as the county surveyor, the county engineer and the county medical officer of health, can spend the money in whatever way they like and we councillors cannot open our mouths about it.  The next power we have is to appoint the rate collector, and then we have power to dismiss the county manager.  I tell you it will be some time before a council can dismiss a manager because one man can carry on corruption behind closed doors, and it will not be found out in a hurry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Laoighis County Council is <Col N="1729" /> the only council that made any attempt to dismiss the county manager for what I would call gross neglect.  The county manager canvassed members of the county council in order to get the motion in connection with his dismissal turned down.  It was turned down, inasmuch as there was no seconder.  The man who was to second it was the sole representative of the Farmers' Party on the Laoighis County Council. Being a member of the Barrow Drainage Ratepayers' Organisation, he was in sympathy with the agitation regarding the non-payment of drainage rates and he would not pay them.  The county manager, being clever and efficient, looked up the rate books and, on the morning of the county council meeting, he disqualified the councillor who was to second the motion, because of the non-payment of his rates.  The result was that the motion fell through.</P>
    <P>I agree with the remarks of Deputy M. O'Sullivan here yesterday evening. He referred to committees appointed by local authorities.  Such committees are very necessary.  I suppose that Deputy Allen will shout across the Chamber, in his usual ignorant fashion, that councillors can do it if they so desire.</P>

      <P>I hold that it would be desirable for every county council to appoint sub-committees composed of the councillors for each electoral area. They could meet every fortnight or month to deal with home assistance applications and the roads in their areas, and refer those things to the county manager, accompanied by a strong recommendation.  If the county manager will only carry out the recommendations that the councillors place before him, if he acts as manager for the county instead of manager of the county council, and if he will merely do what the councillors want, then there might not be a grievance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am one county councillor who is thoroughly disgusted with the administration of this Act.  It is my first time to be a member of a county council and I guarantee it will be my last while <Col N="1730" /> the existing regulations are in operation. I find, like many other councillors, I am merely wasting my time. The resolutions adopted by the county council are never put into effect.</P>
    <P>So far as influencing county managers is concerned, that has been proved.  Deputy O'Leary, from Wexford, mentioned in the last Dáil&mdash;and I am sure he is prepared to stand over it this evening&mdash;about certain influence used on the county manager in his constituency. If a county councillor writes to a county manager, making a strong recommendation for a person applying for a post, or if he recommends an individual for a cottage, he will get back the usual acknowledgment intimating that the county manager is dealing with the matter.  I know one individual in my own constituency, and every time there is a house vacant or a job going the general public will ask &ldquo;What would take us to the county councillors?  They have no say with the manager, and we had better go to the pal he meets on the golf links. That is the man who has the pull with the manager.&rdquo;  I have known letters from councillors and from T.D.s in the Offaly constituency to be ignored because certain influences were brought to bear on the county manager. The point is that while you can influence one man you cannot influence 20, 30 or 40 men and, in those circumstances, it would be much better if the members of the county council had complete control of the administration of local affairs.</P>

      <P>I can give the history of certain appointments that were made.  I will not say they were made in my own constituency, for fear the Chair would think I was too personal in regard to the county manager. Probably the Minister might not like to hear the remark I am about to make now.  There was an order made by a certain county manager for the purpose of giving a job to one of the principal Fianna Fáil supporters in the area.  When that county manager was challenged on the matter, he had no <Col N="1731" /> reply to make, because it was proved that political influence was used and a job was created, and who got it but a prominent Fianna Fáil supporter whose wife is a school teacher, three or four of whose sons are officers in the Army, and who has another son a Civic Guard.  The same position was denied to labouring men who are walking up and down the street and who are in receipt of home assistance.  Some of them have been marching from soup kitchen to soup kitchen and from exchange to exchange.  The pull was worked again and the position was filled without one county councillor having a say.  The manager did not ask the exchange if there was an unemployed man in the district who could fill the position.  The job was given secretly because of the influence used.</P>
      <P>Certain articles were written in the <i>Irish Independent</i> not too long ago under the heading &ldquo;Local government administration behind closed doors&rdquo;. That is exactly the position in relation to county managers, because local government is definitely carried on behind closed doors and the ratepayers dare not seek any information from certain county managers.</P>
      <P>I suggest that instead of the Minister trying to amend this Act he should scrap it, because it is an uncalled for piece of legislation.  There is no use in people getting up at the municipal conferences every year and saying the County Management Act is deplorable and should be amended.  I suggest it should be abolished.  Anyway, the decision rests with the people.  If the people want the County Management Act, let them have it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must remember that all our authority comes from Almighty God. The Government has no right to take authority out of the hands of the local people.  They never got a mandate from the people to take away that authority.  I believe if it were made an issue in local elections the people would decide on a restoration of powers to county councillors.  This appears to be a huge joke to the Minister and he seems to be enjoying it thoroughly.  There is an old saying that there are none so blind as those <Col N="1732" /> who do not want to see.  Probably the Minister is one of those people; may be he is too well up to learn anything about local government.  As soon as his Estimate comes up, I will paint a picture he will not like.</P>
    <P>So far as this Act is concerned, there is only one thing for us to do, and that is to attend its death and burial.  We should abolish it once and for all.  It is the worst Act the Government ever passed.  It is an Act which planted the seeds of corruption. Some of the old county councils, I must admit, were very bad, but you would know they were very bad.  Now the corruption is there and you know nothing about it.  Even the lowest official in a county council office, when you speak to him about roads or home assistance, will turn up his nose and have the audacity to say that the matter will be attended to.  You would imagine he was the county manager. The county manager's authority is going down to the lowest official in the place.  The Act is responsible for it all. I do not know if the Minister will treat this motion with the complete contempt that seems to be usual in Ministerial Departments.  We have had Ministers here ignoring resolutions submitted by the Farmers' Party and by the Labour Party.  Anything that is submitted here by the workers of the country should receive sympathetic consideration.</P>
    <P>I think this motion is useful only in that it gives an opportunity for discussion; I am afraid there will be no results from it.  I firmly believe that the Government will do nothing whatever about it, and that we will be told that the present system of local government in this country is efficient.  It has been said here that it can be proved that the present system is definitely a more efficient manner of administering local government than the old system.  As a member of practically every public authority in the county, I can definitely say that it is not efficient.  If the Minister is not prepared to restore to the people's representatives the power to administer the affairs of their various counties, I respectfully suggest that he should amend the Act in order that <Col N="1733" /> councillors may get any information they require.  I suggest, too, that it be made compulsory for every county council to meet monthly, and that an agenda of the county managers orders be distributed to every councillor, within ten days from the date on which those orders are made, for discussion at the next county council meeting.  That would give councillors some encouragement to attend county council meetings; it would give them an interest in their work, and make them feel that they are not wasting their time.</P>
    <P>I would respectfully ask the Minister to tell us whether he proposes to make any change whatever in the existing laws, because they are laws which in my opinion should not be tolerated in any democratic country.  There is absolutely no democracy at all in local administration.  The people's wishes cannot be complied with; the representatives of the people are not in a position to get the information they require in order to help those who elected them.  I think it is most unjust of any Government to keep in operation such legislation as the existing County Management Act.  We have put up with it since the local elections, but I am convinced that sooner or later it will have to go.  If the Fianna Fáil Government does not scrap it some other Government will come into existence and do it, because the people will not tolerate it.  The ordinary private individual can have more to say in local administration than a county councillor elected by the people, if he has sufficient &ldquo;pull&rdquo; with the county manager.</P>
    <P>If the Minister will not change the present system, I would suggest that he transfer the county managers every six months in order to prevent the exercise of influence.  If you have a strange county manager in the place it will take about six months to get very friendly with him, and then no &ldquo;pull&rdquo; can be worked.  It would be a very good idea if that could be done. It would prevent a lot of the corruption. County councillors can prove that influence is worked at present.  I think there should be a very definite limit to the powers of county managers. <Col N="1734" /> As far as we are concerned, the only thing we can do at the moment is talk about it, and it rests with the Minister as to whether we are to have our grievances remedied.  I think there is really very little use in patching up the Act.  It should be scrapped; the death and burial of the County Management Act should be completed as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>At the outset of my observations, I should like to make perfectly clear one point with regard to the attitude of the Minister in connection with this resolution. First of all, we regard the County Management Act as one of a series of historic changes in local government administration that have been taking place for the last 20 years. We do not regard the Act as a violent change, but part of a slow evolutionary process which has been taking place ever since we attained independence for the Twenty-Six Counties. Secondly, I should like to make it clear at the very outset that we regard the Act as an experiment which is worthy of a very fair and pretty extensive trial, and that we welcome any useful, constructive criticism as to the operation of the Act and as to the way in which it is being administered in different areas.  We welcome any helpful suggestions with regard to the division of powers as between the manager and the local authority which we can examine in the light of the general position of the whole local government of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not in the position that we believe that the County Management Act must stay, without any sort of amendment.  We agree very largely with the Deputy-Leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy O'Higgins, who said that the Act had not been given a sufficient trial; that a certain period must pass before we take a final view with regard to whether it should be continued or whether it should be amended.  In that connection, I should like to point out that in the Act itself there is a clause which provides for the transfer of powers, by permission of the Minister, from the county manager to <Col N="1735" /> a council, with one important reservation, namely, that the power of the manager to supervise the staff is one which is definitely reserved for him.  I think I am speaking on behalf of the great majority of local government electors in saying that it would only be for very extraordinary reasons that we would amend the section of the Act which gives to the manager the control and supervision of the officers.  I might add that under previous Local Government Acts the Minister himself had a very large measure of control, control which has been growing for the last 20 years, and that we would, therefore, be more than reluctant to make any amendment or alteration in that particular respect.  When we hear violent criticism of the Act we are bound to assume that, in certain cases, it is because of the quite natural and human disappointment on the part of local government representatives that they have lost a certain degree of patronage, which they may have exercised quite sincerely&mdash;I make no allegation of corruption&mdash;but which did not redound to the efficiency of the local bodies concerned.</P>
    <P>The resolution is vague in a number of respects.  It does not definitely state whether the executive functions which it seeks to restore to the council include the supervision and control of officers.  It does not specify any particular functions.  It is, generally speaking, a vague statement to the effect that the administrators are dissatisfied with the present position, and there is a suggestion that we have departed from democratic principles.  We claim that the County Management Act has worked properly, and that, given a fair trial, democratic procedure can continue under the aegis of the present Act.  The resolution recommends that we restore to the elected representatives of the people effective authority to direct the administration of local government affairs.  We ask what that word &ldquo;direct&rdquo; means?  Does it mean control or supervision?  Does it mean the appointment and control of officers, or does it mean some slight change in the degree to which any particular local authority controls from day to day the acts of the manager in <Col N="1736" /> so far as the spending of the rate and the spending of a local government grant are concerned?</P>
    <P>We now come to the question of the statement in the resolution: &ldquo;A distinct departure from democratic principles&rdquo;. I feel compelled to remind the House very briefly of the development of local government in this country.  I will be as brief as I can, but it is essential that we look at this Act in its historic context and realise that it is not a violent change in itself, but a change taking place ever since this country achieved independence.  I would remind the House that local government started in this country in 1897.  There is no special sanctity in the form of local government in this country; it has not got the long tradition that democratic government has all over Europe.  It began here in 1897, and it is of no use to assume that the norm of democratic operation here is what existed in any particular period &mdash;in 1925, in 1930, or in 1935.  It is no use to assume that there is a norm of any aspect of local government very far from the present system.  We ought to keep our minds upon that, and I suggest that, if we do, we could debate this resolution in a far more useful way than we could by assuming that everything which has happened since has been a departure from normality.</P>
    <P>I would remind the House of the 1923 Act, which made provision by which local boards of guardians were dissolved or eclipsed.  The Minister was given power to dissolve bodies, and dissolved 20 immediately.  He was also given certain powers of control over the appointment of officers, and from then commenced the ever-increasing control over the terms of appointment of officers, their control, etc.  That began long before 1940.  Then came the Local Appointments Commission, which took over the power to control the appointment of major officers.  The Act of 1925 followed, which unified the authorities for health and assistance and abolished rural district councils. Then the Greater Dublin Commission came into being, including in its membership Deputies Corish, Byrne, and Senator Professor Magennis.  They recommended the managerial system. <Col N="1737" /> Deputy Corish wrote a Minority Report in that connection, but I do not want to keep the House by reading through it.  Their recommendations were at least in general principle very substantially the recommendations that lay behind the County Management Act of 1940; in other words, the absolutely clear separation of executive from legislative functions.  The differences between the recommendations of that inquiry in 1924 and the present County Management Act are at the very most a matter of detail rather than of general principle.</P>
    <P>It so happened that Cork Corporation was the first body to commence the managerial system.  In 1930 we had Dublin.  In 1939, the Cork Managerial Act was amended to conform with what had been done by the other bodies and, so far as I can ascertain, there was no definite or general criticism on the part of Cork Corporation at that time.  When the Act came for re-consideration there may have been some criticism but I cannot find it recorded in the Department that, in the light of what had happened in Dublin, the Cork people did not desire to change the system to keep level with Dublin.  On the contrary, it went through with great smoothness.  In connection with Cork, Dublin, and later Limerick, the Minister never received any considered resolution by any of those bodies for the transfer of functions from the managers back to the councils.  There has never been any serious resolution to that effect.  There may have been minor complaints and minor resolutions, but there was never any considered resolution of that kind.</P>
    <P>In 1927 a commission recommended the consolidation of the public assistance law and that managers be appointed.  Since then, there have been huge increases in the amount of rate collected and big increases in the Government contribution, and it was felt by a great many people that, in order to have impartiality of local government, efficiency and financial stability, executive functions must be delegated from local authorities to independent officers.  Putting that in a different way, what has happened in <Col N="1738" /> the last 20 years?  When this State became independent, there were very numerous authorities in very small areas, with very little specialisation of function, whose members had intimate knowledge of local problems, with little assistance or State control. From that, we have developed gradually to a larger area of authority, fewer authorities, authorities being coalesced, and specialised treatment of almost every subject in local government. Very large executive responsibility has been thrown on to the local authorities.  The development of a national health service needed a degree of national control and the need for the co-ordination of all the executive functions in connection with health service became more apparent.  In that connection, I may add that for ordinary human reasons the local authorities were almost always behind the State in the insistence of new health standards.</P>
    <P>With that came large grants and control.  Eventually the position was reached when a local authority had so many responsibilities that, if it were to be efficient, the agenda for such a body would have to consist principally of discussions on policy, of what had been done in a certain period and what should be done in another period. It became quite impossible for a local authority to carry out a full agenda, in which it had all the managerial control and in which it instructed local secretaries or local officers to carry out what was deemed to be right for the area.  All of us who have studied local government know that that was taking place and that the result was that they could not administer efficiently every function.  Many of these executive functions were under the direct control of county councils or urban councils, and while I need not go into the matter there were many cases of incompetence revealed.  A very large number of local authorities were dissolved by the Central Government on the ground of incompetence. In connection with the appointments of local officers there was a considerable degree of influence of a purely human type.  We need not go into the question of whether or not there was <Col N="1739" /> corruption; but it was quite evident from the reports in the Local Government Department&mdash;as I think everyone will agree&mdash;that the qualifications of officers in local authorities were not regarded with sufficient care by the county council, simply because it is impossible for a large body to deal with a matter like that and appoint the best people with all the political influences that are quite evident.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, 30 separate new functions have been given to local authorities since 1933, including the functions arising out of the emergency. These are entirely new functions, involving the expenditure of millions of pounds, both contributed locally and by the Central Government.  The inevitable and logical consequence of this was the County Management Act, 1940, with the transfer of executive functions and transfer of the control and supervision of the officers to a paid manager.  With that went a very important Act, which must be considered at the same time&mdash;the Local Government Act, 1941&mdash;under which the Minister was given powers to standardise to a reasonable degree the terms of appointment of local officers, their remuneration, their terms of office, their holidays, their relations with the county manager and so forth. At some time a little later on, the Public Bodies Order, 1942, was signed by the Minister.  It provided for a complete reorganisation of all the very highly involved and technical work of carrying out local government administration. With that went the Public Assistance Act, which consolidated all public assistance law.  And now the latest thing we have is a further development of local government functions&mdash;the announcement by the Minister that some time in the next few months there will be a scheme for granting pensions to local government officials.</P>
    <P>All that is part of the evolutionary development of local government, and I will again ask the House to consider it in that light, and when making criticisms to be helpful.  Deputies might realise that we regard this Act in an experimental light and we want to <Col N="1740" /> achieve the very best form of local government while continuing the democratic principles involved in the election of county councils and urban councils.</P>
    <P>I would like just for a few minutes to advert to a comparison between the development of local government and the development of central government. In 1900 democratic government was largely the work of a policeman. It developed from that to a pure control of taxation.  Then it reached the present position, when we absorb between 25 and 30 per cent. of the national income in taxation, including high rates and a big contribution to local rates.  A very great growth of the central government in its legislative functions, namely that of directing economic policy, has also taken place. To show you that the Central Government at all times has carefully kept distinct its executive function, I should like to compare the development of local government with the kind of authorities which, under central government, now administer the Acts passed in this Dáil.  First of all, there is the Civil Service Commission which chooses the Civil Service staff independently of this House.  There is the Local Appointments Commission. There is a whole series of statutory bodies which are subject to the general criticism of the House but which entirely remove from this House any executive function in connection with the work&mdash;bodies such as the Irish Land Commission, the Revenue Commissioners, the tribunal that administers the Trade Union Act, the tribunal that at present deals with Emergency Powers Orders.  There is the development of a huge number of statutory Orders all of which appear in the Order Paper here, but very few of which are ever challenged by members of the House and which bear a certain comparison with the orders passed by county managers.  I say a certain comparison.  I am simply saying they are parallel developments resulting from the huge increase in the complexity of government, both locally and centrally.  There are statutory corporations such as the Electricity Supply Board, the Industrial <Col N="1741" /> Credit Corporation, Irish Shipping Limited, and so on.</P>
    <P>The development of these executive bodies brings with it problems that I need not go into but which affect central government as much as local government on which, at all times, discussion is desirable in the House. Unless the House Leeps very careful watch over all these executive functions, the people lose control of their own government.  We hear discussion of them during Estimates; we hear debates on what should be done; but everybody knows that as government gets more complex there must be a removal from the legislative body, a separation from what may be described as political activity, of the executive functions of the State, money for which is provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>To make another rather far-fetched comparison, it was becoming as impossible for local authorities to administer every Act as it would be if this Dáil sat down to award reconstruction grants under the Local Government Acts.  A list of these reconstruction grants would be placed before us.  We would have to debate whether so-and-so was entitled to a grant or not.  I grant that there is only a remote comparison there but the comparison inevitably exists to a great degree.</P>
    <P>I want to deal shortly with the general powers which local authorities have under the County Management Act.  We have heard a good deal of criticism already from Deputies&mdash;very wild criticism and very moderate criticism.  I was very interested in Lord Mayor O'Sullivan's speech.  I wish he had been a little more definite in his statement.  He made a very careful and balanced observation.  Deputy Donnellan was a little bit uncertain. He felt the Act required amendment but did not go so far as to suggest that the Act should be scrapped. Deputy Flanagan made a number of very wild assertions.</P>
    <P>I want to remind members of the Dáil of the powers of the local authority, which they possess under the County Management Act, 1940.  In that connection I would draw the attention of the House to a letter <Col N="1742" /> issued by the Department of Local Government to county managers on the 27th January of this year in which we very clearly, and so far as we could, indicated the degree to which it was desirable that county managers should co-operate with county councils and with local authorities.  We pin-pointed in this letter a certain number of matters in which we thought a very definite and minimum degree of co-operation was essential.</P>
    <P>The most important work of the local authority is in the estimate of expenses and the striking of the rate for each year, and the degree to which that becomes a matter of discussion is very much in the hands of the local authority.  There is no reason why they should not have discussion on the past work of the year in respect of each of the heads of local government; there is no reason why estimates should not be presented to them in a form which they can understand.  They can ask for explanations&mdash;why a rate is being increased for some particular service or why a rate is being decreased. They can make general observations. The whole question of what happens before the rate is struck is, I submit, a matter of general development in which we hope that local authorities will co-operate with the county manager and from which something useful and reasonable will emerge, something that does not obstruct the work of the county manager but which gives useful activity to the local authority, to the councillors of these authorities, at the time of year when they are debating this matter. That is one thing about which we are most insistent.</P>
    <P>There is another matter I would refer to by reading a paragraph in this letter:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every manager should as a matter of course keep the local authority informed of the important details of his administration, including particulars of projects in contemplation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then, in connection with the examination of orders which have been made by the manager, we make the observation:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1743" />&ldquo;In some cases summaries have been issued or printed copies have been circulated to members while in others the local Press is periodically supplied with those copies of the more important orders.  The local authority should decide whether the production at meetings of the register containing the manager's orders is sufficient or that other information is desired. The manager should endeavour to meet their wishes as far as practicable and not confine himself to the minimum the law requires if the council wishes him to go beyond-that.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We welcome any observations on how far county managers have observed the spirit and the letter of that recommendation made to them.  It is impossible for me to read the whole of this document, but I should like to read what really summarises its whole character:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The representatives of the electorate are the controlling element in local affairs.  It is for them to formulate policy and in association with the manager, to consider the solutions for local problems.  A loyal acceptance by the manager of the predominant position of the elected body will add much to elicit from them the support to which he is entitled in the discharge of his duties.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That, again, we hope, will result in the best possible form of co-operation between the manager and the local authority.  I should say in this connection that discussion necessarily varies in different districts.  It is quite obvious to us that in certain areas the county manager has achieved a degree of co-operation with the local authority which the county manager has not achieved in others, and we are watching that position very carefully. We hope that what is being done in counties where there has been very evident satisfaction with the managerial system will gradually take place in other counties where the position is less satisfactory.</P>
    <P>I want also to advert to another very important power which local authorities have, and which is not apparent at the present time because of the <Col N="1744" /> emergency, that is, in the development of new housing.  Under existing statutes the medical officer of health must condemn houses unfit for habitation, but the rate of building of new houses, the adoption of resolutions for clearance areas, the ratifying of loans for housing give an opportunity to members of local authorities to exercise a very great influence both in the type of houses provided, in the amenities of these houses, in their location and in general housing policy, subject always, as was the case long before the County Management Act came into existence, to control by the central authority.  Housing will be a big problem after the war, and although shortage of raw materials will effect an additional measure of control by the central authority, which would not be necessary in the ordinary way, that is a power which the local authority have and which we hope they will take advantage of.</P>
    <P>Another power they have is in passing town planning resolutions.  Very little advantage is being taken of the Town Planning Act.  A very great deal can be done to avoid unsightly buildings, to build beautiful towns, to see that we have the best possible form of town and urban area.  In that connection the local authority has the power to pass a resolution and to adopt, to amend and to alter any scheme provided by an architect.  Once a scheme has been adopted the execution of it is a matter for the county manager.</P>
    <P>Then there is a further power that local authorities possess.  If they are willing to raise the money or raise the rates for the purpose, they possess the power, with certain reservations that I need not go into in detail now, to requisition the manager to carry out certain things.  For instance, they can requisition him to build a bridge in an area, provided they have the money. If they want a contribution from the central authority, then it is a matter of procedure between the Central Government and the local authority, the procedure for which is well known to Deputies.  That power of requisitioning the manager to do certain things also applies, with certain reservations, but not such as would detract from the value of this clause, to <Col N="1745" /> sewerage and water supply schemes, if the council should choose to invoke the power.  Again, in connection with health, the mental hospitals joint committees have very considerable powers both in regard to the dietary and the conduct of the officials, and they are doing very useful work in ensuring that the work of these hospitals is being carried out efficiently.</P>
    <P>Adverting again to the suggestion of the Deputy-Leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy O'Higgins, that it is too soon to make any changes in the County Management Act, I would remind the House that the Act only came into operation in September, 1942, and a certain number of officers have been transferred.  There has been a certain amount of shifting of officers, and I think it would be true to say that the Act is only in its teething stages.  It has hardly one calendar year of actual working in which we could observe results.</P>
    <P>I do not think that that is an exaggeration, and therefore I think that we ought to take very seriously the suggestion of Deputy O'Higgins, that we should consider the matter very carefully before deciding to make any material changes.  Again, I think that the Government would be most reluctant to go back to the old system of control of officers.  The principal reason for the adoption of the Act of 1942 was to bring about efficiency, and, when I say that, I do not mean cold-blooded, mechanical, relentless efficiency. We have a very high rate of taxation, and the higher the rate of local and central taxation, the more must we, in the interests of national economy, insist on a reasonable measure of efficiency, on having a good job done well, and on the avoidance of waste, while at the same time we wish to have the business of the local councils administered humanely. Nobody on this side of the House&mdash; and, certainly not the Minister&mdash;would like to see the sort of cold-blooded, relentless efficiency which does not take account of the human element, but I can assure the House that, taking one particular section of local government activity, the examination of audits, there is still room for a very great improvement <Col N="1746" /> in the efficiency of local bodies.  They have such large responsibilities that we must expect from them in the coming years the same minimum measure of efficiency that we would expect in the Central Government, and, as I have said, there is still a great deal of lee-way to be made up in that respect.  It is our hope to bring about that efficiency, and now that the qualifications of the officers concerned are being prescribed by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, and carefully supervised by the managers, we hope to have far greater efficiency in the future than we have had in the past so far as these bodies are concerned.</P>
    <P>Taking again the question of how far the County Management Act has created dissatisfaction, I think that, without any exaggeration, it is fair to say that we have not had any large measure of criticism from the electors. Certainly, nothing has been recorded in the Department suggesting that the electors as a whole are dissatisfied with the County Management Act. There is nothing which would suggest that they do not wish to have a continuance of the Act for a further period.  So far as the local authorities are concerned, we have heard criticisms to-day from representatives of certain local authorities, but after a very brief examination of such newspaper reports as I could find of local authority meetings, I find that there, again, a number of local authorities are highly satisfied, so far as the County Management Act is concerned, with what has taken place.  Many of these newspapers are not known for their Fianna Fáil proclivities.  I am not going to read all the extracts, but I can assure the House that a very considerable number of these local authorities, when welcoming a manager, or when saying good-bye to a manager when he was leaving, were unanimous in their praise of his work. In some cases there was unmeasured criticism, and in other cases measured criticism of the County Managerial Act, such as we had from Deputy Roddy, and which I think deserves serious consideration, but on the whole these local authorities were unanimous <Col N="1747" /> in their praise of the work of the managers concerned.  There were suggestions, of course, that the managerial system might be modified, or even scrapped altogether, but from the general tone of these reports one would deduce that a very considerable number of local authorities are satisfied with the County Management Act.  On the whole, therefore, I think that we might give the Act another trial before making any change.</P>
    <P>I could read these extracts for the House, but I do not think it is necessary to do so, and I hope that Deputies will take my word for it that there is nothing to cause the Minister to despair, or to be seriously worried or perturbed.  That is what I deduce from reading a considerable number of extracts from local newspapers in regard to the Managerial Act.  There is nothing to suggest that we need make any drastic changes.  There are no definite reasons put forward to suggest any drastic changes, nor is there a very large measure of criticism either of the Act or its administration.  I might also add that we have had no criticism to any measurable extent in connection with those authorities where the managerial system has been in operation for a considerable period.</P>
    <P>Now, to deal with another criticism that has been made.  It has been suggested that there is nothing now for these local bodies to do.  Although the Act has not been in operation for a long time, and although the creation of precedents and a tradition of discussion between the manager and the local authority has not had time to be seen in its full light, an examination of reports from local newspapers indicates that a very large number of local bodies have had very considerable and prolonged discussions.  From reading a number of extracts from papers from different areas, I should say that very happy relations exist between the local bodies and the managers and that they by no means have had nothing to do. Again, that is a matter for co-operation between the manager and the local authorities.</P>
    <P>Again, the local electoral returns for <Col N="1748" /> the last election in 1942, while lower than the votes in the previous local elections of 1934, reveal that the people, who were aware of the County Managerial Act, took a very considerable interest, and the percentage of the people who polled varied from 47 to 65 per cent. which, I think, compares very favourably with the figures for the last two general elections.</P>
    <P>I would conclude, therefore, by asking the House to let us have constructive criticism, to distinguish between any suggestion they may have to make with regard to removing from the county manager his powers of controlling officers, and the transfer of other executive functions, and to be perfectly distinct, as far as they can, in their observations, because unless we have clarity it will be impossible for us to benefit by discussing this resolution.</P>
    <P>I move to report progress.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; the debate adjourned until 6 p.m., to-morrow.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask a question on this section, a question bearing on the power of the company to acquire any other transport undertaking.  It is stated that the expression &ldquo;transport services&rdquo; means transport services by railway, tramway, inland navigation, sea, air or road.  I observe that the Minister has met certain fears which might be raised by the insertion of the words &ldquo;by agreement&rdquo; after of the words &ldquo;acquire.&rdquo;  I think he mentioned something in reference to the Great Northern Railway operating services in certain areas within the Twenty-Six Counties.  If I understood him aright&mdash;I just could not catch his words very accurately&mdash;he favoured these services being operated, if at all possible, by the new company.  The Minister is quite aware of the exceptional circumstances at present prevailing. He knows that the Great <Col N="1749" /> Northern Railway is operating north and south of the Border, that it is a company which has given, in very difficult and trying circumstances, a very efficient service.  It is a company that has not very much territory within which it can operate in the Twenty-Six Counties and any curtailment of its activities would be detrimental to the future of this very well-managed railway concern.</P>
      <P>Whilst at the moment I feel that the interests of that company are made safe enough by the insertion of the amendment providing for acquisition by agreement, I should like the Minister to say&mdash;I shall not ask him for a guarantee&mdash;that he would keep before his mind, that consultation should take place between the interests concerned before anything is done that would militate against the interests of the company.  Although the words &ldquo;by agreement&rdquo; have now been inserted in this section, the case might be made that the services at present operated by the Great Northern Company, and which I hope will continue to be operated by them, were not adequate and on that plea the Minister might enable the new company to start another service in that area and by competition make the service operated by the Great Northern Railway Company so unremunerative that the company would have to abandon it.  Without asking for any guarantee from the Minister, I hope that before any development of that kind arises the Minister will give the matter serious consideration and that he will not do anything&mdash;I leave it at that&mdash;that would in any way militate against the activities of the Great Northern Railways as carried on for a number of years past.</P>

      <P>I put down an amendment that would take the Dublin United Transport Company out of this section.  The section provides for the <Col N="1750" /> dissolution of the railway company and of the Dublin Transport Company in connection with the amalgamation that is sought to be brought about under the Bill.  In the report issued this morning by the tribunal appointed to inquire into the transactions relating to the stocks of the railway company, one of the points brought forward by the tribunal on page 60, as indicating that there was no improper disclosures of information, was the fact that, although the absorption of the Dublin United Transport Company had been in contemplation from the very outset, and had been referred to in every memorandum and minute dealing with the matter of capital organisation, there had been no stir of any kind in connection with the transport company's shares during that period that would show that any inkling of this matter had got out.  The fact apparently is that so fantastic was the proposal that in the new general transport company, the passenger transport services of the city would be amalgamated with the machinery for the transport of cattle, beet and other farm produce, it never entered into anybody's mind, even though they might be aware that proposals were on foot for transport reorganisation, that anybody could seriously entertain the idea.  I think that fact indicates the mind of everybody in the country with regard to the idea.</P>
      <P>First and foremost, I think it is a great wrong to the citizens of Dublin generally that their passenger transport services would be taken over under this Bill, and that instead of that service being run in an efficient and cheap way that would give them the very specialised service they want, it is to be mixed up with the general transport proposals.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I do not want to be driven to discuss the point of order that it is not possible to discuss this point separately and divorce it from the general proposals.  I simply had to accept that.  In regard to this service, I think a wrong has been <Col N="1751" /> done, and a measure of that wrong in another way can be ascertained by considering the points I put before the House when I made my remarks on Section 8, that, in fact, the charges that have been made for the carrying of passengers to the City of Dublin since the 1939 report was issued have been such that a very large amount of capital of the Dublin United Transport Company has been repaid. I suggest that something like £1,100,000 has been repaid. The Minister declined to accept that figure, but he has given inadequate or rather imperfect figures to cover that situation.  I might point out again to the House that whereas the amount shown as being the capital of the Dublin United Transport Company, on page 105 of the report, totals £2,210,000, the amount of capital that is being provided for in connection with this new company is £660,000 ordinary stock and £600,000 6 per cent. preference stock.</P>
      <P>Therefore, in one way or another, there will be wiped out by the time this company is formed the difference of, say, about £1,000,000 of capital.  The Minister has indicated that about £300,000 of that is to be carried forward as debentures.  That leaves another £700,000 to be accounted for.  The only conclusion that we can come to is that that sum has either been collected from the users of transport in the City of Dublin and been repaid, or will be collected and repaid before this company begins to operate.  To that extent, transport users in the City of Dublin have been called upon to pay something like £700,000 over and above the cost of running the company, and of paying for the interest, repairs and general maintenance of the system here.  Since that is the position, the users of transport in the City of Dublin would be entitled to look forward to a reduction in the high rates that already exist; but instead of that being done, they are to be called upon to shoulder a burden which will be utilised to reduce the expenses of the transport system in the rest of the country either as passenger or goods services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That wrong is being done to the citizens of Dublin.  It falls in a particular <Col N="1752" /> way on those who are living in the working-class areas of the city and who have to travel comparatively long distances from their homes to their work places.  When all these various types of services are amalgamated in one company, or one monopoly, the real cost of these types of services will, I submit, be obscured. The result will be that you will not have, generally speaking, the efficient or cheap service that you ought to have.</P>
    <P>I object to the citizens of Dublin being saddled unnecessarily with the cost of services that ought not to be borne by them.  If we are going to have an efficient service, I submit that the passenger services for the city of Dublin ought to be of a special type. It is one that will require a particular type of organisation.  The efficiency of it should not be obscured by mixing it up with the general transport of the country.  The cheapness of that transport should not be prejudiced in the way that it is being prejudiced in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two main grievances that need to be stressed in connection with this Bill.  The first is in relation to the citizens of the State as a whole so far as its financial structure is concerned, and the second, to which Deputy Mulcahy has drawn attention, is one that is peculiar to the citizens of Dublin.  Dublin Deputies have been vociferous in giving expression to a point of view that they consider to be in the best interests of the citizens on the proposal to bring the Dublin United Transport Company within the confines of the new company. Those of us who have a certain viewpoint on that question should not allow any opportunity to pass without again stressing what is undoubtedly a strong and genuine complaint so far as Dublin citizens are concerned.  I am particularly interested in this not so much from the point of view of the amount of capital of the Dublin United Transport Company that is involved <Col N="1753" /> and to which reference has been made, but rather the manner in which that company has been allowed to milk the citizens of Dublin of an amount which was considered by the Railway Tribunal in 1939 to be grossly excessive. That has gone on over a period of ten years.</P>
      <P>Some time ago I directed the attention of the Minister to the fares charged at present by the Dublin United Transport Company.  I pointed out to him that the profits of the company from 1938 to this year had increased from about £70,000 to almost £400,000.  I submitted to the Minister, in view of the high burden that was being imposed on the citizens of Dublin, in common with the citizens of the State as a whole through the operation of a swollen cost of living, that some relief should be given to Dublin citizens by a lowering of fares. The answer he made to me at the time was that it was not considered expedient to bring about a reduction in fares, but that such a reduction was contemplated after the emergency.  He also said it would be necessary for this company to have considerable reserves to meet the cost of the new and additional equipment that would be necessary when normal conditions returned.  He also, of course, as he has done on a number of occasions, pointed out that there had been no increase in bus fares in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister travels very often on buses.  Superficially, it may be correct to say that there has been no actual increase in fares.  I would point out to him, however, that during the emergency, in the case of the 28-seater buses, the company has been allowed to carry eight additional passengers.  You have, by means of that an actual increase in income of nearly 25 per cent.  That increase has been obtained without increasing the costs of running the bus.  Therefore, there has been a large increase in the income accruing to the company from the running of their buses.  That increase in income has resulted from an imposition of travelling conditions that the public in normal times would not be asked to put up with, and would not put up with.  Therefore, it is true to say that so far as transport is concerned <Col N="1754" /> the drain on the resources of the citizens has been increased.  If, as the Minister maintains, there has been no actual increase in fares, it is worth while pointing out that there has been a complete withdrawal of all special tickets, such as monthly tickets, for workers.  That hits the working classes very severely, many of whom have to travel very considerable distances to their work.  Take the case of a man travelling on the shilling stage.  At present he will pay 2/- per day going to and from work, or say 7/- per week for a weekly ticket confining him to one journey each way on six days of the week.  That is the position now as against a monthly ticket for 24/- which permitted him to travel as many times as he wished in the month and every day.  We can see, therefore, that for practical purposes there has been a very substantial increase in the fares that are being garnered by this company from the citizens of Dublin.</P>
    <P>If, as the Minister has pointed out, one of the means by which the new company will be in a position to meet its commitments so far as interest on debenture stock is concerned and to pay a dividend on the common stock, if that be possible, is the bringing into the transport scheme of this company in Dublin with a high earning capacity, how is there to be relief for the Dublin citizens under normal conditions? We expect a reduction in fares.  Is the City of Dublin to continue to subscribe a sum of nearly £500,000, over and above the actual cost of transport, to the new monopoly of the future?</P>
    <P>I have a particular point of view on local transport.  There is not much use in putting it forward now but I do think that Dublin citizens have got, even at this stage, a special claim in regard to local transport&mdash;a claim which has been completely sidetracked by this Bill and the decision to absorb the Dublin Transport Company into the national undertaking.  It cannot be denied that, in Dublin, there are local peculiarities and transport needs that will not be catered for by a national concern to the same extent that a local concern would be compelled to cater for them.  It is indisputable that, if the Dublin services are absorbed into the national concern, <Col N="1755" /> it will be much more difficult to secure a reduction of the present excessive fares&mdash;fares which are excessive from the point of view of the margin left to the company.  It will be much more difficult to get improved services to the suburbs and to arrange cheap excursions for school children to the seaside in summer, all of which matters can be of tremendous importance not merely from the point of view of transport in the city but from the point of view of housing needs and the health and welfare of the sections of the community affected.  I cannot envisage a board of directors sitting in Kingsbridge and charged with responsibility for all national transport taking the same close and intimate view of the peculiar needs of Dublin as would be likely in the case of a company confined to Dublin and having to cater for conditions peculiar to Dublin. From that point of view, I think that Dublin and its citizens are being drawn into this new monopoly because, by virtue of its concentration of population, Dublin possesses a very high earning capacity and will serve to bolster up and secure this national concern.</P>
    <P>Dublin citizens are not entitled to any greater privileges than other citizens, but, on the other hand, they should not be penalised to a greater extent than other citizens.  If we are to continue under present conditions, our contribution to the new company will be close on £500,000 a year, and we shall be getting a very poor system of local transport.  If the new company proves to be in difficulties, are we to be asked to bear our share of the burden placed on the people as a whole as regards the guarantee of interest on the debenture stocks, and are we, in addition, to carry this local burden&mdash;a burden placed upon us by virtue of the original legislation passed in this House and secured to the company by various enactments?  The position of the company has been improved by the fact that they have been operating in emergency conditions, and have been relieved of many obligations which transport undertakings would normally have to meet.  The Minister has, on a <Col N="1756" /> number of occasions, made great play with the fact that, since the change of management, the company has become a very healthy, solvent company, and has paid an increased dividend each year, while reducing its capital commitments. He has told us that it has a fine fleet of buses, and that it has given fine conditions to its workers.  It has only given conditions to its workers which many of the bus companies, knocked out of existence by legislation of this House, gave to their workers many years ago.  It is only to-day that this company is establishing decent conditions.  That is not a thing to be placed to its credit.  In recognition of the fact that they have been given a monopoly in Dublin and allowed to extract this large sum for transport from the citizens of Dublin, it would be but fair that some portion of the money should go to the workers, and that it should not be all retained for the benefit of the debenture holders.</P>
    <P>It would not be natural to expect that the Minister would, at this stage, place his duty as a Dublin member before his duty as a member of the Government.  But when we realise that transport, housing needs and the health and welfare of the great mass of the citizens constitute a single problem, not one part of which is soluble unless the problem be dealt with as a whole, I think it is well somebody should point out the difficulties we shall have to face in Dublin.  I say that we are being deliberately sacrificed because there is need for bringing into the national concern an undertaking with a high earning capacity. It is also well to point out that, if the Bill goes through in its present form, we shall, in addition to meeting our commitments as citizens of the city be required to pay a very heavy annual tribute to the national undertaking and, in return, get nothing but a transport system which will have no relation to the ordinary transport needs of a city of the size of Dublin or to the needs which exist because of the housing problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>While I have no special interest in the City of Dublin, which is ably represented in this House, I am <Col N="1757" /> opposed to the merging of the Dublin Transport Company in this scheme.  I take that attitude because it is proposed to bring under the control of the State a service which can be efficiently managed, and which has demonstrated that it has been so managed, by private enterprise.  No arguments have been put forward to justify the taking over of the Dublin Transport Company on the ground of inefficiency.  I am also opposed to the merging of the two companies under State control on the ground that we are seeking to make this new transport company all-embracing and to bring under its control the transport services of almost the entire State.</P>
      <P>I can see dangers to rural areas from this amalgamation of all city and rural services.  I can see the danger of complicated problems arising in the City of Dublin, which might cause trouble in the working of the transport company and lead to disputes.  It would be fantastic to have all services from rural areas tied up simply because some complex problem arose in the heart of the City of Dublin.  I have not heard any justification whatever for the taking over of the Dublin Transport Company.  It is desirable that we should endeavour as far as possible to keep State commitments to the minimum instead of trying to bring them up to the maximum level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I endeavoured during the course of the Second Reading debate on the Bill to explain to the House the reasons why I regarded the amalgamation of the Dublin United Transport Company and the Great Southern Railways as a fundamental part of our whole transport scheme.  I think it was obvious that the amalgamation of the two companies would strengthen the national transport organisation. No case has been put forward by Deputy Larkin or by Deputy Cogan for maintaining a separate organisation confined in its operations to Dublin that would not equally apply to any other part of the country.  If an argument is being put forward in favour of maintaining a separate transport organisation in Dublin to meet Dublin's peculiar needs, the same <Col N="1758" /> argument could be put forward for Cork.  Why not?  Cork is a municipality, and there are municipal services there.  There are special needs in the Cork area, and surely a Cork organisation would be concerned to see that Cork City would have as to the best type of organisation for the citizens.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it, then, a question of size?  Deputy Mulcahy says that that is the question.  That is not what Deputy Cogan said.  He fears that the requirements of rural areas may be overlooked by reason of the fact that the board would be solely concerned with the interests of Dublin.  Surely if there is a case to be made on the ground that an organisation operating in Dublin could provide better and cheaper services, if there is no responsibility for transport services outside Dublin, it is not merely a question of size but a question of population density.  You could have a company running the transport service for the eastern counties providing a better and probably a cheaper service, than if it also had to provide a service for more sparsely populated counties.  Are we to revive the old Dublin SouthEastern Railway?  If you pursue the argument that, because of special circumstances, particular difficulties or special features of the transport problem, organisations confined to particular areas could provide better services than a central body, you must not limit them to Dublin.  I do not think that argument is sound.  I think a national transport organisation can provide better services than an organisation confined exclusively to the city.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  Deputy Davin made that point before, and Deputy Mulcahy made a somewhat similar reference.  Deputy Mulcahy referred to the inability of people to comprehend the reasons why an organisation solely concerned with passenger transport in Dublin should be <Col N="1759" /> linked up with another organisation whose main concern was the moving of cattle and beet.  Twelve or 15 years ago that argument could be followed. Twelve or 15 years ago a railway company was mainly a railway company and the Dublin United Tramways Company was mainly a tramways company, but since then both have become omnibus owners.  The omnibuses created an entirely new situation for both concerns.  The Great Southern Railways Company are now operating buses on a much larger scale than the Dublin United Transport Company, and by the amalgamation we are not merely effecting immediate economies in administration but making possible further economies by reason of the standardisation and interchangeability of vehicles, equipment and plant.</P>
      <P>We provide a new national transport organisation, with the best technical abilities available to either company, and over and above that there is a clear cash gain which Deputies should not leave out of account.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy was concerned about the capital.  In 1939, it was stated in the paragraph of the report of the Transport Tribunal to which he referred, that the total capital liabilities of the company were £2,211,000. What were they made up of?  Ordinary stock, £660,000, 6 per cent. preference stock, £600,000, 3½ per cent. debentures due for repayment November, 1939, £300,000, 3½ per cent. debenture stock due for repayment January, 1947, £300,000, debentures at varying rates of interest due for repayment December, 1939, £82,100, and a bank overdraft of £269,000.  In 1939, the company issued new debentures amounting to £700,000 and out of the proceeds of that issue they paid off the debentures due for repayment, and have since then repaid that issue.  The outstanding debenture liabilities are £300,000 due for repayment in 1947. That liability is transferred to the new company.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say.  It is a simple calculation to find out what <Col N="1760" /> has to be paid in interest on the ordinary stock of the company.  By the substitution for preference and ordinary stock for 3 per cent. debenture stock in the manner proposed in the Bill&mdash;£145 worth of stock for every £100 of existing stock a saving of interest is achieved.  The liability of the new company in respect of interest and dividends is reduced by more than half.  There is an immediate saving of £67,000 yearly. It does not represent any increase of fares or any imposition on the citizens of Dublin, except a reduction in the amount of interest payments and dividends.  In addition, the new company's earning capacity is very substantial.  It will be a matter for decision by the board of the new company to what extent the added revenue from amalgamation will be used to give effect to a reduction in fares, or provide in some other way improved transport facilities for the citizens of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is obvious that transport in Dublin could be cheapened.  It is wrong to assume that the national board will not be concerned with the problem of Dublin, and with the provision of cheap fares to districts where the population has been moved from city slums to suburban dwellings.  That will be the function of the board.  They will have no other function except to provide the best and most efficient transport service, meeting the requirements of the public at an economic price and without making a loss.  I think it quite obvious that this amalgamation is going to improve the transport organisation of the whole country, and it must inevitably involve the improving of the transport organisation in each part of the country.  There are not merely the obvious advantages of amalgamating two companies operating similar types of vehicles and a similar business, but there are clear gains of substantial magnitude flowing therefrom.  I stated already that I regarded this amalgamation proposal as an integral part of the whole scheme, and I think that if there was to be a decision now to drop that part of the scheme, the whole Bill would require reconsideration and <Col N="1761" /> drastic amendment.  It is my belief that we will, by reason of this amalgamation, assist very considerably the development of a sound transport organisation. I believe that of all the various proposals in the Bill, or all the schemes which may occur to the board of the new company, there is nothing which will make a greater contribution to the development of a sound transport organisation than this amalgamation of the two existing companies.</P>

The cost of fuel and replacements has enormously increased. The staff of the company which could not be fully employed was nevertheless paid on a full employment basis.  When the trams ceased to run by reason of the electricity stoppage, all the tram crews were kept in full employment at full wages. These additional expenses must also be taken into account, and I think it would be correct to say that the expenses arising out of the emergency far exceed the added sources of revenue which the emergency created.</P>

      <P>The Minister a few moments ago referred to the taking over of the transport company as being an essential part of the Bill, and gave what, on the face of it, appeared to be an explanation of that.  I do not think he has touched the real root of the matter, namely, that the profits of the Dublin United Transport Company are needed to bolster up the possible future losses of the railway company. On the one hand you have, in the case of the Dublin United Transport Company, a company which operates by means of buses and trams for short distances.  It carries the <Col N="1765" /> citizens to and from their work.  These are, in the main, essential journeys. The people must take these buses or trams to get to their work, and the fares are a charge on their incomes just as much as the rents of their houses.</P>
      <P>Now, I am not going to go into the question of the shareholders of this company&mdash;that is another sidelight&mdash; but I will just say that I do not think the shareholders of the transport company were as pleased with the proposed change as the Minister would like to make out.  It is really with the citizens of Dublin and the charges they will have to bear for their transport services in the future that I am concerned. I can see no earthly reason for the taking over of the Dublin Transport Company, except to put the earnings of that healthy company into the earnings of the railway company, which is by no means as healthy.  The transport company operates on short journeys.  That company is patronised by people who must go on those short journeys and the fares, in their essence, become a charge on their income. Every city member is vitally concerned with the charges which the citizens will have to pay and I am afraid, looking into the future, that we can see no hope for a reduction in the fares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The railway company is in a different position.  It carries goods over long distances.  It also carries passengers, but not to and from their daily work&mdash;at least, not to any extent. Even for the passengers it is not quite such a charge on their income as in the case of the Transport Company. In connection with freights, of course, it is not a charge on them at all; it is a charge on industry.  There is no essential connection between an urban transport company and a rural railway company.  If both companies were equally prosperous, there might be some fairness in the proposals, but taking heed of the fact that the railway company is not in a healthy position, or was not prior to the war as regards making profits out of earning capacity, I can see no reason why, when the emergency is over, the railways will not go back, somewhat at any rate, to the position in which they were before 1939.  The company may <Col N="1766" /> put on new carriages and they may tempt a certain number of people to go on railway journeys, but unless there is very repressive legislation introduced to prevent persons, in their private capacity, travelling by motor car, or traders from carrying goods over long distances in their own vehicles, the railways are bound to get back somewhat to the position in which they were in 1938 or 1939.  I can see the position coming in which the citizens of Dublin will be forced to pay higher and exorbitant fares to keep the railway company going, and I think that is a very unfair position.</P>
    <P>In connection with the balance sheet, the Minister has said that he wishes to make it as clear as it can be made in the new company.  Will he guarantee that the receipts and expenditure of the Dublin Transport Company will be kept publicly and shown separately from those of the railway system?  It is only then that the citizens of Dublin will be able to form a fair idea as to how much they are paying towards the needs of the rural community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the proposal to amalgamate the Dublin Transport Company and the general railway services.  I have listened to various speeches made here, and I must say I was quite impressed with the Minister's statement in favour of that proposal. As a countryman, I can visualise the necessity of an amalgamation of the various services and of placing them under one control.  I cannot see the wisdom of advocating separate transport services in places like Dublin as against places like Leitrim and Sligo.  I cannot see how the City of Dublin, cut off from the rest of the country, can hope to carry on its ordinary business, with its growing population, and possessing, as it does, an advantageous situation in relation to transport services, as against counties where there is a dwindling population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there must be in the country a transport service covering the whole area, and if there are parts of the country so sparsely populated that a transport service must be run without profit, then I think, from the national point of view, it is only fair that there <Col N="1767" /> should be some co-ordination between the sparsely populated areas, where the transport may be run at a loss, and the thickly populated areas, where there is adequate and profitable transport, so as to ensure that the remotest parts are served as well as the parts more favourably placed.</P>
    <P>I cannot see Dublin existing without adequate food supplies coming to it from various parts of the country, such as eggs, milk, butter, and live stock.  Assuming we have transport services in each locality in proportion to its population, must it not necessarily follow that the transport of these essential things to the growing population of a place like Dublin will increase in cost, and, increasing in cost, have to be borne by the consumers here?  I can see no logic whatever behind the suggestion that this amalgamation should not take place.</P>
    <P>I know perfectly well that a national system of transport will have an important bearing on various parts of the country and on the rural community. Already evidence of that exists.  We have a transport system which has a unified system of control.  That transport system's charges have definitely increased.  It is quite true, as the Minister stated, that so also have the costs of running that service and the incidentals connected with it.  At the same time, I believe that any transport system covering the whole country, and that has a unified control, will, even under very mediocre management, ensure that its outlay will be borne by the charges made over the whole community.  It is quite a simple matter if it is done in that way.</P>
    <P>I have great hopes of a national system of transport.  I hope the management will take into consideration the needs of the different areas. Dublin may be confident of itself, and so sure of its own position that it feels amalgamation with the rest of the community would be injurious to its healthy position, but nevertheless I urge, and I believe it is right so to urge, that other parts of the country should be taken into consideration in the planning of our future transport <Col N="1768" /> system.  What I mean to convey is that the ports of Sligo and Galway should be developed in connection with the system of internal transport.  That would tend to increase the populations of those areas and it would not allow this terrible catastrophe to continue where we have one centre for the whole of the country&mdash;the capital&mdash;in which amalgamation with the rest of the community on matters of essential national importance is regarded as a menace.  I think future transport arrangements should be aimed at the development of various centres in the country, to increase their activities and to increase their industrial possibilities, so that Dublin will not in future find itself at variance with the general development in national transport, or any other such service.</P>

      <P>Deputy Maguire does not seem to realise the case we have been putting.  We have been putting this case, that in the City of Dublin since 1939 there has been an increased home assistance; there have been vouchers for milk, for butter, for potatoes, for turf; every idea that the Government could get into their heads for trying to combat the poverty and destitution which emergency conditions have brought about here has been employed, and while the Government, in a city where people have to utilise the buses and trams in travelling fairly long distances in the course of their business, were supplying additional home assistance, additional unemployment assistance and additional food vouchers, apparently the transport system was squeezing out of the pockets of the travelling public in the City of Dublin £800,000 more than was necessary to carry on the business satisfactorily and to pay dividends on the capital which was invested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because they had not the same type of machinery for squeezing transport charges out of the rest of the country as apparently existed here in Dublin.  What are we trying to avoid here?  We are trying to avoid the application of that system to the whole of the country.  Never before was it more important than it will be in the coming few years to have a cheap and efficient transport service throughout the country.  In Dublin, there was squeezed out of the unfortunate people £800,000 more than it was necessary to take out of their pockets during that difficult time.  We are dealing with a Bill here which proposes to recover, during the next 16 years, out of the people who use transport in the country, £10,000,000 more than would normally be necessary to pay the interest on the capital, to carry on the business, to pay the workers, to provide material, to cover the cost of renewals, and so on.  That is what we are struggling against.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The interests of the City of Dublin are involved in seeing that the same thing will not be carried on in relation to Dublin to-morrow as was carried on during the last five years. We have that interest as regards the City of Dublin, and we are also interested in ensuring that moneys which should go to relieve the charges on travel here in the city will not be taken to cover up and obscure what is going to happen to the rest of the country, and which is going to have the same effect on the rest of the country as it had on the people in the City of Dublin.  People struggling under economic difficulties are going to have, in the first place, more money taken out of their pockets for transport than ought to be taken, and a less satisfactory system of transport.  If Leitrim and Sligo are to develop to-morrow, and are to have increased production to-morrow, they must have efficient and cheap transport to distribute their produce throughout the country, and if the transport system of the country during the next 16 years has to pay £10,000,000 in the way in which this Bill proposes, then Dublin is going to be swollen more and more by people perhaps with less and less employment. But you are not going to have industries <Col N="1770" /> and agriculture developed in Sligo or Leitrim to feed the accumulated population that there is in the eastern counties.  Sligo and Leitrim are the very places which will be hit if we have not cheap and efficient transport.  Do not let Deputies from the country be confused by the suggestion that the Minister is going to take large sums of money out of the pockets of people in the City of Dublin who use transport and apply it to help the people in the rest of the country.</P>

At the meeting at which ex-Judge Wylie tried to get the shareholders over the hurdle of acceptance of those proposals, he said, as far as I remember&mdash;I do not pretend to quote him accurately&mdash;that the figure proposed was higher than any arbitrator would give.  He indicated what it was. It was to pay £14 10s. 0d. in stocks of the new company for every £10 stocks of the Dublin United Transport Company, and he said his opinion was that, if an arbitrator were brought in, the shareholders would not get par value or anything like it.  He was followed by Mr. Tweedy, who went even further than Judge Wylie.  He said that if an arbitrator were called in, so far from getting £14 10s. 0d., the £10 stock would be very seriously written down.  We are proposing to give £14 10s. 0d., and to redeem it by moneys extracted from the people of Sligo and Leitrim as well as from the people of Dublin in the next 16 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  The Minister's goodwill, of course, in a case of that kind, would be put at a very much higher figure than the goodwill of the ordinary Deputy, even a Fianna Fáil Deputy, but I think the Minister will have to go a little bit further if he has any sincere desire to convince the House that that is a correct method of arriving at the figure representing goodwill.</P>
      <P>The Minister made quite a lot out of the meaning of the financial success of the Great Southern Railways Company. The Dublin United Transport Company is undoubtedly a very successful company from a financial point of view at the present time, and I suspect that the appreciated value of its shares in recent years is explained by this fictitiously high figure representing goodwill.  If the same kind of system were applied to the recent successful working of the Great Southern Railways Company, would he tell me what figure for goodwill should appear in the accounts of that company? Surely it is worth £1 or £100 or £1,000 or £1,000,000 on the same kind of argument? The Minister also argued in answer to Deputy Larkin, that the present financial position of the Great Southern Railways Company was partly due&mdash;he would not admit that at all at the beginning of his statements&mdash;to emergency conditions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister talked about increased revenue as compared with increased expenditure.  I would like him to look at the last Great Southern Railways returns.  He tried to convince the House that the expenditure in connection with the running of the Great Southern Railways was merely balancing the increased receipts. Now, for his information, I quote the principal item on the expenditure side of the last balance sheet issued to the shareholders by the Great Southern Railways.  It shows that the receipts from passengers during the year 1943 reached the amazing figure of £1,186,247, compared to the receipts under the same head of £762,697 for the previous year, 1942.  I hope the Minister has these figures in his head or has a copy of the balance sheet in front of him.  The principal item on the expenditure side is: locomotive running expenses at £1,445,459, as compared to a higher figure for the previous year, £1,478,299.  So there was an actual reduction in the principal item representing expenditure, compared to the type of case the Minister tried to get into the minds of Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is entirely wrong, therefore, in suggesting that expenditure is going up in a corresponding way to receipts.  The Minister promised &mdash;and I hope he will carry out his promise&mdash;to make certain in the terms of this Bill that the ordinary layman, <Col N="1773" /> the taxpayer&mdash;who may be involved in the administration of this Bill if there is a deficit&mdash;and the shareholder will be furnished with returns in the future in a way that can be properly understood. This return, the last one published, under the signature of the present chairman-dictator, has a winding-up note as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The financial accounts and statistical returns are issued in an abridged form, but any proprietor who desires to have a copy of the full accounts will be supplied with one on application.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When the Minister is making up his mind as to the type of return which will be furnished in future, under certain regulations to be made by him, I hope he will make certain that they will be furnished to the general public, the shareholders and taxpayers, in a more understandable manner than as presented in the past.  At any rate, I am using the figures I have just quoted to prove that the Minister's argument is not correct.  If additional evidence is necessary, that the present financial position of the company is not entirely due to the efficiency of the management, that evidence can be got from the report of the chairman who presided at the meeting held under the old directors on the 1st March, 1940. Returns that were submitted to that meeting only covered a half year of the emergency period and the chairman, in a number of important points made in his speech, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Undoubtedly, the increased business in the latter half of the year&mdash;</P>
    <P>that is, the first half-year of the emergency period&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;which was mainly merchandise, must be attributed to war conditions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Even the chairman had that in his mind as the reason why the company earned more revenue then.  I am sure the Minister knows&mdash;at any rate, he ought to be able to get confirmation from the present chairman&mdash;as to whether the chairman at that meeting was making an accurate statement or not.  Though it has been repeatedly suggested by the Minister in his many speeches on that section, it is not true to state that the present financial <Col N="1774" /> position and prosperity of the Great Southern Railways is entirely due to the efficiency of the management.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to intervene to correct certain figures I gave.  I gave a calculation as to the amount required to pay 6 per cent. on the existing shareholders' capital of the Dublin United Transport Company which was somewhat incorrect.  I have worked out now that it would take £75,800 to pay 6 per cent. on the existing ordinary and preference share capital of the Dublin United Transport Company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Not including debentures. The amount required to pay 3 per cent. upon the guaranteed stock to be substituted for that would be £54,000, so there would be a saving of about £21,000. Deputy Mulcahy appears to be perturbed by the fact that the company succeeded in paying off some of its loan liabilities.  I think he has failed to appreciate the fact that it is the saving of interest effected by that redemption of the company's debentures which has made more possible the maintenance of the company's fares unchanged during the emergency and brings appreciably nearer the day when a reduction of fares would be possible.  It is a desirable thing that the company should effect that reduction in the interest charges by the methods to which it has resorted.  I think it is a matter for congratulation that the company has been able to do that without any variation in charges and, so far as I know, it can be described as the only municipal transport system in Europe which has not increased its fares during the war.  I know that Deputies may not wish to accept these things, but I think it is something to be proud of and that it is a matter on which we should congratulate the company.</P>

      <P>A couple of years ago. So far as the accounts of the Dublin United Transport Company are concerned, they are prepared in the usual commercial form.  The accounts of the Great Southern Railways&mdash;and of all other railway companies&mdash;are not prepared in the same form, and I think the antiquated system of preparing railway accounts and presenting returns of financial working and the antiquated system of finances of railway companies generally must be abolished. We must try to get from the new company commercial accounts and a balance sheet similar in form to that which the Dublin United Transport Company now presents&mdash;one which will set out on one side its capital liabilities and on the other its evaluation of fixed assets and current assets and show the financial position of the company clearly and accurately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Great Southern Railways, like the Dublin United Transport Company, spent a great deal of money in buying out competitors. The money was spent by it from capital and represents capital expenditure.  They got a return for that expenditure, not in fixed assets but in goodwill, represented by the sole right to provide transport services of that kind in a particular district. I think those are most valuable assets, but you cannot put a finger on them.  It is not like a building, an engine or a car.  It is, nevertheless, something which cost the company a great deal, and something which should be reflected in its balance sheet <Col N="1776" /> until it has been eliminated by the reduction of the capital provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No; it is something much more.  In the case of the Dublin United Transport Company, the company has already succeeded in securing a reduction in capital liabilities, which permits a variation of the goodwill item in the balance sheet.  I think it is a matter to perturb the shareholders of the Dublin United Transport Company that, out of a total of £2,164,000 of assets, £1,649,000 represents goodwill.  I think that is a bad balance sheet, and one that should be remedied as early as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We must, however, recognise the fact that that goodwill does represent money actually paid out and advantages secured in return for that expenditure.  There is one other matter I wish to deal with, and to which reference was made to-day. Deputy McGilligan apparently contends that the terms offered to the shareholders of the Dublin United Transport Company are too favourable. Anyone could have that opinion.  These terms were arrived at as a result of negotiation.  I felt I could defend them.  Deputies have quoted stock exchange values in relation to the Great Southern Railways Company shares.  I notice they are steering clear of stock exchange values in regard to the Dublin United Transport Company shares.  If they think the current stock exchange quotation for the shares is a fair basis for determining the value to be placed upon Great Southern Railways shares, it must equally apply in the case of the Dublin United Transport Company shares, and on the basis of stock exchange values the terms offered to these shareholders are quite reasonable and fair.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not realise the seriousness of the situation when the two people who put themselves forward as the most knowledgeable members of the board of directors of the company, addressing the shareholders, advised them that no arbitrator would give them this amount?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That would depend, of course, entirely upon the arbitrator's terms of reference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>These two people would naturally have before them, first of all, the type of stock the stockholders at present had, what it was being transferred into, and the question as to whether or not there was a Government guarantee behind it.  The two persons who spoke were not likely to forget all these considerations. I do not remember if they set all these things out, but the conclusion of the remarks of one of them was that they would not even get par for their £10 shares, and of the other was that it would be written down much below par, instead of getting £14 10s. I set against that the Minister's statement to-night that what these people are buying is something less than what they have been getting.  He says interest is going to be saved in this transfer.  His figure is £21,000. That means a loss to these people and yet, buying that loss at this figure, these two people say the terms are better than any arbitrator would give them, that they would not even get £10 for the £10 stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Clearly that would depend on what the terms of reference would be.  Some Deputies would say that if we were buying the Dublin United Transport Company we should only buy the fixed assets&mdash;stations, buses, trams, trolleys, overhead wires. The value of these assets is £359,000. They had other current assets represented by stores, sundry debtors, cash in hands at £102,000.  These were the <Col N="1778" /> only tangible assets you would buy.  I think it would be most inequitable to buy the company on the basis of giving only the value of these assets but if that basis were adopted, quite clearly, the amount paid to the company would be a mere fraction of the total sum subscribed by the shareholders and representing the capital of the company. Similarly, if the arbitrator went upon the basis of earnings over a period of years&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite likely he would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;which he possibly would, I doubt very much if the company could hope to get more than ten years' purchase, that is, more than the aggregate earnings of the past ten years.  The shareholders of the company might argue that that was unfair to them, that they had a company which had been in a bad condition, that they of their own initiative reorganised the management, that they had without any suggestion or assistance from the Government effected such improvement in their affairs that their future earning capacity was far in excess of their past earning capacity and that, consequently, acquisition upon the basis of the past earnings would be unfair to them.  These matters are clearly of a character upon which agreement would be difficult to obtain.  I think, in the circumstances, it was much wiser to get agreement upon the actual transfer of shares.  If the shareholders of that company elected to take&mdash;as they did &mdash;guaranteed 3 per cent. debentures in exchange for 6 per cent. preference or ordinary shares, on the basis fixed, it was because, although it did mean a loss of revenue to these shareholders in each year, they knew their position more definitely than if the matter were left to an arbitrator and they knew that the 3 per cent. on the guaranteed stock was secured to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>They will have to. There has been considerable comment in this House and in published reports on transport as to the manner in which the accounts were presented; in other words, they were brought out in such a way that no provision was made for depreciation or adequate allowance made for renewals.  What were called profits were shown and dividends declared out of these.  Is it likely that that sort of thing may happen again this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past the railway company made no provision for depreciation at all.  That was not its method of finance.  They appropriated every year out of gross earnings a certain amount to renewals and maintenance. That arose out of an arrangement with the income-tax authorities.  As I understand it, the company have now made a new arrangement with the income-tax authorities under which they make an appropriation to depreciation instead of this allocation to repairs and renewals.  Last year, for the first time, they did make an appropriation to depreciation of £556,000.  It is intended that that practice will continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite right to say that under the old system depreciation was not provided for but, instead, there was supposed to be adequate provision for renewals.  We know that was not done.  It is confessed in the report.  The railway officials themselves confessed to it.  Notwithstanding that, it is quite clear that each of these companies may declare a dividend this year on a balance sheet which they may draw up which may show a profit by again omitting the appropriate provision for either depreciation or renewals.  Will that be allowed or is there power to control it?  They are given control of the accounts up to February or March, 1945.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of opinion, at any time, as to whether the company made adequate provision for repairs and renewals, or whether they should have provided a larger figure, and how much larger figure.  I do not know whether anyone could offer an opinion on that subject.  The judgment of one individual will be different from the judgment of another.  Quite clearly, the company is entitled in law to devote to dividends moneys which some other person might consider should be more prudently spent upon the renewal of its assets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The only benefit railway companies have as opposed to ordinary trading companies is that they are not bound to make provision for depreciation before they declare a dividend.  They may, therefore, as they have done on many occasions&mdash; and it has been the subject of very adverse comment in the courts&mdash;declare dividends at times when an ordinary trading company would be guilty of malpractice if they had declared it.  The alternative method was adopted of making provision for renewals.  That is an arbitrary thing.  It can vary.  We know that the tradition of the Great Southern Railways Company was not to make adequate provision, and in that way they have declared in 16 years dividends amounting to £4,000,000 at a time when it was quite clear by the minority report that if they had made adequate provision for renewals they could not have paid even their debentures, let alone any dividends.  Is it possible that they are going to be allowed to continue that practice up to the last year of their existence?</P>

      <P>I am saying that the obligation is on the board of the company to see that revenue is properly spent both in respect of the maintenance of the company's assets and its future earning power.  I think it is misleading to say that the company paid out in dividends more than they earned in the past 10 or 16 years. They had reserves.  Some people might hold that the reserves they held as a result of the payment they had received from the British Government should have been entirely used in repairing damage to the line which occurred when it was under British control.  The company kept the balance, left out of those reserves, for the payment of dividends, and paid out dividends year after year in excess of revenue earned, but they were able to do so because of the reserves that they had.  I think that all the reserve funds are now exhausted, and all that is available now is the sum in excess of revenue for maintenance.</P>

      <P>In line 3, after the word &ldquo;undertakings&rdquo; to add the words &ldquo;including all assets and liabilities&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment was put down by Deputy Hughes and myself merely to clarify any doubt which may exist as to the meaning of the word &ldquo;undertakings&rdquo;. We take it that it is undesirable that the new company should be empowered, as a result of its establishment, <Col N="1784" /> to evade any liabilities or undertakings which the old company had, and the purpose of the amendment is merely to ensure that all the assets and all the liabilities of the dissolved companies shall be taken over by the new one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is not necessary.  There is an Act, called the Railways Clauses Act, 1863, which makes full provision for the amalgamation of statutory transport undertakings. We have incorporated that Act in this Bill, and that makes the provisions in that Act part of this Bill.  These provisions relate to the carry over of rights, liabilities, and so forth, everything there has been transferred except in so far as special provision has been made to deal with certain matters in the Bill.  The Deputy will notice that in Section 7 of the Bill there is the necessary clause, which is to the following effect:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Part V of the Railways Clauses Act, 1863, is subject to the provisions of this Part, incorporated with, and forms part of, this Part, and in the construction of the said Part V for the purposes of such incorporation&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) this Part shall be deemed to be a special Act,</P>
      <P>(b) the dissolved transport company shall be deemed to be a railway company, and</P>
      <P>(c) Section 54 of the said Act shall have effect as if the words &ldquo;until the expiration of 12 months after the time of amalgamation or&rdquo; and the words &ldquo;whichever first happens&rdquo; were not contained therein.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The same thing applies here.  All these matters are provided for in the Railways Clauses Act, 1863. Part V of that Act deals with the question of amalgamation.  Section 39 of the Act provides that the Special Acts relating to or affecting the dissolved company or their undertakings in force at the passing of the Amalgamating Act shall, except so far as they are thereby expressed to be varied or repealed, remain in full force.  Section 40 deals with debts and claims of dissolved companies, and says that, except as may be otherwise provided in the Special Act, all debts and claims of the dissolved company shall be payable and paid by or to the amalgamated company.  Section 41 deals with all deeds, conveyances, grants, assignments, leases, purchases, sales, contracts, and so on, and all obligations and liabilities of the dissolved company existing prior to the amalgamation. All these clauses are now incorporated in this Bill by reason of the incorporation in the Railways Clauses Act.</P>

The position is that when the company starts, the total paid-up capital at the outset will be £13,401,000, of which £9,875,000 will be redeemable stock and £3,525,000 common stock.

      <P>Very well.  If the Minister will be happier about it we can discuss it on Section 16 rather than on this section.  There is just this one definite point: why such an enormous amount of temporary capital is being provided, especially when we take into consideration that this temporary capital is going to give way to excessive transport charges and that at a time when we cannot afford it.  We cannot afford that in the interests of the economy of the country, in the interests of the cost of living of <Col N="1791" /> our people and of our competitive position.</P>

      <P>On Section 13 I suggest that amendments Nos. 18 to 27a, which deal with one major issue about stock, might be discussed together. The amendments in Deputy McGilligan's name should, I submit, be treated as a scheme, with the debate on amendment No. 18.  Amendment No. 27a might be considered as an alternative scheme and discussed at the same time, a separate decision being given, if desired, on it.  Deputy Mulcahy may like to have a decision on amendment No. 19.  I suggest to the House that a more valuable and orderly discussion would take place if amendments Nos. 18 to 27a were discussed as a comprehensive scheme.</P>

      <P>There are just three points in my amendments.  The first is that we should regard as proprietors of the company those who were proprietors at a particular date before the chairman's speech; the second point is to say what those people are to get; and the third point would arise with regard to those people who have crept into the company since March, 1943&mdash; that they should be treated in an entirely different manner.  I would like to get a decision on each of these three points in the amendments.</P>

      <P>I am wondering whether it would not be better to have a separate debate on the amendment dealing with &ldquo;-establishment date&rdquo;. The idea of striking out &ldquo;establishment date&rdquo; and substituting the other date is a definite, clear idea.  If that were decided first we might get a more satisfactory debate on the other.</P>
