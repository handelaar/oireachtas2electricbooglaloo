      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that during the past six months dollar coupons held in this country have been refused encashment by the Irish banks on the grounds that such coupons on being presented in America are impounded by the United States Treasury; whether, in fact, this statement is correct, and, if so, to what extent it refers to coupons held in this country by citizens who are holders of dollar securities; whether he will state if any representations have been made to the United States Government with reference to the matter, and if so, with what result; further, whether it is the intention of his Department to make temporary advances in proper cases to holders of dollar coupons who are unable for the time being to obtain cash for such coupons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that due to prevailing circumstances, Irish banks accept coupons which are payable in foreign currencies, or in foreign countries, only on the basis that the customer will be credited with the amount of the coupons when the bank has succeeded in collecting the proceeds abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An amendment of the United States of America currency laws at the end of 1942 had the effect that United <Col N="1778" /> States dollar coupons sent for collection from certain places, including this country, are impounded in U.S.A. on arrival, and applications for the release and subsequent encashment of the coupons must be accompanied by evidence of ownership of the coupons and of the relevant bonds.  The evidence of ownership normally required is an affidavit in triplicate made by the owner or by his agent on a very detailed form prescribed for that purpose by the United States authorities. Representations were made to the United States Government about the matter, and while no general modification of the law in favour of Irish residents could be secured, a simplified method of proving ownership in the case of such residents was devised and brought into effect.  That arrangement, however, has not been found entirely satisfactory in practice by the United States authorities, for reasons which have not yet been conveyed to me, but further representations have been made and an early decision thereon by the United States authorities has been promised.</P>
    <P>The matter is being kept under constant review and I will continue to make every effort to assist the interested persons in their attempts to secure encashment of their coupons, but I regret that I cannot agree to the making of advances as suggested by the Deputy.</P>

Two accommodation bridges spanning the Dungolman river in the townlands of Keel and Gortmore respectively are, however, included in the works set out in the final award dated 29th September, 1852, for the Dungolman drainage district.  The joint drainage committee appointed by the County Councils of Longford and Westmeath is responsible for the maintenance of the district.</P>

      <P>Representations were previously made to me on the matter mentioned by the Deputy.  The unemployment position in the area in which the proposed drainage works fall would not warrant a grant from employment schemes moneys, but I have caused the beneficiaries to be informed that, if they make application under the new rural improvements scheme, which requires a contribution from the beneficiaries, it will be duly considered. I should say that drainage works cannot generally be carried out economically except in the summer months, during which period, owing to the requirements of tillage and turf production, workers may not be available.</P>

The restriction on emigration of such workers from County Mayo, as from other areas in which a similar restriction applies, is in the interests of agricultural and fuel production to meet the needs of this country. It does not apply to migratory workers who have habitually gone to seasonal agricultural employment in Great Britain or to young members of their families accompanying them to such employment.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that lock-keepers on the Royal Canal are not notified of the increase of wages or bonus which has been granted to employees of other public bodies: that Mr. Thomas Rodgers, of Ards <Col N="1785" /> Kenagh, who has charge of three locks, is at present receiving a wage of only £1 7s. 6d. per week, although when he was working on one lock his wage was £1 10s. 0d. per week; that Mr. Rodgers is on duty from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. when a boat is operating there, and that he must support a wife and nine children; and if he will take steps to have this man's wages increased.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No application for a Bonus Order, applicable to lock-keepers on the Royal Canal, has been made.  The control of wages effected by Emergency Powers (No. 260) Order does not apply, in rural areas, to remuneration which is more than 1/- per week below the minimum agricultural rate.  It is therefore open to Mr. Rodgers' employers to increase his present remuneration without the authority of a Bonus Order.  I have, however, no power to enforce the payment of any particular rate of wages for this occupation.  I have been informed that Mr. Rodgers' remuneration is 29/6 per week, in addition to a cottage and a plot of land, free of rent, and that his duties are nominal and would not represent more than about a half-day's work per week.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that there are not sufficient applicants to rent the number of allotments available for cultivation in Dublin; and if, in view of these circumstances, he will apply the benefits of the free seed and allotments scheme to the old age pensioners who have applied for allotments.</P>

      <P>The provision of allotments in Dublin is a matter for the Corporation of Dublin, who are empowered to provide allotments for persons resident in their area who desire to cultivate them.  My Department is only concerned to the extent to which allotments are provided for and let to unemployed persons at a nominal rent in accordance with the Acquisition of Land (Allotments) (Amendment) Act, 1934.  In such cases the loss to the local authority in providing allotments at a nominal rent is met by a State grant. The supply of free seeds, etc., is a matter for the Department of Agriculture. The circumstances mentioned by the Deputy, if they exist, would not enable the benefits of that Act to be extended to any classes other than unemployed persons as defined by the Act and regulations thereunder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that men who were given plots as unemployed men at the ages of 68 and 69 and who enjoyed the advantages of the free seeds scheme administered by the Minister for Agriculture, were quite recently, when they became 70 years of age, classed as employed men and had to pay the full rates out of their old age pensions for these plots? The result was that a very large number of them were compelled to surrender their plots because they would not get the benefit of the scheme <Col N="1787" /> as unemployed men, although they are still unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the statements made by the Deputy are correct.  I have no knowledge of the circumstances of these particular persons, but I can say that as the net income which might be earned by an ordinary cultivator of these plots is £10 or £11 per year, I do not see why they should surrender the plots.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister assumes that what I have stated is not correct but, if he finds on inquiry that it is correct, will he see that old age pensioners, who were given plots in the last three or four years, at a time when they were about 65 or 66 years of age, and who were deprived of the benefit of the allotment scheme on reaching the age of 70, will have the benefits of this scheme restored to them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <P>I have nothing to add to the reply already given.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the scheme was introduced for the primary purpose of producing more food, and also in view of the fact that many of the people, who are now placed outside this scheme because they have reached the age of 70, would work these plots to much greater advantage than the people who have been since put into possession of them, would the Minister reconsider this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is under a misapprehension.  The Act under which these plots were allocated to the unemployed was passed in 1934 and the definite purpose was to maintain in an employable condition a person who was temporarily unemployed.  The assumption is that a person who has reached the age of 70 is not employable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that, whatever may have been the intention in 1934, the real purpose behind this scheme at present and very properly so is that more food should be produced in this country? The Minister knows that many <Col N="1788" /> men of 70 years of age could get far more food out of these plots than a lot of the people who have not reached 70 years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made a statement that any person of 70 years of age cannot be considered employable.  Will he convey that view to the authorities in charge of the distribution of allotments and free seeds so that old age pensioners may be permitted to avail of these schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If the primary purpose of the scheme was to produce food, then obviously the allotments should be given to men who are vigorous and whose physique will enable them to cultivate them properly. There is great demand for these plots.  Persons who are unemployed are given special preference.  Any balance over is immediately applied for by people who can cultivate them and who are prepared to pay an economic rent for them and who can produce an ample quantity of food out of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick and Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that the road leading to the village of Muckersaun, near the Neale, County Mayo, is flooded for a period, sometimes for three months together. despite the fact that minor repairs were carried out on it some time ago, and if he will take immediate action to have this remedied in view of the fact that it is the only road accommodating 14 households.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The responsibility for this work rests with the local authority.  My Department does not keep records of the various stages of ordinary road maintenance works except in cases where State grants are involved. In this case it has been ascertained that the county council made provision to the extent of £320 in the present year for the improvement of the road, that the work began <Col N="1789" /> about the end of August, 1943, but had to be temporarily suspended as the surveyor was unable to obtain the necessary supply of stone from the local farmers.  Work, however, is again in progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that I cannot give any assurance in regard to that matter.  As I have said, the work was stopped because a supply of materials was not readily forthcoming. A supply is now being maintained and I understand that work is being resumed.  If, however, any further difficulty is experienced with regard to materials, I cannot give the Deputy an assurance that a supply will be forthcoming.</P>

Separate figures as to the numbers of (1) contributory and (2) non-contributory beneficiaries in receipt of food vouchers are not available.  The inquiry as to the cost of such vouchers should be addressed to the Department of Industry and Commerce by which the food voucher scheme is administered.</P>

      <P>In this case there was no refusal to sanction the provision of uniforms.  In September last when the Wexford County Manager submitted a proposal that an allowance for uniform be granted to the domestic staffs of the hospitals he was informed that it would be more satisfactory to provide them with uniforms, and I see no adequate reason why this course should not be followed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The vacancy for a medical officer for the Fontstown dispensary district occurred on the 9th November last.  A slight delay arose pending the making of a general Order declaring the qualifications for the office of dispensary medical officer, the terms of which have now been settled in consultation with the Local Appointments Commissioners.  In the meantime, however, a proposal to alter the boundaries of some dispensary districts, including Fontstown, is under consideration by the county council, and it may now prove necessary to defer the filling of the permanent post until a decision on the question of boundaries is reached.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he has received from the commissioner administering the affairs of the Dublin County Council the scheme for the provision of water and sewerage arrangements in Tallaght, County Dublin, prepared by the officials of the county council; and, if so, whether he will state the reason for the delay in giving his sanction for its execution; whether he is aware that the village <Col N="1793" /> of Tallaght is in a very neglected and dangerous state because of the absence of water and sewerage, and whether, if the commissioner has not submitted for approval the scheme prepared some years ago, he will ascertain the reason for the delay in doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is misinformed regarding the preparation of water and sewerage schemes for Tallaght.  The position is that in 1934, the engineers of the former Dublin Board of Public Health reported to the board as to the possibility of obtaining water in the vicinity of Tallaght.  The board decided in 1935 to await the completion of the Liffey scheme before taking further action.  No sewerage scheme was prepared by the former board.  The questions as to sanction and delay do not therefore arise.  I am aware that it is desirable to provide Tallaght with both water and sewerage, and that the county commissioner has had the position under consideration and proposes to carry out water and sewerage works as soon as circumstances permit.</P>

      <P>I have had inquiry made into the matters raised by the Deputy and I am assured by the Land Commission that there is no foundation, in fact, for the suggestions in his question.  The Scatternagh lands mentioned were the subject of a public auction from which no applicant was debarred from bidding.  Only one bid was, in fact, made and that bid was for £1 per acre.  In the absence of any other hope of letting the lands, this bid was reluctantly accepted by the auctioneer, after consultation with the Land Commission inspector in attendance.</P>
      <P>As regards the last part of the Deputy's question, I am not aware of any such practice as the giving of lands before an auction can take place. I would be glad to know what particular grounds, if any, the Deputy has for this statement.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to what extent the grants are being availed of by private persons for putting houses in order and if tenement owners in Dublin have the right to make application to put some houses in good order that are unfit for habitation in the City of Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to deal with that.  The Act is confined merely to houses which have been built in rural areas by private individuals or public utility societies and, in urban areas, by public utility societies.  It does not deal with individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the Government are anxious to build houses.  I believe they are giving a very good lead in that respect and have done very good work during the years they have been in office.  I want, however, to put this seriously to the Minister and to ask him to take serious notice of it.  To my mind, it is a very serious matter in connection with the erection of houses.  It refers to private individuals who endeavour to erect houses for themselves and who have had to collect a couple of hundred pounds and then go to the local authority and borrow money from them.  There is very little use in giving grants unless the loan that is given is of some value to the person who endeavours to build a house for himself.  The best way I can put this to the Minister is to give a concrete example of what happens in respect of a person who puts £300 or £400 together and then goes to the local authority to borrow the money to erect a house for himself.  I will give him exact figures which I have checked up, because a statement in respect of this appeared in a local newspaper and I made it my business to go to the local authority and check up on the figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here is what happens.  A man gets a loan of £535 from the local authority.  He pays 13 instalments of £8 7s. 10d. each.  In that time he has paid a considerable amount of money.  But out of that he has only paid off £49 14s. 9d. of the <Col N="1810" /> original loan.  The local authority say that out of £33 11s. 4d. that he pays £7 16s. 0d. is all of the original loan that he has paid off&mdash;the rest is interest. He has to make annual payments for 35 years and for that loan of £535 he pays back £1,174 16s. 8d. That is the total amount that he pays for the loan of £535.  In other words, he pays back the £535, plus £639 16s. 8d. interest, or £104 16s. 8d. more in interest than the amount of the loan he got</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to consider whether, while that system of loan, that price for money, is in operation people are likely to try to build houses or to borrow £500 or £600 from a local authority and pay back at least two and a half times as much in 35 years. That is the one point I want to put to the Minister, and I think it is worthy of consideration.  The grant that is available is of no value so long as that system continues.  Nobody will attempt to build houses so long as that price for money is in operation.  No one can change that except the Minister.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to follow the Deputy into the broad question of the creation of credit and the cost of it to this country.  But there is a matter in regard to this grant for houses which I wish to put to the Minister.  I think everybody is strongly in favour of housing grants and the building of houses in any way we can.  But all these excellent schemes are materially injured if something approximating to fraud begins to manifest itself in connection with the administration of them.  I want to communicate to the House a case that came before the Public Accounts Committee and which, I think, was commented upon, but which no one seems to have taken any notice of, and which, in my opinion, will seriously affect the whole of this housing business if allowed to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A gentleman in County Leitrim applied for two housing grants in respect of two houses.  The grants were authorised, and he was told to proceed with the building.  The gentleman <Col N="1811" /> built two houses in one block.  One of the houses had three bedrooms and a drawing-room, and nothing else.  The other house had only a kitchen, a scullery, one bedroom, and out-house, a lavatory and, I think, a bathroom. There was no kitchen in the other house, only three bedrooms and a drawing-room.  The second house had, I think, a lavatory and a bathroom, but certainly a kitchen and a scullery, and, I think, one bedroom.  The inspector, when he came to inspect this pair of houses, said: &ldquo;These are not two houses at all; there is only one house.&rdquo;  The gentleman said: &ldquo;No, there are two houses, and I want two grants.&rdquo;  He got two grants.  The inspector went back after the fellow had got the grants and found that he had broken in a door between the two houses, and, so far as my recollection serves me, he had converted the hall-door in one of the houses into a window.</P>

There are certain public utility societies in this country and they get the person building the houses to make the application for a grant through the society.  This House knows how they arise, as regards 95 per cent. of the new public utility societies: they were Fianna Fáil clubs.  That is a notorious fact.  There were four or five respectable old public utility societies before 1933, and they were functioning and working in the interests of the public.  Then an attempt was made by the Government to turn all the Fianna Fáil clubs into public utility societies in order to provide a £10 bribe in the erection of houses.</P>

I dealt with the case, but I also dealt. with it on this Bill and this Estimate last year, as it had been, in fact, raised then by Deputy Dillon.  This is the case of one particular society.

It started in 1936 and it reached maturity in 1943 and is, no doubt, continuing still.  It so happens that one grantee comes to me in 1943 and says: &ldquo;The scandal you first revealed in 1936 is still going on.  We are still being held out of our money, because this public utility society said to itself that it will not complete its forms for years after failure to do so was first brought under the attention of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I know it to be perfectly true and I now state that the primary object in providing £10 additional for persons in rural Ireland applying through public utility societies was a <Col N="1817" /> corrupt effort to force people to join Fianna Fáil clubs and apply through that agency for their housing grant.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to secure that public utility societies so constituted will be required to conform to the terms of the law, and see that the person who applies for grants through that medium will get them within a reasonable time.  As the Minister points out, I raised this matter in 1936, and on every main Estimate down to this.  Here, in 1943, the Minister is obliged to confess that, in respect of a society first brought to his attention in 1936, he has to take executive action from his own office before he can secure for the grantee payment of a grant to which the Minister knows that grantee was entitled.  Surely, if we are to vote, time and again, money to public utility societies for the purpose of the Housing Acts, we should distinguish between the honest public utility societies, which are old-established and respected institutions in the State, and the new breed of public utility societies, constructed for the purpose of recruiting members of the Fianna Fáil Party, which societies have now drifted into a condition in which they are an inefficient and incompetent blister on the body politic and on the housing schemes at present in operation. I ask the Minister, before he comes to the House again for money to be distributed through public utility societies, to give this House guarantees that the public utility societies through which he proposes to operate will have completed their statutory duties and conformed to the requirements which he prescribes in order to ensure that they are <i>bona fide</i> bodies, and that any public utility society which has repeatedly failed promptly to discharge its statutory obligations will be dissolved, so that the grantees will not <Col N="1818" /> be left out of their money in the future, as they have been in the past.</P>
      <P>I should expect from the Minister an eager willingness to collaborate with me in putting an end to these abuses rather than his attitude of apparent, indignant repudiation of the case I am making.  He knows that the case, I am making to him is true and just.  He knows that a great many people in the country have been cruelly ill-treated by these societies and he ought to put an end to it.  I warn him that, unless he does, every time Estimates of this kind come before the House I shall remind it of the true state of affairs in relation to these public utility societies and press in every way I can for their prompt reform.</P>

      <P>I should like to avail of this opportunity to pay my meed of praise to the work the public utility societies have done for the very poor applicants.  The societies have had to conform to the statutory requirements and have their accounts audited.  If they did not do that, they were struck off the list. Apart altogether from the £10 grant, the main service which the public utility societies rendered to the applicants for houses was, in my opinion, in the matter of obtaining credit for the supplies of materials.  My experience has been that, in the very backward districts, particularly, these people were refused credit for supplies of building materials and, if it were not for the co-operative efforts of the public utility societies, they would not have been able to build their houses. A great many people who are now enjoying the blessing of dry and sanitary houses would not have that blessing if it were not for these co-operative methods.  I do not know of any other method better calculated to serve the people in this respect than that of the public utility society.  I think that it is quite unfair that the vast number of these societies should now be pilloried in this way&mdash;</P>

      <P>There may be exceptions, as there always are where large numbers are operating but, taken generally, I think that these societies have <Col N="1819" /> rendered very good service.  That service has now been interrupted because they are not operating to any large extent at present.  My intention in rising was primarily to agree with Deputy Hogan.  I am very much concerned with the question as to the large element of interest contained in the rents of these houses in urban areas. But I do not think that making representations to the Minister or to the Government will bring about any alteration&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have a suggestion to make to which Deputy Hogan's organisations could probably give effect better than any other bodies I know: I refer to the trade unions.  I mentioned this at the last general election in Galway. It is a matter of very considerable importance in Galway City, where rents are high.  The trade union movement has the necessary organisation. Some of these trade unions are very wealthy&mdash;perhaps the wealthiest bodies in the country.  With their membership, they could procure good, safe tenants.  What I think they should do is demonstrate to the Government how this element of interest could be cut out.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has raised a big issue on this Estimate for £10.  With regard to the points raised by Deputy Dillon, it is a great pity that he did not find other subjects for the exercise of his eloquence on a debate on a Supplementary Estimate. For it is not the first time that the Deputy has raised these matters.  One criticism related to certain things which occurred in Cavan.  The Deputy has indicated that it came under the review of the Public Accounts Committee.  The report of the Committee which investigated that occurrence was laid before the House.  The observations of the Committee have been dealt with by my Department and I stand or fall by what has already been done in regard to them.  Deputy Dillon, occupying a responsible position as Chairman of the <Col N="1822" /> Public Accounts Committee, surely knows that if he wishes to debate in the House any matter reviewed by the committee, the proper way to do it is to put down a motion.</P>

      <P>With regard to the South Roscommon public utility society, I would like to point out to the House that utility societies have been responsible for the provision of over 13,000 new houses in rural areas. Those houses have been built for agricultural labourers, people with small farms and occupiers of land with valuations of £5, £10 and £15.  The building of over 13,000 houses is a very creditable achievement.  I cannot say what is the number of public utility societies responsible for the building of these houses, but it is certainly very large.  Out of that large number Deputy Dillon has been able to single out only one society for criticism. There has not been another case requiring review in this House except this one, which came under Deputy Dillon's notice as far back as 1936.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Came under review,&rdquo; anyhow.  It is quite true that <Col N="1823" /> the history of this society has been unsatisfactory, but we have not any responsibility for the conduct of public utility societies, and no responsibility for the relations which exist between members of these societies and their society.  That is a matter entirely for the members themselves.  All we are concerned with is this: if the society can establish a claim to a grant, it gets the grant.  What it does with the grant we do not know.  If the general arrangement is that the grant is passed on to some member who has built a house, and it is not so passed on, we have no responsibility, for we do not deal with the individual but with the society.</P>
      <P>The real point is that Deputy Dillon has got up here and made a very serious charge against public utility societies in general and has been able to substantiate that charge only by referring to one society which, admittedly, was unsatisfactory, and which was struck off the register because it had been unsatisfactory so far back as the year 1942.</P>

It was found that we could not pay the society as the necessary returns had not been furnished.  However, they were furnished to the Registrar of Friendly Societies in November, 1943, before my Estimate was discussed&mdash;</P>

      <P>The main sum required for the children's allowances scheme will, of course, be voted in respect of the financial year 1944-45, but certain expenditure will arise this year by reason of the fact that staff has to be put on the task of preparing the scheme, and certain advertising has to be undertaken.  For that reason, it is necessary to take a token Vote to enable the cost to be defrayed.  It hoped to appoint May 1st as the appointed day under the scheme, and to commence the payment of allowances on August 1st.</P>

Some time ago <Col N="1826" /> a selection board was set up to interview applicants for such posts in the Department of Supplies and in the Department of Industry and Commerce. A very large number of applicants was interviewed and placed in order of merit by the selection board. As temporary vacancies arise in either Department people are called from that list, that is, the list of those who were recommended by the selection board for that type of employment.  Occasionally, of course, people who are called for employment are disemployed, and, again, they go back on the list and have another chance of reemployment. The procedure has always been to call people from the list of candidates approved by the selection board, and it is not yet exhausted.</P>

The selection board which prepared the present list met some time before the end of 1942, or early in 1943.  The list of candidates approved by the board, and in the order approved, has been in use since. I may have misled Deputy Lynch.  I should have said that any person who applied at that time, and who appeared suitable, was permitted to go before the selection board together with all those whose names were sent forward by the employment exchange.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This may be described as the annual Bill to continue in operation, for another year, the Seeds and Fertilisers Act.  I should like, in order that there may be no misunderstanding of the ambit of the Bill, to remind the House that this is not an agricultural credit Bill, in the proper sense of the term.  It is a merely a Bill to enable necessitous persons who may have a plot of land to secure credit to obtain seeds and fertilisers in order to provide food for themselves and their families in the first instance, and, if of course they have a surplus of food to dispose of it to other persons.  The Bill, as I have said, is an annual one and it has been fairly generally availed of.  Every county council has adopted the measure, and put schemes into operation under it.  It is also a validating Bill in so far as it validates the requests which were made to local authorities to put a measure of this sort into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has stated, this is an annual Bill which comes before the House for approval. It is reasonable enough.  It is intended to help certain people who cannot secure credit by any other method than that provided in the Bill.  I have nothing to say against it except that it does not go far enough in the matter of providing credit, especially during this emergency, in order to enable people to meet the needs of an expanding system of food production.  The <Col N="1829" /> scheme of the Bill makes no attempt to deal with that problem.  I might also say that neither has the Government made any attempt to deal with that problem.  One must appreciate the big amount of finance that is involved in carrying through an expanding system of food production, in the amount of equipment that is required, the cost of ploughing, cultivating and preparing seed beds, the cost of providing seeds and manures.  When one thinks of all that, one begins to realise that there is a very considerable sum of money involved before the producer can hope to cash-in on his work and on his effort.</P>
      <P>We all know that quite a number of people find it very difficult to provide the necessary capital to enable them to expand their production, especially in those areas where they had no equipment for tillage purposes in the past.  In previous years I have criticised this measure from that point of view.  In the Principal Act there is no limitation as to the amount of credit that may be guaranteed, but in actual practice local authorities do not go beyond £10 or £15.  That is the extent to which credit is provided in particular instances.  If people want greater assistance they have to try to secure it from traders and merchants. It is true, of course, that, generally speaking, credit facilities are provided all over the country to a great extent, especially where people are credit-worthy.  That, however, has this disadvantage, that a producer securing credit in that way from a merchant is more or less tied to him in the sale of his produce and does not enjoy the advantages of a free market. However, I suppose the Minister is not concerned with that aspect of the problem; he is merely interested in getting the approval of the House for this measure, which attempts to provide, in a very small way, credit facilities for people unable otherwise to secure them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has not given any information as to the amount of credit provided in the past year or in previous years.  I should like to know the trend of this type of credit in recent years.  Has it had an upward or a <Col N="1830" /> downward trend?  It might be interesting if Deputies had some information on that point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the proper Department to administer this Bill is the Department of Agriculture.  I can never understand the mentality of the Department of Local Government in respect of the treatment of rural and urban holdings.  There is quite a different system in operation in respect of plot holders in urban areas.  It is considered right to give them free seeds and fertilisers and even free implements, but as regards the plot holders in the rural areas, who are endeavouring to do exactly the same thing as the plot holders in the urban areas, they are not given any such facilities. Can the Minister explain why, in the urban areas, such facilities are given to plot holders, while in the rural areas, almost across the road as it were, the cottier or plot holder does not get free seeds, fertilisers or manures?  The rural plot holder has to pay the local authority for everything he gets and now, with the managerial system in operation, the screw is being put on and these plot holders are being forced to pay to the last penny.</P>
      <P>I think the Department of Local Government does not appreciate the good that the plot holders in the country are doing.  If they got a little more encouragement they would produce more food for themselves and their families and relieve the situation from the point of view of town dwellers.  I do not suppose the Minister is prepared to alter the system.  I think the proper Department to deal with this Bill is the Department of Agriculture, which might see the necessity of increasing food production and enabling these people in the rural areas, cottiers and plot holders, the people who are making possible a good deal of food production, to get the same facilities as the dwellers in the urban areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Hogan is under a misapprehension. The position of plot holders in urban areas is that they have to rent their plots&mdash;pay economic rents for them&mdash;<Col N="1831" /> and provide themselves with seeds and fertilisers afterwards.  Under existing legislation persons in receipt of unemployment insurance or unemployment assistance are entitled to get plots for a nominal amount and are given seeds and fertilisers.  That legislation was enacted to encourage unemployed persons to utilise the period during which they were idle, to utilise it in some way that would be beneficial to themselves.  I should like to say, in that connection, that the rather extraordinary thing about it is that the number of employed persons who have taken plots, at any rate in the City of Dublin, and who pay an economic rent, greatly exceeds the number of unemployed persons who took plots, even though they got the plots for nothing and got seeds and fertilisers free.  However, there is no real comparison to be made between the purpose which this Bill has in view and the purpose which the Allotments Act sought to serve.  The intention here is to assist those people who happen to be in the occupation or the ownership of small plots and who are in necessitous circumstances&mdash;to secure for themselves such seeds and fertilisers as will enable them to use their land usefully.  As Deputy Hughes pointed out, the scheme is not an agricultural credit scheme; it is a social service and, therefore, comes more properly under the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hughes asked me to give particulars with reference to the operation of this scheme.  In 1940 the number of recipients of loans under the Act was 3,157 and the amount involved was £17,139; in 1941 the number of loans granted was 9,269 and the total amount involved was £56,285.  The scheme was then operated by 26 county councils.  In 1942 the number of loans granted amounted to 5,509, representing a total sum of £38,678.  There were still 26 county councils operating the scheme.  Last year the number of loans amounted to 5,423 and the aggregate amount involved was £43,580.  Twenty-seven county councils, in all, operated the scheme.  The average sum involved for each borrower was about £8.</P>

Article 27 of the Constitution provides that in certain circumstances a joint petition may be presented by members of both Houses of the Oireachtas to the President asking him not to promulgate a law until it has been submitted to the people.  That Article of the Constitution provides that the signatures to such a petition shall be verified in the manner prescribed by law.  The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the verification of signatures to a petition.  The sections are self-explanatory.  Section 1, provides for the verification by the Clerk of the House or, failing him, in the case of a Deputy who is absent in the country or unable to attend here, by a Justice of the District Court, a Commissioner of Oaths or an officer of the Gárda Síochana not below the rank of Superintendent. Section 2 deals similarly with verification of signatures of members of the Seanad.  Section 3 provides that whenever a petition is presented to the President it shall be lawful for the President to accept the verification of a signature in accordance with Sections 1 and 2 of the Bill, whichever applies, as being sufficient.  Section 4 makes it an offence to forge a signature or to affix a signature which purports to be that of a person other than the person actually signing the petition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>All the amendments are of the same tenor.  The purpose is to prevent the retrospective intentions set out in the Bill.  The matter to which this amending Bill relates was explained on the Second Reading by the Minister, and it is felt by those affected that the retrospective provisions would be a grave hardship upon many pensioners, particularly those in the lower categories.  As I understand it, the purpose is that when arrears of pensions are made payable, sections of the Act of 1934 mentioned in the amending Bill shall operate and have the effect of suspending payments relating to those arrears.  The intention of the amendment is that the idea of applying the suspension of the abatements in the case of those employed in the Civil Service, or who derive money from the Central Fund, should not apply until after the present emergency. As the case was made that this is an attempt on the part of some parties to drive a coach and four through the provisions of that Act, I <Col N="1836" /> want to assure the House and the Minister that we are not concerned, and have not any sympathy, with such an attempt.  We are concerned with the fact that at present, with the increased cost of living, suspension of pensions under sections in this Bill would impose very grave hardship, particularly on the Old I.R.A. forces that would come under the implementation of its provisions.  We know that it is quite within the order of things that the Minister should come to the House in an endeavour to save the Central Fund a sum, estimated at £300,000, but we think the paramount consideration should be the justice of the case irrespective of the amount involved. It should be the dictum in law that justice should reign even though the heavens fall.</P>
      <P>If the idea of this Bill, with its retrospective slant, is to be passed by the House, it would appear that the new idea of law is that justice should reign if it does not cost the Exchequer too much.  That would be a lamentable state of affairs, and I should like to argue this, first of all, from the point of view of elementary justice, and, secondly, from the point of view that this amending Bill should be suspended during the period of the present emergency, since it would appear that the Bill was introduced because some people might derive certain benefits during the emergency.  First of all, we understand that the introduction of this Bill is an attempt by the Minister to forestall a case that might come before the courts.  We do not know whether any such case has been cited, but, if so, it would appear that the Minister has been trying to put in an amendment to the Bill before such a case could be tried.  As far as this particular amendment is concerned, we say, in effect, that whether the Minister is right in his interpretation of the original Act or not, or whether the other people concerned are right in their interpretation, the provisions of the Act concerned should be suspended pending the duration of the present emergency, because of the hardship imposed on these pensioners under the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept this amendment.  There is no question but that the object of the amendment is to make the Bill inoperative, and for that reason I cannot accept it.  Deputy Connolly seems to be badly informed with regard to the circumstances which led to the introduction of this Bill. The implementation of the Bill will not affect any member of the Old I.R.A., any more than he has been affected by any of the various Bills that have been introduced during almost the past 20 years.  This Bill merely makes certain that a flaw&mdash;if there is a flaw&mdash;which appears to exist, will be removed.</P>
      <P>Of course, lawyers differ on such questions, but it was necessary to remove that flaw, if it existed, so as to see that the Act would continue to function in the future as it has functioned during the past 20 years.  There is no case before the courts either, and, accordingly, the Deputy does not seem to be well informed.  Nobody, apparently has attempted to challenge this matter in the courts, but, in case there should be such a challenge, we are taking time by the forelock, so to speak, by ensuring that the sums of money that would be likely to be involved as a result of the successful termination of such a case will not be given away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Connolly&mdash;and I myself, for that matter&mdash;will agree that there are certain duties to be carried out so far as the Old I.R.A. men are concerned, and I think that these duties have been fairly carried out under the various Acts that have been passed by the Oireachtas; but it must also be remembered that we have duties to the taxpayers, and if we have, as has been stated, dealt with all the individuals concerned in a reasonably generous fashion, I do not see why we should go out of our way to add another £300,000 to the large sum that is being spent annually in respect of these pensions.  I should like to say also that the passing of this Bill will not affect in any respect any individual concerned, any more than he has been affected in the past.  We know that there are some people in the public service of this country, in receipt of <Col N="1838" /> large salaries, who get no military service pensions as a result of being in receipt of these salaries, but we know also that there are many thousands of public servants with smaller salaries who would be affected.  Apparently, it was accepted as something that was there, and it was not challenged until quite recently.  Of course, when that challenge came, we had to go into the matter, so as to ensure, so far as possible, that no decision would be given in the courts that might, perhaps, be adverse.</P>
    <P>We had to safeguard, as far as possible, the money in question, and I want to emphasise that the Schedule to the Act, which has been operative for the last twenty years, which passed through this House in 1924 and again in 1934, and to which, apparently, no Deputy took any exception, will continue to operate as it has been operating all through these years.  Accordingly, Sir, I cannot accept this or the other amendments, because it is obvious that they are designed to make the Bill completely inoperative.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has stated that there was no case before the courts.  If that is so, then I have not been correctly informed.  Will the Minister state, however, in what manner the challenge came to him, if there was not a case before the courts? The Minister also states that there may be a flaw in the Act, but he does not believe that there is.  Well, if there is no flaw in the Act, why does he introduce this amending Bill?  If there is no case before the courts, why do we have this raised here in the Dáil?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many cases of obscurity with regard to various Bills, and the Government are aware of these, but in this case one must assume that the Government was advised by its legal advisers that there was some danger that the courts might hold that the people concerned here would be entitled to a certain amount of compensation. Therefore, I must assume that the legal advisers of the Minister are not satisfied with the present position, and that the people concerned are entitled <Col N="1839" /> to get the pensions that were granted to them.  I think that, from the point of view of the Minister's allegiance in that matter, he, like I, would like to see all Old I.R.A. men getting their pensions.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that he has a duty to the taxpayer and because of that he is imposing a means test upon a certain section of the Old I.R.A. which is not imposed on another section.  It is because he has a certain control over the incomes of these people he is endeavouring to penalise them.  Take, for instance, the case of farmers, shopkeepers or professional men outside the public service who are getting pensions.  There is no means of attaching their salaries or incomes.  It is simply because these other people are in the public service that you have a means of controlling their incomes and that you impose a means test upon them.  I submit that is not an equitable proposal and, apart altogether from the point put forward by Deputy Connolly, I would urge that the operation of this section should be postponed until the end of the emergency. It would be impossible to operate this means test in the case of people outside the public service and I think it is altogether unfair, therefore, to impose it in the case of men in the public service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister when he says that it has been the custom to make these deductions in cases where pensions have been paid but I should like to point out to him that in these cases the statutory declaration which the pensioner makes merely states the amount which the pensioner received during the previous quarter from any public funds or from any local authority.  Take the case of an applicant under the 1934 Act.  The pension was payable from the 1st October, 1934, and he was perhaps granted the pension in December, 1934.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He was getting three days' work on a minor relief scheme, and because he was employed by the local authority he had to make a statutory declaration that he received three days' <Col N="1840" /> wages in the week, and then, if it was under £100, his pension was reduced by 5 per cent.  I think that is the correct figure.  A number of cases have been held over and a person who is qualifying only now is paid a lump sum to cover arrears from the 1st October, 1934.  The statutory declaration that such an applicant is bound to make covers only what he earned in the last quarter.  So, therefore, the Minister by this section is changing the position as it stood originally.  The pensioner was not called upon to show that he earned something last year or the year before, but the Minister is now endeavouring to make sure, although the applicant was not bound to make such a declaration, that he will have this advantage over him.  Because of that I am supporting this amendment.</P>
    <P>When one argues with the Minister that a pensioner is at a disadvantage and that in justice and in equity he is entitled to have that disadvantage removed, the Minister will say: &ldquo;That cannot be done because it would involve an amendment of the Act and we could not undertake that.&rdquo; When, however, there is a belief in Finance that something is in favour of an applicant, then Finance and Defence both move with the real pincers movement to deprive the applicant of whatever rights he has.  The Minister is not absolutely correct when he says that this custom has always obtained.  It has obtained only in particular cases and an applicant employed in the public service was obliged to state only what he had earned in the preceding quarter.</P>
    <P>I think that applicants for pensions are entitled to any benefit that the existing legislation confers upon them. I would allow the provisions to operate from the time a man gets a pension and if he worked in the next quarter. I would put him on an equal footing with the man who had been getting a pension previously and who was also engaged in the public service.  The sum involved is very trifling, comparatively speaking, and when one considers that the minimum pension is only £2 15s., and that it is proposed to take 5 per cent. off that in respect of a man working <Col N="1841" /> three or four days a week on a minor relief scheme, I suggest that the schedule was never intended for these people at all.  However, I shall deal with that when we come to a later stage of the Bill.  I would urge the Minister to accept the amendment and that he should not attempt to deprive these men of whatever little advantage they may enjoy under the existing legislation.</P>

      <P>I feel that the Minister's object in this section is to forestall something that he fears may happen which might confer an advantage on persons in receipt of pensions. I therefore propose to support this amendment.  The Minister stated that lawyers differ in many cases, but I think that it is a disgraceful state of affairs to subject old I.R.A. men to a means test.  Surely when those men went out to fight they had no idea that there would be any test imposed either in regard to their circumstances or results of their action.  There were no conditions of that kind whatsoever in their minds.  It is too bad, therefore, that their means of livelihood should be taken into account in an effort to mitigate their pensions&mdash;pensions, let it be remembered, that they never looked for or expected in those days.  In my opinion the Minister should accept the amendment.  As far as I am concerned if there is a vote on it, I certainly shall vote for the amendment, because I think it very unfair that such men who have jobs&mdash;and many of them have neither jobs nor pensions&mdash;should have their way of living taken into account in an effort to reduce the amount of the pension to which they are entitled.</P>

      <P>I should also like to support this amendment as the section in its present form would impose a great hardship on many men in the town from which I come.  I know men, with a pension of 6/- a week, who are subject to deductions in this way.  I would ask the Minister in all sincerity to stay his hand for the moment because I do not think that this is a time for taking action of this kind having regard to the feelings which exist among members of the old <Col N="1842" /> I.R.A., who are a very dissatisfied body at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to reconsider his decision not to accept this amendment.  I am sure that all Parties are agreed that it is not desirable to have a tug-of-war in the House in regard to the position of the old I.R.A.  We would all like agreement on this matter, if possible. I would strongly urge the Minister to reconsider this amendment, which is the most innocuous of all those that have been put down.  It appears to me that the Minister believes that the principle of the abatement of pensions has been sanctified, by reason of the fact that the Act was passed through this House on two previous occasions. I should like to remind the Minister that this Pensions Act has not been before the House since 1934.  It has been locked up, and there has been no opportunity of considering it.  In 1934, when it was before the House, the Minister will remember, there was a minor crisis in the City of Dublin. There was a six weeks' Press strike and most of the I.R.A. organisations which could have presented very strong arguments in reference to the Act were totally unaware of what was occurring in the House.  That is why the Bill passed through the House with such ease.  But now that there is an opportunity of reviewing the position, surely the Minister should be generous because, undoubtedly, he must have the interests of these men at heart. Even if he is not prepared to extend this principle generally he might be prepared to consider the severe hardships of the present emergency and not have the balance weighed against these men for the period of the emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it should be made quite clear and plain that it is undoubtedly a hardship to those in the public service that their pensions are subject to abatement for no other reason than that they took part in the war of independence in order to establish freedom, justice and right in this country. That is the only reason why their pensions are being abated.  I wish to put one aspect of the situation to the Minister which may not have occurred to <Col N="1843" /> him and which, if he considers it, may have the effect of changing his attitude. If the pensions of those who are in public employment are abated, there is an indirect inference that they have obtained their present positions because of the fact that they rendered national service and not because of their having ability equal to that of their fellow employees.  We all know that in the case of the Civil Service and other occupations, in respect of which pensions are abated, the pensioners have obtained their positions generally through competitive examinations, that they are on a par with their fellow-employees in every way, and that it is not because of their national service that they get any preference. But, if portion of their pensions is deducted because they are in the service of the State it is indirectly suggested, on the one hand, they were put into their positions because of their national service and, on the other hand, that there should be a balance against them and that they should suffer a deduction from their pensions.  I think that point reveals an entirely new aspect of the situation.</P>
    <P>The operation of this abatement has become much harsher than would appear from the references to it by other speakers.  I do not think it was ever intended, when this House agreed to the various stabilisation Orders in regard to the bonus, fixing it at 185, that it would operate against these pensions as adversely as it does.  The House knows that there are cases of men pursuing similar occupations, working side by side, one of whom may be employed directly by the Board of Works, for instance, and the other employed by a contractor to the Board of Works.</P>
    <P>The man who is employed directly by the Board of Works suffers these abatements, namely, 5, 10, 20 or 30 per cent. and upwards, as the case may be, whereas his colleague suffers no such abatement.  A bonus of 10/- a week, to meet the high cost of living, was granted recently.  How did it operate in regard to such men?  I shall give the figures that I have been given and I am sure the Minister can <Col N="1844" /> certify that they are correct.  I shall give a typical case.  There were two men, one employed by the Board of Works and another employed by an outside contractor, doing exactly the same type of work and service for the State.  Before the 10/- bonus was granted, the wages in each case were roughly £182.  The man who was employed by the outside contractor had a pension of £130 and his total emoluments per annum were £312.  The man who was employed directly by the State and who suffered an abatement of his pension, had a pension of roughly £156, subject to a deduction of 20 per cent., which gave him a net pension of £125.  He received, in all, therefore, £307.  His pension was £26 more than the pension of his fellow-worker but the net effect of the abatement was to give him £5 per annum less.  That is not a great hardship.  He was suffering only to the extent of £5 in his total remuneration as compared with his colleague.  But consider the anomaly that occurs when there is the addition of the 10/- bonus which is intended to alleviate hardship and to compensate in some way for the high cost of living.  The wages of the man who is employed by the outside contractor are increased to £208.  He still had a pension of £130 without abatement, and he now receives £338.  That is a good increase.  We would not consider it sufficient, but still it is an increase that helps him to weather the storm of this emergency.  In the case of the man who suffers the abatement, the 10/- bonus brings his wages to £208 but, instead of being subject to a 20 per cent. deduction, he is now subject to a 30 per cent. deduction and his net pension is £109, giving him a total of £317.  Now, although he still has a pension which is £26 greater than that of his fellow employee, in the net result he receives £21 less.</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister or the Minister for Finance did not intend that there should be these discrepancies and anomalies.  In an attempt to prevent such anomalies, we have submitted this amendment, in the hope that the Minister will stay his hand until the emergency is over.  Our position in regard to the amendment is that we <Col N="1845" /> are preventing an alteration in the principal Act.  The Minister says that there has been a challenge&mdash;we will wait for him to tell us how the challenge has been made&mdash;but that it is still in the balance as to how the interpretation of the old Act will go.  But we hold that the old Act conferred certain property rights on persons who may be considered beneficiaries under that Act.  These property rights may be hypothetical; it may require a court case to determine that one way or the other.  I say that that should be left to the courts to determine.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amending Bill is to take away property rights which these men had under an old Act, to deprive them of rights granted to them by the law to payments out of the Central Fund.  As the Minister has stated, the Dáil has twice passed this principle and determined that these payments should be made to them.  It now happens that there is a difference of opinion as to what should be paid to them, but, so far as the Acts go, they were passed in order to give a fair balance to beneficiaries under them, and there was no intention to discriminate against these applicants, should it be found that there was any legal flaw in the legislation which would be to their benefit.  The more one looks into it, the more one feels that it should be the intention of this Legislature to deal with these people from the point of view of national record, of what these men did for the setting up of the State which enables us to argue in a legislative Assembly here, and to give them the greatest benefit possible of any doubt under any section of the Acts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. L. Cosgrave Mr. L. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to press on the Minister the merits of this amendment.  The Minister mentioned that there was a likelihood of a challenge and I think I know where the challenge is coming from.  A certain body of these men have taken legal opinion and propose to start proceedings. I believe they instructed a certain solicitor and possibly the Minister has the ear of this solicitor.  He proposed to settle the matter out of court, if it were possible, but apparently <Col N="1846" /> when the Government, and particularly the Department of Finance, got wind of it, they decided to circumscribe the right of these men by this legislation.  On the question of granting these pensions, it is possible, as the Minister has said, that he has a duty to the taxpayers.  I further believe that we have probably gone beyond the limits in the matter of granting pensions in this country, but the fact that we have done so is no justification for withholding a pension or portion of a pension from people who gave national service and who are being penalised merely because they are employed in one branch or other of the public service.  It would be far better to give more than justice to some than to do injustice to a small section, and it is only a very small section of these people who are employed in the public service.</P>
      <P>The really pernicious feature of the Bill, however, is the fact that the Minister is attempting to circumscribe the rights which people have under the law to go to the courts.  It is quite easy to foresee the disastrous results which could follow the introduction by a Minister, every time persons decided to go to the courts to seek rights, of a Bill to nullify the advantages which might accrue to these persons, or at any rate to prevent their being adjudicated on.  There is no knowing what such action might lead to.  We have on numerous occasions since the start of the emergency seen how various Emergency Powers Orders have been used to circumscribe the rights of citizens under the law.  It may be that, in the circumstances in which we found ourselves, that was a highly desirable thing to do, but there is no justification whatever for penalising these people, and particularly for attempting to forestall, as the Minister admits is being attempted, a decision of the courts, which might be in favour of the Minister or of the applicant. He has no right whatever to attempt to circumscribe the rights of people under the law.</P>

      <P>In supporting this amendment, my object is to see that no injustice will be done to the men who, as I hold, are responsible for this <Col N="1847" /> State functioning to-day.  We hear a lot about what the previous Government and the present Government have done for keeping the country safe and for putting it into the position in which it can be neutral to-day, but I hold that the men whose cases we are dealing with now are the men responsible for that position.  Were it not for the stand which these men took, this country would not be neutral to-day, and I am surprised, knowing the Minister's sympathy with, and regard for, these men and what they did, that he should be responsible for bringing forward a Bill to take away some of the rights they hold.</P>
      <P>I do not at all agree with Deputy Cosgrave that we have gone beyond the limits in the matter of looking after these people.

      <P>May I put this point to the Minister?  There is approximately a 5 per cent. advantage to the applicant in the overwhelming number of cases.  Did the Minister put the case to Finance that, where a person is now receiving a lump sum, instead of a deduction of 5 per cent. being made from his pension, he is entitled to 5 per cent. compound interest on the amount?  The man in receipt of the pension has had the benefit of it, but the other man has been nine or ten years without it, and many a hard day he had since waiting for it, as I know.  The reason I support the amendment is that in the majority of cases&mdash;and the cases I have sympathy with are those of the county council worker and the person in receipt of a small salary from whom this 5 per cent. deduction is being made&mdash;the law, as I hold, did not make the deduction.  The Minister is now making sure that it does.  I believe that is done at the behest of Finance, and that, instead of doing that, the Minister should have argued for compound interest at 5 per cent.  on the amount outstanding. Before he rejects this amendment, I should like him to tell us that he has fought that case and lost.  If he has, I appeal to the Government Deputies to support the amendment and defeat this proposal of the Minister.</P>

Anything they got, they got for service to the country. They never looked for it.  It was given by a benevolent Government for honest and faithful service.  I always held that the means test was despicable. The majority of these men down the country have anything from 7/6 to 15/- a week and, when they get a job under the county council or any subsidiary body, they find that their pension is docked.  That is most despicable. I hold that the means test should never have been applied.  I ask the Minister to accept this amendment and show that he, as well as we on this side of the House, will stand for justice for men who deserve justice.</P>

      <P>There is one point I should like to make.  The Minister is amending this Pensions Act.  I could never understand why a man should be penalised because he goes into the service of the State or into the public service.  We know that men who are drawing small wages or salaries, either from the State or a local authority, are penalised by a reduction in the pension which has been granted to them by the State and under the law. We also know that men in private life, business men, professional men and others, who are earning anything from £200 to £3,000 a year, many of them in receipt of a very big yearly income because of Acts passed by this House, are not subject to any deduction whatever. It seems to me that it is a vicious principle that because a man elects to go into the State service or public service he should be penalised. If he decides to set up in business for himself, or to carry on any other profession, and earns anything up to £5,000 or £10,000 a year, so far as I know there is no deduction from his pension.  If a man is reduced to that point of destitution that he seeks rotation work, I think there is something seriously wrong when that is used against him.  I think the original Act requires amendment, but not along the lines suggested by the Minister.</P>

The circumstances were that there were threats of action lodged with us and we had to make a move then.  We sought legal advice and, as Deputy Connolly must realise, lawyers, like doctors, differ.  We were advised by some lawyers that the interpretation which has been placed on the particular clause for 20 years was a good interpretation and would stand the test of law.  Other lawyers told us that it was possible that the view of the people who were making application might be upheld.  Whether one or the other was the right advice, so far as we were concerned we had to see that we did not leave a gap open through which people would secure something to which they were not entitled.  The object of this Bill is not to deprive any person of a legal right to which he is entitled or a right which is vested in him by law, but mainly to prevent people from claiming a right which the Oireachtas never intended them to have.

I mentioned the cases of two public servants, both of them receiving the maximum sum in respect of their service&mdash;£550, or whatever the maximum may have been. Both of these people applied for a pension. They are both granted £200.  One of them applied in 1934, because the Pensions Board at that particular time appealed to applicants to come forward early with their applications.  The other applicant does not apply until a later period.  His case is not decided until 1944.  What happens?  The man who applied promptly in 1934 has his pension abated from the moment it is granted.  The man who was dilatory or who, for reasons known, perhaps, only to himself, did not apply and has not his pension granted until 1944, gets a sum of £2,000 as against nothing for the other man.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am certain that the Oireachtas never intended that a differentiation like that should take place.  I am certain that the Oireachtas intended that the pensions should be payable from the date on which the Bill became an Act and not <Col N="1852" /> from the date on which the pensions were granted, and it is because I am certain of that, that I believe I am doing no injustice, good, bad or indifferent, to any individual.  This is a good string to play tunes on, and I have no doubt that full advantage is being taken of it for that purpose; but I say that the House has other duties as well, and those duties are to the taxpayer.  We have dealt reasonably generously with these men and it has involved a considerable sum of money.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEoin, I think, has referred to the sum as being of no importance. I wish to assure him that it is of very great importance.  There are 2,800 cases involved, and a sum of something between £200,000 and £300,000 will also be involved.  If you do this, you might as well remove the Schedule altogether; and, if you do that, then the sum involved will run into millions. I do not know whether the House has considered that aspect of the matter or not.  As I said at the beginning, I am not going to accept any of these amendments, as they are intended merely to make this Bill entirely inoperative.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider this point?  He has stated the case in which there is complete abatement, that is, the person is in receipt of a salary of £550.  I do not think that that is a fair one to cite.  We are not arguing for that particular case, as I am perfectly certain that it was the intention of the Oireachtas that, where a person was re-employed to the figure of £550, he was not to get the pension due to him while he was in receipt of that salary.  But there is the case of a person in receipt of £10 a year.  The Minister informs me that the minimum pension payable under both Acts is £2 15s. Id., or some figure like that, but even at that if the man gets three days' employment a week, there is a deduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister takes the step to amend the Act to protect Finance would he not consider amending the Schedule in the original Act, taking out any deduction under £250?  That would mean there would be no reduction at all until you were in receipt of at least £250 a year and, after that, <Col N="1853" /> the deductions would take place.  If the Minister insists upon putting the deduction upon the lump sum, I cannot see any reason in the world why the man who is entitled to receive the pension should not get the 5 per cent. compound interest on it for the ten years.  He is putting the case of the man applying in November of 1934 and that of a man not applying until later; but what about two men applying equally on the same dates?  One got the pension in 1935 and the other has not got it until 1944; one has the benefit of it all the time and the other is without it.  The man who now qualifies is going to suffer this deduction in the lump sum.  If he only put it in the Post Office it would get 3½ per cent. if he had it from 1934, if it had been paid.  I admit that, if this section were passed, it would defeat the Bill, but I think the Schedule should be amended.</P>

      <P>There are some points the Minister brought up which make me believe that he does not quite appreciate the intention of the amendment. He has not told us yet how this amendment will have the effect of destroying the whole amending Bill.  I would like him to apply himself to that point.  The amendment distinctly states: &ldquo;The provisions of this section shall apply and have effect as and from the termination of the present emergency.&rdquo; Our intention is not at all to deprive the Minister of rights which he thinks he is justly entitled to.  We think, however, the Minister should not attempt to deprive beneficiaries under this Act of the rights to which they are justly entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister talked about playing on this tuneful sort of rhapsody, but I assure him my intention is far from that.  I was informed by a prominent member of the Minister's own Party that the intention of this Bill was to do what he stated in reference to the higher levels, to those in receipt of £550.  I have no interest in those higher levels, except from the point of view of natural justice and equity.  I was informed &mdash; wrongly, but unwittingly&mdash;that this Bill applied only to the higher categories, and had I believed that I would not have put <Col N="1854" /> down such an amendment as this.  I am concerned only with the lower categories, which have been specified by Deputy MacEoin and other Deputies.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about this £550 and the ten years during which the man did not draw it, but he did not say that, during those ten years, the man had not the benefit of the pension. The abatement which the other man suffered might be taken in some way as interest for the non-use of the pension over the ten years.  The Minister probably did not consider that.  He did not tell us that this applies also to the lower level, to the 5, 10 and 20 per cent. deductions.  I gave an actual case, where there were 20 and 30 per cent. deductions.  Will not this amending Bill apply to them and wipe out the property rights which these men have?</P>
    <P>It is not our intention to make use of this for gaining political kudos, or to make the I.R.A. something to wrangle over here.  If the Minister would undertake to see that the provisions of this amending Bill do not apply to those under the figure mentioned by Deputy MacEoin&mdash;say under £250&mdash; I will undertake to withdraw the amendment.  Failing the undertaking of the Minister to do so, we will have to put this amendment to the vote.</P>

      <P>I would like to join in the appeal by Deputy Connolly to the Minister to consider the case of men under £250.  After all, men working for the Dublin County Council find deductions are made.  Men who are fortunate enough to be in receipt of £550 are quite capable of looking after themselves, but I appeal to the Minister to accept the offer made by Deputy Connolly, in so far as it applies to those in receipt of £250.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to delete the date, October, 1934, from which the amending Bill will start to operate, and to substitute April, 1944, for it.  The intention is much the same as that of the previous amendment.  It is to destroy the retrospective effect of the amending Bill, and all the arguments that have been adduced against the adverse effects, the impropriety and the injustice of retrospective legislation could be developed here to the same extent.  As, however, the main points of the argument have been gone into on the previous amendment, unless someone else has a different viewpoint to put, I think very little more needs to be said.  I feel the Minister should in equity, now perhaps more than on the previous amendment, reconsider his position.  It is not the intention of these amendments to destroy the amending Bill or the principle of it&mdash;it is merely intended to preserve the property rights which we believe are vested in a number of beneficiaries, maybe 2,000 or maybe less, but the number is immaterial.  It is held that these rights reside in pensions under the principal Act of 1924 and the Act of 1934.  They believe that the effect of the amending Bill is to deprive them of these rights.  We wish to stand between these pensioners and the Minister for Finance or his Department and any other section of the Government seeking to interfere with these pensions, particularly in the cases of those who are serving during the present emergency, and it is with <Col N="1859" /> that intention we have put down this amendment to delete October, 1934, and to substitute April, 1944.</P>

      <P>I cannot understand why the Minister resists an amendment which has the intention of maintaining the rights of any person to go to the courts if he feels himself adversely affected.  Surely, it is a denial of natural justice to a citizen of the country, particularly to a citizen who has given service, one who has created not only the Legislature which is passing this Act, but who has given permanence to the courts which are going to administer these Acts.  Such a <Col N="1860" /> person, if he feels that he is deprived of certain rights, should not be denied by the Minister his right of appealing to the courts.  The Minister's refusal to accept this amendment leaves me practically speechless.  I cannot understand why he refuses to have inserted in this Bill a simple provision that nothing in it shall be so construed as to deprive a person of any right of appeal to the courts or otherwise conferred by any Act of the Oireachtas or otherwise enjoyed.  I should imagine that this would be automatically included in any Act and that any Act without such a provision has no real validity in law.  Surely the Minister does not intend to deprive a citizen of his ordinary rights?  I would like to hear him on why he will not accept this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">

      <P>Deputy Connolly must be very simple if he thinks the Minister brought in the Act for any other purpose than to prevent people going to court to get rights which they may think they have, but which the Minister thinks they have not.  This Act is to prevent me, for instance, going to court to get a right which I have been advised I have or had.  It is to make sure that the Government is going to win no matter what happens.  It is a bad principle, I feel, and one which should not be adopted by this Parliament. This right of retrospective legislation should not be given lightly to any Government.  What is happening up to the present is that if there is something to the benefit of the Government and to the disadvantage of the citizen, the Government holds fast. But, if there is something to the disadvantage of the Government and to the benefit of the citizen, the Government takes a step like this to take it away by retrospective legislation.  I think the Minister might accept this amendment, but I am not foolish enough to think he will.  I know well that if he accepts it and if there is a law case, he will have to stand his ground the same as anybody else, and he may lose.  They want to ensure by this Act that they will not lose.  The Minister has told us that he has one set of legal advisers who assure him <Col N="1861" /> that he is right and another set of advisers who say that a case could be made.  Therefore, he has brought in an Act to make sure that one set of advisers was right.  I think that that is a bad principle and I am going to support the amendment.  I feel that the Minister should reconsider the whole matter now.</P>

      <P>Without accepting all the Minister has stated and what he has said on the previous section, I am willing to accept this principle of retrospective legislation.  Although I am opposed to it, naturally, for the purpose of this argument, I would accept it, but I submit the Minister should not have the right to debar any citizen from appealing to the courts. Even if this amendment is defeated, it is quite obvious that this problem will lead only to a long legal wrangle. Even in law, you cannot deprive any person of his property rights by retrospective legislation.  You may attempt to do so, but if we have an independent judiciary, as we are told we have, they, I think, will defend this from the point of view that it is <i>ultra vires</i> the Constitution, and that there <Col N="1862" /> is no power in law to deprive any citizen of the right to go to court with a grievance against any Department. I think it exhibits a bad point of view on the part of the Government to resist this amendment.  For that reason I am glad it was put down.  I thought it would be automatically accepted.  It is merely an attempt to confer on a citizen the right he has already got under the Constitution of appealing to the courts when he feels himself aggrieved.  The Minister says: &ldquo;So far as I am concerned, you are not going to have it&rdquo;&mdash;an attitude of heads I win, tails you lose.  That is the idea exemplified in the resistance to this amendment.  I think it is a bad principle to develop.  If the whole world is going wrong, where does Ireland's missionary zeal come in?</P>
      <P>Why cannot we show the rest of the world that we are somewhat different from them, that we do not crush down the applicants for mercy who come to our gates but hear what they have to say and put the Minister on an equal footing in the courts with the humblest applicant with I.R.A. service who may be in receipt of much less than £100 a year, and who is deprived of 5 per cent.?  Such a person should stand coequal with the Minister in a court of law, with the right to argue his case. No matter what Government it is&mdash; because this Government may be only transitory or it may last for ever&mdash;the Minister must act in accordance with the Constitution because he is subject to it, and, therefore, nothing should be resisted which gives the ordinary litigant the right to appear in court and to have his case heard.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that the Minister has amended the Act in this particular way, I think he should take steps to amend it further.  We are willing to give him the remaining Stages now in the hope that because of our reasonable attitude he, too, will be reasonable and that the Government also will be reasonable.  It is very unfair, in the case of a person with a total yearly income as low as £50, to make a 5 per cent. deduction. I believe it was the intention of the Oireachtas that only where persons were re-employed in positions sufficient to give a reasonable standard of living should these deductions be made.  The deductions were never intended in the case of small payments.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to amend the Acts of 1924 and 1934 so that there will be no deduction from sums under £200. It is an extraordinary situation that one person can be in receipt of thousands of pounds in the year and there is no deduction while, on the other hand, if another person happens to be employed by a county council as a rate collector or a road worker, or employed as a messenger in this House or in Government Departments at a small salary, a deduction of 5, 10 or 20 per cent. takes place.  That state of affairs should not be permitted, and the legislation should be amended at the earliest possible moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join in the appeal made by Deputy MacEoin. I ask the Minister to reconsider the categories in the Schedule and so do something to ease the burden for those people during the emergency period. Perhaps he will take into consideration the points I put before him with reference to the adverse effect of the granting of bonuses under Emergency Orders.  Surely the intention of the bonus should be to relieve a man of some of his burdens and surely the increase to a man's income by way of a bonus should not militate against his pension?  The pension at least should be free from any abatement.  I think a good case has been made in that connection and it has reference only <Col N="1866" /> to the lower levels.  I think the Minister will find that the amount accruing to the Exchequer through these abatements will not be very much.</P>
      <P>I can assure him that this matter has been raised with the best intentions and not for the purpose of driving a coach and four through the legislation. We did not come into the House with any such intention.  Our main anxiety is to safeguard the interests of those in receipt of small pensions, whose pensions would be adversely affected by the operation of the Schedule.  We feel that the amending Bill deprives them of rights to which we honestly think they are entitled.  I trust the Minister will give favourable consideration to our views.  If he does so, I am sure he will receive the gratitude not only of the House and the beneficiaries under this measure, but of the country as a whole.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion that this Bill was before the House I dealt with its benefits from a general point of view, and I wish now to refer to the fact that £7,000,000 is to be spent when the scheme is undertaken. The financing of the scheme is of importance, because if £7,000,000 is to be borrowed, then we will have to pay back that money.  Who will pay it back?  Are we to tax the people by imposing on them a rate that they will not be able to pay?  Are we going to impose further taxation on top of the burden that already exists?  Where will the money come from?  I assume that it will be necessary to incur indebtedness in order to run this scheme. If that is so, I do not hope for good results. Farmers in my constituency have been demanding drainage in their districts for many years.  The Cumann na nGaedheal Government in 1927 introduced a big scheme of drainage affecting Leix, Offaly and Kildare. There is no doubt that that scheme was a good one.  When I was a schoolboy I remember the streets of Mountmellick being flooded, as a result of which it was impossible to get from Dublin to Portarlington, Monasterevan, Portlaoighise and other places.  The Barrow drainage scheme was a good one but it did not do all that the farmers in the affected areas expected. Section 27 of this Bill concerns the Barrow drainage district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that the Parliamentary Secretary was able to announce that the Government thought it fitting to <Col N="1868" /> take into consideration in this legislation the position of hard-working farmers in the Barrow drainage district. I am also glad to say that that section in this Bill will be welcomed by them inasmuch as it appears that there will be a considerable reduction in the demands for rates made on them, and that these will be made a county-at-large charge.</P>
    <P>I go further and ask the Parliamentary Secretary to say if it would be possible to introduce an amendment to the Bill, which would take into account the fact that the Barrow drainage rate was struck for a period of 35 years, and that it has been in existence for six years.  That rate has not been paid because the farmers concerned were unable to meet it.  There is now going to be a great measure of relief for them, as the rate is to be a county-at-large charge.  Would it be possible for the Parliamentary Secretary to introduce a clause wiping out drainage rates due for the past six years?  I think that suggestion is worthy of consideration. If it was wrong to impose a rate that was to exist for the next 29 years, surely it must have been wrong to impose it for the last six years.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to see if it is possible to amend the Bill, so that the Barrow drainage rate would be wiped out, and to give the county councils concerned authority to refund amounts already paid.  That rate was an unjust one and farmers were unable to pay it. The Government, as well as public representatives of all Parties, joined in the present emergency in an appeal for the production of more food. Every Deputy has on some occasion appealed to farmers to get into the front line of defence by securing the country against starvation, and the farmers have gallantly risen to the occasion.</P>
    <P>I ask for special consideration under this Bill for farmers in Leix, Offaly and Kildare.  Their case has been given consideration by the establishment of the Barrow drainage district, but I wish the Parliamentary Secretary to go a little further, and in the name of the Government, to have drainage arrears that are outstanding <Col N="1869" /> for the past six years wiped out, and where they were paid have the money refunded.  Some years ago I submitted a memorandum to the Drainage Commission suggesting that it would be well if drainage schemes were made a national charge.  I received an acknowledgment from the commission intimating that the matter was receiving attention.  I am glad to see that the Government are about to undertake this drainage scheme, and that it will be financed and controlled by the central drainage authority.  I should like to know where the labour to carry out the work will be secured and what wages will be paid.  At present, on various employment schemes sponsored by the Board of Works, on drainage, roads and turf, the wages paid are such that ordinary workers could not exist upon them. When this scheme is embarked upon I wonder if the workers are to be paid the mean wages that some of them are now trying to exist upon.  I hope that no worker will be employed at a wage less than £3 10s. 0d. a week because, in view of the high cost of living, it would be impossible to exist on less. As I am not satisfied that workers employed by the Board of Works in the past were properly remunerated I hope that they will now get a satisfactory wage.</P>
    <P>One Deputy stated that there would be reams of correspondence with the Board of Works from all parts about the undertaking of new schemes. While I am open to contradiction, I suggest that no part of the country requires drainage worse than the midlands. When learning geography at school the first thing the schoolmaster told us was that Ireland was formed in the shape of a saucer, with mountains around the coasts and then the valleys.</P>

Anybody <Col N="1870" /> who passes through County Galway, Offaly or Westmeath will have noticed that the Shannon overflowed its banks between Offaly and Galway. I think the Government should give special consideration to the midlands. They should start off their schemes there, and have the midlands properly drained, because around Shannonbridge and such areas there is great need for proper drainage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite appreciate the point of order, Sir, but to get back to what I was saying: generally speaking, I welcome this measure, but I should prefer that all future maintenance would not be a county-at-large charge but would be paid for out of the Central Fund.  After all, we are told in one part of the Report of the Drainage Commission&mdash;I cannot quote the exact portion at the moment&mdash;that lands that are drained do not benefit very much from drainage until five years after it has been carried out.  As I say, I cannot quote the exact words used in the report, but these words are contained in some part of it, and I should be very glad if the Parliamentary Secretary, when replying, would make special reference to the question of the financing of this scheme.  Will he tell us where the money is to be got: whether it is to be borrowed, or whether it is to be raised by means of rates or taxes, or how the money is to be levied?  I would not like to see a great scheme such as this going through, if it were to mean nothing but forced sales, seizures, and so on, because the farmers could not pay the rate that might be levied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My one request to the Parliamentary Secretary is that he should introduce some section into this Bill which will enable the Barrow drainage rates for the last six years or so to be wiped out or, if those rates have been already paid, to have them refunded.  I happen to know these people.  I happen to represent them here in this House, and I can safely say that they have a <Col N="1871" /> genuine grievance.  I do not blame the Parliamentary Secretary for yawning, because he has been listening to this question of the Barrow drainage for the last five or six years, but I think that he should go further in connection with this Bill, and wipe out completely the Barrow drainage rates or, as I have said, in cases where the rates have been paid, refund them.  We are told that it will take about 28 years for this scheme to be completed.</P>
    <P>Very well, then.  As I said before, it will probably not worry the members of this House in 28 years' time, because very few of us will be here; but if the administration of this Bill, when it becomes an Act, should be under the administration of the present Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Smith, then, as I have said already, it will be in very capable hands.  From my experience, the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Smith, is the right man in the right place.  I have had a long experience in these matters, and if Deputy Smith is in charge of the administration of this scheme in 28 years' time&mdash;as I hope he will, but I am afraid he will not&mdash;I say that it will be a great thing to his credit and to his honour that he introduced this scheme.  If the scheme is carried out under Deputy Smith, I am sure that it will be a very great success, but I want him to give special consideration to Section 27 of the Bill, from the point of view of having the rates connected with the Barrow drainage wiped out completely, or, where they have been already paid by the farmers concerned, refunded.  I should be very glad if legislation of that kind were to be passed here, because those farmers deserve special consideration.  There is no use in repeating what I have said, but I should be glad if the Parliamentary Secretary could see his way to have this grievance, this burning question, in Leix-Offaly and Kildare, of the Barrow drainage, dealt with properly.  It is dying out now, and I believe that it is in the hands of the Parliamentary Secretary to have those rates refunded to the people who have already paid them.</P>
    <Col N="1872" />
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been eagerly looked forward to by practically every local body in the country, and by the great majority of our agriculturists. I think the Parliamentary Secretary is fortunate that it fell to his lot to introduce this measure which, I expect, will, in future years, be known as the &ldquo;Smith Act&rdquo;.  I should like to add my voice to the tribute the last speaker paid to the present Parliamentary Secretary, because I believe that the implementation of this Bill will be in very capable hands and that, so far as there is any obligation on the Parliamentary Secretary to implement the Bill when it becomes an Act, it will certainly be done, but I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary desires, as we all desire, and as I am sure he does, that when this Bill leaves the Oireachtas and becomes an Act it will be such a measure as will merit respect from every section of the community: in other words, that it will achieve the object which most of us had in view during the last 20 years&mdash; the proper draining of the rivers of this country.</P>
      <P>The one blot that I see in this Bill&mdash; and it is a matter that will be largely discussed on the Committee Stage&mdash;is that all powers in connection with this scheme are concentrated in the Board of Public Works and, finally, in the Minister for Finance.  It appears to me that that will create an impression in the minds of a lot of people, that the approach from the point of view of the Minister for Finance in all cases will be that of economy and that, eventually, that might lead to greater efforts at economy and a greater burden being put on the various local bodies which will have to bear the cost of such works.  There is also, to my mind, no reference whatsoever in the Bill to local bodies or, through the local bodies, to their county surveyors, as partakers in this scheme.  There is some kind of a provision for consultation with the Board of Works, but in order to make the Bill a real success I think that we should have brought the county surveyors into the Bill in some responsible way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal section of the Bill on which I think there will be any great <Col N="1873" /> criticism is Section 13, which deals with the certificate of completion.  To my mind, the really vital section in the Bill is the section which says that when a scheme has been brought forward and completed, the Board of Works, through the Minister for Finance, issues a certificate of completion, and that that is final and there is no appeal.  Whether the work was completely done or not there is no appeal, once the Minister for Finance has issued his certificate.  There is in the section a sub-section to say that within a month after publication has been made in the official gazette any person may lodge any objection in writing that he sees fit, but the next sub-section says that the Minister &ldquo;shall consider every (if any) objection sent to him under the next preceding paragraph and shall take such steps in regard thereto as he shall think proper&rdquo;&mdash;in other words, he can put them in the waste paper basket.  I do not say that that will be the procedure adopted, but that is the only safeguard that the ratepayers and others will have to ensure that the work will be accomplished to their satisfaction. When the Minister for Finance has issued his certificate, they will have no appeal otherwise than to lodge an objection in writing which may or may not be considered.  That in my opinion is the main blot on this Bill, and I hope that on Committee Stage, the Parliamentary Secretary will accept an amendment to provide some sort of an appeal from the decision of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>There are only one or two other matters in the Bill to which I want to refer, because I believe it is largely a Bill for consideration in Committee. Section 48, which deals with watercourses, was referred to by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, who said that he failed to grasp the meaning of it.  I cannot say that I am in that position because I think I see what the section leads to.  It deals with a case where a farmer might try to obstruct an adjoining farmer in his endeavour to drain his land properly, and the section proposes that the obstructing farmer should be compelled to drain his land.  I am, however, principally <Col N="1874" /> concerned with the question of main watercourses and I hope that when the Board of Works comes to formulate schemes it will include all major watercourses in the district and that there will be no possibility of any watercourse being omitted from a scheme.  In that connection, I might refer back to my objection to the fact that the Minister for Finance has the final decision in regard to all schemes. In my opinion, the Minister for Finance has quite enough to do without saddling him with this responsibility. He has his job as well as the rest of us, and his main job is to cut down expenses as far as he can.  He is the very last Minister we should like to see entrusted with the final say on a question of this kind where the matter of a little extra expenditure might make all the difference in the success or failure of a scheme.  We do not want any possibility of cheeseparing which may result in a scheme not being carried out in the proper manner.</P>
    <P>I am sure that this question of main watercourses will be brought forward when the various schemes are submitted but there is nothing in the Bill to say specifically that they will.  In any major drainage scheme that I ever saw, there was always some reference to main watercourses and I dare say that in schemes submitted by the Board of Works they will be provided for, but I should like to see some provision of that kind embodied in the Bill.  I should like to see the inclusion of all main watercourses made obligatory in arterial drainage schemes brought forward under this Bill.</P>
    <P>No doubt there will be smaller drains left, the maintenance of which will be the obligation of the farmers concerned but, provided that main watercourses are included in the scheme, I see no objection to Section 48.  If the matter is left as it is, without any reference to the necessity for including such main watercourses, it may result in some large watercourse being omitted from a drainage scheme and so becoming the responsibility of some local farmers.  It would be impossible for any group of farmers to maintain a main watercourse.  It might mean in some cases the removal <Col N="1875" /> of a culvert or the sinking of the level of the drain and that would involve altogether too much expense for any ordinary farmer.  I want to see it definitely provided in the Bill that all such main watercourses will be included in the main scheme so that there will be no possibility of such watercourses being omitted.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies in the course of the debate referred to the fact that many of the schemes brought forward would not be economic.  I am quite certain that many of the schemes proposed by the Board of Works will not, on the face of them, be economic&mdash;there were many schemes before this Bill was introduced that would never have been economic were it not for the contributions of local bodies&mdash;but there are other considerations to be borne in mind besides the mere improvement in the quality of the land as a result of the carrying out of a scheme.  There is for instance the question of the effect on the health of the people which, perhaps, none of us can assess at its proper value.  Medical Deputies would be in a better position than I to express an opinion on that matter, but I think I can say that the beneficial effect of an arterial drainage scheme on the health of the people of the locality should be very considerable.</P>
    <P>Above all, there is the question of the effect on unemployment.  That is a matter that we shall have to face in an acute form in the next five or six years.  Much has been said in regard to the Parliamentary Secretary's statement that it would take 28 years to complete all the schemes under this Bill.  But I think the Parliamentary Secretary was not properly interpreted in dealing with that matter.  At least I did not gather from the Parliamentary Secretary's statement that it would take 28 years to complete these schemes.</P>
    <P>I hope the schemes will be completed in the shortest possible time and that the first schemes will be brought forward as soon as possible after this Bill becomes an Act.  Our aim should be to complete the work in the shortest possible period so as to <Col N="1876" /> give the maximum amount of employment at a time when it is most needed. No scheme that I can think of lends itself more to the solution of unemployment than drainage, because there is a greater proportion of labour involved than in any other form of public work.</P>
    <P>As to the question whether maintenance of the various schemes should be the responsibility of the direct beneficiaries or the county at large, I am in favour of the proposition in the Bill, that it should be made a county-at-large charge.  Everyone who has had any experience as a member of a local body knows the difficulty of collecting drainage rates under the existing regulations, and I think it will be better for all concerned when maintenance is made a county-at-large charge.  I do not think it should be beyond the capacity of the ratepayers to bear the maintenance charges arising out of the various schemes that will be undertaken in the several counties.  Perhaps the men living on the higher lands, taking a selfish view, may say: &ldquo;Why should we pay for the land of those who live in the lower and wet regions?&rdquo;  I think they should be answered, that the men living in the lower regions never charged anything for the water that was allowed to flow down on them, and that it is only fair that something should be paid now for the damage that the people in the hills and highlands did to those in the lowlands in not stopping the water that flowed down on them in past years.</P>
    <P>There is provision in the Bill to refer certain matters to a panel of arbitrators. I should like to see a representative of the local bodies included in that panel, some competent engineer with experience of arterial drainage, who would have the full confidence of the local councils of this country.  I think possibly that could be done by a nomination of the General Council of County Councils.  I think it is right that local bodies should have some voice in regard to this measure, and the absence of any power given to them is, to me, a blot on the Bill.</P>
    <P>When the Bill is finally passed, I <Col N="1877" /> hope it will emerge in such a manner as to be acceptable to everyone interested in drainage in this country and that it will carry with it a halo for the Parliamentary Secretary who introduced it.</P>

      <P>In the course of speaking on the Second Stage of this Bill, I want to relate the Bill to the general question of agricultural production. I cannot accept the statement that the Drainage Bill will not prove in the end fully economical in its effect.  The question, to my mind, of whether the actual cost of it will be repaid by the people who immediately benefit is a purely indirect one.  I consider this Bill to be the first long-term plan produced by the present Government for the increase of fertility and for the increase of agricultural production resulting therefrom.  When I say &ldquo;long-term plan&rdquo; I mean a scheme requiring co-ordination, having universal application and needing particular care and particular supervision over a considerable number of years, but all with the object of increasing fertility.  I look on this Drainage Bill as one of many measures that will be required completely to destroy the atmosphere of stagnancy with which our whole agricultural life is associated.  When we look back on some of the fundamental facts in connection with agricultural production we see immediately the necessity for drastic measures.  I should like to mention, as I have before in this House, the fact that there has been a negligible increase in food production in this country from 1880 to 1935 as compared with any other modern European country and as compared with any other country with which we have to compete in the foreign market. There has also been a virtual stagnancy in the volume of our production ever since we achieved independence, so far as the records to which we have access show.  There has been a substitution of certain forms of production for other forms, but there has been no measure of increase in the total volume of production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the symptoms of that state <Col N="1878" /> of stagnancy has been the gradual decrease in maintenance of drainage, both main drainage and field drainage, the failure of drainage boards and the failure of county councils to implement the 1925 Act.  The consequences of that have been an enormous increase all over the country of saturated, wet, acid soil&mdash;which has its immediate effect on agricultural production&mdash;the reduction in the tillage area, where farmers no longer have sufficient callow meadow for grazing purposes, a growth of poor herbage in all the areas which have become frequently flooded, and, what is most serious of all, the decline in what may be described as the drainage habit, the habit not only of maintaining co-operatively main drainage, but also of maintaining field drainage.  These are some of the consequences which are affected by this Bill.  There is no need for us to go into the causes of this stagnancy in detail; they are due to historical facts which have no relation to the Bill; but we do know that the Bill will have the effect of arresting a process of rot that has set in in connection with the maintenance of land in many areas.</P>
    <P>People have become indifferent and, in some cases, despairing as they watched the waters flow over their land and in every single year the cost of draining the land has become progressively heavier.  The cost increases almost by geometrical progression as time goes on until eventually the time is reached when it would not pay a farmer either to combine with his neighbour or to do his own field drainage, because the cost would be quite uneconomical.</P>
    <P>In order, as I have said, to bring about an increase in our production, the farmer needs confidence in the future, greater knowledge, sufficient capital and strong leadership from the Government.  Unless all those things are made available to him, he will eventually begin to listen to some of the futile suggestions we have heard in this House, such as excessive subsidies which mean merely bribing the farmer in the long run with his own money. Therefore, I particularly welcome this Bill.  During the first period of the present Government's office many <Col N="1879" /> measures were carried out to aid the farmer.</P>
    <P>They were all measures which would have immediate effect, such as providing the farmer with a market in this country, settlement of families on the land, provision of lime subsidies, and the provision of very greatly increased grants for various forms of farm equipment.  But I regard this scheme as part of the new process, the production of long-term facilities to aid the farmer.  When the land improvement scheme first started we realised immediately that it was only part of a whole scheme for draining the entire country.  The land improvement scheme, in fact, showed the need for co-ordination of all drainage. The very rapid increase in the number of grants in each year under the land improvement scheme produced an effect in some places whereby the field drainage was flooding lands close to rivers which had increased their flow owing to the field drainage already effected.  In order to make the drainage scheme of maximum value, it would seem essential to ensure that after the drainage has been done the Department of Agriculture will co-operate with the Board of Works to make sure that everything is done to take full advantage of facilities that are made available to farmers when their land has been properly drained.  I want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether he will, in the course of developing the scheme, consider that point.  It is quite obvious that unless all the field drainage is done, not only in the immediate area of the main drainage scheme, but in areas which have been affected because brooks and streams have overflowed as a result of drainage schemes previously effected, the scheme will not be economic.  Unless the fullest advantage is taken, it will not be economic.  It seems to me that an important part of our drainage programme is what happens after it has come into effect&mdash;what the farmers do when the floods have been removed; to what extent they take advantage of modern methods to increase their grass production; to what extent they <Col N="1880" /> carry out the fullest possible ditch and shore drainage.  If the two Departments can combine together to assure the maximum effect, it seems to me that the Drainage Act will have twice its economic value.</P>
    <P>I made inquiries in connection with some drainage schemes carried out in the past 20 years and I found that a very high proportion of the farmers, partly because of declining prices and partly because of the economic war, did not take advantage of the main drainage effected for them.  They did not carry out field drainage of any description, and it would seem absolutely essential on this occasion to develop the two together.  Moreover, I was also making a study of drainage as carried out in other countries similar to our own, and I found that a great deal has been done in the past 20 years to alter the methods of using recently-drained land.</P>
    <P>It is impossible for many farmers to ascertain with accuracy what the water-table level in their holdings is, and, in relation to that, the best kind of herbage to produce when drainage has taken place.  The water-table, as most Deputies will know, is the level up to which water goes beneath farm land through the development of ordinary drainage levels, and, in the past 20 years, there has been a very great development in the knowledge of particular classes of herbage suitable for particular drained land, and whereas 20 years ago it might pay a farmer to use land freshly drained only for grazing purposes, the position now has changed and there will be a number of alternatives open to him.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I should like very much to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary to what extent it would be possible to push land improvement in general in connection with this drainage scheme.  I refuse to take the pessimistic attitude that drainage is not economic because it cannot be carried out on the basis that those who benefit immediately pay for it completely, and that it is therefore not worth while.  Apart from many health <Col N="1881" /> reasons, I believe it will stimulate better production; it will give confidence to the farmer and encourage him to modernise his production; and it will bring hope to many people who have become indifferent to the potentialities of their land because they were invaded by floods and saw no possibility of increasing production under the many excellent schemes already provided for them by the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Drainage Bill.  No doubt it is very essential for the country in general, but I would suggest that such a gigantic scheme as this should not be undertaken until such time as conditions are restored to normal after the emergency.  In the first place, you cannot get labour.  At different meetings designed to encourage the production of food for the nation, we find that labour is the problem, and if such a Bill as this is to be put into force in the near future, where are we to get the necessary labour?  I suggest that the scheme be left over until after the war.  Prepare the schemes to the full; be ready for the period after the emergency when many men will be disbanded from the Army; and then go ahead with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the cost of maintenance, I entirely disagree with the idea that the cost should be borne by the local authority.  Local authorities already have burdens heavy enough without having to bear the maintenance cost of a huge drainage scheme. Everybody will agree that many farmers and poor people in the towns cannot and ought not be asked to pay a county rate to meet a county-at-large charge in respect of a gigantic drainage scheme.  I suggest that the cost should be provided out of the Central Fund, and that if this drainage is to be of such benefit to the land in general, the land should pay a certain share of the cost.  If that land is put into production, it will have a greater national value than heretofore. This drainage will return a dividend to the nation for the expenditure incurred in maintaining it and I see no <Col N="1882" /> reason why it should not be maintained out of the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>Take the man on the mountainside, the smallholder.  Even though his valuation may be very low, I see no reason why he should be asked to contribute on behalf of his more fortunate neighbour in the lowlands, who may have 150 acres of land, 50 acres of which may benefit substantially from the scheme, and who may have an income from his land five or six times as great.  He has heavy burdens to bear; he has a family to maintain; and his land is much less fertile; and it is very unjust to suggest that he and others like him&mdash;the worker in the cottage, for example&mdash; should be asked to contribute to the maintenance of this scheme which, possibly will benefit the big land owner.  If the land is to benefit from a national scheme such as this, the nation as a whole should be asked to contribute to it.</P>
    <P>Local authorities will have more to contend with after this war than many of us can realise to-day.  There are demands for increased hospitalisation all over the country, and I agree that hospitalisation ought to be on a much greater scale than it is, but these hospitals will have to be staffed to a greater extent than at present.  The rising generation will not accept what they have been getting heretofore&mdash; salaries which would not keep them clothed.  They will have to be properly looked after and proper hospitals will have to be provided.  The local authorities must bear the cost.  Who else is there to do it?  We have recently seen a programme of new roads to be carried out after the war.  Who will pay for them?  The ratepayer who has enough to pay for already will have to pay for building them and for maintaining them.  They will be a county-at-large charge, and I see no reason why this burden should also be placed on the local ratepayer.  If this is to be a national scheme, let it be maintained by the nation.</P>
    <P>Another section of the Bill deals with embankments, old drainage schemes, and so on.  Many of the old embankments were maintained by the Land <Col N="1883" /> Commission in days gone by and, even up to now, they are their responsibility. If that is so, why should a local authority have to accept the responsibility of the Land Commission? Breaches in river embankments due to high tides in a flood will cost thousands in a night.  How could a county ratepayer be asked to bear the cost of the repair of such damage?  I think it should be borne by the State.  The Land Commission up to some years ago did not have the benefit of the moneys collected in the shape of land annuities.  To-day these annuities are retained at home, and why should the Land Commission try to place the responsibility on the ratepayers?</P>
    <P>I hold that they are more liable to maintain the embankments to-day than ever.  I hold that a percentage of that money which is being or has been collected as land annuities should go towards the maintenance of drainage schemes and that maintenance should not be made a county-at-large charge.  I see no reason why the poorer sections of the people should be asked to shoulder the burden.  I know of cases in my own locality where breaches in such embankments would cost thousands of pounds to-day to repair.  Even if they came under the Bill and were repaired, it is quite likely that within a week or ten days after the repairs had been carried out another breach would occur and a further charge of thousands of pounds would be thrown on the shoulders of the unfortunate ratepayers.  For that reason, I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to remove Section 48 from the Bill and have the maintenance costs made a national charge and not a charge on the rural ratepayers.  I know of several rich and well-to-do farmers with large incomes in the locality that I speak of who will benefit by the Bill.  The poor unfortunate men trying to eke out an existence on the mountainside will not benefit by it and I think it is unjust that they should be asked to contribute towards the maintenance of the drainage of that land. If that land is improved by a Government scheme, the nation will benefit and, as well as maintenance being made <Col N="1884" /> a national charge, I hold that a percentage of the maintenance charges should be placed on the land benefited.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>With other speakers, I welcome the Bill for what it is worth. But there is no doubt that there is a great deal in what Deputy McGilligan said, namely, that there is an amount of make-believe about the Bill.  It is purely and simply an enabling Bill.  It is a promise to do drainage.  That promise is being given statutory effect but it is no more than that.  No scheme of drainage is put before us and the Bill after it is passed will not drain anything.  We must wait for what will come afterwards. It will be very long afterwards before any real effects are seen from it.</P>
      <P>There is no need, as some Deputies have done, to look for fantastic reasons for supporting this Bill. Some of the reasons advanced by various Deputies were fantastic. Deputy Allen gave one reason.  I think it was in order to salve his orthodox economic conscience, if I might call it that.  He said he was supporting the Bill because of the wonderful improvement it would make in the public health of the country. There is not a shred of evidence before us that arterial drainage will benefit the health of the country in the least.  It may be that it will, but it is just quite on the cards that it will not have the slightest effect on public health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just giving my opinion, and Deputy Allen has only given his opinion.  There is not a shred of evidence before the House that drainage will benefit public health in the slightest way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>My opinion is as good as yours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying it is not. The Deputy gave it as his opinion, as if it were based on undeniable and irrefutable evidence, that it must follow as night follows day that there will be an improvement in public health generally if arterial drainage is carried out.  There is no such <Col N="1885" /> evidence.  I do not know whether Deputy O'Higgins intends to speak on this, but he told me that he had heard two very eminent medical men discussing that very matter.  One of them &mdash;who was a very eminent specialist&mdash; quoted quite a lot of statistics to show that the healthiest man was the man who lived in the middle of a bog, in a swamp.  I do not accept that view. However, he was entitled to his opinion, just as Deputy Allen is entitled to his opinion, and as I am entitled to my opinion.  I do not think that there is any need at all to look for reasons of that kind for supporting this Bill.</P>
      <P>I entirely agree with Deputy Childers' view of the economic value of the matter.  All these theories of what are and what are not economic are in no sense infallible.  They, too, are purely matters of opinion.  Where a scheme will help to increase the productivity of the country, I think that such a scheme is, in the last event, economic, no matter what it may cost.</P>
      <P>I think it was Deputy Bennett said that he could not see anything to support the opinion that this scheme would be spread over 28 years.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary's statement, that he accepted the view of the Drainage Commission, would bear out the statement that it will take from 28 to 30 years to carry out the programme envisaged by the Drainage Commission. That programme is not in this Bill, but the Bill will enable that programme to be carried out.  It is, apparently, the intention of the Parliamentary Secretary that it will be spread over that number of years; that, in fact, we have not the machinery, neither the human machinery in the way of engineers, etc., nor the physical machinery in the way of excavators, which would enable us to spend more than about £250,000 a year.  If you are only able to spend £250,000 a year on a scheme which is to cost £7,000,000, it is only a sum in simple division to divide £250,000 into £7,000,000, and you will get something roughly in the neighbourhood of 28 years; so that it will be spread over 28 years at the rate of about £250,000 per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also a pity that this arterial drainage scheme should be referred to <Col N="1886" /> as if it were a relief scheme.  Deputy Donnellan and others spoke of it as if it were just another one of those special employment schemes that we have heard a good deal about to deal with the problem of unemployment.  I think that arterial drainage should not be faced in that way.  We all hope, of course, that each scheme as it comes along will absorb a number of our unemployed. But we must not run away with the idea that it will make a big difference at the rate of £250,000 a year.  It will not make a big difference in our unemployment problem.  As a matter of fact, the commission in their report, under the heading of &ldquo;Labour Content,&rdquo; paragraph 200, state:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Our examination has led us to the conclusion that, on construction works, the total average labour content will vary between 40 and 50 per cent. of the total cost....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is, the labour content including engineering and other overhead expenses.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;....and the unskilled labour content between 25 and 35 per cent. These calculations are based on the assumption that mechanical plant will be utilised as far as feasible.  On maintenance work, the average content, which will for the most part consist of unskilled labour, will vary from 70 to 80 per cent. of the total cost.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is on maintenance, which will, of course, be a small matter, but will also have the value of giving permanent employment. We must get out of our heads that this will be a complete panacea for our unemployment difficulties. It will not: it will absorb&mdash;if we are assuming that £250,000 will be spent per year&mdash;between 600 and 700 or, at the outside, 750 unskilled labourers in each scheme per annum. That is not a very big amount.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Drainage Commission in their assumption that mechanical plant must be utilised if the job is to be done properly.  After all, when dealing with arterial drainage, our first object must be that, when a scheme is undertaken, the job will be done properly and that, where excavators and so on are required, excavators will be used, even <Col N="1887" /> though that may mean lessening somewhat the number of people to be employed. I do not suppose that we could spend any more than £250,000 a year and, therefore, I think it is wiser to handle the problem in this way, in accordance with our resources in the way of qualified engineers with experience of this kind of work.  It is better to tackle the job and do it properly, even in that rather slow manner, than to rush in to undertake something we are incapable of doing and to botch the job.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Linehan who made a suggestion to the Parliamentary Secretary which he ought to note, that is, to get in touch now with the schools of engineering in the universities and point out the openings there may be in a few years, when the schemes are started, for the young engineers.  That will turn the minds of those attending the engineering schools in that direction.  A special course of lectures could be given to the students now training as engineers, so that they might be ready to slip into jobs in these drainage schemes when they are qualified.</P>
    <P>I entirely accept the view that there must be a central authority, first of all, to carry out any drainage scheme that may eventuate as a result of the Bill, and especially for the purpose of looking after maintenance.  The only obvious central authority I can conceive is the Board of Works.  They have the engineering staffs and, I believe, they also have some mechanical plant.  That is the only body we have in this country suitable for the job.  I am not nearly as afraid as some of my friends are of bureaucratic control.  Perhaps it is because I was for ten years on those benches and had a fair experience of civil servants.  During my ten years, I never found any great desire amongst the civil servants to get hold of responsibility or to collar power.  The contrary is the fact.  I have mostly found that civil servants, by their training, avoided responsibility whenever they could.  Most of them hated to be put in a position where they would have <Col N="1888" /> to give a decision.  That is their training, and unless they have changed very much in the past 20 years, that is the position to-day.  Of course, it is quite possible that, with all the emergency powers and such things, they may have developed a bad habit since. Certainly, when I remember them, I never found any great desire among civil servants to seek power and, therefore, I am not as much afraid of bureaucratic control as persons who, possibly, have not had the intimate contact with the Civil Service which I had over that period.</P>
    <P>When I was talking about fantastic reasons for supporting the Bill, I was about to refer to those of Deputy Donnellan, which are the most amusing of all.  He wound up by saying that, because of what he had read in the Drainage Commission Report and because of the great value to Connaught, he was strongly in favour of the Bill.  He talked about it being greater than the Shannon scheme.  He thinks this particular Fianna Fáil promise&mdash;that is what it is&mdash;is greater than the actual fact of the Shannon scheme.  The funny part of it is that, if he had read the Drainage Commission Report closely at all, he would have found that they recommend two schemes in priority, to be dealt with whenever the drainage schemes are being undertaken.  One of them is in Munster and the other in Leinster and there is no reference to any scheme at all in Connaught, for priority.  The only two schemes the Drainage Commission mentioned were the Brick and Cashen in North Kerry&mdash;in my old constituency&mdash;and the Brosna in Offaly. I do not know whether the views of the Drainage Commission are being taken on that, or whether that priority will be given.  Even though I no longer represent the people in the Brick and Cashen area&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. F. Lynch Mr. F. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and there is the old grádh there, I suppose.  Apart from that, it is the greatest eye-sore in the whole country.  The description by the members of the commission of their visit to that area is very well <Col N="1889" /> worth reading, being a magnificent piece of description.  They describe how they stood on a bridge eight and a half miles from the sea, amid the saturated water-logged stretch of country stretching for miles around them. I hope that since the Parliamentary Secretary has, apparently, accepted the report practically in its entirety&mdash; apart from the provision for maintenance&mdash;he will also accept that part of the report and do what they suggest in priority&mdash;the Brick and Cashen and the Brosna.</P>
      <P>In the sense that it has so closely followed the recommendations of the members of the Drainage Commission, the Bill is very flattering to them.  I think that was wise; as their work was done well.  They recommended, in paragraph 330, as regards survey work prior to legislation:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If our recommendations are accepted, the promotion of the necessary legislation may occupy a considerable time.  We suggest that it might be desirable, pending such legislation, to undertake the necessary preliminary survey work in catchment areas selected for prior treatment so that the actual works could be launched with the least possible delay.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In his opening statement, the Parliamentary Secretary did not tell us whether or not any survey work had already been done, as was recommended in the report of the commission. In a Vote which subsequently came before the House&mdash;I think that it was a Vote making provision for the expenses of extra engineers&mdash;the Parliamentary Secretary told me, in reply to a question, that survey work had been done on the Brosna.  I should like to know what has happened in the case of the Brick and Cashen.  Has any survey work been carried out there and, if not, why not?  Has the Parliamentary Secretary departed from the recommendation of the Drainage Report in respect of that area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

Survey work is being carried out on the Brosna and has not started on the Brick and Cashen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that from the Parliamentary Secretary so long as he does not go off next to the Moy in Mayo.  When he has finished with the Brosna, I hope he will turn his face to the south-west.  Other matters in the Bill will be more appropriately discussed on the Committee Stage.  The provision of a panel of arbitrators will require a good deal of consideration before it can be agreed to.  I think that it would be far better if the Government, or the Parliamentary Secretary, would second a Circuit Court judge to do this work with the assistance of assessors.  That would give more satisfaction to the persons concerned with these schemes than the plan proposed.  There will be all sorts of claims regarding interference with fisheries and lands, and the decision of an experienced Circuit Court judge in such cases would be far more impressive and acceptable than that of a layman, no matter what his qualifications may be.  Arbitrators are generally engineers or valuers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a feeling amongst the people that if these men do not cut down their awards to the bone they will not be sent on the next arbitration. They are paid either in accordance with the number of sittings or according to the particular cases which they adjudicate.  It is a bad thing that people should feel that the arbitrators must cut down their awards so as to get the next job.  There would be no feeling of that kind if a Circuit Court judge were taken from his circuit and told to dispose of these cases. He would be quite independent of the Executive.  Once appointed, a circuit judge is perfectly independent and can give his decision according to the <Col N="1891" /> evidence presented to him.  I think that the Parliamentary Secretary should seriously consider some method of that kind to replace the proposal regarding a panel of arbitrators.</P>
    <P>There was one point which I should have mentioned before dealing with the last matter to which I have referred.  That is the question of embankments to which Deputy Heskin alluded.  The Bill is silent as to when it is proposed to take these over. Differing from Deputy Heskin, I am very anxious to see these embankments taken over by the Land Commission.  The only hope of their proper maintenance is to put them in the hands of the Board of Works. They have not been properly maintained in the past and are not being properly maintained now.  I presume that the funds at the disposal of the public trustee, or whatever other functionary is concerned, for dealing with these embankments will be placed against the maintenance charge; that whoever will be responsible for the maintenance will have the benefit of the funds reserved or retained for the maintenance of those embankments which used to be maintained by the landlords.  The sums retained by the Land Commission for the maintenance of these embankments will, I take it, be made available for the relief of the rates if the ratepayers have to maintain these embankments in the future.  I trust that the money retained for the upkeep of embankments which, in former times, were maintained by the landlord, will not be diverted into the Exchequer and the cost of maintenance thrown over on the local authorities.  I am not clear that that is the intention, but Deputy Heskin was of opinion that that was proposed.  I had not time since he delivered his speech to look more closely into the Bill to see if he was right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Part 4 deals with the handing over of the embankments, and I take it that reconstruction would be in the nature of a new arterial drainage <Col N="1892" /> scheme and would be a national charge.  Irrespective of any funds in the hands of a public trustee or drainage trustees, work which would be part of an arterial drainage scheme would, I take it, be a national charge.</P>

      <P>No.  These funds were intended for maintenance.  They were never sufficient to deal with such happenings as Deputy Heskin referred to&mdash;what might be described as acts of God.  These funds were never able to deal with conditions in which you had big floods or tides which wiped out hundreds of yards at a time.  Such breaches used to be dealt with out of the Unemployment Vote, and a great deal of excellent work was done in that way.  Like much of the excellent drainage work that was done, it was allowed to go to waste through want of a slight bit of care by way of maintenance subsequently.  When the Parliamentary Secretary asks us to vote money in the future for these purposes, the House will know that the money will not be thrown away, that the Board of Works will be in charge and that any arterial drainage scheme carried out will be properly maintained. That is one advantage I see in having the Board of Works in charge not only of the present construction of these works but of their subsequent maintenance.  It is only a body of that kind which knows exactly how the job should be tackled.  They will know how to do the work properly and prevent the money which will have been spent being wasted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F.H. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  It is an excellent Bill and a bold effort to solve a difficult problem. There is no doubt that drainage, within the past 100 years, has been sadly neglected here.  Mr. Hudson, the British Minister for Agriculture, in a recent speech stated that a complete survey of England, made since the last war, showed that 1,000,000 acres of arable land had gone <Col N="1893" /> to waste.  As regards our own country, I am fairly satisfied that since Griffith carried out his survey, basing it on the capacity of an acre of land to grow wheat, you would nearly have to write down the valuation of the country by 20 per cent.  I am not so much interested in the temporary employment that will be given while the actual drainage work is being carried out, as I am in the improvement of the land and the greater population that it will then be able to carry.  I calculate that for an expenditure of £7,000,000 and a consequent improvement of 500,000 acres of land it would mean that from 10,000 to 15,000 extra people would be employed on the land. That is the figure that I am really interested in.  I agree with Deputy Lynch that the actual drainage work will not employ the big numbers that some people expect.</P>
      <P>I would like to emphasise that our anxiety with regard to drainage will not end with the passing of this Bill. There is the grave danger that when it is passed it may be hung up for a certain length of time.  I would strongly advise the Parliamentary Secretary that, the moment the Bill is passed, he should carry out a complete survey of the country and he should do it immediately, if possible.  I would urge him to carry it out in a way that many people might not perhaps agree with.  First of all, he should carry out a survey of the rivers that are not likely to be touched by widening, dredging or otherwise.  If the survey is done along those lines, and if you schedule the areas that do not need artificial drainage, you can then go ahead with your subsidiary drains, minor drains, reclamation work and afforestation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Personally, I am a bit bewildered when I think of the administration of this measure when it becomes an Act. You will have a drainage scheme and a hydro-electric scheme possibly involved in it; you will probably have a waterworks scheme and even a sewerage scheme.  So many other Departments are going to be involved in this that I am not too happy about the constitution of the drainage authority. <Col N="1894" /> If there is a hydro-electric scheme, the Minister for Industry and Commerce will be involved in that.  If such a scheme is needed in certain rivers then a drainage scheme will not be needed in them.  If a hydro-electric scheme is combined with a waterworks scheme, as has been done in the case of the Liffey, that might have the effect of altering the whole course of the subsequent drainage of the river in question.  In other words, you would have the following Departments involved: Local Government and Public Health, Industry and Commerce, Lands and Agriculture since the fisheries might be vitally affected. The improvement of the land will naturally be affected.  The Department of Industry and Commerce will be involved in the hydro-electric scheme, or in the construction of canals.  The Department of Local Government will be involved if there is such a thing as a waterworks scheme, sewerage scheme, or the construction of a bridge.</P>
    <P>When I think of all that, and visualise the fact that schemes have been submitted by county managers to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health for the improvement of roads involving a possible expenditure of £30,000,000, that schemes for waterworks and sewerage to the tune of £6,000,000 have been submitted to him, that the Department of Industry and Commerce is interested in a scheme involving £10,000,000 in connection with transport, and that big developments are contemplated by the Department of Agriculture for the improvement of the inland fisheries, I am just wondering whether we should not have a national planning council. I am satisfied that this Bill really points to that.</P>
    <P>It means in a nutshell that if you carry out a drainage scheme and, at a later stage, find that a hydro-electric scheme should be constructed in the upper reaches of a river, it would be far better if you had never carried out your drainage scheme, because possibly the hydro-electric scheme would have provided a big catchment area in the upper reaches; <Col N="1895" /> it would have held the water from the upper and the mountain streams and would, possibly, obviate the necessity of having a drainage scheme further down.  For that reason I strongly suggest that the composition of the drainage authority should be one representative from the Department of Local Government and Public Health, one from the Department of Industry and Commerce and one from the Department of Agriculture, with the three existing Commissioners of Public Works.</P>
    <P>Speaking for my own particular district, I can say that until certain drainage schemes are carried out there afforestation will be held up.  Over wide stretches of the country reclamation schemes, which are also badly needed, will be held up, while turf development will definitely be held up in areas where you have numerous unemployed.  When I put forward suggestions that minor relief schemes should be carried out in the construction of drains and of subsidiary drains in certain areas, I have been told that these must wait for an arterial drainage scheme.  It is because of that that I strongly suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that, immediately this Bill is passed, he should get his engineers first of all to schedule the areas that do not need arterial drainage so that afforestation, the reclamation of land and the drainage of bogs may start immediately.  I have given the Bill fair criticism from the point of view of administration.  But, as I said at the outset, I think it is a bold Bill to solve a very difficult problem.</P>
    <P>I was a bit surprised to hear Deputy Lynch chipping at Deputy Allen and saying that drainage would not improve health.  Everybody knows that before you build a house you have to drain the site into a minor drain, from a minor drain into a subsidiary drain, and from that into a river.  We known what the Pontine Marshes were; we heard a lot about them and the diseases for which they were responsible. There are no places of that sort in this country, but if a house is built in a damp district, in an area <Col N="1896" /> where the surrounding district is very damp, that breeds tuberculosis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  It is a measure that is long overdue.  One of the weak points is the period calculated to give full effect to the provisions of the Bill.  The £7,000,000 that will be expended on drainage will be divided over 28 years, the expenditure to be made at the rate of £250,000 a year.  There was no mention as to where the money is to come from. Perhaps it might be wise to be slow and sure about the operation of legislation of this sort.</P>
      <P>There are some sections of this Bill that deserve attention.  The Parliamentary Secretary said he was anxious to get the co-operation of every member of the House.  I am sure he will have that co-operation, and I trust he will give full consideration to the amendments that will be submitted for the Committee Stage.  The maintenance of the drainage will, in my opinion, mean a very heavy burden on the taxpayer.  Taxpayers generally feel that they are already taxed to the limit of their capacity.  They have the feeling, too, that the maintenance of the proposed drainage works will mean an unusually heavy burden in the years to come, and that the taxation for drainage purposes will tend to grow.</P>
      <P>So far as maintenance is concerned, I am satisfied that each county should bear portion of the cost.  At the same time, as this is a national drainage scheme, I feel the maintenance work should be subsidised each year out of national funds.  A comparison may be made with the main roads.  They are being subsidised year after year.  They are constructed out of subsidised money and are being used to accommodate the public.  So far as the drainage scheme is concerned, it may be beneficial only to one part of a county, yet the whole county will have to pay. I think the drainage scheme finance should be put on the same basis as that applying to road construction and maintenance.  I feel that the county, in the first instance, should contribute a reasonable amount towards the maintenance, but a reasonable amount should also come out of State funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1897" /> Section 17 refers to the provision of water-power in the case of mills, factories and other industries, and deals with the rights of mill owners.  I have in mind some mills that have been erected on main rivers.  Those mills were erected there simply to avail of the water-power.  At the present time most of those mills are giving a considerable amount of employment.  In my own county there are three mills run by water and I am aware of the benefit they are to their particular areas from the point of view of employment and a reduction in the cost of manufactured commodities.  Those mills serve at least two useful purposes&mdash;they give employment and the goods they produce can be distributed at a cheaper rate to the people in their respective areas.</P>
    <P>As regards the assessment of compensation for those mills, in paragraph (c) of Section 17 the period of ten years is mentioned.  I think the period on which compensation will be based should be thought out in a very broadminded way, for this reason: that when the mill was erected, the intention was to extend its power; in other words, the power that is being used to-day in that mill is not the limit of the power intended by the owner when the mill was erected.  In those circumstances, I think the period of ten years would not produce a fair calculation as to the value of the water-power utilised in the working of the mill.</P>
    <P>It may happen that mills or factories may be able to retain the pressure of water that they have now, but if as a result of drainage that pressure cannot be retained, I suggest that alternative power should be given to them if it is available.  Electrical power is available in a number of places and, where that is so, it would be one way of assisting these men to keep in production. While on that I wish to refer to the position of arbitrators.  It is my experience that people are not satisfied that the amount of compensation allowed by arbitrators in these cases is sufficient.  I have in mind places where land was acquired for the erection of labourers' cottages but the amount of compensation allowed was <Col N="1898" /> not at all favourable to the owners of the land.</P>
    <P>I agree with the suggestion of Deputy Lynch that if a claim for compensation is made, the tribunal to decide it should consist of a judge before which both parties should make their case.  A judge would have a free hand and would be preferable to arbitrators. Amendments will be introduced on the Committee Stage and I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will take into consideration the viewpoint of those responsible for them. If he does, he can take it that he will have co-operation from all sides of the House in making this Bill as workable as it is possible to make it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been welcomed from all sides of the House.  It is undoubtedly a far reaching measure and one that will do a great deal of good.  There are sections in the Bill that I should like to see amended.  One Deputy has called attention to what I consider to be a great danger.  People seem to think that when work is to be done at the expense of the rates or out of State funds it is up to everyone to grab all they can and to give compensation to Jack, Bill and Tom.  That is why I definitely object to the manner in which some sections of the Bill are drafted, throwing the cost of maintenance on to local ratepayers.  According to the statement of the Parliamentary Secretary, drainage work will not start for five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear the Parliamentary Secretary saying that.  I would like to see work starting when the Bill passes, as it will take 28 years before it is finished, allowing for an expenditure of £250,000 yearly.  There is to be an appointed day on which the capital charge will be taken over by the State, and the maintenance rate taken over as a county at large charge by the local authorities.  I will give an example of what happened on the Aubeg scheme between Buttevant and Charleville.  That scheme cost £16,000, of which the ratepayers of Cork County paid £11,000 as a county at large charge, while <Col N="1899" /> £5,000 was paid by the tenants of the area affected as a maintenance charge. The ratepayers of Cork County are paying £710 yearly for the Aubeg scheme for 35 years, the tenants are paying £300 yearly for maintenance charges, and £363 of an annuity as their share of the capital charge.</P>
      <P>On the appointed day the £363 will be put on the backs of the taxpayers, and the £300 will be taken off the backs of the tenants and also put on the backs of the ratepayers as a county at large charge, leaving people who were quite satisfied, and who thanked the county council for the generous contribution that conferred such benefit on their land, clear of all charges. In my opinion that is going to be a bad proposition, because people are not going to have any interest in these matters if they have not to pay.  If they have to pay something they will see that the work is done.  I think the ratepayers of Cork County did sufficient when they paid £11,000 on a £16,000 drainage scheme, without having this extra burden thrown upon them.</P>
      <P>I am always suspicious of Government schemes, because people always try to grab all that is going and to throw the debt over on somebody else. We have an instance of that in the case of embankments.  A real injury was done tenants when land was being purchased as in most cases sufficient money was not withheld for the upkeep of embankments.  I have a case in mind where four years ago an embankment gave way, and the only way in which the owner of the farm could save his land was by going to the Land Commission and asking them to put an extra annuity on it for the repair of the embankment. That was due to Land Commission negligence in the first instance, in not withholding sufficient money for such work.  Here is what is going to happen under this scheme. Trust funds are now in the hands of the Land Commission for the maintenance of embankments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those trust funds are now going to be taken over by the State, but the job that those trust funds were held for, <Col N="1900" /> namely, the maintenance of the embankments, is to be thrown over on the local ratepayer, under the Act. There is no doubt that the Bill is a good one, that it will have a far-reaching effect, and that a thing that is badly needed in this country is the making of a decent job of drainage, once and for all.  I do not want to delay the House, as we will have an opportunity of discussing the Bill more fully on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, as has been pointed out, by several speakers, has been long overdue, and if the Parliamentary Secretary tackles the problem of drainage in the manner that is envisaged, this will certainly be a wonderful measure.  I should like to say a few words about the West of Ireland, where there is a very heavy rainfall.  Deputy Lynch does not seem to think so, but there is a very heavy rainfall there, and I think that wonderful benefits will accrue as a result of this Bill&mdash;that is, if we do not have to wait, as we are told, for 28 years. There are a few outstanding points in connection with the Bill to which I should like to refer.  Firstly, there is no indication as to where the money is to come from.  In the case of the Children's Allowances Bill there was an indication as to how the money was to be raised, and the Minister concerned indicated, on the Second Reading of that Bill, how it would be raised, but there is no such indication in this Bill.  The second point I should like to make is that £250,000 a year is a rather small amount. There are many schemes in the country that badly need being attended to, and, in my opinion, £250,000 a year will not go half-way towards dealing with these schemes.  Are we to understand that this job will be a slow one, and will drag on from year to year for the next 28 years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other thing that I should like to ascertain, and that is the definition of the word &ldquo;arterial.&rdquo; That word comes into the Bill very often, but we are given no indication as to what is its real definition.  The Parliamentary Secretary directed attention to Section 48 of the Bill. <Col N="1901" /> That section gives power to the commissioners to compel the repair of watercourses.  It says that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... it shall be lawful for the commissioners, by notice in writing, served personally or by post, on an occupier of land, to require such occupier, within such time as shall be specified in the notice, to restore, open up, and generally put into proper repair and effective condition such watercourses on the land as are specified in such notice.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, if we go back to the definition portion of the Bill, we are told that the word &ldquo;watercourses&rdquo; includes &ldquo;rivers, streams and other natural watercourses, and also canals drains, and other artificial watercourses.&rdquo; Section 48, undoubtedly, is a very necessary section because, in the case of drainage schemes undertaken by the Board of Works in the past, it was quite a common thing to get a number of people to agree to a scheme, but one farmer, perhaps, would refuse, as a result of which the whole scheme was held up.  Accordingly, I agree that Section 48 is a very good section, but I wish to point out that according to the definition of the word &ldquo;watercourse&rdquo;, it would mean that people can be compelled to clear up and repair watercourses which are definitely rivers.  At least, that is my reading of it, and I think there will have to be a change in that, because it is quite clear that a farmer, or even a group of farmers, could not be expected to clear a canal or a large river, or what is called here an artificial watercourse.  While it is usually within the capacity of any farmer or group of farmers to keep a drain of, let us say, two feet wide, clear, it would be quite beyond their capacity to keep a large river clear.  It seems to me that that is a serious flaw in the Bill, which requires remedying because, if it is not remedied, it would mean that it would be obligatory on a farmer to clear a river on both sides&mdash; say, a river 16 feet or more wide&mdash; which would be a considerable hardship. I think that that would be a matter for the Board of Works, rather than for the individual farmer.  I want <Col N="1902" /> to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to that, because  believe that it will prove to be impossible of achievement if the section is left as it is.</P>
    <P>There is another thing in connection with this Bill to which I should like to draw attention, and that is the question of employment in the post-war period.  Undoubtedly; there will be unemployment on a large scale in the post-war period.  I do not wish to say more about that at the moment, but it appears to me that the Parliamentary Secretary will have to take power to increase that amount of £250,000 to £1,000,000 or even £2,000,000 a year for the first two or three years of the post-war period, with a view to providing employment here.  If that can be done, very good work could be accomplished as a result of this Bill.  Deputy Lynch had a tilt at Deputy Allen because Deputy Allen said that one of the effects of this Bill would be to improve the health of the people.  I quite agree with Deputy Allen on that.  Deputy Lynch had another tilt at Deputies of this House on the question of drainage in Mayo, Roscommon, and other portions of the West of Ireland.  Deputy Lynch seems to be concerned particularly about Kerry, but I think that Connaught, on account of the very heavy rainfall there and the vast amount of low-lying land, deserves special attention.  Lastly, I should like to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to one old drainage scheme in my locality which, I think, goes back to 1852.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary has heard of it.  At the present time a job is being put into operation there under the county manager.  Something like 40 or 50 families are concerned, but the strange thing is that if the job is well and thoroughly done, it will mean that a big bog will be drained into the arable land of these families and their land will become flooded.  That has been the case in the past every time the job was done even fairly efficiently, and the result has been that these people certainly did not benefit.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether there is any way of taking these things into consideration.  I realise that, compared <Col N="1903" /> with the general scheme, this is only a small matter, but in this particular case there are about 100 acres of shaking bog or pure mire, and some thing like 40 or 50 families will be affected.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to give sympathetic consideration to that matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the discussion on this Bill is likely to be very long drawn-out.  I am not enamoured of the Bill, and I see nothing very revolutionary in it.  For the last 25 years or so, the great question here has been how to keep our workers on the land at home, but at the present rate of emigration it seems to me that we shall have nothing but old age pensioners left here to enjoy the benefits of this drainage scheme, particularly as we are told that it will take 28 years to accomplish.  The great leaders of Ireland in the past told us that we should keep our people at home here and give them a proper standard of life that would enable them to keep themselves and their families in frugal comfort, but what is the position that we have now?  We are nothing but a nation of paupers.  It is my belief that too much attention is being paid to high finance and not enough to the ordinary financial requirements of the people of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is the product of men who have the mentality of Senator Sir John Keane.  I should like to see the Bill the responsibility of a man like Professor O'Rahilly, who believes in the regeneration of this country.  The Bill is a poor headline for post-war planning. On the basis of a proper Drainage Bill we could definitely start our post-war planning.  It is my belief that we could mobilise not alone our finances but our manpower on the basis of a properly conceived Drainage Bill.  When one speaks of mobilising labour it may sound very revolutionary but on the other hand, when we realise that during the last 25 years there have been anything up to 100,000 unemployed men in this country, many of them, no doubt, genuinely seeking work, but many more who would not work under any conditions so long as they could get the dole, I think it <Col N="1904" /> will be agreed that the time has come when some drastic steps should be taken to deal with these work-shys who are living on the sweat of the honest workers of the country.  We see many of them slipping out of the country over to England, where they are content to work under the most depressing conditions although they absolutely refuse to work on a bog or on the land here at home.  I think it is time that all classes should be satisfied to work for the good of the country under equal conditions here at home. There is too much of a tendency to sidetrack schemes that are intended for the common good.  Even here one sees a desire on the part of some Deputies to play up to the mob and there is a sort of competition to see how many votes we can catch by being nice to everybody.  I think it should stop.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, the Parliamentary Secretary in bringing in a Bill of this kind should have proceeded on more revolutionary lines.  I know that in his heart he is a type who would be inclined to adopt revolutionary lines when necessary, but he is bound down by the customs and precedents that have obtained up to the present.  I hold that we should harness the man-power of the country as well as our financial resources to carry out national schemes of this character, so that everybody and not a favoured few will benefit.  As things stand at the moment the rich are getting richer although, for the most part, living lives of ease and idleness, while the poor are getting poorer.  We must strive to give everybody a chance of earning a decent livelihood within the country.</P>
    <P>I have always held that far too much time is wasted in the preparation of schemes of this character, and that a good deal of the money spent on the preparation of maps and things of that character would enable us to give employment at an earlier stage to men who really need work.  I hold that many of these areas were mapped several times in the past and that there is no necessity to repeat the process for this scheme.  There is hardly any drainage scheme that is not known from A to Z, because the country has been mapped several times in every county.  I hold that we could go ahead <Col N="1905" /> with schemes under this Bill without going through all this mapping again. I see no reason why we should not start these works immediately the Bill has been passed.  In my own county there are alleged drainage schemes where farmers are asked to pay for the drainage of their land, but where, in actual fact, they are paying for the water that floods their farms.  They have been brought into court year after year to compel them to pay arrears but the position has been so bad that the judge felt that he could not in justice give a decree against them.  I welcome the Bill from the point of view that it may enable some relief to be given to these people.</P>
    <P>A short time ago we heard a long statement from another Minister in an after-dinner speech about the beautiful roads that were to be constructed after the war, roads that were to be skating rinks from Dublin to Athlone and other areas all over the country.  I hold that talk of that kind is the purest tripe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that when the Bill comes into effect we shall not have skating rinks for our big financiers all over the country.  In my opinion the financial provisions of this Bill are altogether too vague.  Nobody seems to know where the money is to come from, and I should like the Parliamentary Secretary when he is replying to tell us exactly where we stand in regard to the financial provisions of the Bill.  I should also like to know what is to become of overseers who are at present in charge of drainage areas in various districts.  Are they to be thrown out of their positions without compensation?  I know that in my own county some of these overseers had salaries ranging from £150 to £200 a year.  They were very good men at their work and are they now to be scrapped without any compensation? I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will give a clear indication as to their position when he is replying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1906" /> As I have already said, I am not a bit enamoured of this Bill.  It is simply a case of &ldquo;live horse and you will get grass&rdquo;.  I want to see the finances and the man-power of this country mobilised for the common good, so that we can remove a big load from the backs of the taxpayers who have been obliged to support so many men in idleness for years past.  I welcome the Bill from that stand-point, though I think the Parliamentary Secretary will realise that it is not going to bring about the wonderful change that some Deputies have predicted. Talk of that kind is just vague political nonsense.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of drainage in this country has always been regarded as very important, and substantial sums have been expended in the past in an effort to solve the problem.  Maintenance has also been a very big problem and it is true to say that the bill that confronts us now would not be so formidable were it not for the lack of care of existing schemes.  If the existing schemes had been maintained, the bill would not be so heavy.  Personally, I am satisfied the contemplated expenditure of £7,000,000 will be found totally inadequate to carry out necessary schemes. I assert that the problem is very acute and I think it is foolish to suggest that a mere expenditure of £250,000 per annum will be sufficient to deal adequately with it.</P>
      <P>To have any effect, drainage will have to be carried out on a much greater scale.  On the calculation made by the Parliamentary Secretary it will take approximately 34 years before the last scheme is finished. That is a very long time, and even though some Deputies on the opposite benches were optimistic enough to think that the Parliamentary Secretary might still be available here when the last scheme is completed, I think that if he is here, he will be the possessor of a very long beard by that time.  I think the problem will have to be tackled in such a way as to ensure that the work will be carried out on a much bigger and more expeditious scale.</P>

      <Col N="1907" /> Although a number of Deputies in this House have welcomed the Bill, I fear that it is really a purely political Bill in the sense that you are going to have keen rivalry as to which district will have the first scheme.  Between now and the next election, every Deputy on the opposite benches will boast that his particular district is promised the first scheme.  The electors in each area will be told that if Fianna Fáil are in office their particular district will get the first crack of the whip.</P>

      <P>The Bill will allow the Government Party to make a promise within the next four years, and before the next election, that every district in the country will be the first district.  It will be an encouragement to people to maintain the Government in office, and then very unseemly disputes will arise as to which scheme should start first.  A survey has been made in a number of cases, and where surveys have been made the schemes should be proceeded with at a far greater rate of speed. In view of the number of people who are unemployed, there is no reason in <Col N="1908" /> the world why the Government could not proceed with those schemes that do not require machinery, schemes with a high labour content.  If they were to do that, I am satisfied that they could spend much more than £250,000 a year; they could spend £1,000,000 a year or more.  I admit that some of the schemes will require mechanical aid as well as man-power, and in these cases there will be delay. They cannot be started until the machinery is available, but efforts should be made to have the machinery produced in this country.  Production &mdash;even at an uneconomic price&mdash;if it involves labour, creates assets, and every acre of land that is improved becomes an asset and gives value for any money spent on it.</P>
      <P>Although some Deputies, and some members of my own Party, do not approve of the central authority, as one who gave evidence before the Drainage Commission, I am glad that the idea of the central authority is being developed.  I think that it is the only method by which effective drainage can be carried out in this country.  Hitherto, each drainage board was a unit in itself, and did not care who was drowned if it kept its own head above water.  By having a central authority, there will be coordinated effort and unified control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the maintenance should not only be carried out by them but that the rate should be struck and collected by the central authority because, as sure as we are here, when a maintenance rate is struck, or a demand made for the striking of a maintenance rate, there will be councils revolting, and all that sort of thing, and the result will be that, as in the case of the late drainage boards or trustees, the rate will not be struck.  There will be mutinies and all that sort of thing against it by the local authorities. Therefore, I assert that the entire responsibility for drainage should be taken over by the central authority plus an advisory committee from every particular county.  In that way you would have local influence plus, if you like, the dictatorial control of the governing body in getting the work done.  If the scheme is not carried out <Col N="1909" /> in that way, in my opinion, it will not be effective.</P>
    <P>A question arises as to the position of the existing employees.  There is no mention in the Bill, as far as I can find, as to what is to become of them. Some arrangement must be made for them because they have been officials of these boards for a long time and they are entitled to compensation.  Of course, they may be re-employed by the central authority.</P>
    <P>The Second Schedule provides for the taking over of the assets and liabilities of the dissolved drainage boards after the appointed day.  I do not know if the Minister realises that many of these boards owe considerable sums of money to banks, and that some members, in their official capacity as members of the drainage boards, became guarantors to the bank for sums of money.  That is a matter in connection with which they should not be called upon to bear liability.  They are responsible in their personal capacity to the bank as guarantors, and I want to ensure that where these liabilities exist, the matter is covered in this particular Schedule.  Is it correct that it is covered?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>That will be a great relief to a number of people who have liabilities to the bank for drainage works that were done.  It will be news that they will be glad to hear.  The chief point to which I wish to refer is the time taken for this <Col N="1910" /> scheme.  If a drainage work of this magnitude is to be drawn out over a prolonged period of even 20 years, the work carried out in the beginning will have to be done again by the time the last work is carried out.  The drainage would not last that length of time unless it were maintained at high pressure. Therefore, when the Government are undertaking a drainage scheme, let it be done on a generous scale at once; let it be tackled in a big way; let the men be employed on it.  There are many engineers in the country and in the Board of Works capable of supervising and directing this work.  Therefore do not put it off for a 20-year period.  Tackle the matter and get it done speedily so that, at a maximum, in ten years the job will be completed. It may be said that that would cost too much and that the money could not be obtained in that time.  I assert that the issue of the equivalent of land bonds, or something like that, for this purpose would be worth while and would be the proper method of financing the scheme.  Instead of people having to leave the country to seek employment there would be employment here for everybody and the dream of the present Minister for Supplies could be realised, namely, the return of the exiles in America and England to do the work.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The areas in which a reorganisation has been put into effect are County Mayo, County Galway, County Sligo, <Col N="1805" /> and portion of County Leitrim, north of a line running from Carrigallen to Dromod; part of County Longford west of a line joining Dromod, Longford town and Lanesboro'; parts of the Counties Westmeath, Offaly, Leix and Tipperary west of a line from Athlone to Tullamore to a point approximately three miles west of Mountmellick; thence to Clonaslee, Kinnity, Roscrea, Moneygall, Toomevara and Silvermines to the Shannon at a point approximately three miles north of Killaloe.  In addition, as from the 1st February, controlled transport has been initiated in the Counties Clare, Limerick and Kerry. Individual licensed and exempt area hauliers are not affected by the reorganisation of transport.  For the Deputy's information, I would state that 234 such hauliers are now operatting in these areas.</P>
    <P>The number of privately-owned lorries which has been eliminated in the areas now under control totals 842.  A number of these vehicles have, however, been hired from time to time to cater for seasonal traffic.</P>
