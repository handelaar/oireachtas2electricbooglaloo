    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, when introducing this Estimate, said that under a new Emergency Order he had taken powers to dissolve local authorities, if necessary, without holding an inquiry.  I think the Minister, if he gives further consideration to the wisdom of using such powers, might change his mind.  This is a democratic country&mdash;it is supposed to be, at all events.  We set up local authorities, which give voluntary services; some of them are quite honest and quite sincere in their work, and most anxious to comply with the law in every respect.</P>
      <P>I think the threat the Minister has made to these local authorities is, in the circumstances, unjustified.  Simply because one local authority has failed in its responsibility, the Minister lashes out with all sorts of threats to local authorities generally.  I do not think there is any justification whatever for the Minister's attitude in that respect.  I think it is an insult and an injustice to local authorities that because one local authority has failed to provide certain necessary finances, the Minister should threaten the big stick on all of them; and not merely that, but threaten to dissolve them without the necessary sworn inquiry. Surely the Minister will not assume the role of absolute dictator, and dissolve local authorities without giving them an opportunity to defend themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister pursues that line, he may find it disastrous in the long run. If a local authority were critical of the Minister or his Department, he might use the powers given under this Emergency Powers Order to squelch that local authority.  There is one thing we should insist on.  I think the Minister, in his own interest, apart from any other consideration, should clearly demonstrate to the public, when <Col N="644" /> he decides that a local authority must be dissolved, that he is fully justified in carrying out that dissolution, and he must satisfy public opinion, when he takes drastic action by dissolving a local authority, that a sworn inquiry fully justifies that action.</P>
    <P>How can a Minister justify his action if he does not take all the necessary precautions to satisfy the public mind?  It savours far too much of the dictator and I resent, on behalf of local authorities generally, his threat that he is going to dissolve without a sworn inquiry.  I say that in my opinion it is very, very unwise for the Minister to suggest that drastic action of that sort should be taken without having examined all the circumstances. The Minister may try to justify it on the point that it would save cost. Whatever a sworn inquiry costs, surely it is worth the expenditure if it satisfies the public mind that the problem has been fully examined, that the local authority that is about to be dissolved has been given every opportunity to defend itself.  A denial of that principle, in any circumstances, in my opinion is not democratic.</P>
    <P>I suggested before to the Minister that in the matter of public assistance he should insist that county managers should have a committee to advise them.  I think the Minister must agree with me as to the wisdom of that course.  Local people who are in touch with the problem, who are <i>au fait</i> with the difficulties of individual families would be invaluable in assisting the manager in the distribution of public assistance.  By relying merely on the official sometimes the best information is not obtained.  I suggest it cuts both ways.  Sometimes a local representative may feel that an applicant for home assistance has not made the effort to get employment and that home assistance in his case is scarcely justified.  There may be other people &mdash;they are becoming fewer now I admit&mdash;rather reluctant to apply for home assistance, decent people who might need home assistance.  Here again, a committee to advise the manager would be very useful.  Provision is made in the Act for a committee of that sort, and I am not aware <Col N="645" /> that there are very many of them functioning.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the Managerial Act to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention.  It is in connection with the tenancy of cottages. Under the existing regulations, the manager, the county medical officer and the officials responsible for determining who is to get a cottage, take into account simply the condition of the existing houses&mdash;whether the applicant is living in an insanitary, condemned or overcrowded house or whether his family is suffering from T.B.  As the Minister knows, the considerations fall into three or four categories.  There is one point, however, that should not be lost sight of and that is that in rural areas where there is a demand for good agricultural workers, there is a case for giving houses to such workers.  The point should not be overlooked that such men could occupy a house on a farm where there is constant employment and where the occupier has willingly given the site in the past in the hope that he would get a good, efficient, agricultural worker.  I can assure the Minister that that aspect is being overlooked at the present time and that there is no regard to the applicant's qualifications as an agricultural worker.  County managers are putting people into houses simply because the houses they occupy at the moment are unsuitable.</P>
    <P>We talk about agricultural progress. It is an essential factor in agricultural progress that we should get efficient agricultural workers.  I suggest to the Minister now that he should give that aspect of the problem his consideration.  To my own knowledge, 12 months ago, individual applicants for houses, who were first-class agricultural workers, were turned down&mdash;reluctantly turned down, I must say&mdash;merely because the manager was tied by regulations that do not permit him to take that aspect into consideration. I suggest to the Minister that it ought to be taken into consideration.  If that wider aspect of the qualifications of applicants is to be considered, there ought to be some sort of committee dealing with this matter of the tenancy <Col N="646" /> of cottages.  We ought not to leave it to one bureaucrat to make a decision. I can assure the Minister that the matter of the tenancy of cottages is not being dealt with satisfactorily from that point of view.</P>
    <P>The vital statistics show, and the Minister has referred to the fact, that there are increases in certain diseases. It is unfortunate that in this country over a long period of years certain diseases have been endemic and that we have not made any really successful effort to reduce or control them. Typhus is endemic in this country, and it ought not to be.  The same applies to tuberculosis.  Other problems have arisen during the emergency in regard to disease, and I do not know whether the Minister or his Department have given any consideration to them.  I am sure they have.  A big number of people have left this country to seek work in Great Britain. At the present time they are not permitted to return but I understand the matter is receiving consideration and it may be that facilities may be given to them to come back.  We know that some diseases are rife in Great Britain, notably V.D.  I wonder what precautions are taken here because I believe the incidence of that disease is on the increase in this country. Geographically we are very dangerously placed.  Is the increase so serious or alarming that it might be necessary to quarantine some of the people coming back?  The disease is of such a dangerous character that I suggest the question should be seriously considered.  I do not know what examination is made of individuals returning to this country but we ought to take every possible precaution, no matter how inconvenient it is, to control the spread of infection.  I am aware of the fact that the traffic to and from Great Britain is a great source of danger in this respect and the increase of the incidence of that particular disease in Great Britain is viewed with alarm by a number of people in this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the advance in the incidence of tuberculosis.  It has been suggested in the past&mdash;I, as a <Col N="647" /> matter of fact, suggested it here last year&mdash;that the Minister should seriously consider the establishment of a national chest hospital so that all chest cases would be thoroughly examined.  Of all the diseases that we suffer from in this country I suppose the most alarming is tuberculosis.  The House expressed its dissatisfaction with the progress made in dealing with that disease.  It generally occurs between the ages of 15 and 45, and the death of an individual between these ages is a great national loss. Other diseases generally occur earlier or later in life, and, from the point of view of the family or the nation, the loss of an individual from these diseases is not so great.  An effort should be made to try to reduce the incidence of that disease.  I believe that it masquerades under a variety of names, such as bronchitis, pleurisy and influenza, and it has been suggested by experts that, if you had a national chest hospital, these cases could be sorted out there and people would be prepared to go to such a hospital for treatment because, in going to that hospital, it might be that they would not be told they were tuberculous cases.  Unfortunately, a lot of people look upon tuberculosis as a stigma and are afraid to acknowledge that it is in the family or to have it treated, and that makes the problem all the more difficult.  I suggest to the Minister that, if we are to deal with this matter in a vigorous way, we should insist upon compulsory notification of the disease, whether infectious or non-infectious.  As the law stands, the medical officer is only compelled to notify where he is satisfied that there is danger of infection.  Apart from the infectious cases, we have, of course, tuberculosis in other forms, non-pulmonary forms, and if we are really to know where we are in that respect, every type of case ought to be notified.  I believe, too, that there ought to be compulsory sputum tests. I think medical officers ought to be given compulsory powers to take sputum samples in cases where they have any doubt, and have tests made in all cases where they have any suspicion that tuberculosis is present.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="648" /> It has often struck me as peculiar that, in dealing with bovine tuberculosis, tuberculosis in carcases slaughtered for human consumption, merely the portion of the animal found to be suffering from tuberculosis is condemned, and the rest is certified as fit for human consumption. I think that if the average man in the street realised that he was eating meat from an animal some of whose organs were infected with tuberculosis, he would revolt against the whole thing.  I think we could well afford to condemn the whole animal if there is tuberculosis present in any part, and that the wisdom of only condemning portion of the animal might be seriously questioned.  However, I am not a medical man, and I do not know anything about it.  I suppose it is quite safe to certify as fit for human consumption the remaining portions of the animal, but we might consider having the whole carcase condemned.</P>
    <P>In the matter of dealing with diseases and looking after public health generally, I should like to say that I have had complaints during this year, especially from county medical officers, about the amount of petrol allowed in connection with the incidence of diphtheria in my constituency. I appreciate the difficulties regarding petrol, but I do say in all seriousness to the Minister, so far as proper supervision in that respect is concerned, that we ought not to curtail medical officers, especially county medical officers, when dealing with outbreaks of disease like diphtheria and other notifiable diseases.  It is a very serious handicap so far as county medical officers are concerned.  County medical officers, public health nurses, and other officials have been immobilised to a very great extent; in fact, the service as a whole has been immobilised to a very great extent because of the shortage of petrol.  While fully appreciating the difficulty in which the country is placed at present, I say that, where the Minister is satisfied that there is an outbreak of diphtheria or any other disease of that sort, he should make representations to the Department of Supplies to ensure that sufficient petrol is provided anyway for <Col N="649" /> the medical officer charged with the responsibility of dealing with it.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave us no information about hospital deficits.  I am sure the demand on Hospital Trust Funds to meet hospital deficits is still on the increase. One must appreciate that this is almost inevitably due to the increased cost of living and the increased cost of administration.  But it is a problem which is reacting on the possibility of hospital schemes in the country generally and making very substantial inroads into the funds available. The Minister adverted to that matter in the past, but he has made no attempt to solve the problem.  He has not informed the House whether he has any intention of setting aside any capital sum to meet these deficits, and I suggest that something ought to be done about it.  We cannot overlook the fact that city hospitals provide great facilities for very many counties, and we cannot grudge whatever moneys are provided to meet these deficits. I suppose the fact that these deficits have been met out of Hospital Trust Funds for a number of years has killed the possibility of voluntary financial assistance in the future.</P>
    <P>We have agreed to close down this House within the next two or three weeks, and I do not want to prolong the discussion on what appears to me to be a very important Vote&mdash;the Vote for Local Government.  But I asked the Minister before to give some consideration to the criminal injury code. In our circumstances here, it is ridiculous to have such a code on the Statute Book.  It was introduced by a foreign Government for certain purposes and it was not operated in their own territory.  When a criminal injury occurs, I think it is not fair that a small area should be saddled with a charge to make good that injury, especially where the people are not responsible for the injury.  The time is long overdue when the Act should be removed from the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>In our circumstances here, with the danger of the spread of disease, due to the war, I am sure that the Minister and his Department are exercising a close vigilance and will continue to <Col N="650" /> exercise a close vigilance so far as public health generally is concerned, and that they will be prepared to take all the necessary safeguards against any danger of outbreaks of disease.  It is merely because I appreciate how vital it is, in the interests of the health of our people, that those safeguards should be taken that I have directed the Minister's attention to the fact that medical officers who are charged with the responsibility of looking after the public health are not getting the necessary facilities.  It means, in the long run, only a few extra gallons of petrol.  I have had complaints from one or two individuals that they were unable to overtake their work and they were rather alarmed to find themselves in the position in which, being responsible for looking after an outbreak of diphtheria, they could not possibly overtake their work because they had not got the travelling facilities.  I hope the Minister will look into that matter again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wholeheartedly endorse the appeal made by the Minister for a very greatly expanded production of turf this year.  Everybody realises the gravity of the situation in regard to fuel supplies, both for household use and for the requirements of industry, and the House will join with the Minister in urging everybody who possibly can to avail of the opportunity which an exceptionally dry summer has provided to increase output to the maximum extent.  I hope also that the Minister will see to it that his officials throughout the country will ensure that every available turf bog is put at the disposal of people who wish to engage in turf production.  I hope also that complaints which arose in the past in regard to compensation for turbary owners will be fairly and justly met, because anything in the nature of dissatisfaction or strife as between the owners of these turbary rights and people who want to engage in turf production is most undesirable at present, and, even if it is necessary to err a little on the side of generosity in dealing with the owners of turbary rights, the Minister should see to it that the <Col N="651" /> proper authority errs a little in that direction and avoid the possibility of production being held up by contention.</P>
      <P>In this Estimate, the Minister is seeking £1,250,000, but that represents only a very small proportion of the total amount which comes under his survey.  I believe the amount now reaches the figure of £9,000,000, a huge amount of public money in respect of a very extensive number of services, embracing almost every human activity. The Minister referred to the fact that infectious diseases and the death rate rising from them are on the increase. There is one aspect of this matter which ought to engage nationwide attention, that is, the provision of ample institutional accommodation for all persons suffering from such diseases.  It may not be possible to engage in extensive building operations at present, but it is possible at least to have plans carefully prepared and sites obtained, so that the work of building may be undertaken immediately after the emergency.</P>
      <P>In Wicklow, for example, institutional accommodation is extremely limited.  There is an urgent need for a county hospital as the existing building is not adequate.  It requires many repairs which would scarcely be justifiable in view of the fact that it is an old building and a new institution is urgently required.  Perhaps more urgently required is a fever hospital for the county, a district hospital for Bray, and improvement of the district hospital in Baltinglass which was formerly the fever hospital attached to the local workhouse.  All these works require to be investigated and the Minister should press for plans in regard to such improvements and for the acquisition of sites, so that when the emergency is over these institutions may be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect which strikes practically everyone going through the country is the need for institutions for people suffering from tuberculosis. We know that such accommodation is inadequate at present, and we know that building is seriously curtailed <Col N="652" /> owing to the emergency; but we also know that there is wholesale destruction of large buildings throughout the rural areas which would provide suitable temporary accommodation, at least, for such cases.  I personally know some splendid country mansions which were dismantled during the past year and which would have made exceptionally good sanatoria and other similar institutions.  I do not see why the Minister does not use the wide powers vested in him by the Emergency Powers Act and which he threatens to use in various cases to ensure that suitable buildings are not dismantled but are acquired by the local authorities for the relief of congestion in existing institutions.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact, upon which I congratulate him, that in spite of difficulties some building operations were carried on during the past year.  County Wicklow has a fairly creditable record in this respect, as considerable rural housing has been provided within the county in spite of difficulties, but it must be remembered that the cost of building during the emergency has enormously increased, and, at the same time, there has been no increase in the State grants, with the result that the cost to the ratepayers, and probably to the incoming tenants, will be excessive.  I think that, in order to encourage building, the Minister should see whether it is not possible to recommend an increase in the grants.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the reconditioning of existing houses, which is a very desirable national activity. It is desirable that, as far as possible, any building which can be put into repair with moderate outlay should be put into repair, because the wilful destruction of buildings which still have some expectation of life, so to speak, is public waste.  The policy of the Department in encouraging the reconditioning of tenement buildings in our cities and large towns is in striking contrast to the policy of allowing the destruction of much more suitable buildings in our rural areas.  I want the Minister to consider every aspect of that question.  We all realise that, in the immediate post-war period, we <Col N="653" /> will have to embark on very big building schemes.  I think the figure mentioned by the Minister, 53,000 houses required at the present time, is not an exaggerated one, and it does imply a very large amount of planning, a large amount of acquisition and development of sites, and all the necessary preparation which must be undertaken in order to put such a scheme into operation. I want to direct the Minister's attention to the fact that in the post-war period there will probably be great difficulty in acquiring building material, just as there is at present, inasmuch as practically every nation in Europe will be engaged in vast building schemes, and I think the attention of his Department should be directed to ensuring that our new building schemes will be based mainly on home-produced building materials as far as it is humanly possible to do so.  I think our best engineers and architects should be working on the problem of ensuring that end.</P>
    <P>I want to express my strong disapproval of the manner in which the supplementary old age pensions have been provided.  Having regard to the fact that the value of money has decreased, and to the fact that the maximum pension provided at present is inadequate during the emergency, I think the central authority should have provided the supplementary allowance, instead of, first of all, placing an additional burden on the local areas, and secondly, placing a certain humiliation upon old age pensioners in having to go to the local relieving officer and plead destitution.  I think it ought to be accepted that the 10/- is inadequate, certainly during the present emergency with the reduced purchasing power of money.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in introducing this Estimate, was rather strong and heavy in his denunciation of two county councils.  It is rather significant that the two county councils singled out for petty persecution and attack in the Minister's speech should be the two county councils upon which the Farmers' Party have secured a majority.  The county councils of both Kerry and Roscommon are councils upon which the farmers have secured <Col N="654" /> adequate representation, and they are, therefore, the two county councils upon which the Fianna Fáil Minister for Local Government thinks it necessary to concentrate all his fire.  I have no intention of going into the questions which arose in regard to the Kerry County Council.  I know, and every Deputy knows, that the rates in Kerry were excessively high long before the farmers' county council came into existence, and I think the first effort of the farmers' majority on the Kerry County Council was to seek a reduction in the burden of rates.  When we have regard to the large and ever-increasing burden of direct taxation, and to the manner in which it presses upon our most important industry, I think any attempt made by local representatives in the direction of economy in public expenditure should be encouraged. However, the Minister has seen fit to attack the Kerry County Council and to threaten them with many dire penalties unless they bow to his orders.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Roscommon County Council, the position is much more glaring, because the Minister has taken the tyrannical and in my opinion unjustifiable step of abolishing that democratically elected body, a body which was elected only 12 months ago. The Roscommon County Council has been abolished for seeking to reduce the estimate for main roads.  I will admit that the reduction which they sought was drastic, but we must remember that, at the present time, the burden of traffic on the main roads is very considerably reduced.  We must remember also that the Roscommon County Council had a definite grievance in regard to the manner in which the main roads were being made, inasmuch as there was no provision for horse-traffic.  It is well to remember, too, that the necessary materials for the maintenance and preservation of main roads are not available in any quantity at the present time.  The Roscommon County Council, in their wisdom, decided that it would be better to forgo for a certain period the expenditure on main roads, knowing perfectly well, as they did know, that those main roads were in a very good condition; knowing also that the value <Col N="655" /> which they would obtain from expenditure upon those roads would be very limited having regard to the difficulty in securing supplies.  This was a question upon which there could be a very grave difference of opinion.  It was a question upon which the locally elected representatives of the people were every bit as competent as the Minister to judge as to what was in the best interests of their county.  We have been told by the Minister, particularly on last year's Estimate, that the local councils have very wide powers, especially in regard to the striking of rates and to the preparation of the estimate. Here we have a county council seeking to use those wide powers&mdash; seeking to have the roads maintained in accordance with what they consider to be the best interests of the county.</P>
    <P>Does anyone seriously contend that tar-bound main roads upon which traffic has been greatly reduced owing to the emergency will deteriorate very excessively in the course of one year, even if expenditure is drastically reduced?  The Roscommon County Council certainly did not form that opinion, and, as they represent the people of Roscommon who are the main users of the roads, their opinion was entitled to respectful consideration. But, in this as in other matters, we have the clash between the narrow, warped mind of the city, and the broader mind of rural Ireland.  The broader mind of rural Ireland is capable of seeing problems in their wider aspects, and not through the eyes of hide-bound officials with definite vested interests in seeing that certain sums of money are expended each year in certain definite directions. It is necessary to remark that the Minister was very careful to conceal his murderous intention in regard to the Roscommon County Council until the result of the election had been declared.  He seeks now to bolster up his case for the abolition of this council on the ground that main roads, in a skating-rink condition, were essential to the national defence of this country.  Now, I think that the Minister, on reconsideration, will admit that that is a joke.</P>

      <P>Although I am only a humble farmer, I think I would have a better knowledge of what would be in the interests of the country, from the point of view of the defence of this country, than Field-Marshal MacEntee. The Minister may have aspirations towards becoming the Generalissimo of this country, but I think that in bringing in the question of military defence in connection with his quarrel with the Roscommon County Council, he has been talking through his would-be brass hat.  I agree fully with Deputy Hughes, that it is another attempt to abuse the Emergency Powers Order: that it is an abuse of the powers given to the Minister under the Emergency Powers Act to use those powers to suppress democratically elected local bodies.  It is undemocratic and unjustifiable in every sense and meaning of the word.  The Roscommon County Council was elected by the universal franchise of the people of Roscommon, just in the same way as Deputies in this House were elected by the universal franchise of the people of this State, and if we are to continue democratic institutions, it is essential that democratically elected local bodies should have the widest possible power and freedom that is consistent with the serving of their respective counties.  Of course, the Minister, in bringing in this red herring of military defence, is simply <Col N="657" /> continuing the scare that he sought to raise during the election campaign: that this country is threatened with invasion by the forces of the United Nations.  The Minister knows perfectly well that threat is very remote.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall have an opportunity of discussing that matter when we come to deal with the Transport Bill.  The Minister charged the Roscommon County Council, amongst other things, with ineptitude.  Well, the Minister should be a good judge of ineptitude, seeing that he has made a mess of three Ministries already.  I believe that the Roscommon County Council was making a reasonable effort to carry on the local services, first of all, in accordance with the interests of those who elected them, and, secondly, with the best interests of the local body and of the State, generally, and if the Minister thinks that it is his duty to suppress every local authority upon which there is a majority of farmers, then he is going to be a very busy man, indeed, after the next local elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One other matter that was raised by the Minister in his opening speech was the question of arrears of rates.  He was heavy in his denunciation of those who have fallen into default in the matter of payment of rates.  Everybody knows, and every Deputy in this House realises, the desirability of having all branches or forms of taxation collected regularly and efficiently, but everyone also realises that the people of this nation, and particularly the agricultural community, have passed <Col N="658" /> through an economic blizzard, the like of which has not been experienced in any other nation, and which can only be compared, perhaps, with the depression that set in in some of the depressed mining areas in Britain after the last war, and which continued up to the beginning of the present war. That was a condition which prevailed in the agricultural industry here, and which was aggravated by the antics of the Minister and his colleagues.  Now, having regard to the extraordinary difficulties through which the agricultural community in this country had to pass, it was inevitable that some arrears would accrue during that period, and it does not answer the question to say that a great many people found it possible to meet the rate demands.  In every war there are wounded soldiers, and there are some who escape without injury.  If this city were to be blitzed heavily to-morrow, some people would escape uninjured, some would be killed, and others would be injured, badly or otherwise.</P>
    <P>In the same way, during the economic war in this country, some people suffered excessively and to a greater extent than others.  It is well for the Minister to remember, in this connection, that in dealing with this question of arrears the Land Commission took up an entirely different attitude from that which has been taken up by the Local Government Department.  The Land Commission endeavoured to meet as fairly as possible those who had fallen into arrears in the payment of annuities.  I myself, as I am sure is the case with every Deputy in this House, have been instrumental in making settlements with the Land Commission in the matter of the payment of arrears of annuities.  Where-ever the defaulting tenant was able to come forward, offer a substantial portion of the arrears and make an arrangement to pay yearly instalments on what was due, the Land Commission accepted the offer and gave the farmer the necessary time to carry out that arrangement.  In view of the fact that rates are in the same position as annuities, inasmuch as they are a direct charge on the land, and in view <Col N="659" /> of the fact that some people were experiencing the same difficulty as in the case of annuities, some arrangement should have been made to provide for the liquidation of those debts over a period.  Wherever the defaulting ratepayer came forward and was prepared to make a reasonable offer, as in the case of the Sheridan farm in County Dublin, where an offer of £315 was made on a debt of £700&mdash;in that case a reasonable attempt was made to meet the default&mdash;that offer should have been accepted and accommodation granted.</P>
    <P>I know quite well and I have expressed the view in this House quite frequently that it is not easy for local authorities or the Land Commission to make a settlement of that kind.  They are not equipped for that purpose, but I have expressed the view that the State, having involved the farmers in what was known as the economic war, having dragged them through that depression, should have made special credit facilities available so as to enable the wounded soldiers of that war to recover and to get on their feet. Since no such credit facilities were provided, it was the duty of the local authorities to meet people who were in difficulties and to the best of their ability to give them a chance to get on their feet.  If that had been done in regard to the Sheridan farm in County Dublin, all the unpleasantness which has arisen would have been avoided.  It is easy for the Minister to say here that people who default in the payment of their rates are inflicting grave hardship upon the social services.  The Minister is one of those who advocated that farmers, as far as agricultural land was concerned, should be completely exempt from rates.</P>

There is no use in the Minister trying to get away with the plea that he is defending the interests of the poor in this matter.  The poor are always paraded in matters of this kind, so that politicians and Ministers can attack decent citizens of this country who are struggling to live.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just drawing the analogy that they have succeeded in carrying out the law in the past few years without resort to excessively harsh measures.  I know that in a great number of cases they have met tenants reasonably.  I am suggesting that some consideration should be given in regard to local rates.  I think that the question is one which arises out of the experience of the agricultural industry and out of the deplorable condition through which agriculture has passed, from which it has not yet recovered and for which the country is now suffering excessively because the agricultural industry was not put in a position to supply the nation's needs owing to the harsh and unjust manner in which farmers have been treated in many counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few suggestions I should like to make to the Minister in regard to a few points that arise on this Estimate.  One matter that I believe comes within the scope of his Department is the prevention of the spread of tuberculosis throughout the country.  I think the Minister should co-operate with the efforts that are being made by certain societies, notably the Red Cross Society, to check the spread of this disease.  I would suggest that emergency hospitals should be opened in certain centres.  At the moment there are several mansions throughout the country which could be taken over for that purpose, and young medical men who have been recently qualified might be employed in connection with these emergency hospitals to combat the spread of the disease.  From figures that have been recently published, it would seem that the position is getting <Col N="662" /> more or less out of hand, and I think that prompt steps should be taken to deal with suspicious cases, that is, cases in the early stages of tuberculosis. That is the reason I suggest that a number of mansions should be taken over throughout the country and converted into hospitals to deal with the disease.  I think it would be a very wise step if the Minister would co-operate in that way in the efforts to stamp out the disease.  I should like to emphasise that poor people in the early stages of the disease, that is, those who are merely suspicious cases, should have adequate nourishment provided for them.  There are many people in my own area at present who believe that no provision is made under the Local Government Acts to provide adequate nourishment for such people.  I think that when they are on the waiting list, prior to their going for a time to a tuberculosis hospital, that is the dangerous period because of the fact that they are in their own homes and are in many cases not isolated from other members of the family. It may be that a very insufficient amount of nourishment is available for them.  That is a very dangerous situation, and one of which the Minister should take note.  The Minister's Department should send an order to each local authority that adequate nourishment be made available for those on the waiting list and for suspicious cases, particularly if they are of the poorer classes.  If possible, they should be evacuated from their families, but it is hardly likely that evacuation will be possible.  In my own county there are 70 persons on the waiting list.  It is a very serious matter for those poor people if they have to remain with their families without adequate nourishment.  Many people have come to me in connection with that matter.  Whatever the cost, we should make every effort to save the lives of those people.  During the past 12 months I have been more or less associated with one of those tuberculosis hospitals.  From the medical officer in charge I understand that if the disease is tackled in the early stages it can be cured.  If it has not gone too far, it can be arrested <Col N="663" /> and resistance built up to it.  The local government authorities should make every possible effort to combat the disease.</P>
      <P>Arising out of that matter is the question of rural housing which, I think, comes within the scope of this Estimate.  Adequate housing in rural areas is essential.  I freely admit that the Government have done a great deal in the matter of house-building in recent years but I think that they were somewhat slow before the emergency. In our county, we had a number of plots fenced in and, if the Department had been up and doing, we would have had more houses built.  That would have been an encouragement to rural workers to remain on the land.  It is rural workers&mdash;county council workers and agricultural workers&mdash;and those only, who should get those houses when built.  A number of other persons are getting these rural cottages, due to the fact that their houses are condemned by the medical officer of health.  There should be some other means of providing houses for such people.  All the cottages in rural Ireland should be reserved for the people working there. It would be an encouragement to boys in the rural areas to marry and settle down if they had the &ldquo;cage for the bird&rdquo;.  If the Minister's Department have plans ready for rural housing when the emergency ends, they will have done a very good service.  That would also help to provide employment, which may be required when the war is over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In portions of County Cork&mdash;any County Cork Deputy here will deal with the matter forcibly&mdash;the cottage-holders have only half-acre plots.  That is the case in that portion of County Cork area which is in my constituency. Under an old scheme in County Waterford that was also the case, but, with very few exceptions, an extra half-acre was added in recent years.  In all such schemes an acre plot should be provided with the cottage. Some people will say that the occupants will not till the plots.  I think that they will.  I think that people who are in direct touch with rural production will till their plots. <Col N="664" /> There may be people whose work does not require co-operation with the farmers who will not till their plots, but any worker with an acre plot, whether he be an agricultural worker or a county council worker, will till his plot, because he will get the horses and the facilities to enable him to do so, due to the co-operation between himself and the other members of the rural community.  I think that it is very desirable to encourage and extend that co-operation.</P>
    <P>As regards turf production, nobody can grumble at present.  The weather has tended to encourage turf production this year.  We require a very large output in first-class condition, so that consumers of fuel will have no cause for complaint.  I should like to refer to and to stress the necessity for shelters.  In many cases no shelters are required this year, but it has been urged upon me from some of the turf areas that proper shelters should be made available, with cooking equipment, so that, if it is necessary to develop turf production after the war, the necessary steps will have been taken.  After the war it may be necessary to carry on turf production for a long period, and if we make the necessary provision for the protection of the workers on the mountainside or in the bogs now, there will be little reason to grumble.  I ask the Minister to direct the local councils to take the steps necessary for the erection of such shelters.</P>
    <P>As regards the main roads, I suggest that an Order be issued to all county councils that a reasonable margin be left on either side of the tarred roads for horse traffic.  I do not mean that that margin should not be tarred or treated in the same way as the rest of the road.  What I suggest is that rough stone be rolled in on either side of the road in such a way that it would not be damaging to rubber tyres, and would, at the same time, provide a safety margin for horse traffic.  At present the traffic on the roads is almost all horse traffic, and, in many areas, requests have come to county councillors that such a margin as I suggest should be provided.  I suggest that the Minister make an Order directed to all county councils <Col N="665" /> that such a margin be provided in order to accommodate those who have to use horses on the road.  I hope the Minister will attend to these matters immediately, so that those who have occasion to complain will be satisfied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to congratulate the Minister on the statement he made to the House.  It seems to me, from that statement, that considerable progress has been made in the various branches of the Department's activities. I consider that these advances show that badly needed improvements are being made rapidly.  As far as I am aware no money has been allocated in Dublin for many years for the building of houses that could be purchased by the tenants.  I consider that this is a mistake.  The class of people catered for in the houses I am referring to would be tradesmen and clerks, and they have not been regarded as eligible as tenants for the houses that have been built in recent years.  They are not in a position to buy houses or to rent them in the ordinary way.  That class forms an important section of the community, and I consider it to be deplorable that provision has not been made by local authorities for housing them.  When the Marino scheme was initiated 16 or 17 years ago we were told that it would be a slum in a few years, but a visit to that district to-day shows it to be a model one, with neatly-kept and well-cared houses, showing that the tenants appreciate their home and are living up to their responsibilities as tenant purchasers. A visit to Donnycarney or Donnelly's Orchard shows the same results.  The ideal of owner-occupier is one that we should strive to cultivate, as it encourages industrious habits and civic responsibility.  Further, except for the initial grant that was given, the total cost of building such houses is paid by the purchasers and no further burden falls on the community.  When building commences on a large scale in the post-war period, I urge the Minister to see that an equitable portion of the money provided is allocated towards the building of houses for tenant purchasers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider that an injustice has been done to owner-occupiers in connection <Col N="666" /> with the remission of rates on their dwellings.  An Act passed in 1928 gave a remission of 10 per cent. in rates to owner-occupiers of small houses with a valuation up to £6. Under the 1930 Act the valuation was raised to £8.  Owner-occupiers were excluded from the benefits of that Act. An Act in existence for many years gave a remission of 20 per cent. of the rates, subject to approval of conditions laid down by the sanitary authorities, and that concession was available to owner-occupiers.  Under the 1930 Act that concession was withdrawn in the case of owner-occupiers and was confined to the landlords of small dwellings.  As a result, many small owner-occupiers suffered, and the position to-day is that landlords of small dwellings have a choice of concessions, while owner-occupiers have no such benefit.  That is a wrong state of affairs.  I believe that owner-occupiers should be encouraged, and I would go further and advocate that they should be made eligible for concessions in the remission of rates, and that the valuation limit should be raised in their cases.</P>
    <P>I want to protest against the policy of transferring civil servants to higher posts in local government administration. With the machinery now available, it seems to me that it should be possible to get capable men to fill such posts from the officers of any local authorities.  I have not heard of local officials being transferred to positions in the Civil Service.  Unless the two services are going to be put on the same basis, what has been happening is an injustice to local officials and, undoubtedly, will have the effect of withholding from local services the proper type of young men.  I trust the Minister will give due consideration to the points I have referred to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one comparatively small point that I intend to raise on this Vote.  It is small in the sense that it affects only three people, but it is very important from their point of view.  It arises owing to the Minister's action following an inquiry that was held last year into the administration of Killarney Mental Hospital. Certain action was taken against some <Col N="667" /> of the officials who were charged, and three persons against whom no charge had been made prior to the inquiry were, because of their answering, forced to retire some years before the time for doing so.  I felt that the Minister's decision in connection with the business, in so far as it affected these three people, was lop-sided.  The Minister was rightly and reasonably lenient in the manner in which he dealt with the persons who were charged with certain breaches of discipline or lax administration and so on.  Speaking privately to the Minister in connection with the case I was a strong advocate of leniency, but the fact is that having dealt with these persons as he did, and in a right manner, I believe he adopted much too rigid and much too severe an attitude in dealing with the three persons I am referring to.  The charge against them was that they hedged in their answering at the inquiry.  I suppose that is very reprehensible, but lack of candour in answering at public inquiries is not confined to the poor and lowly.  It is not confined to persons in the position of attendants or workers in the kitchen in mental hospitals.  One of these persons was working in the kitchen and the other was a maid or an attendant.  Two women and one man were concerned.  These were uneducated people and they were cross-examined very severely.  I do not think their attitude was one which should have been taken so seriously having regard to their position as they did not want to give their pals or co-workers away.  They did not want to say anything which would make matters worse for other persons even for the medical officers concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At any rate, that was their offence. Now what was their punishment?  They were immediately forced to resign. That meant that they lost the difference between the salary they would be earning during that period and the reduced pension to which they were entitled during the years which they might have continued to serve. That was a serious loss.  I do not know exactly what pension a local officer gets, whether or not it is on the same <Col N="668" /> basis as that of a teacher's pension which, at the maximum rate, is 40/80ths of his salary.  It may be that the maximum pension in the case of local officials is two-thirds of his salary.  If we assume that it is, then one of these persons would be losing the difference between that two-thirds and full salary for some years to come. In the case of the other two, they lose considerably more than that because they are not entitled to full pension. They have been forced to retire before having served sufficient years to entitle them to full pension, so that for the remainder of their lives they will continue to be penalised by the loss of the difference between the pension they are now getting and the pension they would be entitled to get if they had been allowed to continue to serve their full period.  I think that is extremely harsh and that the Minister might review these cases.</P>
    <P>As I have said, lack of candour at this type of inquiry is, I am afraid, rather common, and we are not going to cure it in a day.  That trait in our character probably has its roots in the past: the trait of not wishing to add anything to the troubles of our friends, especially when they are up against the authorities, for the time being the Government, or whatever authority may be inquiring into their conduct in their particular jobs.  As I have said, that probably has its roots in the past. I think it is not an unlovable trait in our character that we should take very considerable risks ourselves rather than betray a fellow worker. Taking the rigid view, however, I think it is reprehensible, but, taking the ordinary human view, it is not so reprehensible as one might at first imagine.</P>
    <P>There are only three persons concerned in this.  One of them, because of his service, is entitled to receive full pension, and I do not suppose very much can be done about him.  I do not think that I could advocate that he should be restored to his job, but I would ask the Minister, in the case of the other two, that he would add sufficient to their years of service to entitle them to full pension.  God knows they will suffer enough during the next four or five years, when they <Col N="669" /> might have been in the service, by the loss they will sustain during that period, without making them suffer for the remainder of their lives the difference between the full pension they would be entitled to, and the smaller pension that they are now receiving. I think there is a strong case why the Minister should review these cases.  I would ask him not to take the rigid view that he has taken with regard to these persons, and to look into the matter again.  I suggest to him that he should put it up to the county manager to make a recommendation to him that these persons would be entitled to the full pension that they would have received if they had given full service.</P>

      <P>I rise for the purpose of pressing forward a subject which has been threshed out in this House several times, but so far without satisfaction to me.  I refer to the treatment of tuberculous patients in the City of Dublin, or, perhaps, I should say to the failure to give proper treatment to them.  I will quote instances of complaints that reached me this morning regarding the failure of mothers to get sanatorium treatment for their daughters who are urgently in need of it.</P>
      <P>One day last week a number of girls working in an office appealed to me to try to get a bed in one of our sanatoria for a comrade of theirs.  I rang up the authorities and made the appeal, stating that this was an effort by her comrades to try to save this girl's life, and that if she got treatment in time her life would be saved. I gave the message by 'phone, and the official reply I got from the sanatorium authorities was this: &ldquo;Alderman Byrne, we are sorry we have no beds.&rdquo; I answered: &ldquo;Can you tell me when you will have a bed?&rdquo;  The reply was: &ldquo;No; we do not know.  There are 36 other cases urgently in need of treatment on the waiting list in front of this girl.&rdquo;  It is very hard to go on when you see the Parliamentary Secretary laughing&mdash;the Minister who is in charge of this treatment.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Dr. Harbison said it was disheartening to have to place early cases on a long waiting list.  At Peamount Sanatorium, Mr. McCarron, secretary of one of the committees, said there was such a large waiting list that if extra accommodation was not made available there was little hope that some patients could ever be admitted to a sanatorium.  What did that mean but that the unfortunate people will have passed to their eternal rest before treatment would be available for them in a country that owes them so much and in which millions of pounds have been raised for sanatorium and hospital treatment?  Yet, I am safe in saying that there are 500 people going around the streets of the City of Dublin appealing for sanatoria treatment and for beds in the institutions, and that they are being denied that chance to save their lives.  I know that the Minister and his Department have done excellent work up to a certain point.  My case is that they have not gone far enough.  I and other people suggested that some of <Col N="671" /> the county mansions round this city be taken over and converted into temporary institutions for those people who are clamouring for treatment.  In that way, they would get a chance while they are waiting for proper sanatorium treatment.  That would mean a heartening message to their parents, who would know that their children were getting a chance.</P>
      <P>I was told last week that, on one corporation list in the City of Dublin, there were 36 girls in front of a patient urgently needing treatment.  I believe that in the men's section there are upwards of 100 waiting for treatment and they cannot get it.  I had a letter this morning from the corporation&mdash;I am sure the Lord Mayor has seen several like this.  It is dated 19th June and is in connection with another matter.  It says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If Mrs. McCarthy were the only tuberculosis case, we could, of course, have housed her at once; but, unfortunately, there are at least 200 cases on our list, most of which were certified prior to Mrs. McCarthy, and a great number have bigger families. I can only inform her that her case would not be reached for some time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then the Minister gets disturbed and cross with me, when I try forcibly to draw his attention to the lack of housing and treatment for our tuberculosis cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his statement, the Minister went on to say that the Department had devised a new scheme, in which patients could get, in their own homes, certain concessions whilst waiting to get sanatorium treatment.  I had some little thing to do with forcing that scheme on his Department.  I appealed as a member of this House that those people would get some consideration whilst waiting for sanatorium treatment. They were promised it and the scheme is in force to give them butter, eggs, milk, clothing, bedding and blankets.  However, I would ask the Minister to ring up the corporation now and ask the officials how many blankets and how many beds have been given out, how many children have <Col N="672" /> been separated where there are ten in one room and put on a separate bed given by his Department.  Up to a week ago, there were none at all.  It may not be the Minister's Department that is responsible, but I want the Minister to spur on the other authorities, if it is not his fault.  All I want is to see that these patients get a chance and are not left merely with a printed document, without any effect being given to the recommendations of the Government or the corporation.</P>
    <P>Not more than ten minutes ago, I opened a letter dated 19th June from a Dublin cottage dweller.  The administration of relief in the City of Dublin is subject to that pettifogging attitude of giving small doles of half-crowns or a 4/- order to poor people who are temporarily embarrassed and, in some cases, hungry. This woman, writing yesterday a letter which I opened about five minutes ago, says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I beg of you to ask them to give me a month to pay the rent.  I have only been getting a food voucher from the relief.  I am only after being down there now and I will not get anything until Thursday.  I do not suppose you will believe me, sir, but I have not got a bit to eat in the house for the children at present.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is not a stunt: I did not fake that letter.  I only opened it ten minutes ago, but it is one of many that Dublin representatives are getting every day in the week.  I would implore the Minister to spur on the other authorities and not look for excuses for their not attending to these matters.  I would give the Minister the credit of believing that he and his Department are anxious to do the proper thing.  The benefit of the doubt, if there is one, should be given to the poor people, so that we would not have a woman in the City of Dublin writing to me to say she has not got a bit to eat in the house for the children.  Her husband is in England and she encloses his letter&mdash;there is a British stamp on it&mdash;which says that he is unemployed and is sick, that he has not had a smoke for the past three <Col N="673" /> or four days and could not send her 1/- towards paying the rent.  The Lord Mayor and myself and other members of the corporation will have to go to-day to implore them not to evict her but to give her time, and to get her some relief.  There should be some method of giving her a substantial weekly sum for herself and her children, so that she may not be afraid of the bailiff in Dublin in these days.</P>
    <P>I have said it is not the Minister's fault, but it is the Minister's Department which can introduce methods to deal adequately with the poor people surrounding us in the City of Dublin, not alone in the tenements but in the good cottage property and good houses. It is not their fault that they become unemployed.  I would ask that a complete change take place in the administration of relief, so that when a man becomes idle, if he is not entitled to unemployment assistance, he will automatically, for himself and his children, go on some form of relief.  In that connection, I think it is not altogether proper that the Dublin ratepayers should have to bear that burden. There should be some system, in connection with the Minister's Department and the local authority, to see that they get enough to eat, in order to prevent them from breaking down and becoming possible patients for the sanatorium.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago, the Minister's attention was drawn to the 800 children before the Dublin School Attendance Committee for non-attendance at school, whose mothers in most cases said they either had not boots or clothing to send the children to school.  Now these children do not go to school, but are taken up and sent to an industrial school, where they are provided with boots, clothes, food and shelter.  If the unfortunate mother had had a voucher to get boots for them, and a little coat, the children would have the parent now to look after them, and give them home comforts, instead of overloading our industrial schools.  Our Dublin children are sent down to Waterford and Cork, where their parents cannot see them for some time.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to consider <Col N="674" /> some scheme, whereby barefooted children could be provided with boots and clothing in necessitous cases.  I have reason to think and to hope that the Minister will go much further than that, and that these barefooted children who are ill-clad, and in some cases ill-nourished, because of the unemployment of their parents or because of inadequate relief, will receive some consideration.  I believe the Minister will go further and see that these children will get boots and clothes.</P>
    <P>It is only once in the year I get an opportunity of raising these points, when the Local Government Estimate is under consideration.  If one does not use the method of Parliamentary Question, one is practically tongue-tied. Sometimes the Question Paper brings good results.  I frequently use it, but perhaps not altogether with the results that I would like.  Some time ago the Infant Aid Society, under what is called the National Free Milk Scheme, was given a grant. Some ten years ago the Government made a grant of £30,000 to the Infant Aid Society to purchase tuberculin-tested milk for necessitous children. That society has 400 voluntary visitors, who go out and furnish marvellous reports.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is under some misapprehension.  The Government makes no grant to the Infant Aid Society.  The Government makes a grant to the Dublin Corporation, which has enlisted the services of the society in administering that grant; but that is a private matter between the corporation and the society&mdash;we do not come into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a good thing the Minister is paying attention to what I am saying.  I am grateful for his interjection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely correcting the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government makes a grant of £30,000 to the corporation. The corporation administers that £30,000 for the Government.  Since that grant was made ten years ago milk went up in price at least five <Col N="675" /> times. How do the Infant Aid Society or the Dublin Corporation proceed to deal with the situation?  An increased grant would not be given to enable the society to continue to give out the 2,665,972 pint bottles of milk&mdash;that is the number mentioned in the 1939-40 report.  There were 2,665,972 pint bottles of milk distributed for the benefit of necessitous children under five years of age whose parents were unable, from their own resources, to provide them with milk.  What is the position?  We cannot get an increase in that grant and the milk has gone up five to seven times in price.  How do they meet the increased cost?  They meet it by reducing the number of bottles of milk annually by 1,000. There were 1,000 bottles less last year and, if the milk goes up again in price, it will mean another 1,000 bottles taken away from the poor children.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to give this matter his sympathetic consideration. The amount that was granted ten years ago is not at all adequate in view of the higher costs at the present time, and the children of the poor are suffering as a result.  I have received numerous complaints in this connection. Women write to tell me that the bottles of milk are being taken from their delicate children.  Deputies who are members of local authorities have experience of the same type of complaint, I have no doubt.  I earnestly appeal to the Minister to see that the good work that has been done for so many years by the Infant Aid Society and its 400 voluntary visitors will be continued.  When they submit recommendations on behalf of the delicate babies urgently needing milk, the least we may do is to provide that milk.  The number of visits paid in the year by the voluntary visitors connected with the society is in the neighbourhood of 52,822.  These people are doing splendid work and they should be encouraged in every way.</P>
      <P>The Public Health Department, writing to one of our committees last month, stated:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;At your meeting on the 8th February last, on consideration of <Col N="676" /> a report indicating that the annual grant of £30,000 made to the corporation under the National Free Milk Scheme for the provision of milk for necessitous children in the city would be over-expended by the end of the financial year, you requested the City Manager to apply for an increase in the amount of the grant, failing which, the excess expenditure, you directed, should be met from corporation funds.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The excess expenditure in question to the 31st March, 1944, amounted to £494 7s. 4d.  The matter was taken up with the Department of Local Government and Public Health and a grant requested for that amount.  A reply has now been received from the Department stating that a further allocation from the Government grant cannot be made to meet the surplus expenditure in question.  The full grant voted, the Department's communication adds, is allocated among the various sanitary authorities at the commencement of each financial year.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The city accountant has been instructed accordingly to issue a cheque for the excess expenditure to the Infant Aid Society.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a further communication which runs:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With reference to your verbal inquiry regarding the cost to this Department of milk purchased for the requirements of the Infant Aid Society, the following are the particulars which, I understand, you require, viz.:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Average price per pint of milk during six months commencing 1st April, 1939&mdash;2.66d.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Average price per pint of milk during six months commencing 1st April, 1944&mdash;3.50d.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a substantial increase and the children are being deprived of the milk.  I am sure that various members of this House are dealing with similar cases every day.</P>
    <P>I should like now to deal with the treatment of the blind generally.  The blind are not getting fair treatment <Col N="677" /> in this city.  The means test as applied to the blind is doing great damage to those poor people and to their families.  They are not being given a chance.  I should like the Minister to ignore all allowances given under blind welfare schemes when assessing the income of the blind for old age pension purposes. There is a blind welfare scheme in Dublin and whatever they give it is considered in the means test in applications for old age pensions.  A trade union such as the typographical society gives 15/- or 16/- of a grant to retired members and that prevents the members getting an old age pension. That type of means test ought to go.  Any money given by voluntary societies should not be taken into consideration. The State should not benefit by these voluntary contributions from trade unions and other organisations towards which the people have paid through the years.</P>
    <P>I earnestly hope the Minister will not think I have brought these matters forward in any aggressive way.  Sometimes he deals with me in an aggressive fashion and I often wonder why.  Is it because I bring these things so forcibly to his notice? I do not care what happens in this House.  Anyone may jeer or sneer at me and insult me, but I will not be deterred from pressing my case.  I can bear all these sneers.  The Parliamentary Secretary may continue to laugh.  Deputy Ward has been in the habit of laughing at me any time I ask question, no matter what they are about.  It is a failing of his.  It will never deter me from continuing my efforts on behalf of the poor If an unfortunate woman in a Dublin tenement or a needy person in any part of Ireland has a grievance, and if I can have that grievance remedied by exposing it in the Dáil, I shall at all times be glad to do so.  I will do my duty in exposing those matters and no insults will stop me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's Estimate as a rule provides a very useful and interesting field for discussion. On this occasion one is very sorely tempted to deal with the matter of the <Col N="678" /> County Management Act but I feel that that subject may best be approached in the way we are at the present time by having a motion on the Order Paper for special discussion at a later date.  I presume that it will not be reached for some time.  We have quite a lot of interesting things to say in regard to that particular Act but I think it is better to deal with it as a special subject.</P>
      <P>There are few other points, so far as the Minister's Estimate is concerned, that I wish to advert to.  It must be borne in mind that we had a full-dress debate and discussion on the Estimate as a whole and on the Appropriation Bill last November and perhaps it would be correct to say that very little has occurred in the interval to change the position.  But I do want to refer again to the question of housing. The housing position in the City of Dublin remains practically the same as it was when we were discussing the matter last November.  We are still in the unfortunate position of requiring some 15,000 houses immediately to meet the present needs of our people here. I am glad to say that we are, perhaps, the only municipal body that I know of, either here or across the water, which is continuing its housing programme. Thanks to the foresight of the corporation and may I say in this respect&mdash;and I am happy to be able to say it&mdash;thanks to the co-operation of that section of the Local Government Department which deals with housing, we are handling that problem as well as can be expected, having regard to very difficult circumstances indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have, as the Minister will know, recently embarked on a scheme of reconditioning some of our old Georgian houses and that scheme has met with success and has been very rightly applauded by people who are interested in that new phase of the regeneration of old houses here.  The scheme is necessarily slow at the moment.  We can only envisage something in the nature of 170 dwellings but we have the satisfaction at least, concurrently with our own building programme, of ensuring that people in the immediate vicinity, say, of Cathal Brugha Street <Col N="679" /> and Gardiner Street will have accommodation right alongside where they have been living for years.  The point I want to make in connection with this&mdash;I have made it before&mdash;is that I would like the officials of the Department to indicate as early as possible to the corporation the lines on which they propose to finance this particular scheme.  The corporation, I understand, have submitted details of what they require so far as grants are concerned.  We submit that grants which have come to us in the ordinary course for slum clearance should also flow to us so far as this reconditioning scheme is concerned.  At the moment we are financing the scheme out of loan in anticipation that the Department will come to an early decision but I should like the Minister when he is replying to this debate to indicate very definitely that it is the intention of his Department to give to the corporation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to interrupt Deputy O'Sullivan but he seems to be drawing a distinction between the officers of the Department and the Minister.  The officers are my officers. The Department is my Department. They give effect to my policy and not their own and I should like the Deputy to bear that in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked the Minister would he indicate to the House, because it would particularly interest the members of the Dublin Corporation who are members of the House, if he is prepared to give these grants.  If he does not like to have his officers coupled with him&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I do not like to interrupt but, through the Chair, I should like to remind the Deputy that it is not usual to refer to the officers of the Department in the House in any connection.  They are anonymous. They are my advisers and they give effect to my policy.  It is the Minister, and only the Minister, that can be criticised or commended, if commendation is deserved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no point, <i>so far as</i> I am concerned, in continuing <Col N="680" /> a discussion of that character.  All I am concerned with is that the Minister should indicate, on the conclusion of the debate, that he is prepared, so far as his Department is concerned, to give the grants which the corporation believe they should get on a reconditioning scheme of this character and that the scheme should not be unduly prolonged without any intimation as to how its ultimate finance is to be met so far as the Local Government Department is concerned.</P>
      <P>May I point out that there is another difficulty so far as the corporation is concerned at the present time and that is in connection with the continuation of its own building programme.  I have indicated that we were in the fortunate position of at least continuing that programme in part, so far as our cottage scheme is concerned, but difficulties are arising at the present time, particularly so far as the transport of timber is concerned.  A number of the contractors here very wisely and very fortunately made provision in the early stages to ensure that as far as possible materials would be available, but difficulties are now arising for obvious reasons where priorities are in operation so far as transport is concerned and it is likely that in the very near future the corporation's contractors will be faced with the serious difficulty of a shortage of timber for the making of doors and wooden sashes, and so on, in connection with their scheme.  I should like the Minister to ensure that we may have the necessary priority for timber so that our valuable schemes of housing will not be impeded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the housing grants, I have referred before and my colleague has referred on more occasions than I would like to recall, to the inequity, shall I say, of the form the grants take under the 1932 Act.  It is worth repeating and I think I will have to keep repeating it until we get to a stage where the Minister will indicate to us that we will be met in a fair way.  I have on a number of occasions pointed out that the ceiling for flats and cottages is entirely too low having regard to building costs. On the last occasion when the Minister <Col N="681" /> was dealing with this question he indicated that we were dealing with a purely temporary position and that, of course, building would probably subside to its normal state at a later stage but I think anybody who knows anything about the building industry will agree with me that it is obvious that building costs will remain stable, comparatively stable in any case, for a very considerable time to come and that it is obvious that the maximum of £500 for a flat qualifying for a grant under the 1932 Act and £450 for a cottage bears no relation to the actual costs obtaining to-day and certainly will not for as many years as we can possibly envisage at the present time. Therefore, in my opinion, the Dublin Corporation is carrying at the moment an undue burden and has to pass that burden on to its ratepayers because we have to meet the deficit so far as our estimates are concerned.  In point of fact, the contribution from the ratepayers of Dublin since the 1932 Act has been in excess of the national grant so far as housing is concerned and that can be borne out by reference to our estimates.  I suggest, therefore, that the Minister should now seriously consider the question of raising the ceiling so far as these two categories are concerned or, may I say, the particular one of urgency is that for cottages, because we are still pursuing the cottage type of building.  Flats at the moment, for the reason that reinforcements have to be taken into consideration, are practically out of the question.</P>
    <P>On the question of tuberculosis, referred to by Deputy Alderman Byrne, I think the Minister indicated on the last occasion that he was pleased with the valuable and helpful discussion that took place in November in connection with this whole subject.  I am glad, as one individual closely in touch with the situation, to find that public opinion and the Minister's own Department have been roused to a sense of the seriousness of this position.</P>
    <P>I referred on the last occasion to what I believed to be a certain remissness on the part of the Minister's Department so far as making the <Col N="682" /> necessary provision in Dublin for people suffering from tuberculosis was concerned, and I instanced the case of the proposed sanatorium at Ballyowen. So far as I can gather, this sanatorium might very well have been built when the times were reasonably normal and at a cost much lower than when it will be started.  The position as regards Ballyowen, as I indicated to the House on the last occasion, is that this scheme was submitted to a board of assessors for an architectural design for the building.  This design will not be available, if my information is correct, until June, 1945, so that the serious position indicated last November still obtains so far as the treatment of tuberculosis in the city is concerned.  What we are up against in Dublin so far as tuberculosis is concerned will be appreciated when I tell you the only institutions available for treatment in this city are Crooksling, Rialto, and the Pigeon House for advanced cases.  These institutions provide only roughly between 400 and 500 beds for a floating tuberculous population of about 5,000 in this city. Apart from these institutions, there is a clamant demand for treatment in Newcastle and Peamount.</P>
    <P>For Peamount, I understand, there is a waiting list at present of 270.  To get into Newcastle in the ordinary way means that a patient has to wait three or four months.  That is understandable when you think of the accommodation available in Peamount and Newcastle and remember that these institutions serve the whole country.  Persons from all over the country come to Newcastle and Peamount. Consequently, we are in the unfortunate position of not being able to provide treatment for all the people suffering from tuberculosis in Dublin at present.  In that respect, I would suggest to the Minister in all seriousness that, since the main thing so far as dealing with tuberculosis is concerned is to ensure that the sufferer will have suitable food, rest and medical attention, it should be possible at this stage to provide accommodation of a temporary character which need not be of the grandiose type suggested for Ballyowen in those architectural <Col N="683" /> designs to which I have referred.  The Minister should approach this question energetically and systematically so as to hold out some hope to those people in this city who are awaiting treatment and unable to get it.</P>
    <P>I want to pay a tribute to the Minister and those associated with him for the advance made by the introduction of the scheme for tubercular persons discharged from sanatoria and those who are attending dispensaries.  That scheme is working in a reasonably satisfactory manner in any case.  There are roughly about 850 persons availing of the scheme, under which they are supplied with 7 eggs per week, ½ pint of milk daily, and ½ lb. of butter per week.  It was intended under the scheme to provide boots and clothing and I think it is only due to the Department to say that arrangements are being made, I understand, to implement the section of the scheme as far as providing boots and clothing to those individuals who need them is concerned.  It is only fair to the Department to mention that in order to show that recently, in any case, they have realised how serious the position is so far as Dublin is concerned.  I would impress on the Minister the necessity for an immediate increase of accommodation because of the number of people who are awaiting treatment and cannot get it.</P>
    <P>As to old age pensions, I have raised frequently here, and so have other Deputies, the question of the means test.  I think the Minister will have to agree that its operation is undoubtedly imposing hardship on a very large number of people, not alone in the city but throughout the country.  I put it to the Minister that the time has arrived when this means test, if not abolished altogether, should be at least modified. There is one aspect of it to which I want to draw particular attention.  I feel confident that there is a growing opinion, even on the Ministerial Benches, that something should be done in this respect, judging from remarks made by the Minister for Finance recently, and by the Minister for Industry and Commerce when <Col N="684" /> closing his speech on the Second Reading of the Transport Bill.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce referred to railway employees who retire at 65 and get an <i>ex gratia</i> pension of 16/- per week and, when they reach the age of 70, the pension is reduced to 6/-, because, so far as the individual is concerned, he would get no benefit if the railway company continued to pay the full pension; it is only the National Exchequer that would benefit in the long run.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce indicated that perhaps the Minister for Local Government might so adapt the provisions of the Old Age Pensions Act as to secure, where private employers or industrial firms were disposed to give small pensions to their employees, that these pensions would continue beyond the age of 70 without any interference so far as the operation of the means test for old age pensions is concerned.  There are a number of employers throughout the country who are prepared, I am sure, to continue that payment if they are satisfied that the full benefit of their payments and of the old age pension will flow to the recipient.  I suggest that at least a modification along these lines is not alone desirable but, so far as the Minister is concerned, is quite feasible and should be brought in as early as possible.</P>
    <P>I also referred on the last occasion to the abolition of the Dublin Board of Assistance in April, 1942, and the Minister, when replying, indicated that, until such time as the Commissioners had decided on a scheme of reorganisation so far as the institution is concerned, he felt that their services were still required.  Recently I noticed that a report along these lines was issued by the Commissioners. The Minister indicated that his main concern was the administration of public assistance.  I venture to point out that the Commissioners have had two years to examine that position thoroughly and I suggest that the time has arrived to associate public representatives once again with that important institution.</P>
    <P>In connection with the board of assistance, reference has been made <Col N="685" /> to the question of the supply of boots to necessitous children, and the Minister indicated on a previous occasion, in reply to a question, that the board of assistance authorities had power to implement a scheme of that character. The Minister will agree, I think, that, so far as boots for children are concerned, they were never in a position to do so.  The only assistance under that particular heading that the board were giving at any time was boots made on their own premises. The only other boots supplied were surgical boots.  I suggest that it is desirable that the Minister should make the necessary provision, at least for the coming winter, to ensure that the undertaking which he gave on a previous occasion in reply to a question will be implemented so far as the board of assistance is concerned and put them in a position to give the boots to necessitous children, on the same lines as those on which he is now making provision for extra food to the extent of something around £50,000, over and above what the commissioners demand of the corporation.  Each year for the past couple of years, the Minister has made provision for roughly £48,000 for extra food, so far as the board of assistance is concerned, and I suggest that it is necessary for him to make the requisite provision to ensure that a scheme of this character will be made available, particularly for children.  Deputy Byrne's figures were not quite correct.  The figure given by the school attendance officers is between 8,000 and 11,000 children who are unable to attend school because of lack of clothing and boots.</P>
    <P>I mentioned previously the question of the capitation grant for mental hospitals and I return to it.  Under an old British Act, capitation for mental hospitals is allowed to the extent of something like 4/- per head. This amount was fixed at a time when conditions were not anything like what they are to-day and I suggest that in present circumstances it is absurd and it is not fair to the contributing body, in this case, the Dublin Corporation. It places an undue burden on that authority and it should be made more <Col N="686" /> appropriate to the general rise in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>Relief schemes have been a very important item of the Dublin Corporation's work for a number of years. The corporation went to the extent of providing a special department to deal with their administration, and, on an average, we have had about 1,000 men employed for a considerable period over the whole year.  The conditions are not what we would desire because the work is on a four-day rotational basis.  I do not approve of that basis and believe that the men should get their full week's work; but relief schemes at present have fallen to a low ebb&mdash; indeed the lowest in any year I know of.  At the moment, we have only approximately 300 men engaged on these schemes in the city, notwithstanding the fact that suitable schemes for the current year have been sent forward by the corporation involving roughly £100,000.  If, in that current list supplied to the Minister, there are schemes which do not meet with his approval, he has, in addition, a number of schemes previously supplied by the corporation from which he could make useful selections so as to ensure that the number of men employed will be brought up at least to the number employed for some years past.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that there are difficulties at present in relation to cement.  That is perfectly true, and I am prepared to recognise that difficulty, but it is probably only a temporary difficulty and there are included in the list such schemes as the cleaning of the Camac and Tolka rivers in respect of which cement is not necessary at all or at least not necessary on a heavy scale, and where the main requirement is purely unskilled labour.  The Minister might see to it that these schemes which have been submitted will be sanctioned at the earliest possible date to ensure the maximum number of men being put to work.</P>

      <P>It would be unreasonable indeed to think that the most vigilant and most energetic Minister, and everybody will agree that the present Minister typifies these attributes in no ordinary degree, could possibly attend to all the intricacies of local requirements and administration in relation to the various boards and councils dealing with diverse populations and areas.  Almost all aspects of local government have been put forward and criticised in various ways to-day, and some Deputies would describe the Minister as a kind of robot which descends suddenly on a council and exterminates its powers and capabilities.  I am sure this is not so, that the Minister gives full consideration to all the matters which he thinks are not being adequately dealt with, and, having made up his mind, gives a reasonable time to the responsible council or other public body to adjust the matters which he thinks need attention.</P>
      <P>One would think that in a discussion in a deliberative Assembly like this, the same principles would guide the speakers in their criticism of the Department. Some speakers, having said that too much power is concentrated in the Minister, criticise him before the end of their discourse for not using the powers he has more widely.  No doubt many aspects of the discussion have been enlightening and will get due consideration by the Minister.  No doubt many helpful suggestions have been made, but, at the same time, we should not, I think, take up the time of the House in dealing with matters which really are functions of local bodies.  The Minister can only indicate general principles and then, in cooperation with his Department, these principles can be given effect to in the proper way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to rents, I know that their adjustment is mainly a matter for local corporations and councils but there is one aspect which, I <Col N="688" /> think, comes within the Minister's sphere, that is, the reason these unreasonable rents are being charged is in great measure the short-term loans which are being procured and the high interest paid on them by local bodies.  If there is any stability at all in local government and if the houses being built are substantial enough, surely these loans could be spread over a greater number of years so that the rents will not fall so heavily on the present generation as they fall to-day.  Many people have been moved from the slum areas into the suburbs of towns and cities and are being charged rents which I know they cannot pay.  Certain statistics have been gathered about these slum clearances and it has been proved; I think, beyond all question, by medical officers that even those who have been moved to healthy surroundings have not been improved in their general health because the rents are so high and because transport difficulties have arisen, that they are not able to provide a sufficiency of nourishment to sustain themselves and their families at the previous standard.  Consequently, the general health of these people has not, in all cases, at any rate, improved as a result of their removal from the slum areas.  This is a matter which I think the Minister should take up with the public bodies if he can be of any assistance to them in that regard.  I am sure the Minister is very considerate for those people&mdash;they are in many ways the most helpless in the community&mdash;and if Government policy can help them and the local bodies I am sure it will have the attention of the Minister and of his Department.</P>
    <P>Another matter which I should like to bring to his attention is the question of the temporary staffs in local offices. Some of those men work for years and years, sometimes for only five or six months of the year, without any hope whatever of permanency.  They are not acquainted with the skilled work which is required in the various councils, and in consequence find it very difficult to obtain alternative employment.  I would suggest to the <Col N="689" /> Minister, in view of the fact that all those departments are brought under the managerial system, that when vacancies occur in the board of health or the board of assistance during the summer periods, when some of the staff go on holidays, those who have been working in the rates department of the county councils during the earlier part of the year should be brought in to fill those temporary vacancies.  Then if they are brought back for the franchise again they will have at least some chance of getting seven or eight months' work in the year.</P>
    <P>I must again refer to what Deputy Byrne said about the industrial schools.  I mentioned it here recently. He was speaking about those children being removed from their families so that their families could not see them for some years.  I know definitely that, year after year, when transport was better than it is now, the Very Rev.  Provincial of the school to which he refers in the County Cork paid out of the school funds the railway fares for those children to go to their homes if they so desired and stay there for the holiday periods, just as they would from any boarding school in the country.  That arrangement still prevails.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few remarks on the housing question. The fact that there is a lull in housing because of the shortage of materials at present is probably all the more reason why some of the aspects of the matter should be gone into and considered from every angle. The housing problem is a very complicated one and has arisen from a number of circumstances, a lot of them not under our control, but perhaps if some of the causes are mentioned very briefly it will enable us to consider how far we are working on right lines.  Dublin is an old walled city on the banks of the Liffey &mdash;I suppose most cities of any size are on a river&mdash;and the fact that it had walls naturally for hundreds of years tended to confine the inhabitants inside that area.  I suppose when the danger was removed the city did not immediately begin to spread out.  Of course from time immemorial people have flocked to Dublin in search of employment, and that has also tended to exacerbate the problem. Another matter which has affected the question is, of course, the awakening consciousness of the people to social conditions in the city.  I suppose many years ago people lived in conditions in the city which would not be tolerated now, and very rightly so. I remember talking to a man, who told me that two of the male servants in his father's household used to sleep under the stairs.  I do not suppose that that would be allowed now. Probably, the people living in these houses would not permit it either, but, of course, that is all added to the problem we are now trying to solve. Coming down to our own times, I suppose we can remember the narrow city boundaries and the city wards, in <Col N="691" /> connection with which everybody was trying to get a housing scheme for the particular ward in which they lived.</P>
      <P>The next matter, I suppose, that complicated our housing problem was in connection with the Pembroke and Rathmines districts, which were just outside the city boundaries proper.  I suppose that, on account of the higher rates in the city, these people did not want to throw in their lot with the city because they were afraid that they would have to pay the city rates without having any increased benefits. Naturally, the housing shortage has led to a certain amount of confused thinking.  People talk about the man who works on the docks and whose house is in Rathmines, or who lives in Rathmines.  Of course, it is a very big journey from Rathmines to the docks, but I think that, undoubtedly, there is also a number of people who live alongside the river and who work in Rathmines.  I remember a case having been brought to my notice in connection with a bus driver, who had to leave his bus in the city, when he was finished duty at night, and had to set out for his cottage in Dean's Grange. That would have been all right, were it not for the fact that his bus was the last one, and he had either to walk out to his home in Dean's Grange or take a chance on casual transport.  That problem, of course, can only be solved when the housing situation is sufficiently fluid for people to be able to exchange their houses fairly easily and fairly rapidly: in other words, that a person who got a job in another part of the city might stand some chance of being able to get housing accommodation in that other part of the city, which, of course, would mean that these people would not have to travel such long distances to their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, houses are uneconomic.  The old condition was that somebody erected houses for the working-classes and intended to make a profit on these houses.  That condition, through a variety of causes, has now become impossible, and I wonder if that is the reason why housing is the only problem of supply that was not settled <Col N="692" /> after the last war.  For instance, during the last few years, anybody who had money had no difficulty in buying such commodities as clothing, and so on, or in getting supplies of these commodities, but it seems to be a different question when it comes to the matter of housing.  Another matter which has tended to complicate the situation&mdash; I do not think the Government have any very clear ideas on this matter, and I should be very pleased to hear if they have any clear ideas on it&mdash;is in connection with the Rent Restrictions Act.  I suppose that the apologists for the Government would say: &ldquo;Oh, you could not let the rents of houses go to their economic level; how would the workers pay those rents?&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Sir.  I am merely referring to this matter as having its effect on the housing problem.  I shall finish that by saying that that problem has never been tackled properly.  There is no doubt, of course, that the Government are very anxious to solve the housing problem.  I suppose they are as anxious as anybody in this House, and that they could say that they have made a number of contributions to the solution of the problem.  That may be so.  At the same time, however, I think that there are certain fields in which they have made very little progress and in which, in fact, they have not attempted to find a solution such as has been tried in other places.  Belfast, for instance, is not so many miles away from here, and, of course, their housing problem was not the same as that which obtains in Dublin.  I think that transport facilities were easier in that city and that it was easier to develop districts around the city.  I am not sure, but I think that in Belfast they give, at the present time, £100 towards the cost of working-class houses, and that a loan is given at a low rate of interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter which was referred to here was in connection with the reduction of rates on working-class <Col N="693" /> dwellings.  I do not know whether the system prevails at present, but in Belfast, many years ago, they used to give a reduction on all rates that were paid by a certain date.  After that date, there was no reduction.  I believe that after a very short time they found that in the case of any rates that were not paid by that date, and the reduction accordingly availed of, the rates were uncollectible.  Another matter to which I should like to refer, in connection with this matter of housing, is that I think the Government have taken too narrow a view of the problem. They are looking, and quite rightly, to the housing of the sections of the community who are most in need of houses, but I think that if they tried to help some of the other sections also, they would find that each section would react on the other.  If one takes the ordinary population of this country at the present time, I think it will be found that it is composed of a few people who are so wealthy that they can afford to purchase a house anywhere they want it, and then, at the other end of the scale, there are people who are so poor that it is a nice question as to what rent they can afford to pay.  I think that one of the last speakers mentioned that it had been found, in connection with some of the new housing schemes, that as soon as people found that they had to pay a few pounds more for rent, that immediately had an adverse effect on their health, because the only item they could save on was food or other necessaries of life.  In that connection, of course, there is a gradual process going on all the time in this city, because of the change-over from the narrow walled city of former times, for which, I suppose, the Danes were primarily responsible; but the city is being slowly spread out, and certain industries are moving out.  As a result of that, the fear of people outside the city, say, in the Crumlin area, is that they will not be able to get any employment out there.  Now, I think that that problem will be slowly solved by the development of factories moving out into such districts, because it will be possible to acquire bigger sites there in which to erect modern factories.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="694" /> I have spoken already about the community being composed of the very rich at one end of the social scale&mdash;a small portion, if you like&mdash;and of another section of the people who can scarcely afford to pay any rent; but, in between, there is a sort of shading of the various classes.  For instance, you have a number of people at the present time who are competing for corporation houses, or for workers' houses, who really do not belong to that class at all and who, with a little help, would probably be able to pay for houses themselves.  I should like to ask the Minister seriously to consider why the sums that were made available under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act were not continued.  An enormous number of houses were built under that Act, and I think that every time a sum of money was made available by the Government to the corporation, it was only a question of a few months until that money was used up, and there was no more.  One could understand the withdrawal of this assistance if the argument could be used that the provision of these grants tended to diminish the supply of working-class dwellings or prevented their being erected as speedily as possible but the people to whom I refer in many cases have certain savings put by and it is only a question of financing them to the extent of the balance of the purchase money.  The risk of those people defaulting in their payments is practically nil because in most cases the class of houses which they purchase would hold their value.  These houses cost pre-war, say, about £500.  If the purchaser met with some difficulty in meeting the payments due on the amount advanced, and the house had to be sold there would be no difficulty in getting the amount of money for the house when it was sold.</P>
    <P>I should like to suggest to the Government that their ideas of housing are too narrow.  I think that practically anyone who wants to get a small house should be more or less welcomed and that there should not be an inquisition to ascertain whether or not the person seeking the house belongs to the working class.  If it did not mean too much of an impost on the community in general, I do not see <Col N="695" /> why any questions of that kind should be raised any more than if a person who was not of the working class went into an establishment where clothing was sold generally for the working classes.  If a person went into an establishment such as that and asked for an overcoat he would not be cross-questioned as to whether or not he was a worker.  Anybody who had the money to put down and was a potential customer would be welcomed.</P>
    <P>That brings me to another aspect of the housing question to which I do not believe the Government have paid much attention or, if they have, they are only very slowly waking up to it. I think the actual construction of houses is the least part of the problem or at any rate it is the part of the problem that is capable of quickest solution.  Housing, I suggest, really falls into four more or less equally-spaced problems, in point of time.  It takes a year to plan a working-class site, a year to acquire the site, a year to clear it and another year to build houses on it.  That is a very rough and ready generalisation but I suggest if you take what is gained in one direction and put it against what is lost in another, you will find that my estimate works out approximately correct.  That brings me to the point that if the Government had been planning for the past four years, they would probably find that in the post-war period the builders would catch up on them.  I do not know if the Government are afraid that the builders will work too quickly.  I am quite sure that the Labour representatives in this House are not afraid that too many builders will be employed at once and that they would finish the job too quickly.</P>
    <P>There seems to be one perennial problem in connection with all these sites which the Government acquire inside the city or where there is any clearing to be done.  It seems to take an unconscionable time to get the site cleared of the people who are living on the site.  Usually the excuse given by the corporation, and I am sure there is a good deal of truth in it, is that they have not houses anywhere else into which they can put people <Col N="696" /> taken off that site.  That is probably true but there is no builder, whoever he may be, engaged on a housing scheme inside the city who is not very seriously hampered, delayed and put to extra expense because he is not handed over the site when he wants to start operations.  He is told that he can start in one corner of the site, that he can work along and that by the time he is ready to start in the other corner the site will be cleared but he never knows from day to day whether he may not be left standing high and dry until the site ahead is cleared.  Adjacent to my premises there is a site which has been under consideration for seven years, that is the Whitefriar Street scheme.</P>
    <P>Another matter&mdash;I do not know whether it delays housing; it probably does not to the extent that one would imagine&mdash;is that the corporation building by-laws have not been overhauled for generations.  I think a rough and ready <i>via media</i> has been discovered. The corporation more or less let each case be decided on its merits without having recourse to the by-laws.  That is no reason, however, why in a period like the present, the opportunity should not be availed of to overhaul any legislation of that kind which would be of assistance in the post-war period.  I should also like to ask the Minister why the publication of the housing report has been delayed so long.  Some people suggest that that report reveals the extra cost of housing due to the tariffs that were imposed in recent years on some housing materials.  I would suggest to the Minister that a more realistic approach to the housing problem as a whole should be made by the Government. The difference in the requirements of various sections of the community as regards housing is very small and may be explained by the fact that various classes live in different districts around the city.  Some of these people may require garages to their houses.  In fact, they are really working-class houses in a slightly different area with, possibly, a garage attached. I do not see why the Minister and the Government should not consider the problem as a whole and provide that anybody who wants a house of a certain <Col N="697" /> size will be able to get it practically on demand.  If they did that, I am sure that the housing problem would not be with us much longer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnSOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the policy at present being carried out in Dublin of taking over insanitary dwellings and making them fit for human residence but I think that the rate of progress is much too slow.  I urge on the Minister that he should press on with that programme.  I can think of no better way of giving employment to building workers than that of eradicating this evil of the slums, which has always been a national disgrace.  As regards the problem of providing houses for people in the city, Deputy Martin O'Sullivan mentioned that about 15,000 houses were needed.  I think that the number is much greater, particularly in the case of persons who do not ordinarily obtain housing accommodation from the Dublin Corporation. That number will continue to increase until houses are again made available.  I am aware that the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Supplies are taking steps to provide that houses will be made available as soon as building materials are obtainable.  They have asked for the submission of plans.  They have requested persons and companies with building projects in view to get their sites cleared, so that the schemes will be ready for operation when supplies come across the seas again.  I am satisfied that, as a result of these plans, houses will be made available for the people who require them as soon as it is humanly possible to do so. However, I suggest to the Minister that there is another aspect of this question to which attention might usefully be given at this stage.  I refer to the question of house-purchase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that a considerable sum should be made available through ordinary sources for house purchase loans.  It should not be necessary for the burden of financing house purchase to fall on the local authorities, particularly Dublin Corporation.  A considerable sum of money would be invested in house purchase loans if new houses were available.  I think <Col N="698" /> that steps should be taken to lay down standard conditions upon which a loan might be given and received for the purchase of dwellings.  A limit should be placed to the amount of interest chargeable.  There should be a standard form of mortgage, and, perhaps, greater safeguards might be devised for the mortgagee.  The position at present prevailing is that there is competition between insurance companies, building societies and others to obtain this business, and an insurance company may offer a man a greater percentage of the amount he requires if he will take out a policy of insurance from them.  There should be no mixing up of house purchase with life insurance. Standard conditions for house purchase loans should be laid down and the rate of interest should be limited.  At present, the rate varies from 5½ per cent to 8 per cent.  The lowest rate which prevails is much too high.  What better security can you offer an investor than a mortgage on the residence of an Irish workman? When the security is so good, the rate of interest should be lower than it is.  A prospective house purchaser should be able to borrow money at half of one per cent. in excess of the rate which the Government have to pay for money.  It might be advisable, too, to establish a bureau at which young people looking for houses would get expert advice.  They should not be left to the mercy of the various commercial interests which are offering competitive terms.  Both as regards the purchase of the house and the negotiation of the loan, the Minister might consider establishing a bureau which would afford information to young people about to embark on house purchase for the first time.  The question of financing house purchase should not be left entirely to the corporation. I am satisfied that, if appropriate regulations were made, the banks could be induced to go in for the granting of loans for house purchase.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of his introductory speech, the Minister gave us a comprehensive review, which enabled us to see the wide character of his Department's activities.  I do not want to discuss at any great <Col N="699" /> length the various activities of the Department and their complex reactions. There are, however, one or two matters to which I should like to make reference. Recipients of old age pensions may now be granted an allowance of 2/6 per week in those areas where the food voucher scheme does not operate at present.  There is to be recoupment, as to 75 per cent. of that expenditure, by the Department, the balance being met by the local authority.  Under the normal administration of the Old Age Pensions Act, there is a means test.  If a person has an income of £39 5s. 0d., no old age pension is payable.  Those familiar with the operations of the Old Age Pensions Department know well that the Department places considerable emphasis on the necessity for a valuation of the means of applicants for old age pensions.  When the pension is finally granted, the applicant is subjected to a means test so as to satisfy the Department that only the appropriate amount is paid, having regard to the applicant's income.  I think that the Department gets whatever value is attached to the means test from its point of view.  I object entirely to the means test in cases of that kind.  It is unfair in its inception and in its operation and it is accompanied by an iniquitous inquisition into the circumstances of persons of 70 years and over who are seeking old age pensions. From the Department's Shylock point of view, it is assured when an old age pension is granted, that the income of the applicant has been sifted and that the pension is based upon the knowledge available to the Department from its inquisition.  The pensions payable to old persons are subject to a means test at present.  The Department is now piling one means test upon another.  The grant of a maximum allowance of 2/6 a week to old age pensioners in rural areas and small towns is also subject to a means test.  I suggest that it is unfair to impose a means test in connection with the grant of 2/6.  A means test has already been imposed and the maximum pension payable is 10/- per week.  In many cases, the pension is less than 10/- and all these old age pensioners have suffered considerably because of the <Col N="700" /> fact that the cost of living has increased, according to the Government's own admission, by over 70 per cent. during the past four and a half years.</P>
      <P>Even when the full increase of 2/6 weekly is granted, it does not in any way compensate old age pensioners for the shrunken value of the 10/- which they previously received.  Even if they get the additional 2/6 weekly, with the shrunken value of money, it would only recoup them to the extent of 25 per cent., while the cost of living has increased over 70 per cent.  It is very unfair to persons in receipt of pensions of 10/- weekly that they should be subjected to two means tests. These two means tests are applied to persons receiving from the State a pension of 10/- weekly in one case, and 2/6 maximum in the other case.  In other words, there are two means tests for the 12/6 weekly that old age pensioners receive from the State.  That inquisition is made into the circumstances of these families, but is not imposed in other cases, where the State spends much more generously, and with less social value than obtains in the case of needy old age pensioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I wish to refer, and that is the Department's policy in respect of the treatment of tuberculosis.  The Minister told us of the efforts of his Department in that respect, but it appears that Deputies are not satisfied that it is doing all that is required, so far as planning and taking steps to abate this dreadest of all scourges affecting the health of our people is concerned.  It is true that the Department's efforts have been praiseworthy. Any effort made to combat the dread scourge of tuberculosis or to assist in its ultimate eradication is praiseworthy, but the fact is, when due allowance is made for the Department's difficulties, as well as the anxiety and desire to combat tuberculosis, the present methods are hopelessly inadequate to deal with the scourge that confronts us to-day. While the Department is planning and thinking of doing this and that, and similarly encouraging local authorities, sanatoria are crowded.  There is a waiting list so long that the doctors <Col N="701" /> in charge of the sanatoria say that there is no hope of patients getting into some of them for months. These unfortunate patients are placed in the position that although they are tuberculosis cases which would respond to early treatment, they are compelled to remain at home, probably in overcrowded rooms, not only a danger to themselves but affecting other members of the family who at that stage are at least free from infection.</P>
    <P>I had cases brought under my notice where medical officers in charge of sanatoria were not only sympathetic but realised that they would like to get patients at an early stage, not merely to treat them but to avoid a spread of the infection.  These doctors were anxious and sympathetic towards the plea that tuberculosis patients ought not to be left at home where they were a heavy drag on the remaining members of the family and a source of diffusion of the infection.  But, no matter how sympathetic doctors may be, they are up against the physical difficulty of limited bed accommodation for patients and, because of that, these unfortunate sufferers are compelled to remain in some cases in tuberculosis houses, where their physical condition not only deteriorates daily, but they infect others with whom they come into contact not merely in that house, but even at business when patients are able to remain at business.  I do not think there is a doctor attached to sanatoria who could be got to say that he is satisfied with the present methods of dealing with tuberculosis or with the rate of progress made in the provision of beds to accommodate sufferers.  The Minister in his statement told us of the methods of his Department for dealing with tuberculosis, but these people are finding it harder than ever to get accommodation in sanatoria.  Apparently there is no prospect of being able to deal with the problem of overcrowded sanatoria, in view of the large number of applicants for treatment, the long waiting list and the apparently inadequate building programme or bed accommodation programme so far as the State and local authorities are concerned. The fact is that the State is <Col N="702" /> tinkering with the whole programme of dealing with tuberculosis and while the State is tinkering with it the unfortunate patients are dying.  Many young citizens who, if proper treatment were available, would live to enrich this State are being sent to early graves, simply because of the ineptitude of the State to make proper provision for the treatment of these hapless sufferers.</P>
    <P>The most serious form of tuberculosis infection concerns patients in overcrowded families.  I have been sent a report of a committee which has been examining the prevalence of tuberculosis in Dublin, and which took the trouble to ascertain the circumstances of a number of families, inquired into the living conditions, into the bed accommodation, and also took counsel with these families as to how they felt the incidence of tuberculosis in the family affected their method of living. At the same time this committee gathered from the families their views on how the problem could be sympathetically dealt with, so as to give the greatest measure of relief in the difficulties confronting them owing to the prevalence of tuberculosis.  The committee reports that in many cases young tuberculosis sufferers, or for that matter, elderly sufferers were compelled to share a bed with other members of a family.  Could anyone imagine, in the year 1944, that we would have in this country a conception of medical science where tuberculosis sufferers share a bed with another member of the family?  If we were engaged in a campaign to spread tuberculosis we could not do it any more efficiently than to allow a sufferer from tuberculosis to share a bed with another member of the same family. There is no more dangerous method, from the point of view of the preservation of the national health, and no more effective method from the point of view of spreading tuberculosis over the largest number of persons in the State, than that.</P>
    <P>The committee, in this case, reports that the reason for a situation of that kind is &ldquo;not so much that there was no room for another bed, but that there was no other bed available,&rdquo; so that the family had simply to double up, and sleep together.  Even in a case <Col N="703" /> where a family might, perhaps, be able to get a bed, there was the further difficulty of providing bedclothes.  I think it is bad enough that we should have an imperfect sanatoria system and that tuberculosis sufferers are compelled to remain at home, but it is still worse that they should have to sleep in beds with persons not affected with tuberculosis.  The crowning injustice is that the tubercular sufferer and the non-tubercular sufferer should have to sleep together when a remedy for that could be provided by the provision of beds and bedclothes so as to segregate the tubercular sufferer from the healthy members of the family.  The committee reports that, in the course of its investigation, it came across one case of a boy of 10 years of age, suffering from tuberculosis, who was compelled to sleep in the bed with his father and mother.  If that happened in ancient Babylon one could understand it, but the position is that it is happening in this Isle of Saints and Scholars in the year 1944, and in the capital city of the State.  Does not a case of that kind afford the clearest possible evidence that the State is only tinkering with this problem, and tinkering with it in an incompetent and insufficient way? There could be no greater indictment of the slothfulness of its methods than to find in this capital city a situation in which a boy affected with tuberculosis is compelled to sleep in an undersized bed with his father and mother.  If the Department of Local Government would keep that case in its mind, and base its policy on the urgency inspired by a case of that kind, we could then make some fairly rapid approach to the adoption of methods calculated to eradicate tuberculosis effectively.</P>
    <P>If there was a physical invasion of this country by the troops of another country, every single national resource would be mobilised for the purpose of repelling the invasion. Nothing would be allowed to stand in the nation's way for dealing with a situation of that kind.  If we could do that in the case of a physical invasion which, perhaps, might last one, two, three or four years, if it were successful, how much more necessary <Col N="704" /> is it to mobilise for constructive, and not destructive, purposes the resources of the State for dealing with an invasion of the nation's health and the nation's homesteads by tuberculosis, which is the most dreadful of all human maladies?  Tuberculosis is not merely an invader of the national health and of the nation's homesteads, it is a permanent occupying power here unless we deal effectively with it.</P>
    <P>Nothing that I say on this matter is intended in any way to hamper the efforts of the Department in dealing with this problem effectively.  My concern in the matter is this: that I am impatient of the slothfulness of its methods.  While planning is supposed to be going on, tuberculosis sufferers are dying, and tuberculosis sufferers are being permitted to live at home in over-crowded conditions because no proper sanatorium treatment is available for them.  Therefore, they are a potential source for spreading tuberculosis over an ever widening circle of people. I suggest to the Department that they ought to use the case of the boy that I have quoted&mdash;a tuberculosis sufferer compelled to sleep with his father and mother&mdash;as a guide to further and much more vigorous action in the future in the matter of providing more satisfactory sanatorium accommodation for patients.  Nothing must be allowed to stand in the Department's way as regards utilising every power that it has, and it must be given every power that it wants to enable it to deal effectively with this problem.</P>
    <P>It may be said, of course, that you need buildings to provide sanatoria, and that necessarily some delay may arise in procuring buildings.  There are many old mansions throughout the country which, perhaps, are not perfect from the point of view of providing sanatorium treatment.  At least, this much can be said, that they would be very much better than to be crowding patients suffering from tuberculosis into homes which are unfit for healthy people, much less for unhealthy people. I suggest to the Minister that he should take over a number of these old mansions and use them as sanatoria, because even an imperfect sanatorium is better than no sanatorium at all.  I suggest to him that the provision of <Col N="705" /> treatment in such circumstances would make a very much better contribution towards combating the ravages of tuberculosis than the scheme of allowing men, women and children to remain at home in overcrowded dwellings which are inadequately ventilated and without proper food or clothing, a source of infection to everyone that they come in contact with.</P>
    <P>That is a situation which the Minister cannot with impunity permit to continue.  On all sides in this House, and throughout the country, there is a widespread measure of good-will for any effort which is made to intensify our methods for dealing with tuberculosis. There will, I suggest, be a widespread measure of popular support for any scheme, no matter how costly it may appear at the outset from the purely monetary point of view, which will grapple with tuberculosis effectively. I suggest to the Minister that, knowing the existence of that good-will in the House and outside of it, knowing the dangers which confront the nation because of the existence of tuberculosis on its present scale, and knowing, too, that all our present efforts are not combating the disease&mdash;it is still on the increase and is calculated to increase still further&mdash;he ought to come to the House and get from it all the powers which he needs for the purpose of evolving a comprehensive scheme to deal with tuberculosis as it affects our people.  There is good-will in the House for that, and when the question of voting money for the treatment of tuberculosis comes before the House there will, I suggest, be no reluctance to do so.  The Government and the Department will get all the power they want to do that.  If they desire to get adequate powers to require local authorities to play their part in a national campaign for the eradication of the disease, they will get them from the House.  This disease is mowing down thousands of our people each year as surely as if they were serving in the front line trenches in a war.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not the opportunity of either hearing or reading the Minister's statement.  As regards what the Minister said when introducing the Estimate, I have to rely; <Col N="706" /> almost entirely, on the newspaper reports of his speech.  At the outset, I want to say that I think it was unfortunate that the Minister should find it necessary to threaten the local bodies with the Emergency Powers Act if they failed to assent to the edicts of his Department.  If one county council has failed to carry out what the Minister has described as its duties, surely that is no reason why he should threaten to hold the sword suspended over all the others?  Under the Managerial Act local bodies have been deprived of almost every vestige of authority, with the sole exception of striking the rate.  This latest threat of the Minister will, I think, only have the effect of stifling any useful or helpful discussion on the part of local bodies.  Surely the Minister would not maintain that the officials of his Department are infallible, and that local bodies must obey every edict issued by them without question?  It seems to me that it should be the duty of the Minister to encourage local bodies to utilise what little authority is left to them, and to discuss intelligently every instruction issued by the Department. It is inevitable that there will be differences of opinion.  I think the Minister must admit that the local bodies have co-operated in a whole-hearted fashion with the Department up to the present, even though some of them do not agree with the principle of the Managerial Act.  Nevertheless, they have co-operated with the Department in a whole-hearted way in carrying out its regulations.  Therefore, I think that the Minister acted injudiciously in issuing a threat of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened with the greatest interest to Deputy Norton discussing the subject of tuberculosis.  One of the most alarming features of the Minister's statement was his reference to the rather abnormal increases in the more serious types of diseases in this country and more especially his reference to the very high level of the deaths from tuberculosis.  I am not satisfied yet that the Department of Local Government and Public Health or the medical profession have tackled the problem of the eradication of the roots of this <Col N="707" /> disease in a manner which will give satisfactory results.</P>
    <P>I was startled the other day to read some figures supplied by Doctor Collis, who, I understand, is recognised as an authority on the subject of tuberculosis. Regarding the death rate in a number of countries, he gave figures for the period 1927/1937.  During that period he states that the death rate decline per annum in Italy ranged from 1.5 to 3.8 per cent.; in Switzerland, from 2.2 to 3.8 per cent.; in Sweden it was 4 per cent., and in England and Wales 3.9 per cent.  In Northern Ireland, presumably operating on the British system, the rate of decline decreased from 2.1 per cent. to 1.5 per cent. and, judging by the Minister's statement, the rate has decreased very substantially since then.  I admit, of course, that in England and Wales since the outbreak of war there has been an alarming increase in tuberculosis, due to factors which, no doubt, were created by the war situation and the lack of adequate nutritive foods.</P>
    <P>Those familiar with conditions in the country know perfectly well that a country patient who feels that he or she is in danger, or possibly subject to the disease, is very reluctant to mention anything about it, even in the family circle, because, as Deputy Hughes has pointed out, of the stigma attaching to a person suffering from the disease.  As a result, when the patient is forced eventually to seek the advice of a doctor, the disease is too far advanced, and it is impossible to do anything for the unfortunate sufferer.  Of course, the disease breeds more freely in surroundings of poverty than in other surroundings.  It is also admitted by county medical officers of health in recent reports submitted to the Department that amongst working-class men and their families the disease is on the increase in very many counties.</P>
    <P>It is all very well for the Minister to state that he proposes in the future &mdash;presumably when the war is over&mdash; to build sanatoria to accommodate these unfortunate people.  It seems to me that he should take immediate <Col N="708" /> steps to prevent the spread of infection. It is a well-known fact that, in many towns and some of the cities, too, there are houses reeking with the disease, and yet no adequate steps are taken in regard to them.  The people living in those houses are working-class people, mixing with healthy people in the course of their employment, in factories, in places of amusement, cinemas, theatres, sports fields, and so on, where there is always the danger that they may spread disease.</P>
    <P>If we are to make any impression at all on this problem, we must get down to bedrock, which means that steps must be taken by intensive propaganda to bring home to sufferers from tuberculosis the serious nature of the disease and the danger of spreading the infection to others.  I know cases myself of sufferers from the disease who, unfortunately, cannot be admitted to sanatoria as there is no accommodation. They are living, as Deputy Norton has said, in their own families, and there is the danger that other members of the family will become infected.  The medical profession seems to be quite helpless in cases like that.  In the case of the poor working man, who probably suspects that he is suffering from the germs of the disease, he is often afraid to approach the doctor, for fear he might be sent immediately to a sanatorium, leaving his wife and children without support.  There is no provision whatever by the State or by any local authority for people in these unfortunate circumstances.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Norton that the House will give the Minister the widest possible powers and authority to tackle this problem at its roots.  Any money spent with that object in view will be well spent, and the House will be generous in its attitude to any proposals the Minister might introduce in this respect.  It appears to me that there is no hope of bringing down the death-rate and making an impression on the problem, until we get down to bedrock, by providing extended dispensary treatment, or ensuring by some other means, that those suffering will be treated at an early stage.</P>
    <P>We must also see that the unfortunate <Col N="709" /> working man, at present afraid to disclose his illness to his employer, because of the danger of losing his employment, is provided for as regards himself, his wife and his family, if he is forced to go away to a sanatorium.</P>
    <P>These are two of the essential aspects of the problem and, until some provision is made to deal with them, I do not see that we will make any real impression on the disease itself or bring down the death rate very substantially.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect to it.  Very often patients are sent to a sanatorium and, when it is recognised that the cases are incurable, they are sent home.  That is largely due to lack of accommodation, because it is necessary to make room for other patients suffering from the disease.  The person who is sent home dies, but during the time that person is at home the infection spreads to other members of the family and perhaps to outside friends and relations.  No adequate steps are taken to prevent the spread of infection and until suitable steps are taken in this connection, I do not see that it will be at all possible to bring about any substantial improvement in the appalling death rate from tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>We are spending an enormous amount of money on social services. The Minister and members of his Party have boasted about the wonderful things they have done for the country by establishing a splendid system of social services.  If any criterion is to be applied to that, surely it is the standard of public health and, on the Minister's admission, the standard of public health is going down.  To that extent, therefore, the policy in relation to social services has failed.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the magnificent highways which he proposes to build, presumably for motorists, in the future.  Apparently it is his desire to convert this country into a tourists' paradise.  But the Minister did not mention the unfortunate people who constitute the bulk of the population &mdash; the farmers.  He had not a word to say about providing the farmers, who represent about 80 per cent. of our productive capacity, with suitable roads, and suitable means of transport.  One of the Deputies for Waterford mentioned this morning that the position of our <Col N="710" /> trunk roads is such that many of them are unsuitable for horse traffic.  That has been a fruitful subject of discussion at meetings of public boards.  I do not know whether those discussions have made any impression on the technical experts of the Department. At all events, many of the roads are definitely unsuitable for horse traffic.  I hope that the Minister's officials when planning these new highways will take into consideration the requirements of the farming community and leave a space for ordinary horse traffic. It would be dangerous, as one man described it in the past, to convert our roads into something approaching skating rinks&mdash;to construct them pretty much in the same manner as skating rinks.</P>
    <P>There is rather a substantial item in the Estimate for the purpose of making provision by way of supplemental allowances to old age pensioners, widows in receipt of pensions, and other people.  I agree that in present circumstances it is necessary that some allowance should be given in cases where there is hardship.  There are many instances of people in receipt of old age pensions and widows being in dire distress and needing assistance from some source.  My objection to the proposal is that I do not see why local authorities should be called upon to contribute towards the cost of any scheme of that kind. It has been the policy of the Department of Local Government for a long time to put on to local authorities expenditure which should be borne by the National Exchequer.  The result of that policy is that the rates are increasing year by year.</P>
    <P>We are told by the Minister for Finance that if this country is to achieve reasonable prosperity it is absolutely essential in the future that production should be increased.  If there is to be a substantial increase in production, one of the first essentials is that local and national taxation should be brought to the lowest point possible.  The lower the scale of taxation the more money there will be to put into production.  All the exactions imposed by the Minister on local authorities add substantially to the rates each year.  I desire to protest <Col N="711" /> against the policy of the Minister which imposes charges of this kind on local authorities.  It seems to me it is not the function of the ratepayers to raise the money; it is the function of the Government to provide the whole of the money for this very necessary purpose.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to turf production. Presumably his remarks were directed to the county councils.  I am not satisfied that the turf production schemes carried out under the county councils have been successful or economical.  My experience of these schemes goes to show that they have been altogether too costly, with the result that the councils have had to charge an excessive price for the turf sent to the Turf Development Board in Dublin and sold to county institutions. I suggest that the Minister should encourage county managers and county engineers to try to get private individuals to produce as much turf as they can for the use of public institutions, and for the Turf Development Board in Dublin.  Looking at the expenditure of one county council on turf production during the last three years, I see that in the first year, at all events, it cost 50 per cent. more than the turf produced by private individuals.  I believe it only requires a certain amount of organisation on the part of county managers and county engineers to secure by private enterprise practically all the turf required by institutions throughout the country.  Many county surveyors did not know much about turf production when they were asked by the Government to undertake this work, but during the intervening years they have gained a certain amount of experience, although anybody who knows anything about turf production would not be inclined to regard them as experts on the subject.  After all, it is to a certain extent a special business, and it should be left to the specialists if the Minister desires to have both economy and efficiency.</P>
    <P>As regards the means test, representations have been made to the Minister on numerous occasions about the advisability of altering, or at least <Col N="712" /> re-examining, the standards which guide the officials in determining whether people are entitled to old age pensions, widows' pensions, and so on. I am sure the Minister and other members of the Government are satisfied that the existing circumstances justify some change.  We are living in abnormal times.  The war has brought about revolutionary and extraordinary conditions, and in view of the high cost of living I think some examination of the means standard is called for.  I hope the Minister will give sympathetic consideration to the appeals made to him by the Lord Mayor of Dublin, by Deputy Norton, and by other speakers here to-day, to have an investigation carried out immediately with the object of removing the dissatisfaction that exists in every part of the country with regard to the present standards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>In his opening remarks, Deputy Roddy appeared to be rather annoyed because of the attitude the Minister has adopted in dissolving local bodies.  I think the last people to criticise any one on that point should be the Deputies who are sitting on the opposite benches, because they specialised in that particular work at a particular time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cogan this morning stood up to defend the Roscommon County Council and he did that without the slightest knowledge of the conditions in County Roscommon.  If there is anything for which people who travel over the roads in Roscommon might criticise the older Roscommon County Councils, it is the condition in which they always kept the roads.  They were never nearly up to the standard of the roads in other counties although Roscommon is a very important county, in so far as its roads are concerned, because persons travelling from Dublin to the West of Ireland must cross some part of County Roscommon.  I know conditions in Roscommon fairly well and I do not think anybody here can dispute for a moment that the Roscommon County Council got every opportunity by the inquiry that was set up.  They were not dissolved by the Minister without being given an opportunity to reconsider their position. <Col N="713" /> The inquiry was held and they were given a fair crack of the whip and an opportunity of reconsidering their position.  The result of the recent election in Roscommon, in my opinion, was a clear demand to the Minister to take the steps he took and he would be lacking in his duty if he had waited any longer than he did.  The upkeep of county roads, main roads or trunk roads, is a responsibility that must be undertaken by somebody.  Thousands of pounds are spent annually on these roads and that money represents not only a contribution from the county but a grant from the Minister.  If the Minister grants to any county sums of money out of the public purse then it is his duty to see that that money is not wasted.</P>
    <P>No matter how we try to maintain our roads, they cannot at the present time be fully maintained; all we can do is to keep the roads in as reasonably good a state of repair as we can. Difficulties are experienced at the moment owing to lack of tar and other materials and the amount of maintenance we can do is not a whole lot. The county council engineer in Roscommon is second to none in Ireland. He is a man with a national outlook so far as the work of the county and the country generally is concerned.  He is a man who is very efficient, who never squandered or tried to squander any of the funds of the Roscommon County Council, and I think the Roscommon County Council were very wrong in trying to evade their liabilities so far as the roads are concerned. They have gone a lot further than that in other respects.  I do not think any Minister of State, any Minister for Local Government, in this country could allow any county council to become a crowd of political racketeers. His duty is to step in and stop it before it comes to that stage.  That is probably the stage which would have been arrived at in Roscommon if it were allowed to go on much further.</P>
    <P>There are a few items that I wish to put before the Minister.  First of all, of course, I want to congratulate him on the way he has handled the disputes all over the country in which <Col N="714" /> bog workers were concerned.  He was most helpful to the county managers and county council engineers because any suggesion they put to him he was always prepared to meet.  In addition he gave them very useful information and assistance to ensure that instead of there being strikes all over the country, work would proceed in a satisfactory way.  That applied in my county in many cases, and therefore I think it is only right for me to compliment him.</P>
    <P>There is a number of peat schemes in Galway in connection with which there is a dispute about the price being paid by the county council to people who let bogs through the county council and the question of arbitration arises.  The Minister should look into that matter at an early date because the price has not been fixed awaiting arbitration of some kind.  I would ask the Minister to give his attention to that particular aspect of the peat schemes.</P>
    <P>There is another matter in which I am very interested.  It is the question of town boundaries.  Most of the new building schemes were chosen outside the town boundaries.  In my particular town one very large scheme of almost 200 houses has been built outside the town boundary.  They are working-class houses, and by being just a few yards outside the boundary the residents are deprived of many services.  If a man is thrown out of employment he is not eligible for the dole.  The same thing applies to assistance of one kind or another.  Where housing schemes have to be built outside the town boundary, the next step that should be taken, and one that should not be delayed, is to extend the town boundary so as to include within the town the housing scheme.  It is a serious position to have 200 or 300 working-class families not entitled to the same benefits as people who happen to be living two or three yards away, inside the town boundary.  I would ask the Minister to see what can be done to rectify that position.</P>
    <P>There is another matter that is causing considerable trouble.  In the West of Ireland we have great difficulty in some of the best tillage districts in <Col N="715" /> connection with village roads or utility roads.  In a number of areas last year where there was a good deal of tillage carried out the farmers were unable to get the threshers into their barns. Difficulty is also experienced by children going to school.  Unless the neighbours oblige them by making a public right-of-way across their fields, there are times in winter when it would be impossible for children to get to school.  I do not know how the Minister can help to solve that problem, but unless he can give some assistance I am afraid the county councils will not be able to do very much about it.</P>
    <P>There was a good deal of comment to-day about tuberculosis.  Of course, we are all anxious that everything possible should be done to control that particular disease.  Unfortunately, we have not got any constructive suggestion but I can assure the Minister that we are all prepared to give him any assistance we can.  I dare say the matter is receiving attention, but in our particular county the position would appear to be bad.  A tubercular patient should be relieved of mental worry in the first instance.</P>
    <P>I know that in our county when they are removed to a sanatorium the county manager, who is very interested in keeping the rates as low as he possibly can, makes them pay for their maintenance.  I think that is a very bad system.  A man stricken down by tuberculosis is, you might say, looking into the grave.  He may be a married man who has worries that other people have not, because he is thinking that he may leave his wife and children behind him without any means of living.  He cannot take out an insurance policy to provide something for their maintenance.  There are two classes of people who should never be asked to pay for their maintenance in public institutions&mdash;those suffering from tuberculosis and those in mental hospitals.  They are different types of patients from any others and there should not be any question of charging for their maintenance.  We may be asked, of course, where the money is to come from, but the extra contribution required from those in <Col N="716" /> good health to provide for these two classes of people would not be a terrible lot and we would be relieving them of some of the worry that is not helpful to them.  There is also the question of mothers suffering from tuberculosis.  I think it is a terrible thing that they should be left at home with their families.  Once a mother develops tuberculosis she should be removed from her family immediately as it is very serious to have her living in a house where there are a number of small children.  Mothers have much more contact with the children than fathers have, and I think an effort should be made to get them away from the children.</P>
    <P>Some Deputy referred to the present condition of the roads so far as horse traffic is concerned and in some cases it is very bad.  County engineers have made some effort to remedy this condition, but any effort they have made, I am afraid, will not be very useful. The present slippery condition of the roads is due to the fact that they are not being maintained in the same condition as they were formerly.  It is a matter that should get the attention of the Department.  Horses are very valuable at present, not alone from the monetary point of view, so far as the farmers are concerned, but from the point of view of their usefulness to the State in the production of food.  If a farmer is taking a cart-load of stuff along a road and his horse breaks a leg and has to be shot, that is a loss to the State as well as to the farmer. I think the Minister's Department should see if something cannot be done to provide even temporary relief in that matter which is very essential. County councils have gone some distance in helping in the matter, but the effort they have made is a very feeble one.  I know parts of the country where farmers had to put stuff on the side of the roads to save their horses from injury.  The Department should go into the matter very carefully, and see if they can do anything to help.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Like previous speakers, I am at the disadvantage of not having had the privilege of listening to the Minister's opening statement.  I have, <Col N="717" /> however, read carefully the summarised version given in the principal daily papers.  I should like the Minister to give us much more information than he gave in his opening statement about the progress in regard to turf production, particularly in relation to any increase that may have been effected in the turf produced by local authorities. In answer to a question from me on the 18th April last, dealing mainly with the question of the demand in my area for improved working conditions for turf workers employed by local authorities, the Minister, as reported in column 858 of the Official Report, said: &ldquo;The number of persons actually engaged in cutting the 1944 crop is more than double the number similarly employed at this time last year.&rdquo;  Any inquiries I have been able to make&mdash;and I have made them from reliable sources in my constituency, particularly in one county&mdash;do not confirm the information contained in that reply.  On Thursday last I handed in a question asking for the latest information in that respect. I assume the Minister must have that information in his possession and I assume that that question will be down for answer by the Minister to-morrow. In any case, I would welcome the latest available figures in connection with this matter in relation not alone to my own constituency but to the country as a whole.  No doubt the Minister can give up-to-date information regarding the progress made by the local authorities in connection with the demand for increased turf production. Every Party in this House and every public representative on a local authority is willing to give whatever assistance is needed in that connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stated here when discussing this matter on a previous occasion that, in my opinion, the failure of the local authorities, in certain areas at any rate, to get more men and a better type of men to help to increase turf production, was due to the fact that the wages paid were not as attractive as the wages offered by private turf producers in the same areas.  I can assure the Minister&mdash;and he can ask his colleagues sitting behind him if he has any doubt about it&mdash;that several <Col N="718" /> private turf producers are paying much higher wages and giving much better conditions to the men employed by them for the purpose of producing turf for sale.  It is a common thing in the turf cutting areas in my constituency for private turf producers to pay their workers at the rate of 10/- per day.  I know of one case where a fairly extensive private turf producer is paying his workers 12/6 per day, in addition to a meal in the middle of the day. When you compare these with the conditions sanctioned by the Minister in connection with this matter, I think that explains why, in some areas, at any rate, the number of workers employed by the local authorities this year is less than last year.  There may be other counties to which the Minister's figures could be properly applied.</P>
    <P>On 1st April also, I raised with the Minister the question of whether he would sanction proposals submitted to him for better conditions for turf workers employed by local authorities, and I asked on that occasion whether he was prepared to authorise the payment of a minimum wage of £3 per week to such workers.  I also asked whether they had received a number of recommendations from local authorities and other bodies during the past two years urging him to provide better working conditions for these workers. The Minister, to my amazement, indicated that he had not received any such proposals during the previous two years.  If the Minister will look up the Official Reports for the day in question, he will find that, immediately prior to answering my question, he answered a question by Deputy Norton and admitted that he had received proposals from the Kildare County Manager for an improvement in the conditions of turf workers.  I asked him if he had received any proposals from the Offaly County Council during the previous two years, and he said he had not.  I want to be fair to the Minister in dealing with this matter.  He subsequently wrote me a letter in which he stated that a resolution was received in the Department from the Offaly County Council on 1st April, 1942, &ldquo;which&rdquo; he said &ldquo;is still over two years from the date of your question.&rdquo;  In fairness to the <Col N="719" /> Minister, I admit that I was 17 days out in the period I set down in my question.  However, on 1st April, 1942&mdash;I suppose a very appropriate date&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On 1st April, 1942, he received a resolution from the Offaly County Council, passed unanimously by the members of that body, urging him to pay the turf workers a minimum hourly rate of 1/-.  This matter was raised by me two years and 17 days afterwards, but, notwithstanding the pressure from that body, and from the Kildare County Manager on the subsequent date, the Minister still insists on the payment of this miserable hourly maximum rate of 10½d.  I urge him now&mdash;I daresay my voice will fall on deaf ears, but I hope not&mdash;in view of the failure of certain county managers in the midland part of the country, to review the miserable rates of wages, and, by doing so, induce competent turf workers now employed by private turf producers to be added to the number of persons producing turf for local authorities.  If he does so, it will, in my opinion, help to increase the production of turf by local authorities, to the advantage of the community as a whole and particularly of the institutions in the counties concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 21st March of this year I raised the question in this House of the cost of turf production in the two counties in my constituency.  The Minister gave me all the available information which was at the disposal of his Department &mdash;I am grateful to him for doing so &mdash; and it disclosed a most extraordinary state of affairs.  I wonder has the Minister given the matter any consideration in the meantime, or has he made any inquries from the County Manager of Leix, who is also the person in control of Offaly, as to the explanation of the difference in the cost of production as between Counties Leix and Offaly of 12/- per ton in 1942 and 14/- per ton in 1943.  The cost of production of the turf produced in <Col N="720" /> Offaly and sold to Fuel Importers, Ltd., in 1942, was 30/6 per ton, loaded on lorry.  The comparative figure for County Leix was 32/6., showing a difference of 12/- per ton.  In 1943, the charge to Fuel Importers, Ltd., for turf produced in Offaly was 24/- per ton.  The Minister refers to that as an interim price in his statement, but the comparative figure for Leix in the same year was 38/- per ton, showing a difference of 14/- per ton.  The Minister gave other figures such as the total amount paid in wages by the county manager of the two counties.  The figure in regard to total production in Offaly for 1942 was 19,407 tons, compared with 13,741 tons for Leix, although there is very little difference in the total amount paid out in wages in the two counties.  I suggest that the Minister should get one of his Departmental inspectors to look into that matter whenever he is next in the district, provided nothing was done between the date on which the Minister gave me his figures and the present day.  There is certainly something to be inquired into there.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which has been brought to my notice by some private turf producers in my constituency. I have a communication from a private turf producer containing an offer made to him&mdash;and I believe it was made to other people of the same type during the same period&mdash;by Fuel Importers, Ltd. to purchase turf, of the 1942 crop, free on rail, at 28/- per ton although Fuel Importers, Ltd. were buying turf from the county manager in Leix at 42/6 per ton.  I daresay the Minister is not fully responsible for the activities of Fuel Importers, Ltd., but the county manager is doing very well in getting 42/- from Fuel Importers, Ltd., in the county in which that firm has been trying to buy turf from private producers at 28/- per ton.</P>
    <P>I made a suggestion, when speaking on this matter several months ago, and I am not sure whether it has been developed and investigated to any extent.  So far as I can see, turf production by the local authorities was started in a hurry.  No opportunity was given to county surveyors or other officials to survey the situation.  The emergency arose without much previous <Col N="721" /> notice and county surveyors were given a very difficult job to do at very short notice.  One thing I have noticed&mdash;and I do not think they have changed their attitude in the matter, notwithstanding the fact that suggestions which might be helpful to the community which has to purchase turf at high prices have been made to them&mdash;is that, in the commencing period of turf production by local authorities, county surveyors or other officials went into the bogs nearest to the main roads, irrespective of whether the turf was likely to be good, bad or indifferent, or whether proper drainage schemes or necessary road repair work had been carried out.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister for Local Government that, when he is next discussing matters of this kind with the county managers or county officials, he should urge upon them the necessity for carrying out a classification of turf bogs.  When cutting turf for sale to county institutions, to Fuel Importers, or to others, they should concentrate upon bogs where they are likely to get the best class of turf.  If they do so, they will get a good class of turf, which will be cheaper to the persons who are buying it; the cost of transporting it, if it has to be carried long distances by rail or road, will be much cheaper than the cost of transporting a very low type of turf over long distances to the cities of Dublin, Cork and elsewhere.  I myself have seen railway waggons in my own constituency loaded with a very poor type of turf.  On one occasion I saw 6-ton railway waggons which contained less than three tons of turf. Wherever you have to carry a low type of turf of that kind over long distances, either by rail or road, you are adding to the cost of transport for the people who have to buy it at high prices in the City of Dublin and other places.  That class of turf should not be cut by the local authorities for sale to people at long distances from the county concerned.  I would urge the Minister, therefore, to consider&mdash;if it has not already been seriously considered&mdash;the question of classifying the turf bogs for the purpose of getting the best results for all concerned.  He <Col N="722" /> should urge the county managers and surveyors to concentrate upon cutting turf in the bogs where the best possible class of turf can be found.</P>
    <P>Some time ago, I raised here in the House with the Minister, by question, and also on a previous occasion on the Estimate, the policy adopted by a certain local authority in my constituency of letting labourers' cottages to unmarried persons.  In answer to one question which I raised here, the Parliamentary Secretary admitted that, although there were several applicants for a labourer's cottage in a certain district in the County Offaly, the cottage was let to a single girl who had not previously been in occupation of a cottage, while married men with large families were turned down.  I understand that, following the raising of that question here and its answer by the Parliamentary Secretary, certain steps were taken by the Minister's Department to put it right with the local authority concerned.  What happened? The county manager concerned took the necessary steps to secure possession of the cottage which had been let to a single girl but not occupied by the party concerned.  The case came up before the district justice and was adjourned because the county manager concerned had not instructed his legal advisers to appear before the court. He sent the rent collector before the justice, the justice would not take his evidence, the case has been adjourned, and the cottage is still in the possession &mdash;at any rate legally or nominally in the possession&mdash;of this single person, while several suitable local applicants, married men with large families, are waiting for suitable housing accommodation.</P>
    <P>Another case of the same kind came under my notice recently.  In another part of the same county a cottage is nominally or legally in the possession of a single girl, while several married men with families are still waiting for suitable housing accommodation.  I raised the matter with the county manager concerned, and he informed me that this particular case had been brought under the notice of the Department of Local Government; in other words, the letting of the cottage <Col N="723" /> to a single person had been sanctioned by the Minister for Local Government. I would ask the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary, in view of the fact that this is the second case which has been brought under notice, to see that whenever one of the Department's inspectors is next in the county he will inquire into the question as to whether there are any other labourers' cottages in the county legally in the possession of persons who are not qualified under Departmental regulations to secure possession of such cottages.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary, with his knowledge of housing and public health matters, will agree with me that it is quite unjust that cottages should be let to single girls while married men with large families are awaiting suitable housing accommodation.  I will furnish him with particulars of the second case if he will give an undertaking that he will have the matter inquired into by one of his Departmental inspectors.</P>
    <P>I should like to raise here the question&mdash;it is a policy question, and that is why I am raising it&mdash;as to whether it is right and proper under Departmental regulations for the labour exchange in a town to order town workers to go a long distance into a rural area for employment on relief schemes, and to pay those persons at the rural rate of wages.</P>

I would also urge upon the Minister the necessity for his housing inspectors, whenever they are visiting the different counties, to enquire into the position regarding the present system of carrying out repairs to labourers' cottages, and whether satisfactory arrangements have been made, especially during the last couple of years, for carrying out <Col N="724" /> what are regarded as urgently needed repairs.  I have received repeated complaints in regard to the failure of local authorities in my area to carry out essential and urgent repairs to labourers' cottages, and in some cases it is stated that they cannot get suitable local contractors to carry out the work.  If they cannot get suitable contractors to carry out urgent repairs to labourers' cottages, there is another way of getting the work done, and that is by direct labour.  The cottages should not be left with slates off the roof and needing other urgent repairs of that kind, while the responsibility rests upon the local authority to get the necessary repairs carried out either by contract or by direct labour.</P>

The statutory regulations governing the competition held by the commissioners for the posts set out in detail the general conditions governing the competition and each applicant <Col N="725" /> was supplied with a copy of them. These regulations provided that candidates should in the first instance hold a university degree or equivalent qualification, or the Árd Teastas in Irish of the Department of Education, and should have an excellent knowledge of Irish and a good general knowledge of educational affairs and of modern social and economic developments.</P>
      <P>The competition itself comprised three separate tests, viz:&mdash;</P>

      <P>(b)An oral examination in Irish;</P>
      <P>(c)An Interview.</P>
      <P>Only those candidates who qualified in the written examination were eligible to undergo the test in Oral Irish and the Interview test.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take questions Nos. 16 and 17 together.  The amount of the revenue derived by the Electricity Supply Board in the year ended 31st March, 1944, from consumers charged on the valuation tariff was £918,147, of which the sum of £520,975 represented the fixed charge portion.  The fixed part of the charge is designed to cover fixed costs which are not affected by variations in the consumption of current.  Reductions in sales of electricity do not mean corresponding reductions in the board's costs.</P>
      <P>While I am prepared to request the board to examine the position should the present curtailment of supply to domestic consumers be prolonged, I should make it clear that I would not be prepared to approve a reduction of charges to domestic consumers which involve an increase in the charge for current supplied to industrial users.</P>
      <P>The Electricity Supply Board will, of course, be prepared to disconnect any consumer who wishes to avoid payment of the fixed charge in present circumstances, in which event the householder concerned would be qualified to receive a ration of paraffin oil during the months in which such ration can be made available to householders with no other means of lighting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with the fixed charge on the present ration basis, is the Minister aware that the actual charge per unit, taking my own case, is 2/3 per unit, while, if I were obtaining electricity on the quarterly basis, I would be paying only 10d. per unit?  It should not be a question of continuing the sources of income of the Electricity Supply Board but one of equity between the board and consumers. Surely, in ordinary common <Col N="736" /> sense, it is not fair to ask people to pay a fixed charge related to an unlimited supply of electricity, and continue to apply that fixed charge to a limited consumption, in which case the charge per unit works out at 2/- or 3/- per unit, while the charge on the quarterly basis was 6d. or 10d. per unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated that I am prepared to request the board to examine the position if the present curtailment of electricity consumption by domestic consumers is likely to be prolonged.  The Electricity Supply Board is not at present making a revenue sufficient to cover its outgoings, and if a reduction in the charges to domestic consumers were to involve an increase in industrial costs, I think it would be a wrong step to take.  I pointed out that, if any householder feels that electricity is too dear under the present system, he can avoid the charge by having his supply disconnected, in which case he will be placed in the same position as the majority of householders in the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not the Minister aware that there are two distinct classes of consumers on the valuation basis?  There are some who have no right other than the right which the Minister has suggested, to have their electricity disconnected in order to save themselves the present excessive charges.  There are others in a position in which they can put up a case to be changed from the valuation basis to a consumption charge.  I would ask the Minister to look into the matter from that point of view.  I think if he does he will find that there are a large number of people suffering hardships, because while they have to pay on the valuation basis, in some cases they are only getting four-fifths of a unit for their electricity supply over a two months' period.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Very complete investigations in connection with the Liffey hydro-electric development were carried out over a number of years by the staff of the Electricity Supply Board in consultation with foreign experts and reports were submitted to the Government and legislation authorising the work was passed by the Dáil and actual work was commenced in 1937.  These investigations and reports covered various types of development, both for high head and medium head schemes, and the decision to proceed with the particular development of Poulaphouca and Golden Falls was taken after full examination of all the factors involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1941, a memorandum was submitted on behalf of the Spanish engineer mentioned in the question. This memorandum outlined the scheme for a high head development, which, in the opinion of the board's technical staff, was less favourable than the other high head development schemes <Col N="740" /> examined and already rejected and, in the circumstances, independent technical advice was not considered necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from the Minister's answer that the technical draft proposals were good, at least in so far as technical ability was concerned. My purpose in putting that question was to follow it by asking whether, if the Minister received a further scheme indicating means whereby the Shannon scheme could be so improved as to permit the output of an additional 100,000 kilowatts with only labour power, he would have representations considered.</P>

      <P>I certainly would consider it, but I think the Deputy is misinformed in that regard.  There is, in fact, very little which can be done to improve the output of the Shannon, even assuming that the work could be done in time and the materials suitable were available.  A very small addition could be made to the Shannon storage, but on an entirely uneconomic basis.  It certainly could not be done in time to affect the supply of electricity during the emergency, nor would it alter to a substantial extent the potential output of the Shannon station.  There were many other schemes, somewhat similar to that submitted by the Spanish engineer, submitted by various Continental contractors and technical experts but the type of development which these schemes represented was rejected in favour of another type of development which was considered more feasible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware, this is the first country to adopt a State scheme for meeting the problem of &ldquo;wet-time&rdquo; in the building industry.  The scheme is embodied in the Insurance (Intermittent Unemployment) Act, 1942, benefits under which became payable as from the 28th June, 1943.  The inauguration and progress of the scheme have been remarkably smooth.  Its operation is being closely watched by my Department with the view of ascertaining whether any amendments are desirable, but no serious defects have so far come to light.  I am satisfied that the Act is being administered in accordance with the original purpose.  No complaints have been received, but there have been many informal expressions of satisfaction.</P>
      <P>The Act provides procedure for the settlement of disputed questions as to title to supplementary benefit.  The number of such questions has been comparatively small.  In all but four cases, the recommendations made by courts of referees on questions referred to them have been unanimous.  In each of the four cases referred to, the question was whether the stoppage of work was unavoidable owing to inclement weather.  The majority recommendation was that it was not and that supplementary benefit be disallowed. In each case the workers' representative on the court disagreed.  The insurance officer has accepted the majority recommendation in one case and supplementary benefit has accordingly been disallowed.  If the trade union to which the worker belongs is dissatisfied with this determination, it has a right of appeal to the umpire. The other three cases have not yet been determined.  I am satisfied in these cases that there has been no avoidable delay.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy has any matter in mind not covered by this reply, I should be glad to have particulars.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>My purpose in putting down this question was to draw attention to certain complaints, especially <Col N="742" /> in regard to the determination as to whether the weather was such as to justify a stoppage of work or not. There are many cases where the determination seems to be a matter of the employer's opinion, which seems to be accepted by the court of referees. I think that some other form of machinery might be devised, in order to prevent any likelihood of an actual stoppage of work over the grievances of the men being denied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The four cases in which there was not an unanimous recommendation related to the question whether the inclement weather justified the stoppage of work for the whole day.  In one case, the workers did not appear for work at all, although the weather cleared up an hour after work would normally have started.  In another case, the weather cleared up at mid-day, but the workers had gone home and were not available for work in the afternoon.  It is on this type of case that the question of a decision as to whether the stoppage of work was due to inclement weather or not has arisen.  In one case a final determination has been made, and in that case the union concerned can exercise a right of appeal to the umpire, but no appeal has yet been lodged.  It will take some time to get a series of decisions on record for the guidance of the officers administering the Act in future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if it is correct that the new wing to St. Bricin's Hospital is being built by members of Oglaigh na hEireann, performing the work usually carried out by civilian building trade workers, but receiving only their normal rates of Army pay, and if he will indicate the policy of his Department on the question of the utilisation of members of Oglaigh na hEireann to perform work normally carried out by civilian employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Owing to the extreme urgency of providing accommodation at St. Bricin's Hospital for Army tuberculosis patients awaiting transfer to civilian sanatoria, the work referred to is being carried out mainly by Engineer Field Company personnel, who receive special additional pay in respect of their trade qualifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="751" /> The normal policy is that members of Oglaigh na hEireann are employed on field engineer works, whilst civilians employed under the supervision of the Corps of Engineers are utilised on barrack maintenance.  Works of the nature referred to by the Deputy are normally carried out by contract.</P>
    <P>Experience has shown that works of this nature can be carried out more expeditiously by Engineer Field Company personnel who are trained specially for rapid engineering work in the field.  Suitable opportunities must also be taken to employ such personnel at their trades in order to maintain their proficiency and to secure some return for the special trade pay which they receive.</P>
    <P>A certain number of civilian workmen will, however, be employed on a later stage of the construction work at St. Bricin's Hospital.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to take it that this particular construction work would normally be carried out by civilian labour but that, in addition to the question of having it completed in a hurry, two other factors enter, first, the desire to keep the members of the engineering unit in training and, second, to take advantage of the rates of pay related to trade qualifications? This indicates a new departure on the part of the Department.  At the time when this wing was commenced, there were from 1,900 to 2,000 building workers idle in Dublin.  On the occasion when it was suggested that we should use the Army lorries to draw turf we were told that no members of the Army could be spared even for an urgent emergency job.  Now we find that they can be spared to replace civilian workers who are idle and obliged to attend the labour exchange.</P>

      <P>Deputies new to the House should realise that Question Time is not a time for entering into debate.  A Deputy may, at the discretion of the Chair, ask supplementary questions arising out of the Minister's reply.  A Deputy may not make a speech in further reply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The urgency of the matter made a decision imperative in that particular case.  The House, on many occasions, pressed me to get on with the construction of such a building, and in order to expedite the completion of the building I issued an instruction&mdash;I have a perfect right to do so&mdash;that the work should be carried out by military personnel.  It is a fact that as the building nears completion there will be a large number of skilled tradesmen employed to do the finishing work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not realise that it is not calculated to promote harmony if a number of building trade workers join the Army for the duration of the war and their services are then utilised, whilst in the Army, to deprive civilian craftsmen of the opportunity of carrying out work which would be normally carried out by such civilian craftsmen?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister say that any real difficulty would have been experienced in making these additions to Saint Bricin's Hospital if building workers who are registered every day at the exchange were utilised on the basis of three shifts to carry out the work the Minister states was so urgent?  Is it not strange that this work should be carried out by soldiers when building trade workers are parading to the exchange in search of work which they cannot get and which is available in the Army?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy's remark is completely unjustified.  The members of the engineering units are engaged to go wherever there are works of military importance to be carried out.  We do not consult with contractors or with Deputies or anyone else as to whom we will send when work of that nature arises.  The urgency of getting this building completed, I have already informed the Deputy, was the reason I made the decision to get military personnel to carry it out and I say the work will be completed in at least half the time it would otherwise take.</P>

      <P>The Land Commission have provided four new pumps for the use of their allottees on the Malone estate at Newhaggard.  The wells are sunk to the most suitable depth, and there have been no complaints that they are going dry.  Numerous samples of water from each well were taken for analysis.  The reports of the analyst on samples taken last month show evidence of harmful organic pollution in one case in which the pump was not being used&mdash;in fact, the condition of the water may be due to lack of use of the pump.  It is intended to pump out and treat this well with a view to clearing the water.</P>

      <P>There are only one or two other matters that I would like to ask the Minister to say something about in his reply.  One is in connection with the administration of the sum of £230,000 provided for grants towards the provision of supplementary allowances to old age pensioners and blind pensioners.  I would like the Minister or his Parliamentary Secretary, whoever is responsible personally for supervising the expenditure of this money, to state the number of applications for these allowances to date, the average time taken to deal with these applications before a decision is come to and whether he is satisfied that the payment of the sum should be continued through the agency of the local authority. When an application of that kind is made I would like to know whether the old age pension file is in the possession of the Department of Local Government or of the Revenue Commissioners and whether the files dealing with the payment of an old age pension or a blind pension are passed on automatically to the local authority whenever an application is made for a supplementary allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am of the opinion that this scheme should be administered by a central authority, because there must be some unnecessary delay between the date when the application is made to the local home assistance officer and the date when the claim is finally disposed of.  The allowance is certainly necessary, but I think it should be provided as an addition in view of the increased cost of living which is not likely to fall for a long period of years.  The allowance should be given as a right to the persons concerned and they should not be asked to go through the machinery <Col N="758" /> of the local authority to prove that they are in a destitute state before they receive a supplementary allowance to meet the increase in the cost of living.  The Government has given that allowance to meet the increase in the cost of living and if 12/6 is considered a right and proper figure for certain sections of the old age pensioners and blind pensioners instead of 10/- in pre-emergency days then that increased figure should be given as a right without a condition that the persons concerned must prove they are destitute.  I would like to have the figure of the cost of the allowances.</P>

      <P>The Minister will have time to reply to the queries that are raised.  Shortly after the emergency arose in this country the Minister's predecessor issued a circular to local authorities in certain counties&mdash;I presume to county officials in every county &mdash;urging that, if they were unable to build cottages on plots that were made available at that time for the purpose, these plots should be acquired, fenced and given to temporary tenants for the purpose of helping to increase food production.  I know of a number of cases in the two counties in my constituency where land was freely offered and taken over by the local authority for the purpose of providing suitable housing accommodation for deserving applicants, which land is still available and which the local authority could have given to temporary tenants for the purpose of providing food for themselves and their families.  I ask the Minister to indicate if he holds the view held by his predecessor on this matter, and to say what progress if any has been made, taking the country as a whole, in getting local authorities to acquire and fence these cottage plots and hand them over to tenants who would be willing to use them for the purpose of producing food for themselves and their families.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephHallide" hpid="Mr. Halliden Mr. Halliden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halliden</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say on behalf of the members of this Party that we regard the position in connection with tuberculosis as unsatisfactory.  In the period from 1927 to 1937 there was a very definite decline in the death rate from tuberculosis in practically every country in Europe, with the exception of Éire.  In Italy there was a decline of 2.3 per cent.; in Sweden, a decline of 4 per cent.; in England and Wales a decline of practically 4 per cent. There was an increase in the incidence of the disease in Éire.  That is a very serious matter, and while very laudable private efforts have been made to stamp out the disease, the Minister should embark on a very comprehensive scheme with a very definite programme to stamp out the disease, or, at least, to prevent its further spread.  We know very well that the problems of malnutrition, poor clothing, bad housing and <Col N="760" /> all the other contributory factors in tuberculosis are not adequately tackled.  There is another aspect of this problem that has come to my notice.  It is that persons suffering from this disease will not subject themselves to medical treatment because of the fear that they may be obliged to go to a sanatorium, or to rest for a period during which very little if any efforts will be made to help their dependents. That is a matter that should be inquired into also.</P>
      <P>With regard to rates, it is our opinion that the present system of levying rates is inequitable.  The poorer counties are obliged to pay for all their services in the same way as the rich counties.  In the poorer counties there are, naturally, more demands on the rates, more poor people looking for outdoor relief or public assistance, more people seeking hospital treatment and other amenities.  All these charges must be met by the local rates, with the result that it is in the counties that can least afford it that the rates may be the highest.  I think a more equitable system should be devised and an effort made to meet that situation by paying more of the rates from revenue.</P>
      <P>There is the question of roads.  Now that the roads are being extensively used by Great Southern Railways lorries and buses we believe that roads as well as hospitals should be made a national charge, and that arrangement would be far more equitable in the long run.</P>
      <P>There is a great shortage of housing in the rural areas.  I notice with great satisfaction that in one particular district, North Cork, a very extensive scheme of housing has been started, but unfortunately there is not a sufficient number of these houses being built in the rural areas; they are more or less confined to the towns.  That is a pity because I feel that this has the effect of taking more of the people away from the land and bringing them into the vicinity of towns where they hope to get work but find themselves after a very short time on the unemployed roll.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is a pity that many relief schemes in the rural area have been <Col N="761" /> rejected on the ground that there are not sufficient people available at the employment exchange to carry on the work.  There are a great many districts where the sons of small farmers would be very pleased to carry out that work.  Of course, they are not eligible to be entered on the unemployment register.  I think no relief scheme should be turned down until it is properly investigated.  It should not be turned down on the plea that there are not sufficient men on the unemployment register.  It has come to my knowledge that at least three or four relief schemes have been rejected in districts where the sons of small farmers would be very glad to get to work and have the necessary works done.</P>
    <P>I may tell the Minister that old age pensioners are very disappointed by the way in which the old age pension is being administered.  The additional half-crown was viewed with great satisfaction but the conditions governing the payment of that half-crown have caused despair.  It is a pity that such regulations should be imposed in the matter of giving these people that small addition to their paltry pensions.</P>
    <P>I was rather amazed that the Minister, when introducing his Estimate, should issue a threat to county councils. I think that is very unfortunate. I have very long experience of the work of county councils and of the unselfish services they have rendered to the country, year in year out, without reward of any kind.  When the Minister says that county councils may be abolished now without any inquiry whatever, it is in my view a very ungrateful and very unwise pronouncement. I hope the Minister will withdraw that statement because it has created a good deal of consternation throughout the country.  Other matters have been touched upon but I do not wish to go into them beyond saying that I would like that the few points that I have raised would receive the Minister's very careful and sympathetic consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Deputies in the appeal made for increased hospital accommodation.  I <Col N="762" /> would like to give some of the Deputies a little information about the arrangements that we have made in County Wicklow for the treatment of patients on the waiting list for institutional attention.  Having had considerable experience of the treatment of tubercular cases, from the working of the committees in the county, but for the past two years deprived by the County Managerial Act of direct contact with the patients in the hospitals and institutions, we made a recommendation to the county manager that pending admission of early cases into a sanatorium the county manager would arrange to send these patients to Newcastle Sanatorium for special treatment by the experts there.  I am glad to say that as a result of this two cases that I know personally were treated in the early stages and one returned to his work after 13 weeks' treatment, while the second had only to spend 13 weeks after the time came for his admission and he was advised by the doctor to take a rest in his home for a month. That was a direct result of treatment being given in the early stages.  I believe that if this system was extended to other counties so that experts could give dispensary treatment or otherwise in the patient's home pending institutional treatment we might not be long in arresting this terrible disease.  I believe that with co-operation between the Red Cross and other public men on these lines we would be able to get a solution of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to draw the Minister's attention to a very serious position in regard to old age pensions in rural areas.  I understand there is only £4,050 given in County Wicklow which is one-third of the amount required to give the extra 2/6 to old people in rural areas.  The county manager estimated that he would want at least £15,000 to give all persons in receipt of old age pensions the extra 2/6.  The relieving officers made their inquiries and their reports but they were bound to interpret a necessitous case only as a person with no other means.  If an old age pensioner happens to have a son working or drawing unemployment assistance he is deprived of receiving that <Col N="763" /> extra payment.  That is a cause of great confusion in the rural areas.  I say you should give the extra 2/6 to every person in receipt of 10/- in the rural areas.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the Minister's attention especially to the fact that there are 124 houses idle in Arklow for the past 12 months.  The Arklow Urban Council, not Fianna Fáil or Labour members, but members representing the ratepayers, recommended to the Department of Local Government that they should be permitted to reduce the rent to a figure which they considered the incoming tenants would be able to pay.  The rent suggested, I think, was 5/- a week, including rates, as the majority of the persons who would occupy these houses would be in receipt of national health or home assistance only.  They would not be in a position to pay any more.  There is a conflict about the position; the Department want the rent to be fixed at 5/- plus 2/6 for rates, and while that is going on the houses are idle, and have been idle for the past six months. A standstill Order has been made preventing the tenants from occupying the houses, and the result is, according to the report of the county manager, the rates have so far lost about £600 owing to the Government not coming to agreement with the urban council. The Government says that in the interests of the ratepayers these tenants should pay 7/6 a week, and the council is opposed to that step because they believe the people are not able to pay that.  Notwithstanding this, the Government has done nothing but allow the houses to remain idle.  I ask the Minister to allow the council to set these houses at a rent which the tenants can afford to pay.</P>
    <P>Another point I would like to put before the Minister is the question of bonuses.  He grants a certain amount of bonus to married men, and a certain amount to single men.  In many cases it has come to my knowledge that some single men have an aged mother or father dependent upon them.  They are prevented from receiving the bonus although they have the degree of responsibility which entitled the married person to it.  I think that the Minister <Col N="764" /> should waive the Order, and permit county managers to give bonuses to single men with dependents.  Another matter I want to raise concerns employees of local boards and councils. We have been promised pensions for a long time.  I think the Minister should give pensions to all employees of local authorities.  I know one case of a man who has given 31 years' local service to a public body, but now he has nothing except 15/- a week insurance.  In a case like that, where a labourer has given 31 years' service, I cannot see why there should not be a pension, the same as for a salaried member of the staff who has a gratuity or pension.</P>
    <P>In connection with the allocation of milk, the Minister is only granting the same amounts of money to public bodies now as he did in former years, although the price of milk has increased. Therefore, there are smaller quantities of milk being allocated.  I think consideration should be taken of the price of milk and that that factor should govern the amount of the grant.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that we produced a considerable quantity of turf in Wicklow and that a lot of it was done, as I advocated for years, by piece work. Some of the Deputies mentioned £3 per week.  They might be surprised to learn that men working at Sally Gap are receiving much higher wages than that and there have been no strikes there.  We instructed our county manager to make an arrangement with the employees when he was in a position to give a bonus.  The result is that we got a very good return.  With fine weather, therefore, we should be able to put out much more turf than last year, and I hope there will be no complaints from the various districts in the country and that we will be able to supply the people with the turf required. I hope that, with the co-operation of all sections of public-minded men, together with the Red Cross Society, we shall try to do what we can, pending the provision of sufficient accommodation, to alleviate the distress amongst those suffering from tuberculosis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to pay a tribute to the Minister for Local <Col N="765" /> Government and his predecessor for what they did for housing in my area. We succeeded in getting a large number of houses built there and in eliminating a very ugly condition of affairs in regard to housing.  Now, however, a second problem has arisen with which I should like to deal.  Under a non-municipal scheme of housing in the south-east Cork area some 200 houses were built which have taken the place of slum dwellings, stables converted into houses, and other houses of that description.  The occupants of these houses were paying 3/-, 4/- and 5/- per week for them.  In a number of cases they were people who were in very bad circumstances and were depending on home assistance.  Others of them had been evicted out of rooms in the city because they were unable to pay the rent of them.  When this scheme went through and the building started I had occasion to go to the then Minister for Local Government, the present Minister's predecessor, in connection with an increase of subsidy.  In a letter which the Minister sent me he stated that the proposed rent of the houses was 3/- per week.  The building of the houses met with a lot of opposition from a section of the board of health and when the rents were being fixed afterwards they fixed a rent of 8/- a week, plus rates.  That matter was referred on appeal to the then Minister for Local Government, who fixed the rent at 7/9, plus rates.  We have a situation, therefore, in which men who were evicted because they could not pay 5/- per week, were taken out of hovels and put in decent houses and now have to pay a rent of 7/9, plus rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These men find it absolutely impossible to pay that rent.  That has been going on for the last three or four years. I have before me a return from the county manager for May, 1944, showing that the arrears of rent on the 1st April, 1943, amounted to £2,614 8s. 5d. and on the 31st March, 1944, to £4,071 3s. 4d., an increase of £1,456 in arrears of rent on something like 200 houses.  That matter has been brought from the District Court to the Circuit Court; from the Circuit Court to the High Court, and from the High Court <Col N="766" /> to the Supreme Court and back again for a number of years.  Portion of the rents, I understand, is being paid to local solicitors to fight the cases.</P>
    <P>I endeavoured later on to introduce a purchase scheme for these people and then the same gentlemen who had insisted on the paying of this exorbitant rent came along and, although under the labourer's cottage purchase scheme people get a 25 per cent. reduction, they fixed the reduction under this scheme at 10 per cent., thus closing the last loophole which these people had of getting justice.  The ratepayers of the county may now throw their hats at getting that £4,000 arrears of rent. That money is gone for good.  The rates are not being paid on the houses and that condition of affairs will continue to exist until the appeals which have been made from time to time to the Minister to have some definite inquiry into the position are acceded to, with a view to having rents fixed which will be within the capacity of the people to pay.  I have no sympathy for a man earning £6 or £7 per week who happens to be in one of these houses.  I say that he should not be in it.  The houses were built for a specific purpose.  They were not built for men with £6 or £7 per week.  But I have sympathy for the unfortunate people with 30/- per week or, in some cases, 15/- or 16/- per week home assistance who have to endeavour to pay a rent of 7/9, plus rates for these houses.  I should like the Minister to take the matter in hand because it is very unjust.</P>
    <P>The next matter I want to deal with is the position of the people living in houses in Gurranebraher, Spangle Hill, and Horgan's Buildings.  These people were removed to these areas as a result of a slum clearance in the city by the corporation authorities.  The people living in these houses, which are owned by the Cork Corporation, are deprived of the ordinary rights of citizens.</P>

      <P>That is the situation that exists down there.  Last year, I brought this matter before the Department <Col N="768" /> of Local Government, and then we had suggestions as to the extending of the boundaries.  Within the last month, however, I have seen where the Minister has abolished a county council because they did not do certain things which, certainly, they have a right to do.  Surely to heavens, if it is sauce for a county council to be abolished, it ought to be sauce for the city manager.  If it is sauce for a county council to be punished for alleged delinquency, it ought to be sauce to deal with the city manager in the same way.  We have a situation, in the area to which I am referring, in which something like 3,000 families are affected.  Now, that is a very big item, and, surely, instead of raising an argument, as between a county council or the Corporation of Cork and the city manager&mdash;or the two city managers, as there are at present&mdash;a five years' argument, as it happens, there should be no difficulty in introducing an Emergency Powers Order to make all corporation property and all tenants of corporation property entitled to their rights as citizens within the borough.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There should be no trouble in doing that, and I think we should eliminate this age-long difficulty.  It is all very well for the Minister to tell me that this matter of the borough boundaries is a question for the corporation or the county council. There is no use in telling me that, when it comes to a question of where bread is to be provided for children. That, in my opinion, is a matter that will have to be settled, because those unfortunate families cannot live in the terrible conditions under which they have to exist at the moment.  I say that it is a nullification of the Constitution of this State.  If the Constitution of this State sets out that there should be equal rights for all citizens of this State, and if you have a number of people in, say, a terrace of houses&mdash;let us say, one man in No. 11 of the terrace, and another man in No. 14 of the same terrace&mdash; both paying the same rent, but each with different commitments in regard <Col N="769" /> to their income and the number of children they have, where does the equality come in in that case?  Again, there is the question of city management. Last year, under an Emergency Powers Order, tenants of those houses &mdash;workingmen&mdash;were entitled to go before a tribunal to seek for a bonus on their wages.  Some of these men went before that tribunal and got an increase, but owing to the increased cost of living, owing to the increase in the price of bread and other necessaries of life, which were essential for the upbringing of their little children, the increased bonus that they got meant nothing.  They got an increase in their wages of 4/-, 5/-, or even 6/- a week, but as soon as they got that increase the city manager immediately pounced upon the money that was given to these people, which they hoped to use in order to buy bread and other necessaries for their children, and extracted 2/- or 2/6 a week in increased rent as a result of their increased income.  If it is thought fit to deal with a county council in a certain manner because of alleged extravagance, or, on the other hand, parsimony, is it not also fit to deal with a city manager if he takes what, in the opinion of many people, is an unjust action?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have another problem facing us in my constituency, which has a bearing on the very same problem, and that is that on the 1st August next, owing to the manner in which the Minister has carried out the duties of his Department and the manner in which this Dáil has sanctioned it, we shall have the Children's Allowance Act coming into force.  Now, that is the first Act that will do justice to these outlaws, as one might call them, in the hinterland to which I have referred&mdash;outlaws in the sense that they are outside the city limits.  Now, for the first time, they will gain something.  I remember that, up to recently, in connection with many of these houses in the outlying districts, you would have to move almost a few tons of stuff from before the door of the house before you could get into it, but now, when these unfortunate people will be given a few shillings a week for their children, the city manager will move in again and <Col N="770" /> extract, from these half-crowns which are allocated by the State for the support of the little babies in these households, his pound of flesh.  Again, I should like to call the attention of the House to the fact that under our Constitution equal rights are supposed to be guaranteed for all our citizens.  I was called to order, Sir, a few days ago, when I attempted to deal with this matter in connection with the Finance Bill.  I had pointed out that under Section 4 of that Bill, which we were discussing at the moment, children's allowances would not be taken into consideration in connection with the payment of income-tax or surtax. Surely to heavens, such things should not be taken into consideration in the case of a poor little baby whose parents have not even sufficient to provide that baby with ordinary nourishment.  If there is to be a law for the rich, then surely there should be a law for the poor also.  I want a very definite statement this evening from the Minister with regard to the powers of that city manager in respect of social legislation that was introduced into this House and passed by this House for the benefit of the poor.  If we have it in the Constitution that there should be equal rights for all citizens, and if we have special legislation put through this House, under which a man, paying income-tax, is not liable to have children's allowances paid to him taken into consideration for the purpose of assessing income-tax or surtax, surely to heavens, if there is any question of right or equality of citizenship, we have to take into consideration the case of the unfortunate man who has no income, who is probably living on home assistance, and surely that man is entitled to get that allowance for his children free from the griping hand of the city manager.</P>
    <P>This matter has gone too far.  I may tell the Minister that the area down there is in a state of incipient rebellion. It is not a question of a &ldquo;No rates&rdquo; or &ldquo;No rent&rdquo; campaign, but throughout the whole of that district there is a state of incipient rebellion, which should not exist and would not exist, were it not for the sense of injustice <Col N="771" /> under which those unfortunate people are suffering.  I may say that they have my sympathy and that, so far as I can, I shall give them my help in any fight they have to make, one way or the other, in this matter.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to prolong the discussion, but I should like to call attention to yet another aspect of the question, namely, the burden that is placed on the ratepayers of the county in having to make up for these families the difference between the city rate and the county rate of unemployment assistance. The city manager visits the houses and gets the rents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no rates paid. No rates were paid there for the last ten years.  If they get justice they will pay rates, but until they get justice I hope they will not pay.  We are faced with a position there in which an unfair and an unjust burden is thrown on the county ratepayers as a result of having to make up the difference between the city rate and the county rate of an unemployment assistance each week, and of having to pay 8/- to each recipient in respect of vouchers as well.  That results in putting an extra burden of £150 or £200 each week on the county ratepayers in respect of that area alone.  Surely, when that injustice could be wiped out by one small action on the part of the Minister, we are entitled to expect that the Minister, who has proved in this House that he has sympathy with the poor, and who has introduced legislation benefiting the poor, is not going to leave that blot on our legislation, that he will see that the poor will get the benefit of the legislation which he introduced for their benefit, and that 50 per cent. of it is not going to be grabbed by the city manager, who apparently has neither heart, soul, nor conscience.  I do not wish to delay the House longer, but these are two matters that to my mind constitute a running sore and an evil in a large portion of my constituency.  I do not wish to be put to the necessity of coming up here month after month in an <Col N="772" /> endeavour to get justice for these people.  I would appeal to the Minister to let us know definitely this evening what he intends to do in regard to these matters.  If we cannot get justice here, we shall have to try to get it by some means other than through this House.</P>

      <P>I listened with 80 per cent. satisfaction to the speech of Deputy Corry.  It is said that there is more joy in heaven for the one sinner who repenteth&mdash;well, Deputies all know the Scriptural quotation.  I welcome the Deputy's conversion for more than one reason.  Deputy Corry however, knows that according to constitutional practice in every Parliament in the world, there is a certain alternative open to him.  It is not surprising to me, by the way, but it still gives me a kind of thrill when I hear Deputy Corry making a speech against the Government, although voting with them.  We know the alternative and Deputy Corry must know it.  He is not so blandly innocent as he pretends to be.  There is a certain method open to him although he pretends not to follow constitutional methods on all occasions. It all depends on the audience he is addressing.  He had the alternative of putting down an amendment, or he could move the reference back of the Estimate, but he has not the guts to do so.</P>

      <P>I am addressing myself to a number of gentlemen who know how to conduct themselves.  The Deputy must conduct himself or leave the House.  Of course we disgraced ourselves in the last couple of weeks through the conduct of people like Deputy Corry.  As I say, he had an alternative but I shall not pursue that matter as the Deputy has left the House.  There are, however, one or two matters in regard to which I should like to put some suggestions before the Minister.  I do not want to cause the Minister too much trouble because I know that previous speakers have already covered certain matters on <Col N="773" /> which I should like to speak.  I would ask the Minister, however, to take into consideration a matter to which I referred some time ago.  I then contrasted two types of citizens.  There is on the one hand, the provident, the prudent and the good citizen, who because of his prudence and providence, paid a sum of 1/4 or 1/8 per week into a trades union organisation, a provident society or some kindred association that would enable him at the end of a certain period, usually about 40 years, to provide for his old age a superannuation of 15/- or 16/- a week.  Such men were model citizens in every way, the backbone of the State and under our legislation would be entitled in the ordinary way to a State pension.  Contrast them with the man who has been before the courts on numerous occasions, a charge on local and the national funds in so far as he is in and out of casual wards, and in so far as he has come under the notice of the judiciary or police and has been in jail on many occasions for beating up somebody, burglary or some other crime of that sort.  That man, on attaining the age of 70 years of age, gets a full pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have cases in Cork City of a number of men who are corporation employees.  I know that I may not advocate legislation in a discussion on Estimates, but I do feel that I am not seriously transgressing the rules of order in asking the Minister on some future date to give some consideration to this question of corporation employees. I have been a lord mayor and I am still an alderman of Cork Corporation. From day to day we have to witness humble men being deprived of their employment under the corporation because they have attained the age of 70.  They get then 10/- a week as a corporation pension and, because of that, they are entitled to only 6/- from the State as pension.  The corporation, of course, could say: &ldquo;We will give these men only 6/- a week and the State will then have to pay 10/-.&rdquo;  I would ask the Minister to consider carefully the position of these men because it is causing a good deal of annoyance and quite an amount of hardship amongst a large number of <Col N="774" /> these old employees, some of whom have given 40 years' faithful service. We are not legally entitled to give them a penny.  The history of these cases goes back many years.  I do not want to go into all the details but it appears that many years ago when the corporation made several grants, the local government auditor of that time under the British régime challenged these items.  He found that he had to go back so far that it would cost the corporators many thousands of pounds if they were to be surcharged.  What he did suggest was to raise the lord mayor's salary by practically the amount which would cover all these grants or gifts.  That was done; it was simply a matter of accountancy.  We are now in the position in Cork that we have a number of old employees, some of them with 40 or 50 years' service. We cannot grant them pensions because we are afraid that the local government auditor will come down upon us.  I hope the Minister will consider these cases, because whatever differences I have had with the Minister from time to time I feel that he is just.  I hope he will sympathetically consider the matter I have mentioned in regard to introducing some kind of legislation that will regularise the position as far as we are concerned in Cork City.</P>
    <P>With regard to blind pensions, I have several cases which have arisen over the last 12 months or longer of which this case is indicative.  I do not want to give names, but I have the case of a poor old lady who had a blind pension of 6/- and whose husband had a blind pension of 10/-.  Her pension was stopped because her son, who had gone to England, sent her 30/- at Christmas, and three or four months previously had also sent her 30/-.  Since Christmas, however, she has not received one penny, but her blind pension has been cut off.  There is something wrong there.  I know that the application of a means test is rather difficult, and I know it is hard to fix a limit and to decide where finality comes.  One person will say it should be £1, and the late Deputy Dowdall suggested that it should be fixed at £2.  I quite realise that it would cost money, but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not intend to delay the House with matters which might be dealt with in the local authorities but rather with matters on which the local authorities are in conflict in principle with the Ministry. One is the very vexed question of the Spangle Hill area.  It has been dealt with by many speakers, and I do not intend to deal with it by way of threat, as I think threats are not at all in order here.  The Minister is quite well aware of the difficulties in connection with these people in the Spangle Hill, Gurranebraher and Horgan's Buildings areas.  All these people are workers in the City of Cork, and particularly those in the Spangle Hill and Gurranebraher areas, and they are living outside the city, not through any act of their own, but as a matter of the convenience of the Cork Corporation.  They have been for generations workers in the City of Cork, but they are now not entitled to city benefit and are subject to Employment Period Orders as agricultural workers.  That is a gross injustice.  It must be remembered that they and their employers have been paying into the Unemployment Insurance Fund. Their money and the employers' contribution have gone into the fund and <Col N="776" /> the City of Cork rates are made liable for a sum of 1/6 in the £.</P>

      <P>On raising this question with the Minister for Industry and Commerce the other night, he said the area in which they live was a matter for Local Government.  Permit me, however, to make my point.  My point is that they, their employers and the City of Cork have been contributing to the Unemployment Fund, the benefits of which are now denied them.  A simple way of settling the question, other than by way of threats or invoking these famous Orders by which anything can be done, is to alter the basis of qualification.  That is a matter for the Minister.  The basis of qualification is mere residence.  Why should it be residence?  In justice, ought it not to be the area in which the operations are performed and in which the contribution is made?  That is a very simple method and it would cut both ways. Any man not working in the city would not be entitled to city unemployment insurance when idle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy misunderstands. A person is paid a flat rate of unemployment insurance, irrespective of where he lives.  He is paid it because, as the Deputy has properly said, he and his employer between them have contributed to building up the Unemployment Insurance Fund.  Unemployment assistance is uncovenanted benefit to which the recipient contributes nothing.  It is paid irrespective of whether he has ever been in insurable occupation or not.  It is payable in respect of the place in which he lives and the fact that he is out of employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite clear on that, but the Minister appears to fail to grasp the point I am making, that <Col N="777" /> the people entitled to unemployment insurance living within the city are not subject to any Employment Period Order which denies them the right to benefit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamJosephBroderi" hpid="Mr. Broderick Mr. Broderick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well; I shall pass from that matter to another which is entirely within the Minister's purview. It was raised by the Lord Mayor of Dublin&mdash;the question of the capitation grant for mental hospitals.  He pointed out how grossly inadequate the present contribution towards the maintenance of mentally afflicted patients was.  I think that, in Cork, the cost amounts to 17/-, towards which we get a contribution from the Ministry of 3/10.  Local authorities have held for a considerable period, and the Department has denied, that in respect of liability for mentally afflicted patients, the words used in the Local Government Act prescribed a 50 per cent. contribution by the national and local authorities.  I readily admit that a maximum of 4/- was fixed, but that was in days when the weekly liability was not more than 7/6 or 8/-.  At a later period, although the wording of the Act set out a 50 per cent. contribution, by a subsequent Act, which was passed for accountancy reasons, because there was such little variation at the time as between the various costs of maintenance, there was an agreement fixing the capitation grant at 4/-, but in our view that did not get away from the original wording of the Act of Parliament which established the liability of national and local authorities as to 50 per cent., apart altogether from the extraordinary injustice of the State now contributing only 3/10 while a local authority must contribute five times as much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the plea put forward by the Lord Mayor of Dublin and hope that the Minister will review this matter and see that a more equitable allowance for the maintenance of the mentally afflicted is made.  The history of the case is as I have given it. <Col N="778" /> The original provision was 50 per cent. at a time when the average cost was 7/6 to 8/-.  Undoubtedly, 4/- was fixed at the time, but the reason was that nowhere was the cost more than 8/- and the Ministry responsible, wishing to avail of any cheaper administration by the local authority than 8/-, prescribed 4/- or any lesser sum. That, however, did not take away at all from the original liability of 50 per cent., and I think the matter is entitled to consideration.</P>
    <P>With regard to the extra half-crown a week granted to old-age pensioners of a particular class and others under the poor law system, a good deal of administrative difficulty has arisen by reason of the fact that persons have to go to the post office to draw the pension and to the home assistance officer, who may live in another area, to draw the extra half-crown. We had cases at the last meeting of the county council and board of health of the entire half-crown having to be spent in bus journeys to draw it. We have made a recommendation to the Minister which I hope he will consider very carefully&mdash;that we as a county council are prepared to accept the liability of the State for the amount of the half-crowns payable, and to let both the pensioners and the recipients of home assistance be paid in the one place, because of the difficulties which I have mentioned. Killeagh, for instance, is seven miles from Youghal.  The home assistance officer lives in Youghal.  The people could draw their pension in the Killeagh Post Office, but if they came into Youghal it would cost them 1/3 each way in the bus to collect the half-crown. If the Minister would accept our suggestion, we are prepared to accept liability for the half-crown.  If the Minister could arrange that the pension officer would pay the increased amount it would save an enormous amount of hardship and loss to the recipients.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasCarter1921" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to consider very kindly some of the suggestions made by the Deputy who has just spoken.  I also want to refer to some of the grievances already <Col N="779" /> spoken to by the Deputy.  I ask the Minister to give very kind consideration to the suggestion that the means test should not be so rigorously enforced, particularly in the case of poor people, some of whom are living in labourers' cottages in my district.  I know cases where labourers, old men of 70 years of age, are granted say, 6/- or 8/- a week, and in one case the plea was put forward that a man was building a clamp of turf for a neighbour. The neighbour might be very useful to him, because in the particular case 6/- or 8/- a week was no good; it would not keep him.  I ask the Minister to see that the means test is not rigorously enforced, particularly in cases like that. Also, in the case of a small farmer who is thrifty and who, say, has a son married in the place and has handed over his bit of property which might amount to 15 acres, I ask that he be allowed the 10/- per week.  I could quote several instances like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next matter I should like to mention is the case of poor widows who are drawing a non-contributory pension.  Those people are getting 5/- a week, and when the home assistance officer comes along he tells them they are not eligible because they have no family.  Some of those poor old women are in desperate straits at the moment. I know that we are trying to do the best we can, but those are the kind of people we should assist.  Those old women are not able to support themselves. Some people may say that they should be able to do a bit of charing if they live near a small town. I know some of them who live at the back of the hill, miles from a town, and but for the charity of their neighbours 5/- a week would be no good to them.  Their sons may be in England and have forgotten them.  Their daughters may have gone away and forgotten them also.  Those poor old women are coming to me not in fives or sixes but in dozens and twenties to see what I can do for them.  I know that the Minister is kind, and I take this opportunity of asking him to give sympathetic consideration to this matter.  With regard to blind pensions, I have received numerous complaints <Col N="780" /> from applicants&mdash;I do not know whether they are all eligible or not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In the case of applicants for blind pensions in my district, the oculist comes to Athlone.  A person living 50 miles away may be asked to come to Athlone.  I want the Minister to consider the suggestion that the oculist should be asked to go to the post office in the district where the applicants live.  The applicants have no way of travelling long distances.  There are no convenient buses at the moment, and a donkey and cart would take a long time to travel 35 or 40 miles.  The oculist could travel to five or six post offices in a day, and he might deal with two or three applicants in each district.  It is the people I am interested in&mdash;not the oculist.  He is paid, I dare say, by the Department.</P>
      <P>With regard to the extra 2/6 which is being paid by the assistance officer, if the suggestion is made to him by the various councils concerned, I am sure he would be in a position to meet the applicants at the various post offices on a particular day.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity that the Minister, in his opening statement, in which he reviewed the position so far as local government in this country is concerned, saw fit to include certain threats.  He dealt with the attitude of the Roscommon County Council, and <Col N="781" /> told the Dáil and all concerned that in future he would take advantage of the Emergency Order enabling him to abolish a council without going through what I call the farce of an inquiry. I do not think that would be much loss, because I am perfectly satisfied that, in the case of any inquiry which is held, the Minister and his Department have already made up their minds as to what they are going to do.  I have never yet seen an inquiry in a case similar to that of the Roscommon County Council in which the Minister took any action other than to dissolve the council.</P>
      <P>Various aspects of local government have been touched upon during the last couple of days, and I think the most important one is the question of dealing with tuberculosis.  It is a very sad state of affairs when the Minister has to come to the House and tell us that tuberculosis is on the increase, notwithstanding the fact that a good deal of propaganda for its eradication has been carried on throughout the country over a number of years.  To my mind, the principal reason for the increase of tuberculosis at the present time is the poverty of the people, due to the fact that another Minister in this Government prevented workers from securing increases in their wages during the emergency. That was done despite the fact that in many cases employers were prepared to concede increases to their workers.  Because of that the people are now living in hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A lot of talk has centered around the fact that numbers of people refrain from taking advantage of sanatorium treatment.  I think that is largely due to the fact that bread-winners know that if they leave their families to take advantage of that treatment, their families will be in absolute hardship while they are away.  A man suffering from tuberculosis works very irregularly, as we know, for the reason that he is in a delicate state of health.  In consequence of that, his insurance card is not stamped up to enable him to get full benefit.  When he becomes so ill that he is unable to work, and must go to a sanatorium if <Col N="782" /> he wants to be cured, the amount of benefit that he is entitled to is usually only 7/6 a week.  One cannot expect a man who cares anything about his wife and family to go to a sanatorium leaving them behind to depend on 7/6 a week.  Therefore, if you want to stamp out tuberculosis and to get people to take advantage of sanatorium treatment, you will have to give their families the equivalent of a living wage.  Everybody knows that in the case of people who are not happy and content this disease makes greater progress than it otherwise would.  If a man has to go to a sanatorium knowing that in his absence his wife and family will have only a few shillings a week to live on, he cannot be content or happy, so that in his case the cure offered is worse than the disease. It is because of that that people are not taking advantage of sanatorium treatment and remain too long in their homes, infecting other members of the family.  I believe that if this problem of tuberculosis is to be tackled as it should be, decent wages must be paid either by the Government or local bodies to the family of a man while he is getting treatment in a sanatorium. The family should certainly be given the equivalent of a living wage.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in the course of his statement, dealt at length with the question of housing.  He, and everybody else, knows that at the present time very little housing is being carried out in consequence of the greatly increased cost of building.  That has been responsible for putting the country back four or five years.  To the credit of this Government it must be said that up to the outbreak of the war they did make serious efforts to tackle the housing problem.  Comparatively decent progress was made, and a good number of houses were built.  Since the outbreak of war, however, very few houses have been built.  Everybody, particularly the members of local authorities, knows that there does not appear to be any prospect of houses being built in the near future.  Even when the war is over, one cannot see much prospect of houses being built. One thing that will militate against <Col N="783" /> that is the availability of building materials.  We all realise that in Britain, on the Continent of Europe, and in other parts of the world there will be big demands for building materials.  One wonders whether, when the war is over, any timber, for example, will arrive in this country.  It is all very well to say that we have native materials.  In my opinion we have not sufficient to enable us to grapple with the housing problem that confronts the country to-day.  There is no use in anybody saying, no matter what efforts we may make, that we will be able to produce enough timber to enable us to grapple with that problem. There is also the question of money. In 1932 and in 1933, under legislation which was passed through the Dáil by the present Government, a subsidy of two-thirds was paid by the Government in the case of a house costing up to £350.  That applied to many towns, such, for example, as Wexford and Enniscorthy in my constituency.  That subsidy enabled the local authority to rent houses at a comparatively decent figure.  I should say that, of course, the local authorities also had to subsidise the cost of these houses.</P>
    <P>The position to-day is that to build a house, such as the local authorities built in 1937 and 1938 for in or about £360, would cost at least £700.  With the help of the grant of two-thirds of the cost given by the Government, the house built by the local authority in 1937 or 1938 could be let at a rent of 6/9½d. per week.  If we take the same house now, and bear in mind the rate of interest at which the Local Loans Fund is prepared to advance money for house building, the rent on the £700 house would be 14/4½d. per week.  I need hardly tell the Minister that there is no use in looking for a rent of 14/4½d. per week from people whom we have taken out of slums and put into these new houses.  If the Minister were prepared to pay a subsidy on the full cost of that house it could be let at 9/4½d. per week, but even so that rent would represent an increase of 3/- per week compared with the rent that was charged for the same house built in 1937 or 1938, the comparative rents being <Col N="784" /> 6/9½d. per week for the latter period, and 9/4½d. at present.  In that situation something will have to be done by the Minister.  In my opinion the Housing Board which was set up by the Department some years ago should be considering problems of this kind.</P>
    <P>There is no use in either the Minister for Local Government and Public Health or the Minister for Finance saying in this House, as they have said on different occasions, that they have no intention of increasing the subsidy for houses built by local authorities.  The position is that the housing problem in this country cannot be tackled unless the subsidy is increased. No local authority will undertake housing to any extent unless that is done.  I am perfectly satisfied, from what I have learned from people engaged in building, that building costs will not come down for a number of years.  Therefore, the position after the war will be as bad as it was about 20 years ago.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have referred to the rents charged for the houses built for slum dwellers.  Everybody knows that in many large towns and cities there are people who had been living in houses rented at 2/- or 2/6 a week. When the new houses were built, those people were taken out of the old houses forcibly.  I am not saying that is wrong, as sometimes one has to save the people from themselves.  However, the rent which they have to pay is anything from 5/- to 6/6, according to pre-war figures.  It would be infinitely more now.  How can those people be expected to pay an increase in rent of that kind?  It is absolutely impossible. The result is that, in the various towns and cities in Ireland, the arrears are accumulating year after year, because of the fact that these people are unable to meet their liabilities in so far as house rent is concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made a very hard and fast rule in regard to grants for housing.  Before a person can be put into a new house, the house in which he or she lives must be condemned as unfit for habitation, or that person must have been living in a house where there were three families.  That <Col N="785" /> is all right so far as it goes, but there is no provision at all being made for people who are newly married.  I am familiar with a few towns and I cannot recall any case in which a young married couple have been given a new house by a council within the last ten or 15 years.  That is a very serious matter, because those who get married go into rooms to live and are rearing young families in those rooms under wretched conditions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>And high rents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, high rents.  The Minister should allow local authorities to give a certain number of the houses built, on which two-thirds subsidy was paid, to young married couples, who should get some encouragement.  If the Minister goes into any town or city, he will find that these young married couples are trying to rear children in an environment which is absolutely terrible.  There should be a little relaxation of the position, so far as the Minister is concerned, and the matter should be carefully examined.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will approach the Minister for Finance now&mdash;without waiting until after the war&mdash;with a view to getting a higher grant towards the cost of housing.  I would also be prepared to advocate that the local authority pay a higher grant in proportion, but at the moment any local authority which is building houses or has built them within recent years has had to pay a grant in some cases as large as that received from the Department.  That aspect of the matter should be dealt with by the Minister or by the Housing Board. The question of materials should also be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Deputies have referred to the half-crown which is supposed to be paid&mdash;and I say &ldquo;supposed&rdquo; advisedly &mdash;to recipients of old age pensions.  I would like the Minister to say why there should be any question at all as to the person who should get this half-crown. The means test has already been applied in the case of the 10/- when the person reached the age of 70. Exhaustive inquiries were then made by the local pensions officer, the claim <Col N="786" /> was examined by the local pensions committee and, if necessary, if there were any contention about it, it was submitted to the Department for examination. The pensioner has in many cases gone through a gruelling time when seeking the 10/- pension, and I do not think it is too much to ask that that half-crown be paid automatically to pensioners.  The present state of affairs is wretched.  It is humiliating to these people, many of whom never had resort to the Poor Law system during their whole lives.  They are decent people who, in many cases, would prefer to go half-hungry rather than seek home help.  They have been given the 10/- pension and should now receive the half-crown without being put to further humiliation and without being asked to sign a form disclosing every aspect of their lives at home. The Minister must have been satisfied that there is hardship amongst many old age pensioners in the country, when he agreed to concede that half-crown a week, and it should now be paid automatically.</P>
    <P>I would add my voice to those of Deputy Martin O'Sullivan, Lord Mayor of Dublin, and Deputy Eroderick, on the question of the grant paid to mental hospitals.  As far as I know the capitation fee paid all over the country is between 3/6 and 4/- a week.  Owing to the difference in the value of money now, there should be a big increase given to the mental hospitals.  They are a huge drain on the ratepayers in any county and the 4/- is worth less than 2/- now. Owing to the cost of foodstuffs having increased in this war and the last war, they have found it very hard to carry on, and it would not be too much to ask the Minister to have the whole matter re-examined.</P>
    <P>The question of blind pensions has been raised by almost every Deputy. I object to the refusal of the Department to take a certificate from any doctor but the doctor appointed by the Department.  In Wexford town there is a doctor who acted as oculist for the Wexford Board of Health for a number of years.  He went up for the position before the Local Appointments Commission but did not get the job, not <Col N="787" /> because he was not qualified.  I suppose the Commission thought the other man better qualified, though I do not agree with that.  This man has repeatedly given certificates of blindness to applicants and they have been turned down, with the result that the applicants now find it impossible to get him to certify them at all.  I think that is very unfair and I am surprised at that happening when we have a medical doctor as one of the Minister's Parliamentary Secretaries.  He should try to safeguard the interests of his professional brethren to a greater extent than he does at present.  I have never yet known an applicant for a blind pension to receive it without an inspector or an oculist being sent down from Dublin to examine him.  That might not be so bad, if it did not take 12 months for the oculist to arrive in the particular district, to examine the patient.  I put a case before the Department a couple of months ago, and in that case the application was made well over 12 months ago; and it was only a few weeks ago that, on my representations, an oculist examined the applicant.  Surely that is very unfair.  When an application is made, if the local pensions committee considers the person is blind, but the Minister's pension officer disagrees, the person should be examined at least within a month.</P>
    <P>I want to complain also about the length of time the Department takes to give a decision on many things.  It is only in recent years that there has been such delay.  It has happened especially in connection with wages. Time and time again during the past two or three years, questions have been tabled here to the Minister, complaining that sanction has not been received by various county councils who have, through the medium of their county manager, agreed to concede to certain increases in wages to their workers. In some cases it has taken six months. I cannot understand why the Department cannot make up its mind to give sanction to a proposal of that kind which is unanimously recommended by a county council and with which the county manager agrees.  If some of <Col N="788" /> the people in this Department were dependent on a decision of that kind, we would get it much more quickly. When it is a question of an unfortunate man with 35/- a week seeking an increase of 3/- or 4/-, sanction is held up for what is, in my opinion, an unreasonable period.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to make reference is concerned with clerical officers in the service of county and municipal councils.  I understand that, for some time, the Minister's Department has had under consideration the question of standardising these positions.  A decision on that matter is keenly awaited.  The salaries paid to clerical officers in some of the county council offices are absolutely disgraceful.  I have in mind the case of a man who would have to be 12 years clerk in the service of a county council before he would receive £3 a week.  This young man is well educated, has the Leaving Certificate and is competent to fill his job.  Surely a man of that type should not have to wait 12 years to receive a salary of £3 a week.  If the Minister is considering the formulation of a scheme which would be suitable to all the counties, I ask him to have it introduced as quickly as possible.  So far as I know, it has been under consideration for two years.  Certain councils were asked to send in model schemes and the Minister and his Department have been considering these.  I hope something will be done very shortly regarding this matter.</P>
    <P>In 1940, an Act was passed which, we were told, would short-circuit the acquisition of land.  I forget the title of the Act but the measure had something to do with the relief of unemployment. Prior to that, many councils had submitted schemes for the widening of roads and such works but they found it impossible to acquire the necessary land within the period which would enable them to introduce schemes for the relief of unemployment at the proper time.  When the measure was going through this House, Deputy Ruttledge, then Minister for Local Government, told us that it would short-circuit the acquisition of land by many months.  I cannot see <Col N="789" /> that it is being applied to any extent. Wexford Corporation put up a proposal three years ago for the construction of a public park there.  In the centre of the town, there are ten acres which would be very suitable for the purposes of a park.  Three or four landlords are involved.  The corporation has written to them on several occasions but cannot get any definite answer from them.  When the Bill which is now an Act was going through in 1940, these were the types of cases which were cited to us by the then Minister as being responsible for the introduction of the measure.  Yet, when we ask the Local Government Department to apply that Act to this scheme, they say it is not applicable. I cannot understand the reason for that because my recollection is that the measure was designed to deal with such cases.  This scheme is necessary in the interests of the citizens, and the land is not so very valuable so far as the owners are concerned.  The labour-content of the work would be about 90 per cent.  It would be an admirable scheme in every way but we have been unable to induce the Minister to apply the Act to which I have referred to the scheme.  I think that the Minister is interested in cases of this kind.  It is probable that he knows the place I am speaking about&mdash;in the centre of the town.  I ask him to have the position specially examined because, apart from the amenities provided by such a park, this would be a splendid scheme for the relief of unemployment because it would have a 90 per cent. labour-content.  I cannot understand why that Act has not been applied. There is a new man at the head of that section now and, perhaps, he will bring a different mind to bear upon it. Again, I ask the Minister to get the housing action of his Department immediately to apply themselves to preparations for the resumption of housing on a large scale when the war ends.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamFrancisODonne" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is many years since the question of T.B. came to my notice.  There are few houses in Eire which have not had their &ldquo;snowy-breasted pearls.&rdquo;  I think that one of <Col N="790" /> the causes of the incidence of this disease is impure water&mdash;that pet topic of mine.  I know the conditions in the valley in which I was born and reared &mdash;between the Galtees and the Knockmealdowns and about 20 miles from Cahir to Mitchelstown.  I know the streams coming from the Galtees and the Knockmealdowns and Slievenamon.  Deputy Heskin would know a good deal about this, also. These streams join the Suir about three miles down along the centre of the valley.  The water from most of these streams is not fit for human consumption.  Yet, the people are depending on that water for drinking purposes.  I know one stream and, for three miles from where it leaves the mountain and enters the Suir, about 25 families are using the water.  About 30 years ago, Sir Charles Cameron, who got samples of it, would not pass it as fit for consumption in the local school.  That is typical of the whole valley.</P>
      <P>Our mountains suffer from a lack of minerals which leads to what is known as Derbyshire neck or goitre.  A lady doctor who was helping the local medical officer in South Tipperary did very good work there for two or three years. She got married lately and she is not now interested in goitre.  That swelling of the neck is peculiar to South Tipperary between the Galtees and Knockmealdowns and likewise Slievenamon. North of Cahir and, from that, to the centre of the valleys where the streams rise out of limestone, they do not suffer from that complaint.  I should like to know if there is any report on that from the medical officer for South Tipperary.  This lady doctor, who had very high credentials, was assisting him and she has been succeeded by another doctor who is carrying on the good work.  It is suggested that the addition of iodine to the water has a good effect in the case of Derbyshire neck.  Quite a lot of young people from 14 to 35&mdash;particularly girls &mdash;suffer from this disease and the operation necessary for removal of the swelling is very dangerous.  I should like to know if good results have followed from the addition of iodine to the water in these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would say that the streams of Ireland, <Col N="791" /> most of them, are little better than polluted sewers.  We must be a healthy race to exist at all.  We must be healthier than the niggers to survive. Something should be done as regards our water supplies.  I am personally well situated so far as a water supply is concerned, but there are at least eight or ten families living near me who are not so well off.  Members of one family living three miles away have to travel quite a distance to get a water supply.  A girl has to take two buckets every day in the week and travel quite a long distance over the fields.  It is the whitest of white slavery; it is almost as primitive as in the days when Rebecca went to the well with an earthenware jug.  Half the streams of Ireland have water that is not fit for human consumption, and that is a very serious thing.  We are told that there are 600,000 acres of submerged land.  Of course, that is more appropriate to the Arterial Drainage Bill, but I suggest that arterial drainage and a supply of pure water to rural houses are as inseparable as Siamese twins.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy debated that on the Arterial Drainage Bill.  He will have a further opportunity this week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamFrancisODonne" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not anti-arterial drainage; I submit that if we can get 600,000 acres of submerged laud reclaimed, it will be very good indeed.  According to the Minister for Agriculture, there are 15,000,000 acres in Ireland of which 10,500,000 are arable and 4,500,000 are non-arable&mdash; rough grazing, but still land on which cattle and sheep could be put.  I suggest to the Minister that out of the 15,000,000 acres there are at least 6,000,000 acres with impure water. There are many people living there and we shall have to do something for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the valley between Cahir and Clogheen for a distance of ten miles there are only two sources of pure water.  One is two miles from Cahir, and at this time of the year it is not <Col N="792" /> unusual to see ten or 12 carts loaded with milk churns or barrels, drawing water.  I say that is the whitest of white slavery.  Within three miles of Clogheen there is a well known as St. Ciaran's Well.  There is a certain tradition associated with that well. When the saint crossed the Knockmealdown Mountains certain baptisms were arranged and, finding himself short of water, he struck a rock and, according to tradition, he got water out of the rock.  There are eight or 12 carts there every morning waiting to draw water.  These are the only two sources of pure drinking water in that part of the country.  I say it is disgraceful that that should be the state of affairs in 1944.  The suggestion has been made that people in that area are subject to consumption, possibly through lack of a good water supply. The conditions there to-day are the same as the conditions that have existed for many hundreds of years.</P>
    <P>So far as tuberculosis is concerned, I have lived in the City of Dublin for 25 years, and I may say I have had some experience of tuberculosis.  I was reared in Tipperary, and, following my 25 years in Dublin, I have lived in my native county for almost another 25 years&mdash;you may judge my age by that.  I have had a good experience of city and country life, though I may say I am learning every day.  In my young days I noticed quite a lot of tuberculosis.  Many of the cases I observed were sent to South Africa and Australia.  A pal of mine was affected by tuberculosis, and I remember putting him on board a vessel at Tilbury docks.  He went to Australia, and he recovered, and is a healthy man ever since.  I am not suggesting that we should transport all our tubercular patients to South Africa and Australia.  I have had experience of tuberculosis in my own family.  It is not a matter to smile at, because it is a very serious thing. Times are too troubled at the moment, and I do not want to be misunderstood.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of our money foolishly expended here on the treatment of tuberculosis.  You need some kind of colony where there will be some chance <Col N="793" /> of a cure.  I know that practically all the people who went to Australia or South Africa recovered.  I should like to know the proportion of tubercular patients who have recovered in Ireland. Anything would be better than to have them dying at home, and if conditions were normal, perhaps we could decide on some better course of action. I had a bitter experience in my own family of the effects of tuberculosis. I would have done anything to save my wife.  I did not succeed.  I did not get a chance.  I do not think our climate is kind to people so affected. From my observation as a layman, but subject to the authority of medical men, I would be inclined to suggest that when conditions become normal it might be advisable to have some patients sent to places like Australia or South Africa.  I know that if any young man of 22 or 24 could spend six or seven years in those countries, he would have a great chance of recovery. If tubercular patients got over 30, they would be all right and could come home again.  I say that anything is better than putting them into the clay.  I was going to put my theory into practice, but unfortunately my wife died, and I did not get a chance.  I am not suggesting that anybody should do what I would not be prapared to do myself. I would have done anything to save her life.</P>
    <P>Goitre trouble is very severe in South Tipperary.  Between Chashel and Cahir people have to travel long distances for water from the Well of the Hundred Springs.  The lack of water in South Tipperary is responsible for tuberculosis, and I think we have a higher rate in County Tipperary than in any other part of Ireland.  The water is not fit for man or beast to drink, and when an arterial drainage measure comes before the House I am going to put this very seriously to the Minister.  The one thing that brought me into the House was this question of water.  I had no axe to grind, and I am no politician.  The lack of a pure water supply is responsible for tuberculosis and goitre.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few remarks that I would like to make on the Estimate for the Department of <Col N="794" /> Local Government.  I had expected to hear from the Minister something as to his proposals to codify the Local Government Acts and regulations. Everyone knows that they are in a horrible mess at the moment.  It is impossible to trace local government law on any particular point, and seriously I suggest to the Minister that he should in the near future consider setting up some commission to codify the law and regulations.  Another point is that I would like to ask if the Minister has considered the obvious necessity of co-ordinating the services for the Department of Local Government and Public Health into one service with a view to saving expenditure.  At present there is £270,000 odd extra in the Estimate and we will continue to have an increased Estimate unless an effort is made to co-ordinate the various services.  As regard tuberculosis, I just want to make a local point.  Kilkenny people are very badly served in the matter of a sanatorium. The only accommodation there is the old militia barracks, and it is virtually in the same state as it was left in by the militia when they vacated it. I am not casting any aspersions on the local public health and tuberculosis officers.  They have done their best, but I do feel that the local authority in Kilkenny and perhaps the Department in Dublin have not taken sufficient interest in the matter.  There is room for further development, which should take place in the near future.  Deputy MacEoin drew attention to the fact that sufficient use was not being made of Hospital Trust funds to provide sanatoria throughout the country.  I think an effort should be made by the Department to get in on this fund to provide sufficient sanatoria.  In that connection I would suggest that the officers of the Department would consider the provision of convalescent homes both for pre-sanatorium treatment and post-sanatorium treatment. The main thing that has caused me to rise to-night is the question of road safety.  I heard nothing whatever from the Minister on this question.  I want to put it to him that there is a great necessity for propaganda on road safety at the moment.  There is in the country a new generation of <Col N="795" /> children and young persons who have had no experience of the motor car as it was in the pre-war period and there is every reason to believe that when the cars come back on the road we will have a holocaust of accidents.  You will have drivers who have been off the roads for five years and a new generation of drivers who will simply go to the country council and get a certificate without perhaps any test being imposed upon them.  I think it is the job of the Minister for Local Government to take in hand the setting up of a propaganda department to direct attention to road dangers and, in particular, to the risks of the road in cities near schools and colleges and places of that sort.  It is an extraordinary thing that our death rate and personal injury rate are perhaps for a country like this the highest in the world, although the density of traffic on our roads is perhaps the lowest. According to the figures of basic road statistics published in 1938 in Great Britain, the density of vehicles per road mile in Great Britain was 14.6; in the United States 9.7; in New Zealand 4.2; in Eire 1.4; in Belgium 10.5.  The death rate per million gallons of petrol consumed in road vehicles was in Great Britain 4.4; in the United States 2.2; in New Zealand 2.4; in Eire 5.3; Belgium 4.3.  These are very serious matters, and I think they have not received the attention of the Departments concerned, the Department of Local Government and the Department of Education as far as the schools are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I am wrong I can get at the matter in another way.  The Minister has done nothing whatever to standardise the roads in this country. At least he has not produced anything that the public is aware of.  In Britain the Ministry of Transport has standardised all their roads and I would like to see something done here.  We were told during the election that the Minister proposes to spend £14,000,000 on roads.  I do not know where this £14,000,000 is going to be spent or whether the Minister has in mind roads after the German model or if he proposes arterial roads and by-passes like the roads in the South of England. If he does I venture to suggest that £14,000,000 will not get him anywhere at all.  I have taken the case of one road which has been completed recently, the Naas by-pass.  I find that the cost for that 1,000 yards is something like £47,000, and that does not include the entire cost.  In addition there are cycle tracks to be provided, which are not there at the moment, and it does not include the cost of planting trees.  On that basis a mile will cost £80,000, and ten miles £800,000 and a mere 100 miles would cost £8,000,000.  If the Minister has in contemplation a system of roads such as I suggest it is quite obvious that £14,000,000 would not get near the mark at all.  I would like to have from the Minister some indication as to whether his Department has considered the problem as a whole and whether it is worth a candle to continue improving our existing roads by cutting off corners, hills and bridges or whether we should develop a new system of arterial highways devoted perhaps solely to fast moving traffic. On this Naas by-pass road I notice they have failed to provide bays for bus stops or bays for waiting vehicles. <Col N="797" /> I did not notice any strip for horse-drawn traffic.  I think that in rural areas the question of horse-drawn traffic will have to receive special consideration, whether by way of providing a separate strip apart from the main highway is a matter for consideration, but it is quite clear that if you go in for a system of modern road construction you must leave something for the horse-drawn vehicle.  That is not being done at the moment to any satisfactory degree.</P>
      <P>There are a few points in regard to the question of traffic that I should like to mention.  One is that there is a gap at the moment in our legislation in regard to the provision of traffic signs. There is no law by which you can compel a local authority to erect these signs, and secondly there is no standardised sign.  Our existing signs are completely out of date and some of them are really dangerous.  The matter was raised in the House recently by Deputy Daly and probably the Minister has already the question under consideration, but I think in any future legislation provision will have to be made whereby it will be essential for public authorities to provide modern up-to-date signs.  I would suggest to the Minister in all seriousness to restore our road signs.  Road signs have been restored in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>He is in charge of roads.  The only other point I should like to make is as regards mental hospital workers.  It has come under my notice that there is no standardisation of salaries or wages in the mental hospital service.  You will find two adjoining counties where the attendants have similar conditions of employment and the extraordinary thing is that the salaries and wages vary considerably. In Kilkenny and Carlow, two adjoining counties, the difference is quite considerable and I would suggest that the mental hospital section of the Department should take the question in hand because there seems to justification for the discrimination.  The mental hospital workers in Kilkenny are, I believe, the lowest paid mental hospital workers in Ireland although they are doing the very same duties as are performed in Ballinasloe, Carlow or elsewhere. I think it is a matter that the Minister should take into consideration in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one matter I wish to raise, namely, the matter of connection with sewerage and water schemes.  Many sewerage and water schemes have been installed in villages and towns in recent years but if the Minister makes inquiry, I think he will find that the matter of connection with these schemes is most unsatisfactory.  I could point out to him towns and villages where not 5 per cent. of the population have connected with the schemes.  I think it is waste of public money not to have power in the local authority to compel connection with these schemes.  I hope the Minister will make a serious inquiry into the matter because there is very little use in spending a great deal of public funds, striving to improve the health of the people and social conditions in particular districts, if the residents for any reasons refuse to take advantage of it.  I understand that local authorities have no power to compel an individual to connect with their schemes; that they have power to do it themselves and then try to recover cost from the particular individual.  I think that has been found to be the law.  I do not suggest that you need to amend the <Col N="799" /> law but I think the matter needs to be inquired into.</P>
      <P>In other towns, perhaps, landlords refuse to make these connections because of the rent restrictions or for some other reason.  They have power to increase the rent but they do not want to be involved in difficulty.  It is possible that the local authorities are at fault in many cases; I do not know, but I would suggest to the Minister that inquiry by a competent body who understands the whole matter is overdue. While there is a lot of planning for post-war work and searching for new schemes, I would suggest to the Minister a scheme in all towns and villages where water and sewerage have been installed, to compel connection with these installations.  We have spent, I suppose, up to £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 in the last 12 years in installing these water and sewerage schemes, but the Minister will find on inquiry from local authorities that there are villages where not 5 per cent. of the people have made connections, after nine or ten years.  A serious difficulty exists and the local authorities have no easy solution.  I would ask the Minister seriously to inquire into the matter.</P>

      <P>The problem to which Deputy Allen has referred is one which is receiving consideration.  As the law stands at present, I think the local authority has no power to compel a person to connect to a sewerage scheme where the premises affected are already provided with adequate sanitation.  Of course, that has its disadvantages from the point of view of a local authority that has carried out a comprehensive scheme.  On the other hand it is rather difficult to say that you should compel a person who already has an efficient sanitary service to connect up with the municipal scheme.  However, the problem is, as I said, under examination and perhaps we may be able to find a solution for the situation which in some areas at any rate is unsatisfactory in view of the circumstances to which the Deputy has referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Coogan, in his concluding <Col N="800" /> statement, referred to the fact that there were no standard scales of remuneration in force for mental hospital workers.  That is quite true but that matter again has been engaging the attention of the Department for a considerable time and very prolonged negotiations have been carried on by the Parliamentary Secretary, Dr. Ward, with representatives of the staffs and other interests concerned, in order to see whether we cannot get a greater degree of uniformity than at the moment prevails.  I think we are well on the way to a solution in that regard.</P>
    <P>A great deal of attention in the debate was given to the problem of tuberculosis and everybody stressed what we, all of us, regret&mdash;the lamentable and deplorable lack of adequate accommodation in the country to enable us to provide institutional treatment for those who require it. But while we may regret this at the same time we cannot discuss this problem with our heads in the sand; we can no more provide all the necessary institutions for the treatment of this disease than we can make bricks without straw.</P>
    <P>Everybody is aware of the acute shortage of building materials, the shortage of practically every essential requirement for providing hospital accommodation.  There is a shortage of all sorts of metals, a shortage of glass, a possible shortage of even cement, and there is no use in people coming along here and saying, &ldquo;You should have these beds&rdquo; when they know very well that in present circumstances there is no possibility of providing these beds except at a slow rate, a very slow rate, and under great difficulties. We have in fact made some progress towards the solution of this problem since last year.  Every effort is being made to speed up the treatment of persons suffering from tuberculosis and considerable difficulties are being experienced in procuring building materials.  But despite this, some progress has been made, and as a result of new institutions provided 135 additional beds have been made available and works are in progress on <Col N="801" /> existing institutions to provide a further 135 beds, while extensions have been planned to provide 336 extra beds. In addition a considerable number of further beds are in contemplation.  All our efforts to secure those beds are entirely determined by the supply of building requirements available.  There is no use coming in here and telling me about 100 people waiting for beds as Deputy Byrne did.  I am as much concerned, even more so, than Deputy Byrne about these people because with the two Parliamentary Secretaries I am responsible for finding an adequate solution for this problem.</P>
    <P>I can no more provide 100 houses by a whisk of a wand than Deputy Byrne, but I have the honesty to come along and tell the people the difficulties. I do not trade on the sorry plight of the unfortunate sufferers of this disease.  When discussing this matter, let someone come along and instead of stating the position tell us how we are going to cure it.  One suggestion was made here and repeated by Deputy Norton that we should take all these derelict and unoccupied mansions and convert them into sanatoria.  We declare immediately that we have had an exhaustive survey made of every vacant and unoccupied house in the country which at first sight by reason of its size and location might be suitable for conversion into a hospital or sanatorium and we have been disappointed beyond measure, by the result of that survey.  The number of houses found to be suitable was very small. Most of these houses were built when requirements in regard to sanitation and hygiene were not what they are now.  Many of them are without a water supply and a great majority of them without even proper sanitation.</P>
    <P>In order to provide them with the hygienic accommodation that hospitals would require, we would have to procure things that are not procurable, things which, in fact, are holding up the construction of new hospitals; things which, if available, would enable us to proceed with the hospital programme we have already mapped out; things which would relieve us of the need of trying to find any sort of substitute for the hospitals we have <Col N="802" /> contemplated.  This proposal has been examined, not this year or last year, but three or four years ago, when the question of providing for evacuees from the city was being intensively investigated.  We have gone back on this early investigation two or three times with the idea of trying to find somewhere some substitute for the hospital accommodation which we so urgently require.  The year before last, when infantile paralysis was widespread, we had an exhaustive survey made of all buildings standing within a reasonable radius of Dublin.  We found one capable of providing something like 100 beds which has been remodelled and is now under the control of the commissioners of the board of assistance.  This was the result of an exhaustive examination within a very wide radius of the City of Dublin, where you would think buildings which could be used as hospitals would be more numerous than around the country towns.  We carried out the same survey throughout the length and breadth of the country.  We made an effective examination of all the residences and buildings that came under the control of the Land Commission, and, for the reasons I have mentioned, the difficulties of providing water and sanitation found them unsuitable generally.  We simply had to make up our minds that those old mansions could not be utilised for the purposes of providing substitute hospitals, and we may as well make up our minds that until after this war is over, and fresh supplies are available, that the rate at which beds can be provided is going to be very much slower than any of us desire or even think adequate, and certainly very much slower than the public demand, than the public conscience, almost, will tolerate.  But there is no way out of it so long as building materials are curtailed to the extent that they are now. Accordingly, we have to consider whether we cannot find some other way of dealing with the problem.  We have made an approach to this problem by providing supplementary food allowances, and other arrangements were made to induce people who have contracted the disease to seek early <Col N="803" /> treatment, and to provide them with proper food, clothes, beds and bedding. We would go even further than that again if it were possible for us with the limited supplies of building material.  We would even try to provide them with rooms in which they could isolate themselves and their families.  These things are impossible so long as the present situation exists, and all we can do in the present circumstances is to try to alleviate their condition to the extent to which it is possible with the things which we have at our disposal.  It is not because any of us in the Department of Local Government and Public Health are satisfied with the existing position that that position obtains.  It is because we are faced with difficulties which, being human beings, and not supermen, we cannot overcome.</P>
    <P>One of the matters in relation to which there was a great deal of criticism was the manner in which we have asked the local authorities to provide supplemental allowances for old age pensioners and those coming under kindred categories living in the rural areas.  So far as the urban areas are concerned, we have already met the position there to a reasonable extent, bearing in mind what the resources of this community are, by providing the food vouchers.  A scheme of that sort would not be workable in rural areas, and we have tried to meet the necessitous cases, the cases of hardship in rural areas, by making a cash grant as supplementary allowance to the old age pensioners.  But, in connection with that, we have to remember that where persons are in necessitous circumstances the primary obligation of relieving their necessity rests on the local authority, which is the public assistance authority for the district. But, when we decided to make a cash allowance, we took a reasonable view of the situation and said that under present conditions we were not going to impose on the local authority the full responsibility for supplementing the old age pension in the case of persons whose circumstances were necessitous.  We said that we were going to relieve the local authority of a great part of that obligation and <Col N="804" /> liability, but nevertheless the obligation and the liability rest in the first instance on the local authority.  We cannot afford to lose sight of that fact, otherwise we would simply convert the whole system of social services into a poor law code operated from a central institution here in Dublin and operated, I would say, in these circumstances with much less regard for the personal needs of any applicant than would naturally be felt by those living as neighbours in immediate proximity to the person who is to secure the relief; for they would have a more human view and a view less hidebound than would be the case, say, if the services were to be administered from one centralised organisation with its central direction located here in the metropolis.</P>
    <P>As I was saying, we had regard, first of all, to the fact that the primary obligation of relieving necessity rests on the public assistance authority.  The next thing we realised was that perhaps, in view of the circumstances, the number of cases where assistance would have to be given would be much more than normal and that, therefore, the local authority might not be able to cope with the problem upon an adequate scale.  We also had regard to the fact that there are at present many other demands on the local authorities. Apart altogether from the demand for public assistance, there are increased demands for the maintenance of roads and for the maintenance of the local institutions.  Therefore we decided that, while we would ask local authorities to do their duty, we would come along and take the major part of the burden; and we have been taking it to the extent of three-fourths or 75 per cent. of the total cost.</P>
    <P>In devising our scheme, we also had regard to the fact that there are many persons drawing old age pensions in rural areas who are living in conditions of comparative comfort, comfort certainly as compared with most old age pensioners in urban areas.  We are all of us well aware of the revolution which Deputy Dr. Ward's Old Age Pensions Act of 1932 brought about.  We all of us have seen cases where persons, whom I would describe as comfortable farmers, <Col N="805" /> even substantial land owners, assigned their farms to members of their families and got pensions at the full rate.  Those people, when they assigned the farms, reserved to themselves certain rights: the right to a room, the right to food, the right to a seat at the fire, and other things.  At the present time, when we know that a very great number of the people who would have to be taxed to provide a supplementary allowance are themselves living in conditions of great difficulty, in urban areas in particular, we could not disregard the fact that a very large number of persons in receipt of old age pensions who are living in rural areas are living in circumstances of comparative comfort, living on a farm or living with relatives who have a filial duty and obligation to them still.</P>
    <P>I hope the philosophy is not growing up in this country that when parents become 65 or 70 years of age the full responsibility for looking after them in their old age and of caring for them is to be thrown on the shoulders of the State.  If so, we might find that it would lead to some very revolutionary changes.  The primary responsibility for maintaining parents in their old age rests, in the first place, on the children of those parents who are in a position to maintain them, in the same way as the duty of maintaining children rests, in the first instance, on the parents.  The State may come in, in view of the circumstances of the majority of the people, and may help the adult population to discharge its filial and parental obligation. But the primary obligation rests upon the sons and daughters of those old men and women to look after them and care for them and cherish them at the end of their days.  As I say, in view of the well-known fact that many of these people are the parents of children living in comfortable circumstances in rural areas, I think that there was a binding obligation upon the Minister for Finance, when he was taking this money out of the common pool of taxation and providing it for the relief of persons in necessitous cases, to take steps to ensure that the supplemental allowances would be given only to those <Col N="806" /> who in fact require them.  That is the answer to all the criticism we have heard here as to the manner in which these supplemental allowances are being administered.  Just in the same way as a person who got an old age pension had to prove that his means were not sufficient to maintain him, I cannot see that there is any stigma in asking a person who wants to supplement that old age pension to show that in fact he does require the supplementary allowance before the supplementary allowance is paid to him.</P>
    <P>Another matter which was raised by a number of Deputies was the question of the mental hospital capitation grant, and it was suggested that the mental hospital capitation grant should be increased and that the State should bear the greater portion of the cost of maintaining patients in those hospitals. That proposal was extended by some Deputies to include not alone main roads but other roads, and the effect of their proposals was that the maintenance of these roads should be a charge on central funds.  Now, I think it was Deputy Cogan who complained about the heavy burden imposed on local rates as a result of the making and maintenance of these roads.</P>
    <P>Let us examine this question of raising revenue by means of rates, as compared with central taxation.  It must be remembered that rates are a taxation upon property, and let us make no mistake about that.  They are, as Dr. Ward observed to me, levied upon tangible assets or property which a man possesses in this country. If rates are levied on a man, they are levied on the property that he owns or occupies, and the basis on which these rates are levied and collected is the amount of property which that individual possesses.  Now, in general, when it comes to the matter of central taxation, the larger part of it is not upon the property which individuals hold, so far as this country is concerned, at any rate, but is levied in the way of indirect taxation.  I am sure that such taxation would amount to something more than 50 per cent., of the whole.  You have indirect taxation on tobacco, beverages <Col N="807" /> of one sort or another, and on many other commodities, such as tea and sugar which, at the moment, I admit, would only come to an infinitesimal amount; but the greater portion of taxation in the whole country is in the form of indirect taxation, and that, as I have already said, is a tax upon individuals. Now, what the Lord Mayor of Dublin, Deputy Martin O'Sullivan, who sits on the Labour Benches, was contending for, and evidently what other Labour Deputies, such as Deputy Corish, were contending for, was that we should transfer the burden of taxation from property owners to the individual, and that the money that is at present collected in the form of rates from property owners should be collected in the form of indirect taxation from every man, woman and child in the community.  That is what those independent Deputies on the Labour Benches, such as the Lord Mayor, Deputy Martin O'Sullivan, Deputy Corish, and others, would seem to advocate, but I should like them to go back and try to justify that viewpoint before their own trade unions. When they talk about the meagre contribution which the State gives in the form of capitation grants for mental hospitals, let them go back and try to justify to their trade unions, and to the members of the Labour Party, the transferring of that burden of taxation from those who possess property and putting it on the backs of the working people of this country.</P>
    <P>The same type of argument occurs in connection with the housing grants. At the present time, the amount that the State contributes in the way of housing grants, particularly in connection with the county boroughs, far exceeds the amount contributed by the cities concerned.  In the City of Dublin, for instance&mdash;it is difficult to analyse the matter exhaustively&mdash;so far as my information goes, the central authority is making a greater provision, so far as the subsidising of houses for the working classes under the Act of 1932 is concerned, than the Dublin Corporation is.  In addition to that, however, there are two very significant factors.  The first one is that if the Dublin Corporation are subsidising houses, they are <Col N="808" /> subsidising houses which are their own property, which will remain their own property, and which will be a source of income to the citizens of Dublin when the loans are paid off.  The second point is that when the Dublin Corporation raises money to subsidise these housing schemes, or any other scheme, they raise that money by taxes on property, whereas, when the State raises such moneys, a large portion of these moneys must come out of indiscriminate taxation upon the whole community.  When, therefore, Deputy Martin O'Sullivan, Deputy Corish and other Deputies who claim to speak for the people in the towns and cities, ask for authority to raise the rates for the provision of housing by these means, they are asking us to transfer the burden of taxation to the whole community.  The same thing applies to the whole gamut of social welfare legislation, such as the provision of free milk, and so on, and when these Deputies ask us to give greater grants for such purposes they are asking us to relieve the mass of property owners and put the burden of taxation on the other people, who have no property, and whom we represent in this House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Roddy mentioned that I had talked about providing motor roads on Continental standards.  I think he said that, so far as the people of this State were concerned, we had made no provision whatever for that important section of the community upon whom we all, in the ultimate analysis, rely, to wit, the farmers.  I think he said that, in effect, we had made no provision to meet the needs of the farmers, so far as horse-drawn traffic is concerned.  I do not think Deputy Roddy was here when I was speaking and, accordingly, he must not have heard what I did say in regard to these new roads which we hope to construct, eventually, over a great number of years.  If he had been here, he would have heard that we proposed to provide four classes of roads and that, in respect of three of those classes&mdash;Class One, Class Two and Class Three roads &mdash;we propose to provide for horse-drawn traffic on all of them.  We could not provide a margin for slow or animal-drawn traffic on the Class Four roads&mdash;they are not wide <Col N="809" /> enough to permit it&mdash;but in respect of three of the four classes I definitely gave the House the information&mdash;and no Deputy should have been under any misapprehension&mdash;that we were endeavouring to meet the problem of providing a safe pathway or roadway for horse-drawn or animal-drawn traffic in general, and Deputy Donnellan, for one, must have been aware of that.  I am not saying that it can be done this year, or even next year, but I do say that, as soon as we can start on this matter of a new road-construction programme, we shall provide sufficient accommodation for those who have to use animals on the roads.</P>
    <P>A considerable number of other points were raised by various Deputies. Deputy Donnellan, for instance, referred to the lack of accommodation for tuberculosis patients in certain institutions, and he referred particularly to the hospital position in the County of Galway.</P>
    <P>Again, in one way or another, it was not possible to get ahead with the building of the regional hospital which has been planned for Galway but we have made, notwithstanding all our difficulties, certain plans which I think, when carried out and completed, will go a long way towards providing the additional accommodation which Deputy Donnellan rightly says is required in Galway.  For instance, two dormitories which had been occupied by maids were vacated, redecorated and equipped to form two new 14-bed wards.  Adjacent stores and sanitary accommodation were converted into auxiliary accommodation providing 28 beds.  Plans are being prepared to provide a new two-storey block for the maids, who, because they were compelled to vacate their dormitories, had to get alternative accommodation elsewhere. As soon as the accommodation for the maids is provided, we shall have accommodation for 12 more patients in the rooms now occupied by the maids.  The additional new maternity hospital is on the point of completion. When it is completed and occupied by the maternity and gynæcological patients, 35 beds will be available in the old maternity hospital for further patients.  That will give us an additional 35 beds, or, all told, a total <Col N="810" /> accommodation of 75 beds.  It is true that sometimes this hospital is overcrowded to the extent of 80 patients but we hope that, by the end of this year, or at least before the House comes to consider this Estimate again, we shall have provided as full a solution as possible for the hospital problem in Galway.  What we are doing in Galway we try to do in every other county to the extent of the resources at our disposal.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell complained in relation to Dublin housing that the housing by-laws were a generation out-of-date and had not been overhauled. The position, in fact, is that steps have been taken to bring these by-laws, which were originally made in 1901 and were revised in 1919, up-to-date. A draft copy of the new by-laws, strange to say, was received in the Department from the corporation today. The examination of the draft copy and necessary discussions with the corporation will be pushed forward and we shall have these new by-laws, I hope, in operation within a very short period.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connor referred to the reconditioning work in the flats in Gardiner Street and elsewhere and suggested that we should push forward with this work more rapidly and on a greater scale.  We have got to realise that this reconstruction programme was embarked on as an experiment and we had to feel our way.  We are certainly impressing on the Corporation the need to push ahead with works of this nature and the Corporation have, in fact, made a compulsory purchase Order in respect of a number of other houses in Gardiner Street and Seán MacDermott Street with a view to reconditioning them on similar lines. There are, however, difficulties in connection with this work to the extent that we have to try to use as much as possible the existing materials in these houses.  All sorts of devices and expedients have to be adopted by the architectural staff of the Corporation in order to eke out, as far as we possibly can, existing supplies of materials.  This involves a certain amount of delay, but the delay means that we can get a greater number of <Col N="811" /> flats and a greater amount of accommodation in the end.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch referred to the action which I had to take in regard to three officers of the Killarney Mental Hospital. The officers in question were the cook, the assistant cook and the attendant in the stores.  The position there was that those officers had direct, immediate and personal responsibility for the safe custody and proper control of coffee, sugar and tea issued for patients' meals, that their evidence was very unsatisfactory and in certain respects contradictory.  They made statements to the auditor at the audit which were duly attested by them and put in writing.  They afterwards furnished separate statements to other officers whose conduct was under investigation, which contradicted the statements which they had made when questioned by the auditor and, on oath, they testified that both of these statements, themselves contradictory statements, were true.  I could not adopt the attitude of regarding that as a light matter.  Each one of those officers was a link in a chain of responsibility, a chain of responsibility that extended from the resident medical superintendent right down to the lowest officer, to see that what was provided for the patients in the institution would go to the patients who were entitled to receive it.  These people had that responsibility and, as I said, they made contradictory statements. They gave us no help or assistance whatever and, even on oath, they made statements, one or other of which must have been untrue.  I think I was treating them leniently and mercifully when I allowed them to retire on pension, even if in one or two cases the retirement was a few years in advance of the normal retiring period. I cannot think that Deputy Lynch seriously meant me to reopen these cases.  In any event, I could not do it, and I would not do it because we have to impress every officer in an institution of this sort, who is charged with the care and custody of people who are unable to look after themselves, with a full sense of responsibility to the patients under his control, <Col N="812" /> or for whom he has any responsibility. Accordingly, when the auditors discover abuses, and investigations are being made to establish responsibility for these abuses, I cannot take up any other attitude than that of saying that any member of the staff of an institution of this sort who does not place himself fully and freely at the disposal of the auditor, who does not give him every assistance and all the information he seeks, will be held by me to be responsible and will be dealt with accordingly.</P>

However, they will be retired before they have completed, in most cases, their full period of service and I suppose that will have to suffice now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Broderick and Deputy Corry formed a coalition, or carried out a joint action in relation to certain houses built by the Cork Corporation outside the city boundary. They tried to impose upon the Minister for Local Government some responsibility for the situation which had been created thereby, and, in the case of Deputy Broderick, for the fact that because these houses were outside the city boundary, the persons resident in them came within the category of rural residents in respect of unemployment assistance.  I explained to Deputy Broderick that so far as the administration of unemployment assistance is concerned, I have no responsibility. I have no responsibility, either, for the fact that these houses remain outside the city boundary.  If Deputy Corry and Deputy Broderick <Col N="813" /> are really so concerned about the plight of the residents of these houses, they have a remedy.  They can move to have the Cork City boundaries extended so as to bring this property inside the city.  Of course, if they do, Deputy Corry and Deputy Broderick, as members of the Cork County Council, will probably be depriving the ratepayers of Cork of the benefit of the rates paid by the Cork Corporation in respect of these houses and, perhaps, that is why they want to have it both ways.  They want to collect the rates on these houses, and, at the same time, to provide the people with the same amenities and the same consideration as if they were living inside the city boundary.  The position is anomalous, and, so far as I am concerned, speaking here unofficially, I think it could be remedied by the Cork Corporation seeking to extend the city boundaries and to bring these people inside.  That might bring them outside Deputy Corry's constituency and we would then hear less about these houses in future.</P>
    <P>As to the position in relation to the rents of these houses, there are two types of houses.  There is the type which is let at the flat rate of 7/6. Are these the Spangle Hill houses?</P>

      <P>Deputy Corry is a very influential member of the Cork County Council, and so is Deputy Broderick.  What about the pair of them getting together and trying to settle it themselves?  With regard to the differential rents, we hear a great deal of talk about the burden which the provision of houses imposes on the local authorities.  We also know that there is a great deal of dissatisfaction on the part of the ordinary citizen who has to pay an economic rent for his house with the position which exists; for he knows that people who are quite able to pay an economic rent occupy houses which are subsidised both by <Col N="814" /> the State and the ratepayers at rents which are much below an economic rent.  Therefore, this idea of a differential rent based upon the family income has been introduced.</P>
      <P>One of Deputy Corry's criticisms was of the action of the city manager in trying to relate the rents of these houses which he let upon this differential principle to the family income, the income of those who occupy them.  I cannot see that the city manager can be criticised for that.  If he fixes the rent at a certain fraction of the family income, at one-sixth, one-seventh or one-eighth of the family income and if the family income goes up, surely the manager is entitled, and not merely entitled, but, in the interests of the ordinary ratepayers, is bound, to take that into consideration when fixing the rent to be paid by any occupant of these houses.  I do not see why there should be any general complaint about that.  Of course, we all know that the moment the family income goes up and the city manager tries to give effect to the principle upon which the houses were let, everybody who thinks that, by getting his neighbours involved in an agitation, he can prevent the city manager from exercising his rights under this agreement in relation to differential rents, will join the agitation and will get Deputies to make a case for them in the House, in the hope that they will prevent an increase in the rent which would be proportionate to the increase in the family income.  I can have no sympathy whatever with that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have to look at the fact that I find the greatest difficulty in getting the Minister for Finance to provide £500,000 or £600,000 for housing subsidies year after year, at the fact that Deputies complain about the burden which these housing schemes are imposing on the ratepayers, and at the fact that the great majority of people in our cities and towns have to pay economic rents for the houses they are living in, and, therefore, if any municipality tries to relate the rent of a house to the family income of those who occupy the house and does so on a fair and just basis, I have to say that it is fair, just and equitable, and, <Col N="815" /> so far as I am concerned, I am not going to be at all critical of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">

      <P>May I ask the Minister two questions?  He has dealt with two matters.  He asked if Deputy Broderick and I would not be able to settle the matter of these houses ourselves. Would the Minister on his part be prepared to annul the tenant-purchase agreement in connection with these houses and send it back to us? With regard to the differential rents, the argument put up both by the Minister and the city manager previously was that the bonus on wages given to workers was calculated for income-tax purposes and why should the city manager not calculate it also for rent purposes?  The children's allowance is not so calculated; it is expressly, under Section 4 of the Finance Bill, excluded from income-tax and super-tax. I want to know definitely from the Minister whether he is in favour of the city manager gathering for rent portion of the money provided here in the Bill.  I may tell him frankly that, if he is, I could not be a member of any Party that would agree to it.  That is straight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>One day that recurring threat will be given effect to, I suppose.  Anyhow, that is not the point.  The point is that, if the allowance is excluded by law from being taken into the calculation, then it will be excluded.  If it is excluded, then the city manager will himself be entitled to withdraw any allowances which he makes, and which are considerable.  You cannot have it both ways.  If an allowance is made by the city manager in respect of children, then he may be compelled to reconsider the situation.  The fact of the matter is this, that the more an attempt is made by Deputies like Deputy Corry and others to give those people over and above what they are equitably entitled to under their agreement, the more difficult it will be for us to find a solution of this housing problem at all.</P>

They should be thinking of those people who are not in houses&mdash;people who are paying exorbitant rents in slums and elsewhere. When a man gets a house, and is in a position to pay a fair rent for it, then I expect that every Deputy in the Dáil who wants us to solve the housing problem will stand behind any authority which is responsible for trying to reduce the burden that the housing programme is imposing upon the ratepayers.  That is a position which Deputy Corry has never taken up.  I wish he would; it would make it very much easier for the rest of us.</P>

What sense of public responsibility has a person who will behave in that way?

      <P>I would be very sorry to find anything being done which would put us at loggerheads with the Deputy, or with the people who live in those houses, but the fact is that we have responsibilities, and we have got to see that, if houses are provided for the community as a whole, they will be provided at the lowest possible cost to those who are being taxed to provide them.  As I have already reminded the Deputy, the people who are being taxed to provide them are, in general, people who have not the benefit and privilege of living in houses at less than an economic rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last matter dealt with was the question of my statement in relation to the Roscommon County Council, and my powers under Emergency Powers Order, 1939.  I have said, and I repeat, that if I am satisfied that it is necessary for the public safety and the preservation of the State that certain road works should be maintained, and if a local authority refuses to fulfil its obligation in respect of those road works, then I am not going to put the ratepayers to the needless expense of having another local inquiry.  I will exercise my powers under the Emergency Powers Order, and dissolve that county council.  I want to say that, because in two consecutive years we have had an example of refusal on the part of local authorities to face up to their responsibilities in this matter.  The Kerry County Council took up that attitude in the years 1940, 1942 and 1943.  I had an inquiry held.  I knew that the members of the Kerry County Council had declared that they would reduce the rates by a considerable sum, and, in order to fulfil that threat to the people, that they had cut very drastically and radically the estimate for the maintenance of main roads.  I hoped that, after the experience of 12 months, they would be wiser; that they would realise that they could not <Col N="818" /> stint the expenditure upon main roads without involving the local ratepayers and the community as a whole in very much greater expense later on.</P>
    <P>This year, when they took up the attitude which they had adopted in the preceding year, I reminded them of the fact that an inquiry had been held; that I had withheld the decision in order to give them an opportunity of reflecting upon the position which had been created by their refusal adequately to provide for the maintenance of the roads.  I told them frankly that if they did not this time make the necessary provision I would exercise my powers and dissolve them. They were wise.  I do not want to dissolve any local authority.  I want to keep them in existence.  I do not relish the prospect of having to find a commissioner to administer the affairs of any local authority.  It means that I have to deplete my already sorely tried staff.  It means that I have to take responsibility here in the House which I would just as soon not have to take on occasions.  Therefore, I assure the House that I do not hanker after replacing any local authority by a commissioner. They were wise, as I have said.  Having before them the report of the engineer who had to be specially retained for the purpose of making a detailed inspection of the Kerry roads and of reporting upon them; having had the benefit and advantage of that report, and having also some financial assistance and consideration from me, they decided to strike a rate, and they had to impose a very much heavier rate upon the Kerry ratepayers than they would have had to impose if they had made adequate provision in the previous year and in the year before that.  That was all right so far as the Kerry County Council was concerned.</P>
    <P>Then the Roscommon County Council thought they would try their hand, and they decided to reduce the estimate of the county surveyor for the main roads by a sum of, approximately, £10,000, which would not merely have meant that there would be no proper expenditure on the maintenance of the main roads of the county but would mean at the same time that the county itself would be <Col N="819" /> losing a free grant of over £9,000 which would have been expended also on main road maintenance.  I have examined the position, and I found that the roads of Roscommon form a particularly important link in the communications between practically four counties along the western seaboard, and the centre and east of Ireland.  It is quite clear that they would have considerable importance from the point of view of national defence.  I told the Roscommon County Council that I would have to hold an inquiry as to how they were discharging their duties.  I sent down an inspector.  In doing so, I drew his attention to that consideration.  I drew his attention also to the fact that, under the Emergency Powers Act, I had special responsibilities imposed on me by implication to ensure that the roads were maintained in a proper condition.</P>
    <P>I asked him to draw their attention to Article 69 of the very first Emergency Powers Order made by the Government under the Emergency Powers Act of 1939.  That article says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where it is the duty of any local authority or other person to construct or maintain any public road the Minister for Local Government and Public Health may give such directions with respect to the manner in which that duty is to be performed as he thinks necessary in the interests of the public safety or the preservation of the State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Quite obviously, that article threw a special responsibility on the Minister for Local Government to ensure that, where these roads were of importance from the point of view of the public safety or the preservation of the State, they would be properly maintained.  I drew the attention of the Roscommon County Council to that Order, and also to the further provisions in Article 81, which states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If, in the opinion of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, a local authority has failed to perform duly and effectually any <Col N="820" /> function imposed on such local authority by or in pursuance of this Order, the Minister may... dissolve such local authority.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I pointed out to them that, in my view, it was essential that these roads should be maintained for the purpose of Article 69, and that if they did not maintain them there seemed to be no way out for me except to dissolve the Roscommon County Council.  The majority group on the county council met while the inquiry was actually being held, and decided that they would not conform to my requirements under Article 69.</P>
    <P>We heard a long statement here today from Deputy Cogan as to the broadmindedness with which the Roscommon County Council acted: that we had down there, as distinct from the narrow, bigoted view which we take up here in the city, the representatives of the rural community who take a broad national view on these things, and that it was in pursuance of that, because they thought it would suit their locality best&mdash;they did not give two hoots about the rest of the country&mdash;they were going to allow these roads to deteriorate.  The master strategists who operate in the County Roscommon decided that it would be much better from the viewpoint of national defence if the roads in the county were allowed to become impassable. I do not think that would be the view either of the Chief of Staff or of the army authorities in respect of these important transport arteries, but, at any rate, it was not my view.  I came to the conclusion, having read the evidence given on oath by the county engineer who is, I suppose, the person most competent to tell me what is necessary in order to maintain these roads properly, that the estimate which he had prepared was the minimum sum that was required to maintain these roads.</P>
    <P>I again wrote to the Roscommon County Council, and pointed out that I was satisfied that, with the reduced estimate, the roads would be bound to deteriorate, and then I pointed out that in 1939 the Minister for Local Government and Public Health was authorised by the Emergency Powers <Col N="821" /> Order of that year to give such directions with respect to the manner in which the duty of maintaining the public roads is to be carried out &ldquo;as he thinks necessary in the interests of the public safety or the preservation of the State.&rdquo;  I went on to point out that &ldquo;the security of the State and the protection of its citizens must always remain the primary duty of any Government, and that in fulfilling this duty the Government will expect and, if necessary, demand the cooperation of every local authority in this State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This broad-minded group of 14 people in Roscommon who, I am perfectly certain, for the result of the last general election shows it, do not represent the feelings and views of the ordinary patriotic men and women of Roscommon, decided that, notwithstanding that it was a national obligation that they should co-operate with the authorities in taking such measures as would make for the greater safety and better preservation of the State; notwithstanding the fact that that obligation was pointed out to them, they were going to allow the roads in the County Roscommon to become, so far as they were concerned, impassable for any traffic to go over them, whether it was military or otherwise.  I decided that I would proceed on the basis, not of the Emergency Powers Order, but on the basis of the local inquiry which I held, and would dissolve them.  But I wanted, having gone through this experience once, and realising that these people were not concerned at all about the position of the country or the community as a whole but were concerned about trying to score a point in petty parish pump politics, to make it quite clear that I am not going to have the same attitude adopted by the members of any other local authority, that I am not going to go through this process of holding an inquiry which involves the ratepayers in expense and which will, perhaps, have the same result in the end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should, but I am merely making the point that I want to obviate the need both for a local inquiry and the expense which it involves, and the possible surcharge which might follow on it. Therefore, I am warning all those people who are charged with responsibility for maintaining the main roads of this country that, if I am satisfied their maintenance is necessary for the public safety and the preservation of the State, those people who refuse to discharge their responsibility in that regard will have to be removed from office.  They are not put there to be obstructionists; they are put there as men who have a responsibility, not merely to their local community, but to the nation as a whole, and in present circumstances it is of vital importance that we should maintain the roads in the best possible condition we can.  Apart altogether from the military considerations, there are economic considerations. The fuel and the food of the country have to be moved over these roads.  The things which the city people require from the country people have to be brought up from the country, and the things which the country people require from the people in the city have to be brought down from the city.  These roads are an essential part of our national communications, and the responsibility for maintaining particular sections of them has been imposed on each and every local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as I am concerned, I am not going to allow this road question to become again merely a pawn in local Party politics.  The maintenance of the roads is a matter of national importance, and it is my duty to see that they are maintained.  I am satisfied that so far as the existing road system is concerned its maintenance is necessary for the preservation and safety of the State, and I am not going to go through this process of a local inquiry.  I am not going to put the ratepayers to needless expense; I am not going to divert my officials, who have already much more on their hands than they can adequately cope with, from the work which they are doing to <Col N="823" /> hold these local inquiries.  So far as the national roads are concerned they had much better be taken out of local politics altogether, and those who are responsible for maintaining them had better face up to their obligations and responsibilities in that matter, because if not they will not be there to obstruct those whose responsibility it is to see that these roads are maintained.</P>

      <P>Permit me to ask the Minister a question.  It is intended to serve a dual purpose&mdash;to obtain and to give information about the 7/9 houses mentioned here&mdash;part of the scheme outside the borough boundary. The Minister will understand that the people living in those houses have not the slightest objection to paying that 7/9, but they thought when they went into the houses that that was an inclusive weekly charge.  Now 1/11½ has been added to that and it is specified as being in lieu of rates, which is the bone of contention in that particular area.  It is neither rates nor rent and the people feel that, because <Col N="824" /> its particular purpose is not specified, it is something that has been worked in subsequently, to their detriment.  I would ask the Minister to do something about that.  In regard to the differential, the main point there is that, as the families grow up, one-sixth of the wages is charged&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe I could proceed by asking if the Minister is aware that the amount charged is one-sixth of the rate of wages.  Then, when the family grows up, that operates seriously against the household and the people feel it is too much.  The city manager allows only 1/- off the wage for each child, which is really allowing only 2d.  I would ask the Minister to consider those matters and make representations to the city manager.</P>

Regarding the 1/11½ in lieu of rates, a special concession was given and the rent was made 7/9, exclusive of rates.  The Cork Corporation pay the rates to the county council in respect of houses owned by them in the county, and obtain back an equivalent amount with the rents.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  Before the dissolution of the Eleventh Dáil, the Drainage Bill had secured its Second Reading.  It has been reintroduced without any <Col N="827" /> change whatever and I suppose it is scarcely necessary to cover the ground that was covered then.  There is just one matter to which I would like to make a short reference.  Since the Second Reading debate to which I have referred, a certain decision was given in the High Court regarding the Mulkeerin and Cappamore Drainage Scheme.  As a result of that decision, it will be necessary to introduce certain amendments on the Committee Stage, to regularise the position.  Those amendments will be circulated to all Deputies and there will be ample opportunity to think them over before the Committee Stage is reached.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Transport (No. 2) Bill, 1944, be now read a Second Time.  This Bill was so fully discussed prior to, and during the course of, the general election that no long statement regarding its provisions is now required.  I assume that all those who spoke about the Bill during the course of the election had studied its provisions and, therefore, require no elaborate review of them. The Bill now before the House is the same as it was when originally introduced except that the dates have been changed so as to provide for its coming into operation on January 1, 1945, instead of July 1, 1944, as originally proposed.  I contemplate that the House will deal with the Bill on Second Reading before the summer recess and I aim at having the Committee Stage of the Bill, which will be the longest stage, dealt with before the end of September, leaving the month of October for the final stages in the Dáil and the Second Reading in the Seanad, with the concluding Stages in the Seanad and, if necessary, in the Dáil in November.  When circulating the Bill after the election, I circulated again the explanatory memorandum which was made available in the first instance and which describes in non-technical language the main provisions of the Bill. Associated with that memorandum and <Col N="829" /> available to Deputies are the reports of the discussions that took place here in May on the Second Reading of the Bill.  There was a long debate upon the Bill and any member of the Dáil who was not then present and who wishes to be familiar with the points of view expressed for and against the Bill will find them in the Dáil Debates. On that occasion, a number of Deputies referred to matters of detail. In the discussion on Second Reading of the Bill, we are, of course, entirely concerned with the principles of the measure.  Matters of detail are discussed in Committee.  I propose now to confine myself to a review of the principles of the measure, leaving for the more intimate type of discussion which is possible in Committee matters were referred to during the course of the previous Second Reading debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle of this Bill is that national economic development in the future and, particularly, our effectiveness in international trade requires that we should have a public transport system as adequate, as efficient and as cheap as can be provided&mdash;certainly, a public transport system as efficient and as cheap as any other country has.  Whether it will be possible for us to realise that aim or not, it is the view of the Government that we should strive towards it.  It is common ground amongst us, judging by the speeches made on the previous occasion on which the Bill was before the House, that we had not such a system in the past.  If we are to have it after the war, then, in the view of the Government, we should now make the necessary arrangements to bring it about.  It is our view that it would be unwise to wait until circumstances had developed in which the operation of such a system would be practicable before attempting to provide the legislative basis for it.  We think it wiser to enact the necessary legislation now, to establish an organisation that will be responsible for the provision of that public transport service and to give it the authority of the Dáil to proceed as best it can in present circumstances to prepare for its creation when times are more favourable.  In <Col N="830" /> the view of the Government, the best possible method of providing the country with such a public transport system is to establish a new statutory transport organisation on the lines proposed in this Bill&mdash;a statutory transport organisation which will control all the public transport services in the country except those that operate across the Border.  As Deputies are aware, special considerations affect those cross-Border services which make it undesirable that they should be interfered with at present.</P>
    <P>I stated previously, and I would like to repeat it now, that if the present situation in respect of the cross-Border services should be altered fundamentally by legislation elsewhere, then we would have to reconsider our decision not to interfere with the operation of these services within our jurisdiction. For a number of reasons which will be known to Deputies, it is desirable that they should not be interfered with on our part, nor is it necessary to do so in order to create the organisation which will provide, for the greater part of the territory under our jurisdiction, the type of transport service which we believe to be possible.</P>
    <P>We are proposing to create a new statutory organisation by amalgamating the Great Southern Railways Company and the Dublin United Transport Company.  The new transport organisation resulting from that amalgamation will, we propose, be given maximum freedom in commercial operations.  We are proposing to relieve it from the restrictions which in the past it was considered necessary in the public interest to impose upon railway undertakings, and other public transport services in latter years. When the provisions of this Bill were under discussion in the Press and amongst the public there were many references to monopoly by people who had obviously failed to realise that the essence of our transport problem is not the creation of a monopoly but the passing of a monopoly.  In the years before the first World War, when the motor vehicle was in its infancy, railway undertakings provided the only public transport service and had in their areas a complete monopoly.  Because <Col N="831" /> of the monopolistic conditions which they enjoyed, they developed in a rather haphazard fashion and were not compelled by force of competition to adopt new methods of operation, as they became possible, to renovate their equipment or maintain their organisations at maximum efficiency.</P>
    <P>With the advent of the private motor-car for the conveyance of passengers and the private lorry for the conveyance of goods, it is no longer possible to contemplate a public transport service with the same monopolistic privileges.  Any public transport organisation has now to face a competitor far more deadly than existed previously, the private lorry and the private car, and unless it can provide services which are efficient and cheap, those who might otherwise avail of its services can and will provide their own transport with their own lorries or their own private motor vehicles. Because of the change of conditions, it is no longer necessary to preserve the many cumbersome restrictions upon railway undertakings which legislators of previous years considered desirable.  We are proposing, therefore, to give this new organisation as complete freedom as is possible in the public interest of commercial operation and to remove entirely all the archaic forms of control which are no longer practicable.</P>
    <P>It appears to us there are certain safeguards which are necessary in the public interest and these safeguards are provided in the Bill.  The other restrictions upon railway operators and public transport providers are completely removed.  The safeguards which the Government consider essential in the public interest are, first, that the general policy of the public transport operators should be directed towards serving national economic aims; second, that there should be a public authority with control over the rates charged for transportation; third, that there should be given to the public authority power to require the provision of adequate transport facilities and, fourth, that there should be adequate protection against the <Col N="832" /> discriminatory treatment by the transport operators of members of the public.  All these safeguards are provided in the Bill.  It is considered that these are the only safeguards which the public interest requires.</P>
    <P>We propose to provide against the discriminatory treatment of individuals by making it illegal and giving the citizen who alleges discriminatory treatment to his detriment the right of appeal to the courts.  We propose to give to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, subject to whatever consultation is necessary with the advisory committee, the power to require the new organisation to provide new services sufficient to meet the requirements of all localities and trades and are proposing to give him power to prescribe maximum rates of charge and, in the principal matter of ensuring that the policy of the organisation will be directed in accordance with the national economic interest, we aim to achieve that result by the device contemplated in the Bill of having the direction of the organisation entrusted to a board consisting of shareholder-directors with the chairman nominated by the Government, the Government-nominated chairman having certain powers which will enable him to ensure, whenever the interests of the shareholders clash with the public interests, that it is the public interests and not the interests of the shareholders which will predominate.</P>
    <P>To effect the transport reorganisation which we have in contemplation, including the overhaul, renovation and modernisation of the transport equipment available, it is necessary to place the new company to be established in a stronger financial position than it would ever be possible for the Great Southern Railways Company to attain.  It is proposed to give this new organisation that stronger financial position by means of a capital reconstruction scheme which, by affording a State guarantee of the principal and interest of the debenture stock of the new company, has secured agreement from the existing debenture holders and other stockholders to a reduction in the rates of interest or dividend rights which they at present have.  By <Col N="833" /> the provision of the Government guarantee, the obligations of the new company in respect of the Great Southern Railways system for interest charges and dividends will be reduced by approximately £110,000 per year.  By means of the State guarantee of capital and interest, we put the new company in a position to raise new capital as required at lower rates of interest than it would be possible for any private undertaker to secure.</P>
    <P>There is also the possibility of a saving in taxation.  Under the provisions of the 1933 Finance Act public utility concerns which had previously been exempt from corporation profits tax were made subject to that tax, but an exemption was granted for a period of years to railway undertakings.  That exemption has been continued up to the present and there is a proposal in the Finance Bill of this year to continue that exemption for another period.  The Dublin United Transport Company is, however, liable to corporation profits tax.  Arising out of this amalgamation, there will result a saving in corporation profits tax which will redound to the company in the form of increased net revenue.  I am not committing the Government and it is not intended that the Government should be committed to maintain the present exemption of railway undertakings beyond the period contemplated in the Finance Bill of this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>How much will be involved annually?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount involved annually would vary considerably.  At the present time it is substantial because the Dublin United Transport Company is paying not merely corporation profits tax, but excess corporation profits tax.  That situation could, of course, be changed by a reduction of fares in Dublin.  That course may in fact be adopted.  The reasons against it are not so much financial as traffic reasons.  But clearly the amount involved depends entirely upon the rates of charge in operation. The original theory, as I understood it, was that any companies that were subject to statutory control of their maximum charges were on that account <Col N="834" /> exempted from corporation profits tax. That theory was departed from in the Finance Act of 1933 but it was continued, on a temporary basis anyway, in respect of railway undertakings as distinct from other firms.  I could not attempt, because it would be a complicated calculation, to put a precise figure on the revenue that will accrue to the company but, in any event, the exemption from corporation profits tax to railway companies is, as I mentioned, a temporary arrangement continued as required by Finance Acts which the Government is not committed to maintain indefinitely.</P>
      <P>The capital reorganisation which the Bill provides for, together with the better management which we believe to be possible in the case of the Great Southern Railways Company, will we expect enable the company to provide better transport services than were possible in the past, to provide these services at cheaper rates than operated normally before the war, to effect a reconstruction and modernisation of its equipment very largely, if not entirely, out of revenue and at the same time to effect a steady reduction in its capital liabilities.  The Bill does in fact provide that it shall be an obligation of the company to redeem the substituted debentures, that is, the debentures issued in substitution for the existing debentures of the Great Southern Railways Company, not later than 1960.  It may be held that that is a rather high standard to set for the company and that, in its efforts to attain it, it may be compelled or induced to maintain rates of charge at a higher level than would otherwise be necessary, but in fact we believe it can be done.  The effect of maintaining that provision in the Bill is this, that if it cannot be done the matter must come to the Dáil again, because new legislation would be required, before 1960.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new company will have on constitution capital liabilities of approximately £13,400,000.  I know that members of the last Dáil in discussing this Bill were somewhat confused by the fact that the maximum capital liability of the company was stated at £20,000,000.  That is a maximum capital liability which cannot be <Col N="835" /> exceeded by the company without the authority of fresh legislation.  In fact when the company is constituted its capital liability will be £13,400,000, of which £9,900,000 will represent 3 per cent. guaranteed debenture stock and £3,500,000 common stock.  Three per cent. upon the debenture stock would involve an annual payment of £296,267. The payment of a dividend of 1 per cent. on the common stock would involve an annual payment of £35,257. The total amount, therefore, required to pay in full the debenture interest of the company plus a dividend of 1 per cent. upon the common stock would be £331,524.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The information I want to give the Dáil is that a dividend of 1 per cent. on the common stock would cost £35,257.  The Deputy can calculate for himself what 2 per cent., 3 per cent. or 4 per cent. would cost. But, if the company were to pay its debenture interest plus 1 per cent. on the common stock the total amount would be £331,524.  The reason I am giving that figure is because I want to draw attention to the fact that the lowest point at which the combined net revenues of both the Great Southern Railways Company and the Dublin United Transport Company ever reached in the past was £448,193. In the worst year of both companies, which was in fact the year 1938, when the Great Southern Railways Company was in a very precarious financial position and when the Dublin United Transport Company had not yet secured the benefit of the reorganisation which was then in progress, the combined net revenues reached that figure which I have mentioned&mdash; £448,193&mdash;and I want to mention that figure to bring it into comparison with the other figure I mentioned&mdash; £331,524&mdash;which represents the amount <Col N="836" /> required to pay the whole of the debenture interest plus 1 per cent. on the common stock.  It will be clear, therefore, that even on the basis of the lowest net revenue obtained by the company in pre-war years, the company's debenture interest is fully and adequately covered and that therefore the prospect of the Government having to make good its guarantee of that interest is, so far as one can see, reasonably remote.</P>

      <P>The total net revenue of the Great Southern Railways Company in 1943, before making provision for renewals and depreciation, for the writing off of certain stocks and work in progress, was £1,335,000.  That 1943 net revenue represented an increase of £675,000 upon the previous year.  That increase in the net revenue of the Great Southern Railways Company was due to some extent to increased passenger and goods traffic; it was due partly to higher rates of charge for transportation which came into operation in July of last year: it was however, in a very large measure due to managerial methods which offset <Col N="837" /> increases in the cost of operation, including the payment of emergency bonus to the employees of the company, and represents a real economy due to the application of efficient methods of management to the concern.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I could not.  However, for the purpose of illustrating my point, I can give another comparison which I think will be equally effective: The revenue expenditure of the Great Southern Railways Company last year increased by 5 per cent.  That represented the increase in wages paid in consequence of Emergency Bonus Orders, the increase in the costs of fuel and other equipment.  The only possible comparison we can make is with the Great Northern Railway Company.  The revenue expenditure of the Great Northern Railway Company increased in the same year by 13 per cent.  I am not making that comparison for the purpose of casting any reflection upon the efficiency of the management of the Great Northern Railway Company.  It will be obvious, I think, to most people who are familiar with both concerns, that there was much more scope for improvement in managerial methods in the Great Southern Railways Company than in the Great Northern Railway Company but if the increase in the revenue expenditure of the Great Southern Railways Company last year had been similar to the actual increase in the case of the Great Northern Railway Company, the difference in the net revenue would have been £375,000.  It will be clear, therefore, that the actual improvement in the revenue position of the Great Southern Railways Company, resulting from the application of better methods of management, alone increased the net revenue position by an amount more than sufficient to pay the whole of the debenture interest for which the new company will be liable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was quite obvious from certain <Col N="838" /> questions which Deputy McGilligan asked in the Dáil when the Bill was under discussion previously that there is a misunderstanding as to the intentions in respect of the redemption of the substituted debenture stock.  If the intention were to redeem the substituted debenture stock by equal annual payments, with additions to meet the tax chargeable thereon as well as to pay the debenture interest as it accrued and 1 per cent. on the common stock, the net revenue in future would require to exceed £1,119,000.  But there are other and more economical ways of reducing the capital burden, particularly in the case of the Great Southern Railways, where methods of working in the past have been wasteful, cumbersome and inefficient. In the discussions in May last I drew attention to what already had been done in the case of the Dublin United Transport Company, where substantial capital liabilities have been wiped out, where the revenue position has been considerably improved, where the basic wages of the workers have been increased by 24 per cent., exclusive altogether of the emergency bonus payable during the emergency, and where a substantial allocation has been made to a fund to provide benefits for the employees. I want to say that, in the case of the Great Southern Railways Company, there is far more scope for the application of the same methods and the same principles than there was in the case of the Dublin United Transport Company.  We believe that, by the application of the same methods, the same sound management both in relation to the ordinary operations of the company and its general financial affairs, it is possible to secure a similar lightening of the capital burden of the new company while, at the same time, making available funds to provide for the re-equipment of the concern, for the extension of its activities, and for the reduction of the rates and charges.</P>
    <P>I have given a very general picture of what the Bill intends to do.  It proposes to set up a national transport organisation, to give that national transport organisation, which will be <Col N="839" /> formed by the amalgamation of the Great Southern Railways Company and the Dublin United Transport Company, reasonable freedom of activity in commercial management, to make it subject only to the safeguards which are considered essential in the public interests to which I have referred, to give it the benefit of a substantial lightening of the burden of interest by the capital reorganisation scheme, to which the shareholders of the existing concerns have already agreed, to give it the benefit of a Government guarantee in respect of the new capital raised for reconstruction purposes, which will enable it to get that capital more easily and more cheaply than private concerns can attempt, and thus to place the management of the concern in a position that it will have, not merely the powers, but also the resources to carry out the transport reorganisation that we believe to be necessary in the national interest and which we desire to have proceeded with as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <P>I know that many members of the Dáil are concerned with the provisions of the Bill as they affect the staffs of the amalgamated companies and I just want to make some brief references to outstanding matters in that regard. All these matters can be discussed in detail in Committee and, if any Deputies have doubts concerning the provisions of the Bill, or require to make sure that the Bill has in fact the effect that its drafters intended, amendments can be submitted and debated.  One of the matters which aroused a great deal of discussion in May last was the provision for compensation on redundancy.  I made it clear that this Bill is intended to provide only for compensation to workers or employees of the existing companies who may be rendered redundant because of the amalgamation.  Some Deputies did not appreciate that Section 9 of the Railways Act of 1933, which provides for compensation on loss of employment in other circumstances, would continue in force or would apply to the new company.  We are concerned here only to safeguard individuals against loss of employment <Col N="840" /> by reason of redundancy resulting directly from the amalgamation and, because that was the intention, it was provided that that right of compensation would persist for six months. It was considered in framing the Bill that six months gave ample safeguard to the individuals concerned, because it is quite obvious that any redundancy which will occur will become apparent immediately the amalgamation occurs.</P>
    <P>There can be no comparison between the experience of the operations of the 1924 Act, which amalgamated 26 railway companies, all of which were operating railway services only, operating them in competition with one another and frequently in adjoining districts, with what is proposed here. The amalgamation of the 26 railway companies under the 1924 Act created a great deal of redundancy and, in fact, it was probable that some of the redundancy which resulted from that amalgamation would not become apparent for a number of years after the amalgamation occurred.  On that account, the Act provided for a period of seven years in which workers could claim compensation on loss of employment as a direct result of the amalgamation.  In this particular case, however, we are amalgamating two completely self-contained units, each of which is operating transport on a monopolistic basis in separate areas. It is quite clear, therefore, that there cannot be anything like the same experience as resulted from the 1924 Act, and that any redundancy that will result will be in the managerial and executive grades, not in the operative grades.  Such redundancy will become apparent at once and, for that reason, the six months' provision was regarded as adequate.  However, it really does not make any difference what period is in the Bill and, as I intimated previously, I am prepared to have the question of the adequacy of that provision debated in Committee and the Bill amended, if it appears to the Dáil desirable that it should be amended.</P>
    <P>I should like, however, Deputies to keep in mind that a great deal of unnecessary litigation may result from leaving the provisions of the Bill in respect of redundancy unduly ambiguous <Col N="841" /> and workers may be induced to incur expense in litigation, or the trade unions which cater for the workers may be compelled to incur expense in litigation, which it is desirable should be avoided by having a clear and precise definition of what the Bill intended to achieve in that regard.  I want to make it clear that the Bill is intended to achieve that redundancy resulting directly from amalgamation shall be covered by the compensation clause. The general provisions of the Railways Act, 1933, which applies to all railway companies, will apply equally to this new organisation and specific provision is made in order to secure that in the Bill itself.</P>
    <P>One of the obligations of the Great Southern Railways Company is to arrange the conditions of employment of its workers in accordance with agreements negotiated with the trade unions which represent these workers. I saw it stated in the Press during the course of the election campaign&mdash;one does not pay too much attention to things said then, but this particular statement requires some notice&mdash;that legal opinion had been secured by some of the railway unions to the effect that Section 55 of the 1924 Act did not apply to the new company. I have had that point examined and I am satisfied there is nothing in it.</P>
    <P>The legal advisers of the Government are quite specific in their belief that the obligation of the Great Southern Railways Company, both in regard to their railway employees under the 1924 Act and their transport employees under the 1933 Act, will be carried over, so far as conditions of employment are concerned, in relation to the new company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that cover Section 10?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Section 10 of the 1933 Act; that is also covered.  There is some slight doubt&mdash;and I am having the matter considered at the moment &mdash;as to whether the protection given <Col N="842" /> under the 1933 Act to employees of the railway company will also attach to employees of the Dublin United Transport Company after the amalgamation. Deputies will realise that the employees of the Dublin United Transport Company never had the same measure of protection which was extended to the employees of the Great Southern Railways Company under the 1933 Act.  It is intended that the same measure of protection shall now apply to employees of the Dublin United Transport Company as applied to employees of the Great Southern Railways Company.  The intention is that Section 10 will apply, not only to the employees taken over by the new company from the Great Southern Railways Company, but also to employees taken over from other transport companies which will be affected by this measure.</P>
      <P>I also want to make reference to the superannuation proposals.  The Bill, as framed in Sections 42 and 43, requires the new company to take over all the responsibilities of the amalgamated companies under existing superannuation schemes, and also to frame a scheme for such employees as are not covered by existing schemes. Deputies, I am sure, will have seen in the newspapers that the Great Southern Railways are bringing into operation a new superannuation scheme for certain of their employees who were not covered before this, and that may require a consequential change in the wording of the Bill.</P>

      <P>That is a different matter, but might I say that the Great Southern Railways Company have now brought forward a new scheme for the benefit of their own employees.  They have brought in this scheme themselves, and it is in the same category as a scheme that was introduced by the Dublin United Transport Company. They were under no statutory obligation to bring in that scheme, but they have done it themselves, and, as a result of the introduction of that scheme, it may be necessary to introduce certain changes in the Bill.  However, we can discuss these matters, or any changes in the Bill that may be necessary as a result of the introduction of the new scheme, when we come to discuss the Bill in Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made also to the Railway Clearing System Superannuation Fund.  I shall not deal with that matter now, because it is a most complicated subject and would take a very long time to discuss fully, but the intention of the company, as conveyed to me, is that none of the clerical staff will lose in the matter of their pension rights, by reason of the refusal of the Great Southern Railways Company to make the contribution to the fund which was required this year or last year.  If, however, Deputies wish to raise any specific point in connection with that matter, we can discuss it on the Committee Stage of the Bill. I think that we should be in a better position to deal with such matters on the Committee Stage than at present, <Col N="844" /> but in any case I should not like to go into that matter at the moment. I have read a large number of documents on the question of the Railway Clearing System Superannuation Fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure whether the age is 65 or 68&mdash;I think it is 68&mdash; but I think that in the past the company themselves made whatever additions were necessary.  However, there is a very complicated state of affairs there, in respect of which it is desired to ensure that no employee will lose and that whatever addition has to be made, in order to see that the employee will not lose, will be made.  The intention, so far as the staff of the new organisation is concerned, is, firstly, that in so far as the amalgamation of the two companies may involve some redundancy amongst their employees, they will be compensated in accordance with the proposals in the Bill; secondly, that the new company will have the same obligations as the old company in respect of new conditions of employment, in accordance with agreements with the trade unions concerned; and, thirdly, that superannuation rights will be guaranteed by Statute.  Whatever amendments Deputies think may be necessary in order to bring these conditions about can be considered better, I think, on the Committee Stage of the Bill.  I do not think it necessary to say anything more.  If Deputies think I have not said enough I can only refer them to what I said previously on this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are opposed to the Second Reading, not alone on the ground that we consider that the Minister is still rushing the matter but on the main general principles of the <Col N="845" /> Bill.  While opposing the Bill we entirely agree with the Minister that the national economic development of the country and, as he said himself, our effectiveness particularly in international trade, depend upon having an effective, cheap and adequate transport system in the country.  He may take it that we are fully at one with him in the aim to establish that particular type of transport system but we are as convinced as any Party can be, that this Bill is not going to provide it, particularly on the principles that he apparently advocates.  So far as one can judge from reading the debate on the last occasion this Bill was discussed, it would seem that the one principle the Minister was really standing on was the financial principle enshrined in the Bill.  I was not able to disentangle entirely the financial principle embodied in the Bill from the principle of the control and ownership of the company by the owners of the common stock and the Minister's remarks here to-night would indicate that he regards the principle of control and ownership embodied in the Bill as a principle that he would completely stand over although I think he indicated in the last Dáil that he was not entirely standing over it.  I believe that the financial proposals embodied in this Bill are going to hang such a weight on transport in this country that the system which it visualises will be bad, and that it is not going to provide these services that are essential here to keep the ordinary life of the country going in its development to that further production in the country that the presence of an adequate transport service would bring forth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, in making his Budget statement on the last occasion, referred to the shadow under which any Minister for Finance here would work with the contingent liability of the guarantee that is provided for in this Bill for the debenture holders.  He said that no Minister for Finance could assume without misgiving such a heavy liability.  Subsequently he went on to say that &ldquo;the possibility of having to meet that guarantee was one which must not be <Col N="846" /> forgotten in any pre-view of public expenditure during the financial years that lie immediately ahead&rdquo;.  When the Minister for Finance makes a statement of that nature he is not thinking of saving his own face. When he begins to feel anxiety as Minister for Finance, he is feeling anxiety, not for his own particular position or his own particular outlook but he is thinking of the financial posi tion of the country generally.  When the Minister for Finance to-day looks at the contingent liability which is likely to fall on the finances of the country as a result of this guarantee, he must feel that there is a bill there to be paid by somebody.</P>
    <P>I suggest that if a heavy burden on transport has to be borne by the users of transport it would be as disastrous to the country as if the burden were shifted over to the Minister for Finance.  As a matter of fact it might be a better safety valve if any undue burden on the transport users of the country had to be shifted over to the Minister for Finance because it would be clearly disclosed.  At present under cover of a war emergency a very heavy burden is imposed on users of transport and they are not able to kick against it.  It is damaging the position of the country very definitely.  If there is too great a burden for the maintenance of our transport system imposed on the people then we ought to see it in the clearest possible way.  When we consider how important the financial burden of the new capitalisation of this company is likely to be, I do not think the Minister has yet either adequately or fairly represented the position to the House.  I think he attempted to skip rather lightly over it in dealing with the matter to-day. I submit to the Minister it is not a matter that should be lightly skipped over.  If there is a principle to be supported in connection with the financing of transport under new conditions in this country, then we ought to see this principle clearly.  The fundamental point in connection with that principle is that it must provide cheap and adequate capital for the company.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was questioned <Col N="847" /> by Deputy McGilligan on the 9th May, with regard to the expenditure that would be necessary by the company to meet the stockholders of the Great Southern Railways Company under the new arrangement, he gave certain figures.  We find ourselves in this position, if we deal with the Great Southern Railways side of this arrangement, that the owners of the Great Southern Railways stock are being given debentures and common stock.  The amount of debentures to be held by them will amount to £8,048,000, while the common stock will total £3,525,000.  The Minister was asked what moneys would have to be made available in order to pay for that stock and to deal with redemption and he indicated that in the first year of the formation of the company the redemption provisions would require £640,800, that the interest on the debentures would require £241,457 and that the 1 per cent. interest on common stock would take £35,257, a total of £917,514.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy appreciates that that is dealing only with the Great Southern Railways Company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the House to be fully aware that I am dealing only with the Great Southern Railways Company, because it is only by dealing with the Great Southern Railways Company that we can get a picture of what the financial provisions really imply, and see how the ex-Great Southern Railways Company stockholders, who will be holding debentures in the new company, will have to be provided for. There is, as I have said, £640,800 to be provided for redemption of debentures and £241,457 for interest.  There is then a small amount to cover the 1 per cent. on common stock, amounting to £35,257.  The company, therefore, would have to put aside £917,514 in its first working year.  If page 139 of the Report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into Public Transport is looked up, it will be seen that the average net annual income of the Railways Company for the period dealt with there&mdash;1925 to 1938&mdash;was only £576,845. If we take the period from 1932 to 1938 the average net annual income was <Col N="848" /> only £453,000.  However, taking the average net annual income from 1925 to 1938, £576,845, it would mean that in order to make the payments of the provision that I mentioned in the first year, the new company would require £349,669 more than the net average income of these years up to 1938.  But if the deficit for renewals which this transport inquiry report showed was so desirable and which was estimated at £216,000, were to be provided for as well, then the amount that would be required over the net adjusted income of £576,000, would be £565,000, so that in the first year this new company was created, there would be required twice as much money as was available for this purpose in the years preceding the war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has given figures to show how enormously the receipts of the Great Southern Railways have risen during the war.  Does he not know that he has a whole department built up on the definite understanding that during war-time anybody with goods or services can get anything he wants to claim for them, and that it requires the most elaborate machinery of government, with almost Gestapo methods, to keep the charges made for either goods or services within any kind of reasonable bounds?  I do not think that, when we are considering what the future charges to be taken out of the people for transport of passengers or goods are to be, we ought to relate them to the war position but to the pre-war position, and I think it is essential that the Minister should take a period of, say, eight or ten years and sketch out in theory the payments which would have to be made for interest, the money which would have to be put aside for redemption, and some idea of the amounts required annually for renewals and which ought to be paid out of annual income, and let us know what payments have to be made or what moneys put aside for redemption, so that we could see how the income which had to come from the users of this transport compared with what we would regard as normal pre-war charges.  But we are asked to face, completely blindfolded, what the Minister on the last occasion said was the principle he stood over; but if we are <Col N="849" /> to use our intelligence on the question at all, on the figures and facts before us, we have to say that this scheme will impose on the people who use the transport system a burden which will choke them up and strangle both normal trade and the possible development of production.  Dealing with a matter of such great importance to the whole economic future of the country and at a critical time such as this, it is not fair to leave Parliament, which has to take decisions, in the blind state in which the Minister leaves it. I, therefore, condemn the Bill on what is there implied.</P>
    <P>Again, I condemn the proposals on the 3 per cent. for debentures provision. The price of money has very substantially decreased&mdash;certainly by much more than 25 per cent.&mdash;since these 4 per cent. debentures were first introduced&mdash;I do not know how long ago&mdash;and a scheme under which the Minister gives both debenture holders and stockholders 100 per cent. of their present holdings, and, in relation to that 100 per cent. of their present holdings, guarantees 3 per cent., I suggest to the Minister, completely ignores the whole trend of the money position, and the whole trend of the position with regard to interest in the world to-day. If we, particularly in a matter like this, which, if it is at all reasonably handled, cannot be regarded as piling up dead-weight debt&mdash;whether the company is to carry it out or the Government under a nationalised system&mdash; fix 3 per cent. as the guaranteed percentage of interest which we will give for money subscribed in large amount now, we are facing an impossible future from the point of view of the large amount of money which is to be spent in all kinds of other ways. We have heard of £8,000,000 for housing here and £25,000,000 for further housing, as well as £67,000,000 for something else.  If we propose to start, at this hour of the day, with a 3 per cent. interest rate for work related to the transport system of the country, I do not know where we will stand.  We are likely to choke off all development in the country.</P>
    <P>Taking the position of money generally in the country, we find that the <Col N="850" /> deposits in the banks have increased by £56,000,000, from £114,000,000 in September, 1939, to £170,000,000 in December, 1943, and that the total amount of money in the country has increased from about £18,000,000 to £36,000,000, or by approximately £17,000,000.  The total circulation, deposits and money in the country have increased by almost 55 per cent., and if we are to accept a position in which we are to put all the increased money for housing, railways improvement, and any other development on a kind of dole of 3 per cent., then, so far as the houses we are to build for ordinary workers are concerned, we are going to put an unnecessarily increased rent on them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Money was never available for house construction at as low a rate as 3 per cent. at any time in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It ought to be available now.  It was available for running the last war at 5 per cent.  The present war is being run on something like 2 per cent. or less, and one of the things which the people who are running the present war are bewailing is the fact that they had not as much sense when running the last war and when working after the last war as they have now, as a result of their very costly experience.  The point I am making is that the Minister is offering 3 per cent. to debenture holders who invested money at 4 per cent. when the last war was being run on a 5 per cent. basis.  He is offering that 3 per cent. now as a great contribution towards saving the State money, when the cost of running a war has been reduced from 5 to less than 2 per cent.  Do we accept the position that we are to hang all this new money which has been accumulated in this country around the necks of people who have to work and produce?  Money has been increasing in the country, but the people who have to work and who will be the producers of the country have been fading out of it.  What is being provided for here is that the money will have to be maintained, will have to be put on a substantial living, whether we call it a dole or anything <Col N="851" /> else, and we are hanging an unnecessarily high rate of interest around all constructive effort in the country if we maintain the situation we are proposing to maintain in this measure of giving debenture holders 3 per cent.</P>
      <P>The people who are to get this money are people whose property was in a condition which need not be elaborately described.  There is a simple reference to it in a statement by the Minister. The Minister, as reported at column 1788, volume 93 of the Official Reports, said with regard to the Great Southern Railways Company:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It was unable then to find from revenue, that is, the income it obtained by the sale of transport facilities, sufficient funds to provide adequately for the maintenance and improvement of its equipment.  It was incapable of procuring new capital on reasonable terms to finance new developments.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was the position in which it actually was, but the work that required to be done is stated by the Minister in column 1798 of the same volume.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The provision of cheap and efficient transport facilities in our circumstances involves, so far as railway transport is concerned, at any rate, over the greater part of the State, an almost complete scrapping of existing transport equipment. The railway equipment which Córas Iompair Eireann&mdash;the corporation which it is proposed to establish under this Bill&mdash;will acquire from the Great Southern Railways Company is very largely obsolete.  Not merely is it largely obsolete, but it is to an entirely uneconomic extent unstandardised.  It will be necessary, at the earliest moment, for whatever organisation we set up to take over the responsibility of transport operations, to replace the existing equipment with new equipment, designed to meet modern requirements, standardised to secure economy in maintenance and adequate to meet all the demands upon it.  If our transport organisation, set up as a result of legislation enacted here, is to provide <Col N="852" /> such new equipment, it must be able to command new capital freely and cheaply.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the condition of the property in respect of which the Minister is proposing to compensate the owners of debenture and preference and ordinary shares by a full grant, a grant at 100 per cent. of the shareholding that they had in the company before the war.  I consider, again, that the giving of compensation of that particular measure is entirely unwarranted, and is one of the things which will tend to hang a load of expense around the new company if it is formed in the way in which the Minister proposes to form it.</P>
    <P>Again, the Minister proposes that the ownership of this company should ultimately be in the hands of the owners of the common stock, and the owners of the common stock are going to be the owners of the ordinary stock, the owners of the 4 per cent. preference stock and, to the extent of one-half, the owners of the 4 per cent. guaranteed preference stock&mdash;the owners of £3,525,734 worth of stock in the old Great Southern Railways are going to be the real owners of the new company that the Minister is setting up, when the company has utilised whatever new debenture stock it is raising and has improved and developed the property, and has paid it back.  An examination of the figures given in the Transport Tribunal Report would show that the owners of the common stock of the Great Southern Railways Company were paid in dividends moneys amounting practically to the full amount of their holdings, I think, during the period from about 1931 down to 1938, which had never been earned, because they had left the company in the condition described by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the paragraph I read just now, on the one hand, and they had taken over £3,000,000 worth of money out of the company when, from the point of view of maintaining the company and carrying out the necessary repairs, that money should not have been taken out at all.  It is not for us here, I agree, to say what should be given by way of compensation either to the debenture holders or preference <Col N="853" /> holders or holders of ordinary stock in the Great Southern Railways Company, but on the face of it we would have to say that it is more than generous to give the compensation that is provided for in this measure here, and the result of that generosity on the part of the Minister is, in my opinion, hanging a serious burden of debt around the new company.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in introducing his Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce the other day, advised us to read the British White Paper published recently on employment policy.  I welcome the Minister's invitation, because it does give us an indication we had not got before to look to the world outside and to see what is happening in the world outside. I am grateful for the Minister's invitation, because I think it will help us to get something like a common language and to get something like a base line to which we can refer some of our discussions here.  We have been very sadly lacking in base lines either of fact or of theory in any kind of a reasonable or reasoned way in this country, but outside, and particularly in Britain, over an enormous range of ground, examinations have taken place and facts and theories have been set out, which, while we need not necessarily say they are the last word in theory and facts which bear on this country here, nevertheless give us a kind of base line to which we can relate our line of thought, and even our smaller array of facts.  When we do look outside and see what people are thinking of, we find that one of the things which are dominant in people's minds is that, whatever have been the achievements of the policy of free capitalism in years gone by, and they have been enormous&mdash;the population of Europe, I think, has risen in the nineteenth century from about 180,000,000 at the beginning of the century to something like 430,000,000 at the end, and all that increased population has been sustained at an increased standard of living in Europe as a result of the achievements of capitalism over the century&mdash;it is admitted that the policy of free capitalism cannot deal with the problems of the present time, and that in <Col N="854" /> Russia, on the one hand, where over a particular period national income has been enormously increased, and in Germany, on the other hand, where over another period the biggest unemployment problem the world ever faced was fairly successfully dealt with, they have shown economic ways of dealing with things that have something in them which the modern world requires, and, while they have been associated with political movements and political actions of a kind we do not want here, nevertheless it has been insisted that we have to look to what has been happening in other countries which have solved their big economic problems, and that we have to do something to add to the general economic scheme that operated during the nineteenth century.</P>
    <P>In looking into the future, thinking people indicate that there is definitely a clear dividing line between private enterprise on the one hand and Government activity on the other.  It is implied that the Government will have to interfere with and control more and more the general atmosphere in which economic business is carried on, that there will be directions in which, say, the Government will have to take complete control.  We are heading for disaster of one kind or another if there is not a clear line drawn somewhere between Government responsibility for carrying on work on the one hand and private enterprise on the other, because various statements made by Ministers will show how they are agreed on that.  I think that the main spring we require in the development of our national work is individual incentive which to a certain extent, arises out of this problem, and that it is only where there is work to be done, or projects to be placed, that are outside the capacity of the individual or combinations of individuals to achieve, the Government should step in, or where social interests of one kind or another are involved.  But, at any rate, it is being more and more appreciated that the profit-interest must be left clear inside its own definite sphere, and that the social interest must be left clear on the other side.  We must fix responsibility on the Government <Col N="855" /> side and leave people who are carrying on private industry perfectly clear.</P>
    <P>The Minister is proposing in this Bill to have complete Government control. He talked about the Bill wiping away archaic controls over the railway company. I would like to know what they are or what disabilities any company would suffer from with a shadow over it of the controls that the Minister proposes here with regard to the appointment of his chairman with the control of rates and charges and the right to dictate how certain services will be run, and, generally, that the public interest or general Government policy will be served.  A native speaker of the English language called a scheme somewhat similar to the Minister's scheme, when it was proposed some time ago in Great Britain by Mr. Herbert Morrison, &ldquo;bastard socialism&rdquo;&mdash;a scheme under which private owners owned property but were not allowed to run it.</P>

      <P>He was a native English speaker, talking in his native language.  I suggest to the Minister that the proposed control in this scheme is utterly absurd; that it shows a lack of faith and confidence both in Parliament and in the Government to propose such a scheme as this.  The people the Minister would make owners of the new company are those who let the old Great Southern Railways Company sink to the low position it reached.  It is the representatives of the stockholders who owned that company in the past and let it sink that he is going to put in under this Bill with a Government-appointed chairman to provide the stimulus and initiative which will be required in the future and which the Government cannot be expected to give.  The chairman, appointed by the Government, will have complete powers to run everything in his own way: to be a quorum and to ignore any recommendations put up to him.  The stimulus required is to come from the representatives of stockholders, and we know what they have shown themselves to be in the past.  The Minister thinks <Col N="856" /> they are the people to advise the captain in the ship how he is to get 6 per cent. profit out of the undertaking.  I think the scheme is fantastic and entirely unwarranted.  Why should there be provision for ownership, and especially for the people for whom it is made?  I think that the railway situation&mdash;I am taking it that it has been properly described by the Minister&mdash; has been brought to its present position by private management.  It is such that the Minister cannot find any other way of dealing with it except for the Government to take over control. Whether that is to be done on the Electricity Supply Board model, or by a Government Department, is a matter for consideration.  I do not think that in the present circumstances, with the type of contribution that has been made to maintain transport by private persons, that private persons can do that job to-day, working from that foundation and particularly into an unknown future.</P>
      <P>The Minister tells us that this is his first post-war measure.  He gave us the financial side of things first.  What we really want first is the economic side, and particularly the technical side, of things.  We all admit that no one is quite clear as to what form of transport the technicians will declare to be the most suitable type for this country immediately after the war.  Even highly developed countries are not able to say that at the moment.  With the difficulties that we are labouring under at the present time, we might very well get our technicians to help us with our present system until the situation, from the technical aspect, clears a bit.  For that reason, I think the situation is such that the Government should take over the railways directly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of other things that ought, perhaps, be discussed.  It is difficult to do so satisfactorily, except in Committee.  I suggest two things.  The first is that the compensation to be paid to the stockholders of the Great Southern Railways Company should be fixed by a commission set up for the purpose.  The second point is that, in the condition in which the railways are and with the work <Col N="857" /> that will be required to be done by the new capital as well as the cheapness of the transport that we will require in the future, it is inequitable to the public, in my opinion, to give full compensation to the stockholders in the way the Minister proposes.  If the Minister, on taking over and buying out the stockholders, gave full compensation to the debenture holders and half compensation to the other stockholders, and borrowed the money to do so, he would have to borrow £11,574,000.  Paying off the debenture holders in full and the other stockholders in half, he would have something like £2,250,000 left, which could be added to carry out the improvements and renewals that the Transport Inquiry Report suggested should be carried out at the present time.</P>
    <P>This is the kind of scheme in which the Minister should face up, with a fresh mind, to what the future financial policy of the world is likely to be. With the enormous increase in the amount of money that has arisen during the war, and with the changed relations of the banks to Government, there is another theory developing in the world outside&mdash;that is, that the joint stock banks are beginning to have the same relation to Government as the Bank of England has to the Treasury, and that in the future the function of the banks will be to hold and receive the savings of the people and to lend them to Government.  I think the Minister should be able, under present conditions, to approach the banks here and get the £11,500,000 from them at 2 per cent., and so lay a foundation for a correct modern financial policy in the country.</P>
    <P>Unless we examine the financial theories upon which we are going to face the future, and do so in relation to the Bill before us now, we will miss one of the greatest opportunities of putting our whole national house in order that is likely to arise in our generation.  In dealing with one of the most important services in the country, which is vital to our people and to the development of our national resources, we are driven to deal with our whole outlook on national policy, and we are also driven to deal with the other question&mdash;that, <Col N="858" /> in our organisation in the future, we must have a clear line of demarcation between Government responsibility for carrying out certain classes of work and where private initiative and energy will have full and free place.</P>
    <P>These are matters in which, I suggest, the Government is as interested as any Party or individual Deputy.  It is because there are these important matters to be dealt with that we object to the tendency to force this measure through the House that characterises the Minister's attitude so much.  We earnestly plead that these matters be given full attention, so that, in the autumn, when the House is discussing the Committee Stage of this Bill, we will be informed in every possible way that the Government can inform us on the situation.  The Government must encourage us and help us to get our facts and our theories right, so that, in a matter that is of vital importance and that affects the country in so many different ways, we will at least have the benefit of knowing that every aspect of the matter will be thoroughly discussed here in Parliament, with everybody so assisted in every way and so assisting one another in every way, that we will see clearly the problem that is before us and bring the best possible solution to bear on it.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to take issue with Deputy Mulcahy as to whether the eventual ownership of the new company shall be invested nominally in the stockholders of the £4,000,000 capital&mdash;the common stockholders&mdash;but I do seriously suggest that the new company means that the taxpayers of this country will have to pay £16,000,000 plus the interest on that for the next 16 years, to a total amounting to £20,000,000 for the next 20 years, apart from the cost of materials, labour and other expenses to meet the dividends due to this venture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In launching this project, the Minister seems to be very enthusiastic about present conditions.  From long experience of railway life, I do suggest that the present is very false material to go upon, in trying to decide what the future may hold.  He would be a <Col N="859" /> complete dud in railway control who would not make a success of rail transport at the present time, when the difficulty is not to find traffic but to find vehicles to carry it.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with the origin of the Dublin United Transport Company, which is the other component part of the new company.  Inside the past ten years, the Dublin United Transport Company was in sore financial straits.  The present wizard who is to take control of the joint company, and who is performing extraordinary miracles at present in the Great Southern Railways, was one of those who opposed the Dublin United Transport Company as controller of the General Omnibus Company.  There were various contending interests at that time which made it impossible for the Dublin United Transport Company to be a success, and these contending factors had to be fought on the prices dictated by the contenders. The present chairman was one who successfully fought his own corner.</P>

      <P>The General Omnibus Company was one of the contenders against the Dublin United Transport Company, with several others, and it was up to them, in view of their business capacity, to make the business good.  They were eventually absorbed into the Dublin United Transport Company, and were brought in at their own price.  Then we had prosperity in <Col N="860" /> the Dublin United Transport Company. A similar procedure was adopted in the Great Southern Railways.  They bought all and sundry of the contenders who came up against them and then, with the existing position, they were successful and prosperous, with the absence of competitors, as traffic is driven to the Great Southern Railways. I suggest that that is a very false basis on which to build our future hopes regarding transport.</P>
      <P>The Minister paints a very roseate picture of the future in this matter, but when we are committing ourselves to expense we should have regard, in retrospect, to the history of transport both in the Great Southern Railways and in the Dublin United Transport Company.  We have been trying for a long time to overcome transport difficulties in this country.  The Minister himself has contributed very largely and enthusiastically, and has given of his best since he became Minister, in trying to overcome the difficulties of the transport industry.  We had experience of the position in 1924 and 1926, and when the Minister came in in 1933.  With all these efforts he has not been able to make a success of it.</P>
      <P>We are asked to believe that this Bill is the be-all and end-all of a transport millennium in this country and we are entitled to be somewhat sceptical on that point.  We want to know whether the Minister is warranted and justified in committing the nation to the expenditure of this £16,000,000, with its consequential expenditure, I suggest, of £20,000,000, to be paid out in the next 16 years, apart from the cost of materials and various other things.  I am not satisfied that it is warranted expenditure and, if it is to be embarked upon, I say it should not be on behalf of a private company.  I think the owners should be the nation and then there would be no objection to it run as a national entity, but there is certainly objection to it being run in the interests of any private company.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
