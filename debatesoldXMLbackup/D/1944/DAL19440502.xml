      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  In moving the Second Reading of this Bill, I think I should preface my observations by stating that this is a Bill designed to facilitate a long-term transport policy, and has no special relationship to the transport difficulties which have been created for this country by the emergency, difficulties which have become so accentuated in recent weeks. The policy which this Bill is intended to facilitate will not come into full effect until the emergency has passed, and its enactment will not minimise in any way the present transport difficulties.  I should like to urge Deputies to consider the Bill, and determine their attitude towards it, as part of our post-war plans.  It is in every way unfortunate that the introduction of this Bill should coincide with a temporary transport crisis.  I expect that Deputies will not find it easy to forget the present acute difficulties in considering the Bill, and each of us will find it hard to visualise the transport circumstances in relation to which this Bill is designed.  In considering the arrangements which it is desirable to make in relation to the <Col N="1786" /> post-war situation, we are dealing with something we cannot foresee with any exactitude, and we are likely, therefore, to allow the picture&mdash;the mental picture which we draw for ourselves&mdash; to be coloured by present circumstances. It may help to mark the acute distinction between the circumstances now existing and the circumstances which existed in relation to transport before the emergency&mdash;and which may exist in relation to transport after the emergency&mdash;if I point out that, in giving evidence to the Railway Tribunal, one of the major transport operators in the country stressed the view that their problems and the problems of other companies engaged in public transport, arose out of what they then described as an uneconomic excess of transport facilities.  Nobody will suggest that we are suffering from an excess, uneconomic or otherwise, of transport facilities now.</P>
      <P>I know that some Deputies and some members of the public have had suspicions that some of the measures which were adopted to deal with the emergency transport difficulties, particularly the measures relating to road transport, were designed with an eye to a long-term transport policy.  It is probable that the publication of the detailed provisions of this Bill will have removed those suspicions, but in case there are any lingering doubts on that matter, I should like to emphasise that this Bill represents the whole of the transport policy which the Government has in mind.  I should like particularly to stress that this Bill was not framed with any intention other than to deal with a situation which will be similar in essence to that which existed in 1938, when the decision to establish a transport tribunal was taken.  I should like also to emphasise that the current restrictions on railway transport were not even contemplated when the Bill was being drafted.  Further, I should like to express the hope that these restrictions can be withdrawn before the end of the emergency.  I should like even to express the hope that it may be possible to modify them before the Bill is passed, although the expression of that hope is probably unwise because the grounds for it are all too slender.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1787" /> Deputies may ask why a Bill which is designed to facilitate a long-term transport policy and which cannot become effective in its results on the transport situation until after the war should be proceeded with now, why the Government should take the risks involved in having this measure debated in the atmosphere of a temporary transport crisis.  The answers to that question are twofold: The Government contemplates that the immediate post-war situation will be one of critical significance in the future economic development of the country.  It is our view that we should get ourselves organised now in every important economic sphere to face the problems and to avail of the opportunities which that post-war period may bring.  It is contemplated that other measures to that end will also be introduced.  I think it will be common ground amongst us that cheap and efficient public transport facilities are vital to national economic development.  The Government, holding that view strongly, considers that it is desirable to bring into existence now the organisation which will be responsible for the provision of these facilities after the war, assuming that it is common ground amongst us that such an organisation does not now exist.  It is deemed desirable that the officers of that new organisation should know that they will have the responsibility, that no further legislative changes are contemplated, and should be able to perfect their plans with the knowledge that they will have available to them the powers and the financial resources necessary to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>It is for these reasons that the Government decided to proceed with the preparation of this measure.  It took that decision last year, aiming to have the Bill come into effect in the middle of the present year.  As Deputies are aware, the preparation of the measure involved the submission to the shareholders of the existing transport organisations of proposals which affected their interests.  The Bill has been framed with the operative date of 1st July.  It is the view of the Government that, because of the nature of the Bill and because of the publicity <Col N="1788" /> already given to its more important provisions, its enactment should not be delayed.  It was on that ground that it was deemed desirable to proceed with the measure despite the new transport difficulties which have developed so rapidly since the Bill got its First Reading in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>If it should not prove practicable to secure the enactment of the measure so as to permit of the operative date being the 1st July, then, for a number of reasons relating to the finances of the Bill and other matters, the operative date would have to be postponed to the 1st January.  A date commencing at the beginning of a half year would be necessary.</P>
    <P>It is for these reasons the Government decided that it was desirable to proceed with the Bill, but when introducing it here it is presumably necessary to demonstrate why any Bill is considered necessary.  Why is it, in the view of the Government, desirable that we should have new transport legislation?  I think that it will be generally agreed in the House, and I am sure it will be generally agreed throughout the country that the prewar position in respect of our public transport services was thoroughly unsatisfactory. Outside the municipal area of Dublin, the public transport facilities were neither efficiently directed nor sufficiently extensive nor cheap enough to promote national economic welfare.  The main transport operator, the Great Southern Railways, Company, was in a precarious financial position in the months immediately preceding the commencement of the war.  It was unable then to find from revenue, that is, the income it obtained by the sale of transport facilities, sufficient funds to provide adequately for the maintenance and improvement of its equipment.  It was incapable of procuring new capital on reasonable terms to finance new developments. The Railway Tribunal in its report stated bluntly that the company's financial position was such that it was not possible in the circumstances then existing to raise further capital through ordinary commercial channels. In fact, it appeared to be rapidly approaching a situation in which it could <Col N="1789" /> not even meet its running expenses, that is, find from its gross revenue sufficient funds to pay the wages of its employees, the cost of fuel and other equipment, and meet its debenture interest.</P>
    <P>The Government was, therefore, forced to recognise, in 1938, that the earlier transport legislation which we had introduced and enacted in 1932 and 1933 had not produced the results which were then anticipated.  The reasons why that legislation failed to produce the anticipated results I will deal with later.  In 1938 the Government had to face the fact that the results anticipated from the earlier legislation had not emerged and that new transport legislation was required. That decision of the Government in 1938 led to the establishment in December of that year of the Transport Tribunal.  The Transport Tribunal's Report was submitted to the Government in 1939 and was published some time later.  I should like to advise Deputies who are anxious to familiarise themselves with the nature of our peace-time transport problem to study that report.  They will find in it a wealth of historical and statistical data which will be very useful to them. It was, I think, one of the most informative reports ever published.</P>
    <P>It may, of course, be contended that, despite the disappointment of the Government with the results of the 1932 and 1933 legislation, new legislation was not essential, that the unsatisfactory situation was due to incompetent management of the Great Southern Railways Company and that, given better management, the situation could be remedied without new legislation or without Government interference. The Government was unable to accept that point of view It had, of course, no power under statute to enforce changes in the management or in the organisation of the Great Southern Railways Company. It had no evidence that such changes would be made by that company on its own initiative.  It had no belief that changes of management and organisation within the framework of the Great Southern Railways Company would suffice to overcome the bad traditions <Col N="1790" /> of the organisation, or to promote, with sufficient speed, the development of a sound outlook within it, upon its own responsibility to the nation and its functions in relation to national and economic development.  It did not believe that any scheme based upon the Great Southern Railways Company would inspire public confidence.</P>
    <P>It was also forced to recognise, because of the circumstances to which I have referred, which were revealed by the report of the Transport Tribunal, and admitted by the management of the Great Southern Railways Company, concerning the difficulty of that organisation in procuring fresh capital, that any transport reorganisation scheme involving new capital of substantial measure could not be operated, unless the Government was prepared to assist in finding that capital, and it will be recognised and, I am sure, agreed by the Dáil, that if the Government accepted any financial obligations in relation to the undertaking, it should necessarily, in the interest of the taxpayers, also undertake the duty of supervising the company's management. The Government, therefore, decided that the situation was such that it could not be met merely by patching up the Great Southern Railways Company, that it needed a new organisation, with a new legislative basis; a new financial structure, a new relationship with the Government and the public, and even a new name to signalise the break with the old traditions.</P>
    <P>It may help Deputies to understand why the Government arrived at that decision, if I give a brief history of the transport legislation of this State since it was established.  Deputies will find in the report of the Transport Tribunal, to which I referred, a much fuller account of that legislation and of the aims of those who drafted it.  The principal landmarks in our transport legislation since 1924 are the Railways Act, 1924, the Railways Act, 1933, the Road Transport Act, 1932, and the Road Transport Act, 1933.  The Railways Act of 1924 provided for the incorporation in the Great Southern Railways Company by a process of absorption or amalgamation of 26 <Col N="1791" /> separate railway concerns which, at that time, operated exclusively in the area of this State.  The amalgamation secured by the Act of 1924 had the effect of keeping open for traffic for a time a number of lines which would otherwise have been obliged to close, and it resulted also in considerable economies in railway working.  I would not like to suggest that all the economies which were subsequently enforced proved by experience to have been wise.  Some of these economies, I think, proved unwise.  I refer to such measures as the singling of the main line to Galway.  I think those familiar with our transport problems will now admit that that was a mistake, and that the board of the new company, when established, will, at some stage, have to consider whether it is desirable to undo that.  Apart from these matters, there were substantial economies in railway expenditure secured as a result of the amalgamation of these separate 26 railway undertakings. This reduction of railway expenditure, however, did not produce a corresponding reduction in railway charges.  It failed to do so by reason of the development of public services operated on the roads, which began about 1924 and developed with very great intensity in the following years. The Act of 1924 contemplated that the Railway Tribunal which was established by that Act, with the functions given to it under that Act, should prepare a scale of charges for various classes of traffic which, if made operative, would secure for the Great Southern Railways Company&mdash;the company which emerged from the amalgamation of 1924&mdash;a pre-determined standard of revenue of £1,170,000 which, it was estimated, would be sufficient to permit the normal renewal expenditure of the company, and also provide for the payment of debenture interest and a reasonable dividend upon the various classes of stock.  Because of the development of road transport, to which I have referred, the company never found it possible to enforce the standard charges determined by the Railway Tribunal, except in respect of <Col N="1792" /> a very small proportion of its traffic, with the result that the financial position of the company deteriorated seriously and rapidly.</P>
    <P>When the present Government came into office the financial position of the company was so critical that it was obvious that further steps would have to be taken.  It was decided then, in consequence of the new transport situation which had developed from the mass production of road transport vehicles, that there was no prospect of the Great Southern Railways Company ever earning sufficient revenue to remunerate the capital of £26,000,000 with which it was incorporated in 1924.  The Railways Act, 1933, effected a compulsory reduction of that capital of £26,000,000 to something under £12,500,000.  When considering the provisions of this Bill I should like Deputies to keep in mind that figure of £26,000,000, which represents the original capital of the Great Southern Railways Company, and which was in itself a substantial reduction upon the aggregate capital of all the companies which had been amalgamated with the Great Southern Railways Company. This Bill should be examined in relation to the legislation that has gone before.  The Act of 1933, enacted against the will of the shareholders of that company, and despite a great deal of agitation in financial quarters, effected a compulsory reduction of the capital of the undertaking by more than half, from £26,000,000 to £12,500,000, the balance of the capital being written off.  It was regarded as lost capital represented by closed branches, unremunerative equipment and other losses which could not be recovered.</P>
    <P>Up to 1932 it was open to any person to operate a road transport business. There was, in fact, a period in which anybody could engage in a road transport business except the statutory transport operators.  The only people who were, by legislation, prevented from operating on the roads at a certain period were the railway companies and the Dublin United Tramways Company as it then was.  The result of that situation&mdash;the unrestricted <Col N="1793" /> operation of road transport businesses&mdash;was, from every point of view, unsatisfactory.  Not merely did these road transport businesses spring up in great number, not merely did their number result in very unsatisfactory conditions of employment for those engaged upon them, as I am sure Labour Deputies will remember, but they had very serious repercussions upon railway services.  The Road Transport Act, 1932, imposed upon all road passenger business a measure of control by means of a licensing system which was designed to limit new entrants into that business and secure improved standards of operation. That Act also granted to the statutory companies additional powers to engage in road transport themselves: to engage in road transport both for passengers and for merchandise, and gave them power also to acquire, by agreement, other undertakings engaged in road transport.</P>
    <P>The Road Transport Act of 1933 dealt with merchandise road transport services as distinct from the passenger services dealt with by the Act of 1932, and it had practically the effect of confining the operation of merchandise road transport services&mdash;that is the carriage of goods for reward on the roads outside certain defined port areas&mdash;to the statutory companies or to persons who got under that Act a licence to engage in that business. The issue of these licences was confined to persons who had been engaged in the business of operating a merchandise service on the road before the passing of the Act.  The Act provided also for the compulsory acquisition of passenger and merchandise licences by the statutory companies.</P>
    <P>It was contemplated that that legislation would enable these statutory companies to put themselves into the position in which they could achieve not merely financial security for themselves but also the main transport aim of the Government, which was to ensure that there would exist transport facilities extensive enough and cheap enough to promote national economic development.  When in 1938 it was obvious that the aims of the Government in enacting that legislation had not been secured, the Transport Tribunal <Col N="1794" /> was set up.  It was set up by resolution of the Dáil and Seanad to inquire into the position of public transport in general, and in particular into the circumstances contributing to the unfavourable financial position of the railway companies.  The principal recommendations of the majority of the members of that tribunal, in so far as they related to the Great Southern Railways Company, were that the existing board of seven part-time elected directors operating through a general manager should be replaced for an experimental period of five years by a board of three members, consisting of a chairman nominated by the Government, and two shareholders' directors, the board to be assisted by two whole-time controllers.  It recommended that the company's borrowing powers should be increased, and that the Government should guarantee the issue of £1,250,000 debenture stock.  It recommended the creation of a special fund to be raised through the imposition of additional taxation upon motor vehicles, that fund to be available to meet any deficit in respect of the Great Southern Railways Company debenture interest.  The Transport Tribunal found, in effect, that the difficulties and the ineffectiveness of the Great Southern Railways Company were due, in large measure, to its failure to reorganise its business so as to bring the most modern methods into proper perspective, or into coordination with, or where necessary in substitution of, the older facilities.  The provisions of the Transport Acts of 1932 and 1933 had not, it reported, been applied with efficiency or foresight, and the undertaking, they said, still remained one of unequally developed, unco-ordinated and, sometimes, antagonistic parts.  The same state of affairs existed in the Dublin United Tramways Company up to the year 1935, about which time, however, the company began effectively to apply the policy of the Road Transport Acts and to become, in a fuller sense, a transport company.</P>
    <P>It will be noted by Deputies who have studied the report of the Transport Tribunal that it recommended only temporary measures, and, in effect, postponed the finding of a permanent <Col N="1795" /> solution of the problem they were investigating.  The provisions of this Bill will indicate that the Government did not consider its recommendations adequate for the situation.  The Government, therefore, decided that new legislation was desirable.  In framing legislation, the first matter to be considered is the aim to be achieved by that legislation.  I think we will find that there is amongst the various members of the Dáil not very substantial differences of opinion as to what the aims of all transport legislation should be, and the purpose we should try to serve by reorganising the transport situation generally.  It is the belief of the Government that the maximum development of the nation's economic resources and of its economic potentialities requires the provision of public transport facilities so extensive, so related to the varied needs of different localities and different industries, and so co-ordinated and directed as will provide the best possible services at the least cost to the community. That, I think, will be agreed as a general statement of policy.  There may not be similar agreement concerning the Government's belief that a fully developed transport system operating on road and railway, extending into all parts of the country, and providing in all parts of the country full transport facilities, can be operated on a remunerative basis.  I mean by that, earning from the sale of transport facilities sufficient revenue to cover all its operating costs and its overhead expenses to meet the interest charges upon its capital, and to provide, over and above, the reserves which are necessary to finance its further development.</P>
    <P>The Government does not believe in subsidised transport facilities.  I think it will help Deputies if I make that as clear as I possibly can.  It is not merely that the Government objects to having placed upon it the onus of imposing taxation to secure revenue with which to finance transport subsidies. Even if there were no Budgetary difficulties, even if we could get the agreement of all Parties in the House as to the taxes to be imposed for that purpose, the Government would oppose <Col N="1796" /> any such proposition, because it does not believe in subsidised transport.  It sees no advantage whatever in saddling the industry and agriculture of the country with new taxation for the purpose of subsidising transport facilities. It believes that subsidised transport will inevitably mean inefficient transport and will ultimately result in an increase in the cost of transport to the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>Our national economic development requires that our public services, including our transport services, should be thoroughly efficient.  It requires also that they should be self-supporting. The burden which is placed upon trade and industry by inefficient public services&mdash;and particularly by inefficient transport services&mdash;would not be any lighter if we decided to subsidise transport, if we reduced transport charges to an uneconomic level and made good the difference by imposing an additional burden in another form, a form of taxation upon the country's producers. If for any temporary reason we acquiesce now in a transport policy based upon subsidies, we will, in the belief of the Government, have placed shackles upon the national progress, shackles which will have to be painfully removed at some future time.</P>
    <P>The Government does not believe in the efficacy of competition in promoting efficiency in public transport services. Whatever theoretical case may be made for competition in encouraging efficiency or stimulating enterprise in other commercial spheres, it can, in relation to transport, undermine the stability of the services which are necessary to the national commercial life and it can, in its effect, do irreparable damage to the public interest. The Government believes, as its earlier legislation demonstrated and as many public statements by members of the Government have emphasised, that the maintenance of our railway services, now and in the future, is the kernel of our transport problem.  Our experience during the war years has clearly demonstrated that the railways remain the backbone of our transport system, and it is the Government's view that no transport policy is sound unless it makes ample provision for <Col N="1797" /> the maintenance of the main line railway services.  To make provision for that purpose, the only practicable method is to secure for them sufficient traffic to permit of their profitable operation.</P>
    <P>We had these aims in mind when we were preparing the legislation of 1932 and 1933.  If that legislation did not achieve those aims, it was because we made then the mistake of assuming that the transport companies which were favoured by that legislation would take full advantage of the opportunities then given.  They failed to do so.  That fact became clearly recognisable as early as 1938.  If Deputies criticise the provisions of this Bill on the grounds that the Great Southern Railways Company failed to give satisfactory services in the past, failed to give those services despite the quasi-monopoly situation which was created for them by legislation, I will reply that it is precisely because that company did not rise to its opportunities and to its responsibilities that new legislation is now necessary, legislation which provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for the disappearance of that company.</P>
    <P>These were, and are, the aims of the Government's transport policy.  If we can get agreement upon those aims, we can proceed with the consideration of this Bill solely upon the basis as to whether the machinery the Bill proposes to create is the best that can be devised to secure their achievement. We can, I think, however, go further than that in determining what would be common ground, as between the various Parties in this Houses, in relation to transport legislation and, in fact, common ground to all schemes for transport reorganisation.  There are certain essential things, in the public interest, which must be provided for in any transport scheme. Whether we decide to proceed upon the basis of nationalised transport or a public transport company or independent private operators, there are safeguards which must be inserted, in order to ensure that the public interests are protected against the transport operators, no matter who they may be.</P>
    <P>I have already stressed the importance <Col N="1798" /> which the Government places upon the provision of cheap and efficient transport facilities, in relation to the future economic development of our country.  The provision of cheap and efficient transport facilities in our circumstances involves, so far as railway transport is concerned, at any rate, over the greater part of the State, an almost complete scrapping of existing transport equipment.  The railway equipment which Córas Iompair Éireann&mdash;the corporation which it is proposed to establish under this Bill&mdash;will acquire from the Great Southern Railways Company is very largely obsolete.  Not merely is it largely obsolete but it is to an entirely uneconomic extent unstandardised.  It will be necessary, at the earliest moment, for whatever organisation we set up to take over the responsibility of transport operation, to replace the existing equipment with new equipment, designed to meet modern requirements, standardised to secure economy in maintenance and adequate to meet all the demands upon it.  If our transport organisation set up as a result of legislation enacted here is to provide such new equipment, it must be able to command new capital freely and cheaply.</P>
    <P>The first feature, therefore, which, in my opinion, must be common to any transport scheme, is adequate means of ensuring that the transport operating organisation will be able to get new capital in sufficient measure, to get it freely and to get it cheaply.  The second essential provision in all transport legislation must be some effective means of ensuring that the management of the transport organisation will be conducted in accordance with the requirements of public policy; that the Government of the day will have power to insist that the transport organisation will be directed so as to facilitate the achievement of its economic aims. Furthermore, there must be provision to ensure that there will be adequate control by a public authority over the charges that are made for transport facilities of all kinds and in all circumstances. Fourthly, there must be provision to ensure that the public authority will have ample powers to <Col N="1799" /> insist upon the provision of adequate transport facilities in all parts of the country.  Fifthly, there must be ample safeguards to prevent discriminatory treatment of individuals using the transport facilities; safeguards to ensure that there can be no discrimination as between one individual and another, as between one harbour authority and another; to ensure that all transport facilities will be equally available on equal conditions to all interests.</P>
    <P>It is my view that these provisions must be common to any comprehensive transport scheme; but, subject to these essential provisions, and subject also to whatever legislation may be enacted to control conditions of employment in transport undertakings or relating to social services, it is the Government's view that the transport organisation, no matter how constituted, no matter how directed, should be left free to run its business as it thinks best; that it should be relieved from the restrictions which were imposed by earlier legislation upon statutory transport undertakers, restrictions which were, in the main, designed to deal with conditions completely different from those which now exist.</P>
    <P>I have stated what the Government consider should be the aims of our transport policy, and I have stated what the Government consider should be regarded as essential provisions in any transport legislation that may be agreed upon.  I now turn to consider what type of organisation should be set up for the purpose of implementing the transport aims I have outlined.  The Secretary of the Labour Party was good enough to send me a copy of a report of a committee of that Party which dealt with this matter of transport policy, in which the decision was to recommend here the adoption of the policy of nationalisation.  I would like to say a few words about this question of nationalisation in relation to public transport.  The Government considered very carefully the advisability of nationalisation of transport.  It had certain predilections in favour of that course because, at an earlier stage, <Col N="1800" /> it had seemed to us the only way out of the situation that then existed.  If it decided against the policy of nationalisation in the full sense, it did so, not because of any theoretical objections or stupid prejudices, but because it came to the conclusion that there were a number of practical considerations which made such a policy, in relation to present circumstances in this country, undesirable.</P>
    <P>It is usual to refer to transport as a public service comparable with the postal and telephone services, with certain municipal services and with the electricity supply and, on that basis, to urge that, as nationalisation or public ownership was considered satisfactory in relation to these other services, a precisely similar case could be made for nationalisation in relation to transport services.  I want to submit that there is not the complete similarity between these services, as is sometimes suggested.  These other services are all operated entirely free from competition, either direct or indirect.  In theory a man could deliver his own postal packets, draw his own water, or generate his own electricity, but in practice the cost and inconvenience are so great that, except in very unusual circumstances, he will not attempt it. Transport can never be free from competition in the same sense.</P>
    <P>I think it is well known to all persons who have studied this problem here, that in recent years the most deadly competitors of public transport operators have been the private lorry and the private passenger car.  It is obvious that if the public transport services are inefficient or unduly costly, the number of such vehicles will increase rapidly. That was the situation here; that has been the situation in every other country.</P>
    <P>If, therefore, we decided upon a policy of nationalisation, if a State Department is to be given the responsibility of operating our public transport services, just as State Departments operate the postal or telephone services, and if that service should prove to be inefficient, or if it should prove to be unduly costly, whatever about inefficiency&mdash;and I am convinced that in the long run it will be <Col N="1801" /> an unduly costly method of providing transport&mdash;then the State would almost inevitably be forced to impose on private transport restrictions which do not now exist, by means of taxation or otherwise.  Even if we had to contemplate the possibility of a nationalised transport service operating side by side with completely unrestricted private transport, it will be agreed that nationalisation of transport must involve all forms of public transport. The committee of the Labour Party which recommended it recognised the logic of that contention and they themselves, in their report, propose that all the licensed operators of public transport, in addition to the statutory companies, should be compulsorily acquired by the nationalised undertaking.  I think that is an inevitable consequence of nationalisation, but I do not agree it is good policy.</P>
    <P>There are approximately 900 independent licensed public transport operators at the present time.  I think it is desirable that they should, in the main, continue to operate.  I do not say that there never again will be any renewal of the decision to acquire some of these licences, but except perhaps in the case of licences which authorise operation over the whole of the State for all classes of merchandise, it is my view that, in present circumstances at least, the continued existence of these independent transport operators, who frequently provide a service that the public transport companies cannot give, is necessary to the existence of a thoroughly efficient and comprehensive transport system.</P>
    <P>I think that nationalised transport almost inevitably means subsidised transport.  I have already indicated that the Government do not believe in subsidised transport and it therefore follows that if my contention is right, that nationalised transport means subsidised transport, then that is a strong argument against nationalisation. Nationalised transport has meant subsidised transport in practically every other country.  The Government of the day responsible for the operation of a nationalised transport system will certainly be subjected to repeated demands for extended services, to <Col N="1802" /> repeated demands for cheaper rates, to demands for improved conditions of employment of transport employees and, because the Government will be dependent upon popular support for its existence, it will not, for political reasons, be able to refuse such demands and, if it does refuse such demands, it almost certainly will be rapidly replaced by another Government prepared to promise such concessions.</P>
    <P>I have stressed the view that subsidised transport means dear transport, dear to the community as a whole.  Our national economic efficiency, our competitive effectiveness in international trade, depend not merely upon the actual charges for public transport in operation but upon the total of the overhead burdens that industry and agriculture must carry. The uneconomic reduction of transport charges resulting from political pressure on a Government operating nationalised transport services would not benefit our trade, would not facilitate our economic development, if the differences between the actual charges in operation and the economic charges had to be made good by taxation and the unremunerative extension of transport facilities of any kind would necessarily mean that transport as a whole would cost the community more than it need cost.  Nationalised transport, therefore, here as elsewhere, would mean the creation of a new basis for political contentions.  Where the State is directly responsible for the operation of transport services, it is certain that transport workers will be organised to exert political pressure to support demands relating to their conditions of employment, that groups of traders of various kinds will similarly make their political support conditional upon the granting of concessions to their interests, and that in every locality of the country the extension or the cheapening of transport facilities will make or unmake Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>However, I am anxious to discuss this matter upon a general basis and, if necessary, we can introduce the personalities later.  I say that the history of nationalised transport in every country where there was a democratic form of Government has shown that these results are to be expected. In these countries it became clear, and it would undoubtedly become clear here, that under a nationalised system of transport, coupled with a democratic Government, the direction of transport services would be undertaken, not for the purpose of promoting national economic development, but for the purpose of forwarding Party political causes.</P>
      <P>There is in some quarters a fallacious belief that the nationalisation of transport means the elimination of the profit incentive in the direction of transport services.  I say that is a fallacious belief, because, neither in theory nor in fact, is there any foundation for it. There are, in fact, many instances in this country, as well as elsewhere, where a public monopoly has been made the instrument of rapacious profit-taking in order to reduce rates or reduce taxes.  It will, I think, be agreed amongst all sections of the House that it is desirable, in framing transport legislation, that we should make the profit motive subordinate to public aims, and that is, in fact, proposed in the Bill which is now under consideration.  But it is entirely wrong to assume that a hard-pressed Minister for Finance would always ignore the possibilities of a State-owned transport service in overcoming his Budgetary difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also a fallacious belief that the capital needs of transport can be more cheaply met by a nationalised organisation than otherwise.  There are, of course, some people who speak as if the State can find capital without cost.  As every Deputy knows, that is not the case.  Nor can we relieve the transport organisation we set up of interest charges, unless we are prepared, on the one hand, to confiscate the property of existing companies and, on the other hand, to provide new capital facilities under subsidy, and <Col N="1804" /> the Government do not believe in either one course or the other.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill will ensure that the capital requirements of Córas Iompair Eireann will be more cheaply met than it has been possible heretofore for the State to provide the capital requirements of the Electricity Supply Board, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, or any similar service. The State has to go to the market for its money.  It has to offer State stock upon terms which will ensure the subscription of the amount required.  It has to relate the interest upon the stock to the prevailing market conditions, and in relending that money to the organisations for the financing of which it was responsible, it has in the past always found it necessary to charge interest rates over and above that paid by it in order to offset the cost of management and the administrative expenses involved in that relending. I repeat that the new transport organisation which this Bill sets up will be able to get its total capital requirements met more cheaply than any existing organisation in which the State has an interest has been able to have its capital requirements met in the past.</P>
    <P>As a general consideration, I want to submit that there is no country in the world where the nationalisation of transport appears to have been adopted on economic grounds.  Leaving out of account the U.S.S.R., which is in a special category, I think it can be stated truthfully that, in every other country where the nationalisation of transport has been adopted, it has been done for non-commercial reasons, either because the only alternative to State-owned transport services was foreign-owned transport services, or because private concerns were unable to raise the capital required, or for political reasons.  In most cases of nationalised transport there appears to be a very distinct tendency to revert to other forms of control, as in the case of Belgium, where the railways were constructed by the State because the alternative was to have them constructed by foreign companies, and where subsequently these State-owned railways were leased to a national company which operates the <Col N="1805" /> services, a company which is somewhat similar in constitution to that proposed for Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>
    <P>As a final consideration, I submit that there is no case where the financial record of nationalised transport has been sufficiently impressive to justify enthusiasm for its imitation here.  In this State, we have in recent years extended State ownership or State regulation in the economic field to a considerable extent, and various types of organisation have been set up to achieve the purposes which the Government have in mind.  It can, I think, be stated that we have experimented with different types of organisation. In the case of the Electricity Supply Board there is a board consisting mainly of whole-time executive officers all of whom are appointed by the Government, and the organisation is financed by repayable advances from the national Exchequer.  In the case of the Turf Development Board, the Tourist Board and certain similar organisations, there is a whole-time managing director, with a part-time board of directors, and the finances of the undertaking are met partially by Grants-in-Aid voted by the Dáil and partially by repayable advances from the national Exchequer.  In the case of the Industrial Credit Company and similar organisations, whose constitution is more closely related to the constitution of private companies, another system has been adopted.  There, again, however, you have a whole-time managing director, assisted by a board of part-time directors, the capital secured by the issue of shares, the majority of which are held by the Minister for Finance, as a result of which he exercises control over the company concerned, and a minority held by private people.  In the case of the Sugar Company and other similar concerns, you have a still closer resemblance to the constitution of private concerns.  The capital is represented by debenture stock and preference shares held by private persons, and the ordinary stock is held by the Minister for Finance, and, by reason of his holding that stock, he has the power of nominating the entire board of directors of the concern.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1806" /> The aim of the Government in devising of methods of controlling these various concerns was, first of all, to ensure that the Government should have control in matters of general policy and, secondly, to see that these concerns should have complete freedom in matters of day-to-day management, but particularly to see that such concerns would be free from anything in the way of political pressure.  It cannot be said, however, that any of these systems has been entirely free from faults.  The onus of appointing members of such boards has frequently created difficulties, as Deputies will understand, for the Minister for Finance and for the Government.  The very fact that all the directors are dependent on the Minister for Finance for their appointment and re-appointment has, in some cases, appeared to limit their independence in relation to the Government. Also, there is always the possibility that in dealing with outside interests they will have regard not merely for the best interests of the concern of which they are in charge, but to the possible reaction of their decisions upon political circumstances. The fact that these directors are not, themselves, personally, affected by the financial results of the organisations which they control makes them, perhaps, less critical than they should be of the administrative methods adopted by these companies.  Because of these various objections to which I have referred, the Government has never been satisfied that it has yet devised a satisfactory organisation or method for the carrying out of that type of enterprise.  In relation to transport, therefore, it is now proposed to adopt a different device, and to appoint a board of directors, consisting of a whole-time chairman, appointed by the Government, who will act in full accordance with the wishes of the Government, and a part-time board of directors, elected by the holders of a common stock privately owned and which will have limited dividend rights.  These stockholder directors will be in a similar position to that of the directors of a privately owned concern.  They will be in no way beholden to the Government <Col N="1807" /> for their appointment or re-appointment, and they will have the same freedom of action and the same interest as the directors of a private concern in ensuring good management and efficient operation.  It is my personal belief that, assuming that the Dáil accepts the proposed scheme, the success of that system will lead to its adoption in other cases where the State considers it necessary to make special arrangements for the conduct of economic activities.  In my view, it gives all the advantages while avoiding the disadvantages of nationalisation.  I have already stated the reasons why the Government decided against nationalisation and, at the same time, I have pointed out the reasons for the provisions contained in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the provisions in the Bill.  Perhaps, before drawing attention to the provisions of the Bill, it might be better if I first drew attention, not so much to the things that are in it, as to the things that are not in it.  First of all, the Bill involves no extension of the area of monopoly in transport.  A great deal of nonsense has been talked about monopoly in transport.  People seem to forget that there has always been something like a monopoly in public transport.  It must be remembered that, apart from the rivers and the canals, the only means of public transport was by railway, until about 25 years ago, and there was an effective monopoly held by the railway companies, each in its own area.  So far as the railway companies were concerned, they had almost a complete monopoly within their respective areas.  That has never existed since, and, probably, will never exist again, because the operation of mass-produced lorries and cars on the roads in increasing numbers had broken the monopoly of the railway companies even before 1924.  Because of the damage that was being done to national interests, and the difficulties that were involved in the preservation of public transport services by the increased use of privately-owned lorries and cars, certain restrictions had to be imposed on independent road transport services.  There is no extension of any <Col N="1808" /> monopoly proposed in this Bill.  Whatever monopoly position may have been created by the Great Southern Railways Company, or the Dublin Transport Company in their own areas will be taken over by the new company and continued, but the position is not being extended in any way.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes no provision for any interference with private transport, and again I repeat what I said at the beginning of my remarks that this Bill represents the whole of the legislation relating to transport which the Government has in contemplation.  The carriage by a trader of his own goods in his own vehicles will be permitted as freely after the war as it was before it.  It is believed that a properly managed and economically run transport organisation can provide, for most traders, transport facilities, which will be cheaper and more extensive than they can provide for themselves with their own lorries, but if traders cannot be convinced that such is the case, then they will be free to conduct their own business as they think fit, in the same manner as heretofore.</P>
    <P>It is not proposed to alter the law relating to existing independent licensed merchandise hauliers except in a minor degree, in respect of certain of the smaller port areas where previously, in a radius of ten miles, no licence was required to engage in public carriage.  That provision is being amended, but it is contemplated that the general transport scheme which will exist and operate after the war will include these licensed operators continuing to undertake transport work for reward supplementary to the national service which will be operated by Córas Iompair Eireann.</P>
    <P>I would like to review briefly the main provisions of the Bill.  The Bill provides for the establishment of a new transport company to be known as Córas Iompair Eireann.  That company will be a general transport company, and not merely a railway company of the traditional type, hedged around by out-of-date restrictions.  It will be equipped and empowered to provide whatever type of transport is best suited to any industry or any area, <Col N="1809" /> undertaking rail and road transport as part of a co-ordinated scheme.  The company will have freedom of commercial operation in competition with unrestricted private transport.  It will be free from the restrictions formerly associated with statutory transport undertakings.  It will be given such freedom as is compatible with the maintenance of Government control of policy, of services, of charges and with the protection of the public against discriminatory treatment.  Córas Iompair Eireann will be constituted with a capital of £20,000,000 of which £16,000,000 will be in debenture stock and £4,000,000 in common stock.  The undertakings of the Great Southern Railways and of the Dublin United Transport Company will be vested in it, the stocks of the new company replacing the stocks of the dissolved companies on terms which have already been published, and which have been approved by the stockholders of these concerns.</P>
    <P>The existing stocks of the Great Southern Railways will be replaced pound for pound by the stocks of Córas Iompair Eireann on the following basis: the 4 per cent. debenture for 3 per cent. redeemable debentures; the 4 per cent. guaranteed preference for an equal proportion of debenture and common stock; the preference and ordinary stock for common stock; the 6 per cent. preference stocks and the ordinary stocks of the Dublin United Transport Company will be converted into 3 per cent. debentures at the rate of £145 for £100.  The paid-up capital of the company will, therefore, at the outset, be £13,500,000, of which £10,000,000 will be represented by debentures and £3,500,000 by common stock.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that the debenture stock should be guaranteed by the State as to principal and interest.  In the case of the common stock, dividends will be payable only when earned, and will not, in any circumstances, exceed 6 per cent.  The issue of debenture stock, except for the purpose of the conversion scheme, will be subject to the approval of the Minister for Finance, but subject to his approval, it may be made for the purpose <Col N="1810" /> of financing projects designed to give more efficient service, to open up new sources of revenue, or to secure reductions in expenditure, including particularly the modernisation of equipment, new buildings and plant, and the reorganisation of stations and depôts.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, the chairman will be appointed by the Government. It is contemplated that that arrangement will ensure that the policy of the company will be related to national economic aims, that the company's finances will be well planned during its development period, and that the issue of new capital will be limited as it is desirable it should be limited, in view of the obligation the State is taking in relation to it, to sound projects.  It will be the responsibility of the chairman of the company to ensure that the Government's liability under the guarantee is maintained at the minimum. The draft Bill provides for the redemption of capital out of surplus revenue&mdash; surplus revenue which it is hoped will be earned by the reorganisation and by more efficient working in normal circumstances.</P>
    <P>The company is being required under a section of the Bill to maintain a redemption fund for its debenture stocks, and it is authorised to use that fund to purchase its own stock in certain conditions.  In framing these provisions, the Government recognises that Córas Iompair Eireann, if established following the enactment of this Bill, will be the principal transport undertaking in this State and will on that account be a national asset which must be maintained at full efficiency in the interests of trade and agriculture, of industry and defence.</P>
    <P>The Bill was drafted particularly to ensure that inability to raise new capital or lack of funds will not result in any retarding of the development of the company on modern lines. In pursuit of the idea of giving efficient and modern transport facilities everywhere, the Government considered that there would be substantial advantages to be secured by combining the undertakings of the Great Southern Railways and the Dublin United Transport Company.  It is anticipated <Col N="1811" /> that many useful results will follow from that amalgamation.  The new company will be in a position to command the best administrative and technical abilities available to either company.  It is anticipated that substantial economies can be effected by the standardisation and interchangeability of vehicles and plants.  It will permit of the full co-ordination of suburban transport services.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask Deputies when considering this Bill not to regard our national transport problem as something distinct and separate from the Dublin problem, merely because public transport services were operated in the past by separate companies.  If the question of a sound transport policy is to be properly considered, we must not allow ourselves to be influenced or prejudiced by the accidental fact that these two separate undertakings survive from an age in which there was a multitude of local transport undertakings. I think that anybody who approaches the problem with an open mind, uninfluenced by existing conditions or any representations made on behalf of existing interests, will agree that a unified organisation is necessary and desirable.  If that is agreed, then clearly we should not allow ourselves to be diverted from creating that situation merely because there are these two existing organisations.  On the assumption that the transport problem of this country can best be solved by means of a national transport organisation, there is no case for excluding Dublin from the sphere at all&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy likes, I will deal with that also.  The transport problem of this country is largely one of providing adequate facilities for sparsely populated and industrially undeveloped areas.  We are naturally <Col N="1812" /> inclined to make comparisons between our position and that prevailing in Britain and consider as applicable here transport arrangements that have proved successful there but, in fact, no such comparison is possible.  In Britain there are dense populations, there are many large industrial cities and much greater density of traffic on all parts of the transport system which makes the economical working of public transport comparatively easy.  We have no such conditions here.</P>
      <P>If it is contended that the Dublin area, where similarity with British conditions reduces the difficulty of successful operation of public transport, should, because of that circumstance, be excluded from the scheme and given whatever benefits can be derived from special circumstances, precisely the same case could be made for Cork or any other municipal area.  An almost identical case could be made for the east coast countries, and if we were to follow that argument to its logical conclusion, we would abandon the attempt of trying to establish a national transport organisation.  We would get back to the stage of local transport operators, and we would leave these remote and sparsely populated areas where conditions of transport are obviously more difficult to bear the full burden of the conditions.  Transport in this country is very largely the handling of traffic to and from Dublin.  Cheap and efficient transport from all parts of the country will contribute to the prosperity of Dublin.  Apart, therefore, from the practical advantages of amalgamation, there is, in the Government's opinion, no case based either upon equity or policy that the advantages associated with a national transport organisation should be forgone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to rights possessed by the Dublin Corporation. The Dublin Corporation have the right to acquire the tramways undertaking of the Dublin United Transport Company. May I make it clear, in view of the circular which I received this morning from the city manager, that whatever rights the corporation has are not being interfered with in this <Col N="1813" /> Bill?  They have a right to acquire in the year 1966 the tramways then operated, if there are tramways operating. If there are no tramways operating in that year, the right of acquisition will have died with them.  The suggestion has frequently been made that we should provide for the municipal ownership of transport services in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>Whatever case might have been made for such a policy 15 years ago when the transport services in the City of Dublin were unsatisfactory, when transport facilities were provided almost entirely by tramway services while in the rest of the country they were provided almost entirely by railway services, it exists no longer, now that there is the common factor of the omnibus which makes both types of service similar in character, and renders amalgamation not merely practicable but conducive to increased efficiency and economic working.  The Government does not believe that the establishment of a municipally owned service in Dublin, even if urged by the municipal authorities, should be permitted to interfere with the general scheme of a national transport undertaking providing for transport facilities of the kinds required in all parts of the country, urban as well as rural.</P>
    <P>As part of the general attempt to tidy up the finances of the new company and to capitalise recurring expenditure wherever possible, it is proposed to abolish the way-leave payments now due by the Dublin United Transport Company to the Dublin Corporation and the Dun Laoghaire Borough Council on the basis of paying compensation which will be fixed, in default of agreement, by an arbitrator. Deputies will naturally be concerned with the possible effect of this measure on employment in the transport services.  Our transport operators, are, outside agriculture, one of the biggest employers of labour in the country, and naturally, when devising transport legislation, we must have regard to the interests of those who were earning their livelihood in the operation of transport services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1814" /> May I say, straight away, that although the Bill makes provision for a possible redundancy of staff following on the amalgamation of the two companies it is not contemplated that redundancy to any extent will in fact occur.  If there is such redundancy, then provision is made for the payment of compensation on terms set out in the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Bill provides for the continuance of superannuation funds.  Provision is being made to secure the establishment, by Order if necessary, of a pension scheme for the company's employees.  When we framed the Railways Act of 1933, we introduced provisions to ensure that there would be a pensions scheme for employees of the company.  For various reasons which I need not deal with now, these provisions became inoperative, and, in fact, no pension scheme was brought into existence under the relevant section of that Act.</P>
      <P>We are providing now for the creation of a contributory pensions scheme, and taking the necessary powers to ensure that no difficulty will exist which will prevent it coming into operation.  May I say, however, that I understand the management of the existing Great Southern Railways Company are at present engaged in framing a pensions scheme for that company's employees on a basis far more generous than was previously contemplated as possible?  If that pensions scheme has been brought into operation before the establishment date, the new company will continue to operate it.  If it is not complete and in operation, then the new company will take up the task of completing the arrangement of a pensions scheme for its employees.</P>

      <P>The Bill provides that recruitment to the company's clerical grades will be on the basis of open competitive examination.  The existing wage negotiating machinery is being left unaltered.  I do not know if that situation is regarded as the most desirable by the trades unions catering for the various grades of transport employees, but if there is any desire to effect amendment in the existing arrangment, any suggestions for such an amendement that are put forward will be considered.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to abolish the Railway Tribunal set up under the 1924 Act. We propose to abolish also the very elaborate system for the regulation of charges which that Act established, and to substitute for it the very simple system of maximum fares for railways, canals, trams and road transport services, with adequate provision for the revision of these maximum rates.  The functions of the Railway Tribunal will be transferred to the High Court, except to the extent to which they are transferred to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The functions transferred to the Minister for Industry and Commerce will be those relating to charges, to classifications of merchandise and to conditions of transport.  There is, I think, ample provision to ensure that the company can be required by Ministerial Order to provide new services, where new services are considered necessary, or, in the alternative, to ensure that such services will be provided by other independent licensed operators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We propose to establish a transport advisory tribunal which will consist of five members: a chairman nominated by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, a representative of agriculture, a representative of industry, a person <Col N="1816" /> skilled in transport matters and a person in a position to speak authoritatively on labour matters.  To that tribunal will be referred for advice matters relating to the provision of transport facilities, agreements relating to the allocating and routing of traffic or agreements relating to the pooling of receipts, matters concerning maximum charges, matters affecting the classification of goods or matters concerning the conditions for the transport of goods.</P>
    <P>I should, perhaps, make it clear that no change is contemplated in the existing law with regard to the closing of branch lines, nor is any change being made in the obligation which rests upon the Great Southern Railways at present, where a branch line is closed, to substitute adequate road services. Provision is being made, however, that where a line is closed permanently, it may be abandoned by the company on the basis of transferring the property, or the obligation to maintain bridges or level crossings, to the local authority, or to the adjacent property owner, on the basis of paying adequate compensation to be fixed by agreement or determined by arbitration.</P>
    <P>Although we do not contemplate any additional restrictions upon the operation of private transport, measures are being taken in the Bill to ensure that certain successful evasions of the provisions of the 1933 Road Transport Act will not in future be possible.  As I have mentioned, we are abolishing the exempted area around certain ports.  These exempted areas proved a fruitful source of evasions of the Act, and, in any event, experience showed that there was no reason for granting that special exemption to persons engaged in haulage for hire around these ports which did not exist around any other town of equal size. The persons who have in the past been engaged in haulage for hire in these areas will, as of right, receive licences to continue to operate in future, but no addition to their numbers will be permitted.</P>
    <P>We propose to make certain amendments of the 1933 Act by way of easement in respect of the restrictions imposed upon those who were licensed to <Col N="1817" /> operate for hire in the carriage of goods on the roads under that Act. Certain of these licensed operators found themselves in difficulties because they inadequately described the area in which they had previously operated, or the class of goods which they previously carried.  No modification of a licence could be made after it had been granted under the terms of the 1933 Act.  We are taking power to effect such minor modifications now, as well as to grant changes in the areas and the classes of goods specified in these licences where it is necessary to do so to avoid hardship.</P>
    <P>These are the main provisions of the measure.  It is a long Bill which contains a large number of sections, all of which, if the Bill gets a Second Reading, will, no doubt, be fully debated in Committee.  In submitting the Bill to the Dáil, I realise that there is probably no matter of internal policy upon which so many divergent views may exist as transport.  It is, I know, impossible to expect that all the provisions of the Bill will find full agreement in the House, but I put the Bill before the House as a sincere attempt to cope with the facts of our situation.  The Bill represents the culmination of many years' experience of our transport problems.  It is the Government's belief that it is along the lines sketched in the Bill that we will most likely secure efficient and comprehensive services at least cost. I urge that the Dáil should enact the measure, subject to whatever amendments of its provisions may appear desirable to Deputies after discussion in Committee.</P>

      <P>The amendment which we have tabled is to the effect that the Dáil recommends the postponement of further consideration of this measure until the tribunal inquiring into railway stock matters has issued its report.  I think that, on the face of it, it is highly improper for Parliament to discuss a Bill which contains in its very essence subjects relating to grave matters which are at the moment <i>sub judice.</i>  It would be impossible for the Dáil adequately to discuss this Bill and to give ample consideration to some of its recommendations if Deputies were prohibited from referring to recent activities in relation to railway stocks, and if they were prohibited from making any reference to the board responsible for the production of this Bill.  I think it would be a very unreal discussion and a very unjust curb on the natural rights of Deputies to express themselves freely in Parliament.</P>
      <P>I cannot see that there is any particular urgency about the Bill.  We are told that it is a long-term planning Bill, which will not come into operation until some time after the war, and whether it is considered in the month of May or the months of July does not seem to make any great national difference; but certainly as to the propriety of discussing here matters of a grave nature which are <i>sub judice,</i> there has always been a ruling from the Chair against discussing any such matters, and if this amendment is ruled out of order, the Chair, I presume, must adhere to previous rulings that any such references are not permissible.  If we are to discuss the Bill on this basis it would be an entirely unreal, hollow and farcical type of discussion.</P>

      <P>On that point I want to state that some time ago the Government regarded dealings in railway shares as a matter of such public importance that they set up a tribunal to inquire into it.  A certain amount of the evidence has been heard in public and we are promised that furthere evidence will be taken in public and certain statements of a highly disquieting nature have been made.</P>

      <P>I want to put it that the tribunal is dealing with a matter that is of considerable public importance and it is quite improper from the legislative point of view that we should enter upon the discussion of a Bill of this magnitude that has such important repercussions upon the industrial, commercial and agricultural life of the country and probably upon the inquiries which the commission is making.  There can be no reason for rushing this Bill.  It was only available in the Government Stationery Office on the 22nd April and we are discussing it on the 1st May.  What is the explanation for all the speed and haste?  I put it again to the Minister that there is no need for it.  The war is not going to end as soon as the Minister apparently thinks and it is much better that there should be an informed public opinion on this Bill and its provisions rather than that we should rush it through.  We have only eight weeks before it is to be operative, and in that eight weeks we are to pass the Second Stage, the Committee Stage and possibly a Recommittal Stage, a Report Stage and the Final Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood you permitted me to give the reason why the amendment was in order and should be moved.  The reasons I am endeavouring to give are, that there is no real need for the Bill being rushed through in the manner in which it is, and it is unfair to ask the House to deal with a Bill of this character in a short period of eight weeks and that there is no urgent demand for it.</P>

      <P>My point of view is two-fold.  I agree with the point of view that until we get the report we should not have the Second Stage and I suggest to the Government that there is no need for rushing the Bill through in the manner proposed by the Government and bearing in mind both these considerations the Bill should not be proceeded with to-day. When Deputy O'Higgins expresses the opinion that the fact that the tribunal is sitting is reason why it should not be proceeded with, I say there is considerable force in that contention but the position is further strengthened by the reason which has been given to the Government that there is no need to rush the Bill.</P>

Overriding all this was the argument that in our opinion it was highly improper to discuss this Bill in present circumstances.  Both points were put.  No. 1 was turned down by every Government person we approached and then this amendment was put down.  I agree with the points raised by Deputy Norton.</P>

He said that it was a matter of confidence and that it had been asked for by the Leader of the Opposition and that no action would have been taken if it had been asked for by a member of one of the Independent groups.  Why should the Independent members not be taken notice of?  But he admitted the Opposition Leader had asked for it?  Because of that there was to be a tribunal, a judicial tribunal and you are deliberately interfering with the judiciary.  You are leading to a position, to a precedent that would be very serious for the Government. Supposing this Government brings it in as a matter of confidence and the Government was thrown out as I think it ought to be, I say that is putting the Government into a serious position. I say the Minister for Justice ought to be the man to rise and protect the judiciary.  There is a judicial body sitting and there is one person concerned&mdash;I will name no names.</P>

      <P>I will be quite brief. There is nothing in this Bill which is <i>sub judice</i> to the tribunal.  There is no matter which the tribunal is investigating or upon which it is entitled to report which can affect in any way the question of the merits of this Bill as a piece of legislation.  In fact this contention I take it has been put forward with some other motive. There is no basis in fact for the suggestion that the Bill is being rushed, that the inquiry has anything to do with the Bill or that the Bill has anything to do with the inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That tribunal was set up to report upon dealings in Great Southern Railways stocks between 1st January, 1943, and 18th November, 1943, and the extent, if any, to which any of such dealings <Col N="1823" /> were attributable to the improper use or disclosure of information concerning proposals for the capital reconstruction of the Great Southern Railways, which proposals were published in October, 1943.  I submit that there is no basis for the suggestion that this Bill has been rushed.  The intention of the Government to introduce this Bill was known last year.  The main features of the Bill were known last year.  The Bill was introduced before Easter.  Copies of it were in the hands of Deputies last Thursday week.  The Standing Orders of the Dáil require that four days' notice be given of the intention to debate any subject.  A much longer period of notice was given of the intention to take this Bill.  In fact, we had intended to take it last week but, at the request of Opposition Parties, the Second Reading was postponed until to-day.  There is no reason whatever why the Dáil should not now discuss this Bill on Second Reading.  I think that, in the two months between this and the 1st July, there is ample time to enable this Bill to be discussed and amended in Committee, assuming the Dáil is prepared to pass it on Second Reading.  If, in the event, that should not prove to be so, the Bill can be amended.  However, I should like to ask the co-operation of the Dáil in making such amendment unnecessary if, in fact, members find that they have ample time to discuss the Bill and propose amendments to it, if they so desire, during the two months which are available.  A period of two months is normally considered long enough to secure the enactment of any measure and it should not be too short for the enactment of this measure.  But I do not want to press that point.  We are concerned solely with the question whether or not the Second Reading of the Bill should be taken now.  I say that there is no reason why it should not be taken now.  There is no such reason arising out of the proceedings of the tribunal of inquiry to which reference has been made nor is there any ground for the contention that the Dáil has not received sufficient notice of the intention to legislate on this <Col N="1824" /> matter or sufficient notice of the details of the Bill.</P>

      <P>It may have been unintentional but the Minister's statement was an unchallenged example of presumption.  The Minister states that there can be no relation between the discussion of this Bill and the tribunal.  He makes that positive assertion in his usual style.  Such an assertion could only be based on knowledge of the line which individual Deputies intend to take on this Bill.  Here is a Bill referring to railways stocks, vastly increasing railway finances and giving control of those new finances to certain individuals.  One of the things that have disturbed the public mind during the past six months is the handling of the finances of the railways company.  If the Minister were on this side of the House, instead of on the other side, he would realise, with honesty and conviction, that he could not fulfil his public responsibilities in discussing a Bill of that kind without any reference to the past.  It could not be done.</P>

      <P>The objection of the Chair to this amendment was that it did not seem to be relevant. The terms of reference of the tribunal set out that it is to investigate and report on dealings in Great Southern Railways stocks during certain months of the year 1943.  This Bill sets out a general transport policy for the postwar period.  The difficulty the Chair had was in relating the first matter to the second.  The question of the proceedings of the tribunal was introduced slightly by one Deputy. The Chair wants to make quite clear to Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney and other Deputies that the only reference which will be permitted to this tribunal will be to the fact that it is there. What any member said at the tribunal, what evidence was given there and how such evidence implicates, or does not implicate, anybody&mdash;these are questions which do not arise on this Bill.  In the first place the Chair is of opinion that reference to them would be contempt of the tribunal&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>To delete all words after the word &ldquo;That&rdquo; and to substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the Dáil refuses to give a Second Reading to the Transport Bill, 1944, pending the receipt by the Oireachtas of the report from the tribunal established to inquire into dealings in stocks and shares of the Great Southern Railways Company.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In moving this amendment I must say from the discussion that has taken place that our mind was very much that expressed by the Chair.  The reason for the amendment was to avoid discussion that would of necessity involve references to matters which are the subject of investigation at the moment.  In order to elaborate a point or support an argument, a person might be tempted to quote from evidence already given and already published in the Press.  I would consider that would be an unhealthy precedent and I consider that, at the moment, at least the Opposition Deputies are confronted with a rather difficult course&mdash;to discuss this Bill as fully as we can, all the time cautiously avoiding reference to certain things. It is an unfair position in which to put the Dáil.  However, that is the position.  If I might say so, without <Col N="1828" /> any heat, we are getting accustomed to lack of consideration and acclimatised to lack of courtesy in Parliamentary matters.  Here we have before us a Bill, which it took the Minister one hour and threequarters to introduce with very little reference to detail, a Bill described by the Minister as a most comprehensive measure, a Bill that could also be described as a voluminous measure, a Bill the background of which could not be fully understood without studying the Transport Tribunal Report.</P>
    <P>The Bill was circulated on Thursday week when the Dáil was in session. Deputies got home on Saturday, found the Bill awaiting them and returned here on the following Monday.  They remained here from Monday to Thursday, returned to their homes again, and came back here once more on Monday.  Two week-ends were, therefore, given to Deputies to study and understand the Bill and to grasp and understand the Report of the Transport Tribunal.  I put it to the House that there are probably no five Deputies who can stand up and say that they have fully studied the report of the tribunal and the Bill.  I do not mind admitting straight away that if there were, I would not be one of the five.  I try to take my responsibilities fairly seriously.  I endeavoured during these two week-ends to study the Bill fully but I did not succeed in doing it. Here, in that set of circumstances, without having fully studied the ground as public representatives, we are to launch a plan regarding the future transport of this country, as far as most of us can see for a very considerable length of time, without having the details and without being fully conversant with the subject.  That is the position in which we are put by the Government.</P>
    <P>Whatever case may be made for the Bill, certainly no case has been made for urgency.  I would say, in spite of the fact that the Minister took 1¾ hours to introduce the Bill, in spite of his unquestioned skill in debate, that the policy of the past is adhered to in giving the minimum amount of assistance and information to the Dáil.  Here we have a Bill with regard to the future <Col N="1829" /> transport of this country, with an estimate as to what the financial requirements of the transport company will be, and we have no indication either in the Minister's statement or in the Bill as to the purpose or purposes specifically for which these vast sums of money are required.  Those of us who can throw our minds back to the time when the electricity supply legislation was before this House, no matter whether they supported that legislation or opposed it, will recollect that every bit of information that was available to the Minister in charge was made available in advance of the Bill to every Deputy in the House.  Of the £9,000,000 or £11,000,000 which it was proposed to raise under that Bill, every single piece of proposed expenditure, down to the last £5 note, was laid out in print for the information of Deputies&mdash;how much for banks, how much for labour, how much for machinery, how much for plant.  Every single halfpenny of the sum it was proposed to raise was accounted for, as far as the experts could estimate. Before the Bill was considered, all that information was available to Deputies.</P>
    <P>It was not put before the House as a Minister's Bill, a Government measure or a Bill incorporating the views or the decisions of the Government. Various groups of experts, one group a cross check on the other, were given the problem to examine and asked for their suggestions, asked to put their plans in black and white, and the opinions of those experts were made available to the Dáil before Deputies were asked to sink State credit behind that scheme by their votes.  Contrast that with the situation in which the House finds itself to-day. The Minister gave us his views on transport; he gave us Government policy with regard to transport but he did not support those views by the view of any expert, named or unnamed. He did not even indicate in the course of his statement to the House that any experts had been consulted. His statement was presented to us as Government policy with regard to the transport of this country. Now any eight Deputies sitting on any side of the House are just as competent <Col N="1830" /> to evolve a plan with regard to the future of transport in his country as any eight Deputies sitting over there on the Front Bench.  If the proposals brought before this Assembly by the Minister are the outcome of study by experts, where is the experts' opinion?  Where are the pros and cons?  Were any alternatives considered by the experts and who were the experts and from where did they come?  Surely, the Minister will agree that in dealing with a measure of that magnitude both with regard to its importance to the public and the cost, all that information should be made available.  Yet, we are given the Bill; Government policy is stated; £20,000,000 is the sum suggested, and we are not told for what.  We are not told how much of that is for rolling-stock, how much is to put the permanent way in a proper state of safety and repair; how much is for repair, how much for renewals, how much for the purchase of omnibuses, how much for the purpose of permanent way rolling-stock.  Is not that all information that is distinctly relevant and which we are entitled to have before we approach a Bill of this kind?</P>
    <P>I do not know the reason, but, from the very beginning, there appears to me to have been a studied policy of withholding as much information as possible from the public in connection with this transport adventure, and I am describing it properly as an adventure. It is an adventure for the rest of us at all events because we are asked to pledge State credit, to give up people's property by our votes without knowing the justification for taking such a decision.  The Minister gaily manoeuvres around as between a policy of temporary subsidisation of the company, to help the company through an emergency, and nationalisation. And then he builds up a very strong case on the assumption that the basis of his argument is dogma. Nationalisation is unthinkable in the opinion of the Government because nationalisation is subsidisation and subsidisation of transport is unthinkable. What are the proposals in this Bill?  What proposals are we asked to pass, by a Minister who abhors subsidisation <Col N="1831" /> and who says the policy of subsidisation is unthinkable?  We are asked to pledge public credit and to pledge the finances of the Central Fund to meet certain classes of dividends if the company does not make good.  Is not that subsidisation?  And, if subsidisation is so abhorrent to the Minister, why does he select this particular form of subsidisation?  Over here there is no love for nationalisation, but when we have reached the point that private and public property has got to be compulsorily absorbed, when State credit and State revenue have got to be shovelled in to keep going our main system of public transport, then I think we have reached the point that we are reluctantly forced into saying the situation is so desperate that the only way to meet it is nationalisation.  If public finance is to be committed in public ventures then I think public control is the natural answer and public control is essential and desirable.</P>
    <P>The Minister refers to the Post Office&mdash;an essential national service nationalised.  I have no doubt in the world that you could get a group of two or three business men and pass them over the whole property of the Post Office, telephones, telegraphs, and all the rest, and that they would give as efficient service and make a profit out of it.  But, on the whole, I am not dissatisfied with the service we are getting from that Department and reference to the Post Office does not frighten me away from the same type of service with regard to national transport.  I think it would be fair, if public transport is to be maintained in the interests of the people as a whole, that it should be maintained at the expense of the people as a whole. Certainly, if the finances of the public as a whole are to be committed to a scheme such as this, there should be public control, public supervision.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that in a democracy there would be political pressure, so much so, that demands could not be refused by any Government relying on the franchise of the people.  There may be something in that, but I do not think it <Col N="1832" /> will be generally accepted.  If that argument is to apply to transport, should not it apply to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, and there are areas without telephone facilities, without telegraph facilities, with a twice weekly postal delivery and, unquestionably, pressure is being brought to bear on the Minister but the Minister is able to withstand that pressure and, no matter what success or failure crowned the efforts of the Government in other directions, they were always successful in rolling in the votes.</P>
    <P>I think it is due to this Dáil to utter that protest against the withholding of relevant information, the refusal to take the Dáil fully into the Minister's confidence, the refusal to give the Dáil any picture of how the money it is proposed to raise is going to be spent.  In the Transport Tribunal we had a body of the most experienced people that we could get together with regard to railway matters in particular and transport matters in general. They went into the whole question of passenger and goods traffic, rail and road traffic, very very fully.  They got together an immense amount of data. They sat for a very considerable number of months and, as a result, they prepared a majority report and a minority report.  The Government takes those two reports, the work of highly experienced persons and a number of experts, and they throw both reports into the waste paper basket.  They come along with a completely new scheme of far greater magnitude, a scheme evolved by some person or persons unknown or unnamed, and the Dáil is asked to accept that or to reject the recommendations of the tribunal.  I do not think that is reasonable.  It may be that the Minister has far more competent advice than what was available at the time of the Railway Tribunal.  What is the point of keeping that advice secret?  There is too much secrecy about affairs in this State in recent years.  How was the figure £20,000,000 arrived at?  Was it like this?  Was it the old game, think of a number, double it, add so much to it, and that is your answer?  That is the manner in <Col N="1833" /> which the figure may have been arrived at.  The Minister did not give any information to indicate that it was arrived at in any other way.  I suggest that to a Parliament of representative people, seriously facing their responsibilities, whatever they do, they dare not support the measure on the information we were given and retain their self-respect.  If, at the end of this debate, the Minister is more expansive than he was at the beginning, he may make a case, and may provide some reasons why this particular measure should be supported.  I remind the Minister that there is a vast difference between expansiveness and length of time.</P>
    <P>In this Bill we have a proposal of a rather startling kind.  It did startle the public when it was first made, that it was intended to take over what was known as the Dublin United Tramways Company and absorb it in a joint company with the Railway Board.  The Minister referred to that rather lightly, and rather briefly: as some people thought, because they were at one time separate, they should for all time remain separate.  Beyond a light statement to that effect, no case was made for that amalgamation.  There may be a case.  I expect there is a case but we have not heard it.  Anybody leaning back and looking at the proposals would say: &ldquo;Amalgamation of the railway company is necessary because it was doing badly, and amalgamation of the tramway company was necessary because it was doing well.&rdquo;  That is the picture that presents itself.  But no case was made by the Minister, and no enlightenment was brought to bear on the subject.  Are we to understand that the tramway company is merged now with the railway company so that the tramway company will act as a milch cow for the services over the remainder of Ireland?  Is that the idea? That would strike one as being the obvious idea.</P>
    <P>When the electrical undertakings that existed in Dublin were brought under a national board at the time of the passing of the Electricity Supply Board Act, specific legislation was enacted to ensure that although these city undertakings were coming under the national board, the benefit of their <Col N="1834" /> profits would be retained in the city areas, and would not be used to finance undertakings in the rest of the country. There is no provision whatever of that kind in this Bill.  No case has been made by the Minister.  The complaint I am making with regard to lack of information to Deputies on being asked to pass this Bill, was made by the tramway shareholders when a pistol was put to their heads and they were told: &ldquo;Accept the terms, or else&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;  The whole handling of the situation may display energy; certainly, it did not display tact.  The handling of the Dáil displays anything but tact.  We have proposals in this Bill to establish a new and peculiar type of board, where the Minister nominates a person as chairman and the shareholders will nominate so many others.  Decisions will be taken by that board, but no decision is effective except with the concurrence of the chairman.  What are all the rest of them there for?  Is it to pass the time? Is it merely to provide so many jobs? What is the use of inviting any group of men to discuss matters if their opinion&mdash;even the unanimous opinion &mdash;would count for nothing as against the views of one individual?</P>
    <P>The Minister stressed the importance of the railways to the nation. The company at the moment is managed in the main by two very competent and very experienced people, both of them road-minded, both of them bus-minded.  Presumably the same persons will be in charge of the new company.  Is there any assurance that there is going to be a railway line at all in this country in ten or 15 years' time?  I have a feeling that that is the idea; that we will have, possibly, a more efficient type of service but entirely a road service.  I know that there are numbers of people who think that the day of railway lines is gone, except in great military countries, where they are kept for military reasons.  Would the Minister tell us, when concluding, some of the things he did not tell us in his opening statement?  Is there any guarantee that railway lines are going to be retained?  I do not think there is anything in the Bill to indicate whether <Col N="1835" /> the type of management could be a railway-minded management or a road-minded management, and within the scope of £20,000,000, either type of management could frolic around and carry out their own policy.  I may be wrong in that.  I am speaking as a person who had two brief week-ends to get at the background of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Portion of this Bill deals with the compensation of workers who are displaced as a result of this merger. In previous pieces of legislation provision was made so that a displaced worker would get compensation settled through arbitration if he lost his employment as a result of a merger and, speaking from memory, I think those provisions held over a period of seven years, if displaced because of new legislation.</P>
    <P>Here we have proposals to compensate for a limited period of six months. I would like to hear some explanation of that.  I do not think anybody would be so callous or so brutal as deliberately to wait six months and then unload workers so as to trick, them out of their legal compensation. Can we have some explanation from the Minister as to why the six months' period is mentioned?  Surely it is reasonable to say that if an officer or servant loses his employment because of legislation enacted by this House, whether at the end of six months or six years, he will be compensated for the loss of employment.  I do not think there will be any conflict as to the reasonableness of a view such as that.  Why the period is limited in the Bill I do not understand.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, our attitude to this Bill is one of opposition.  The Bill is one that can be more adequately dealt with on Committee Stage.  It is such a voluminous and comprehensive measure that, to try to deal with it now, especially in view of the fact that the Committee Stage is to come on later, would be waste of public time. I regret very much that the Minister and the Government showed such a lack of consideration for the Opposition Parties as not to give them reasonable time to study this Bill.  That attitude <Col N="1836" /> was followed up by the Minister's introduction of the measure in which he gave the House the minimum amount of information on matters on which it would be absolutely necessary for Deputies to be conversant before asking them to cast a vote.  In all the circumstances, we think that some word of explanation is necessary as to why the recommendations in the majority and minority reports of the Transport Tribunal were discarded by the Government and why a third scheme was put before the House.  The House is being told in effect: &ldquo;Put that through with the minimum amount of consideration and with the minimum amount of time to discuss it.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill of a complicated character.  It is made up of 117 sections and ten Schedules.  It passes comprehension how the Minister can plead that any considerations should compel the House to pass it, give it the force of law and have it in operation by the 5th July next. Ten years have passed since railway legislation was first introduced here. Apparently, it was not felt that there was any compelling necessity to introduce a Bill of this character with such speed as the one before it.  During the past four years of a world war not once was it suggested that there was any urgency about the introduction of a Bill of this kind, so that after seven years of peace and over four years of war the Government suddenly decide that it is imperative to pass this Bill and have it operative within eight weeks, and that during a period when there will be restricted sittings of the House.  The Minister gave no indication whatever as to the urgency of the Bill or as to why it is necessary for the House to sacrifice its rights of reasonable discussion and pass it according to the time-table suggested by himself.  The Ceann Comhairle, I think, interpreting the Minister's point of view, said that the Bill was one dealing with post-war transport.  If so, is there any urgency why it should be passed and become operative by the 5th July?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the Minister is treating the House fairly in asking it to discuss this measure in all its aspects and <Col N="1837" /> pass it through all its stages&mdash;at the same time providing the Seanad with an opportunity of doing the same&mdash;so that it may become operative from the 5th July.  If every Deputy were to exercise his right to discuss the Bill, it would be quite impossible for the House to pass it within the time suggested by the Minister.  From the public point of view, I think that more time for its discussion should be allowed so that we might get informed public views as to its provisions and its effects on industry, commerce and agriculture.  It is a Bill that will affect the lives of all our people, and that will have widespread repercussions in every sphere of human activity in the country.  It is obviously the kind of Bill for the discussion of which sufficient time should be allowed so as to get the type of informed public opinion which is so necessary in a matter of this kind.  I hope, therefore, that the Minister, on reconsideration, will not endeavour to induce the House to keep to the time-table suggested, and that even yet an adequate opportunity will be given to discuss the Bill.  Certainly, more time should be given for its discussion than would be possible under the Minister's time-table.</P>
    <P>I was rather interested and amused at the Minister's lengthy dissertation on the dangers of nationalisation and his belated warning to the House of the danger of setting up a nationalised undertaking because of the fear that Governments, being popularly elected, might not be able to withstand the pressure from outside interests, or that, if they did endeavour to stand up against pressure from outside interests, another Party might come along seeking the reins of office with promises to do for the interests concerned some of the things which the sitting Government will not do. The Minister was like the poacher turned gamekeeper because there is nobody in this country who has practised the art of political manipulation with greater success and greater skill than the present Minister for Industry and Commerce.  When he came to produce the rabbits out of the bag at elections, there was no gentleman more <Col N="1838" /> capable of exercising his skilful hands than the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The Minister, as far back as 1931&mdash;the Minister, of course, in those days used to woo the railwaymen at Inchicore by saying that the Fianna Fáil Party was the railwaymen's Party and that kind of thing&mdash;spoke in this House on a road transport Bill.  The views which he expressed on that occasion, speaking on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, are reported in Volume 40 of the Dáil Debates, column 2646.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party to these questions has been revealed in the past, in so far as it has been possible for us to acquire all the necessary information to formulate a definite policy in the matter. We are strongly in favour of public ownership of transport services with unified control outside the boundaries of the municipalities.  Inside the boundaries of the municipalities we are in favour of municipal ownership and control of these services. It is not necessary that we should discuss the merits of that alternative policy at great length now.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So in 1931 the present Minister for Industry and Commerce was telling us that the Fianna Fáil Party stood for the public ownership of transport services outside the municipal boundaries, and that inside the municipal boundaries the Fianna Fáil Party stood for the municipalisation of the transport services which then existed.  Later in the same debate the Minister used these words at 2653, same volume:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;These are the main points I want to make in regard to the proposals that are before us.  I think that these proposals are altogether inadequate to deal with the situation. I feel certain that in a few years' time, if the present Government are still in office, they will have to come again to the Dáil with fresh proposals to deal with the circumstances that will then exist, proposals along the line which I have suggested here, the line which apparently the Government contemplated taking in 1925, when the President of the Executive Council stated that if the Amalgamation <Col N="1839" /> Bill which was passed in that year did not achieve the purposes which the Government had in mind, then nationalisation of the railways would be the next step.  That apparently was the mind of the Government then.  It certainly is my view that we shall ultimately be forced to recognise that the maintenance of the railways on an efficient basis will be a direct obligation of the State which it will have to take over, as it has taken over a number of public utility services in recent years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So that, in 1931, it was the viewpoint of the present Minister for Industry and Commerce that it would be necessary for the State to take over the ownership of the railway services of the country and that it was only thus that the services could be maintained on an efficient basis.  The Minister has now run full circle in respect of his thoughts on railway development. In 1944, he states that possibly the greatest evil of all would be the nationalisation of transport: that is the only meaning which could be attached to the words he used in this House to-day.  In 1931, the country was promised nationalisation of transport by Fianna Fáil and the railway workers were assured that that was Fianna Fáil policy.  In 1944, we are told by the Minister that the greatest danger which could befall the country &mdash;and, inferentially, the railway workers&mdash;is that the promise of 1931 be implemented in 1944.  The real danger to-day, we are told, is not nationalisation but rather that the Minister should implement the 1931 promise and, if it had been implemented at any time since 1931, the awful catastrophe, which the Minister says would have been a misfortune for the country, would have to be borne to-day.  Fortunately, the Minister did not erupt before 1931, and the country has been spared the catastrophe which the Minister tells us now would have followed the implementation of the policy of nationalising the railway services.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about the nationalisation of the railway services <Col N="1840" /> in other countries.  Here again there was democratic Government in those countries&mdash;or was, at the time those services were operated as nationalised undertakings and at a time when we were able to obtain information as to the management of those services.  If those countries found it possible to maintain nationalised undertakings, even if they did not yield a financial surplus, I think that a closer examination will show that those countries acted in that way because they were satisfied that nationalisation gave to their respective citizens much better services than could be provided by such a private undertaking as it is proposed to set up in this country now. In any case, it is sufficient for the House to know, and sufficient to cause curiosity amongst members of the House, that, when those countries continued to operate a nationalised transport system, they had some very good national reasons for doing so, seeing that they could have abandoned nationalisation with the utmost ease if the Governments in those countries desired to do so.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that, in his view, nationalised transport means subsidised transport.  That apparently did not worry him in 1931.  No question of subsidising transport worried him, when indicating his Party's policy in this House and making speeches at Athlone and Inchicore.  The main thing then was that a national undertaking would provide a service for the people rather than make profits for those interested in the production of profits as a condition of the continuation of railway services.  Are we not setting up now the worst of all forms of subsidised transport?  The State in this country is to guarantee £16,000,000 of 3 per cent. redeemable debenture bonds&mdash;not irredeemable, but redeemable debenture bonds.  There is £16,000,000 in respect of which the taxpayer will be liable to guarantee the interest at the rate of 3 per cent. per annum.  In other words, the taxpayer may be asked to put his hands in his pocket each year for £500,000 to pay the interest on the 3 per cent. guaranteed redeemable bonds.  That is subsidised transport and that is subsidising the <Col N="1841" /> interests of the community.  This country is setting up a private monopoly, owned by the people who hold the stock in the company.  The stock will be held by private individuals.  We are, therefore, merely perpetuating an existing private ownership of transport by this company, and the taxpayers are being required, if necessary, to subsidise this transport service.  For the Minister to talk about subsidised transport services being a feature of national transport undertakings, in introducing a Bill of this character, which is providing public subsidies for a privately owned transport service, is an anomaly which I cannot easily reconcile.</P>
    <P>Instead of implementing his 1931 promise to give the country a nationalised transport undertaking, the Minister now proposes the amalgamation of the Great Southern Railways Company with the Dublin United Transport Company.  In other words, he proposes to perpetuate a private monopoly in transport in Dublin and throughout the country.  Very generous compensation is being provided for shareholders.  As a matter of fact, the shareholders of the Dublin United Transport Company and the Great Southern Railways should erect a very lofty monument to the present Minister, as there is no doubt in the world that he has been a fairy godfather, so far as the shareholders of both those companies are concerned.</P>
    <P>Efforts were made by some shareholders to say that the scheme of compensation provided was not satisfactory and that the shareholders should hold out for more conpensation. The Minister knows that that effort was foredoomed to failure.  The cute old boys, the shareholders who had their money invested, did not like to take a risk on an uncertain future and said: &ldquo;Oh no, these terms offered by the Minister are the best we will get,&rdquo; and all the boys packed in their votes for the Minister's scheme of compensation. They knew perfectly well&mdash; and they were quite right in the accuracy of their viewpoint&mdash;that the Minister was giving them compensation on a much more generous scale than they ever expected.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1842" /> What are the facts?  Everybody knows that, in the last few years, owing to the war, modes of transport have been restricted and there has been a concentration of passenger and goods traffic on the available services. Examination of the figures of passengers carried and revenue earned by the Great Southern Railways and the Dublin United Transport Company will show that the passenger traffic has increased enormously and that the income earned per running mile is very much greater now than at any time previously.  That is due to the fact that passengers are now being concentrated more densely on the present services, and the operating costs, on the other hand, have been reduced to a minimum.</P>
    <P>In the days before the war, the ordinary stock of the Dublin United Transport Company was quoted at 7/6. Under this Bill, I think we are paying the Dublin United Transport Company something like 26/- or 26/6 for stock which, some years ago, was quoted at 7/6.  This is not bad from the point of view of the company's shareholders. I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <P>I was dealing with general Land Commission policy but, before I again take up that matter, I should like to deal with several points raised by Deputies, some of which were personal, some local and some which may be answered in a few words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Roddy raised a question about erosion.  I am very much interested in erosion, because in my constituency there is a rather dangerous <Col N="1843" /> river and I was one of those who were interested in having a clause inserted in the 1933 Act whereby annuities might be remitted in respect of any lands where erosion would affect their value.  I am not sure if it was Section 37 or Section 27 of that Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Was there not a provision in the 1923 Act about that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking of the 1933 Act.  Deputy Murphy referred to the wages paid by the Land Commission. The Land Commission have 49 supervising gangers, whose wages are 12/4 to 14/8 per day; 250 gangers at 9/- to 11/8 per day, and 1,393 labourers at 6/2 per day.  Deputy Keyes introduced the subject of distance.  When I first went to the Land Commission, I took up this question of distance with the commissioners.  My view was that the distances already being permitted were too great, because in my experience when a man lives too far away from the land which he works, his work is not as effective as it would be if he were to live on the land.  It is the experience of the Land Commission that when the distance is too great, the farm which is allocated to the particular allottee is not properly worked. Therefore, we must be guided by our experience rather than by Deputy Keyes' views.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins referred to water supplies and asked whether the water was analysed where we sink wells and erect pumps.  It is analysed.  Deputy Hogan raised a question about fences and quicks.  So far as I am concerned, I am more used to the double bank. I will say the Land Commission fences are rather attenuated but, nevertheless, they are a sound job.  Deputies must remember that a sod fence built in the dry weather of summer time is not as effective as one built in the winter months, but generally they are a good job, and quicks are planted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish Fianna Fáil <Col N="1844" /> Deputies would give me a chance of making my case.  Quicks are planted. Allottees have found many grounds for complaint, but I think that if they were to occupy their time by giving a little protection to the quicks, there might not be so many complaints about the fences.  Possibly, quicks are not always planted, even in those fences which are on the lands of allottees who happen to be Fianna Fáil supporters, but people cannot have everything.</P>
      <P>Some Deputy, I think it was Deputy Roddy, referred to reclamation.  We have three main schemes&mdash;at Donegal, Galway and Mayo.  These, however, are merely experiments.  It is not the business of the Land Commission to indulge in reclamation.  My own experience of reclamation is that it is tremendously costly in my constituency, and is not value for the money expended.  It may be necessary and wise at certain times, in order to provide employment, that we should indulge in such schemes.  There is a type of reclamation, such as that in Donegal, a sand fixation scheme, which has proved eminently successful.</P>
      <P>Deputy Roddy mentioned that we have tremendous erosion all over our coasts.  That is not correct.  We have certain main points of erosion here and there, particularly at Lahinch, in County Clare.  But the sea, like the Lord, giveth and taketh away, and no purpose would be served in adopting the suggestion of building an enormous concrete wall around this country.  That would be of no use.  At any rate, the question of dealing with coast erosion is altogether a matter for another Department, and not for the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton raised the question of migrants versus the claims of local men in County Kildare.  I could make a lot of comments on the attitude of the Labour Party to land holding, but I will not bother.  The whole point is that in County Kildare migrants have got 5.9 per cent. of the divided land and the local people got the rest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to over-tilling, some points were raised by people in the Farmers' Party.  The Land Commission <Col N="1845" /> have had, naturally, to produce food the same as every farmer.  The general complaint is that the farmers are over-tilling and destroying fertility. The Land Commission have certainly tilled as much as possible and are laying down the land again in grass as far as possible.  We think we are just as good farmers as are to be found in the country.</P>
    <P>Some Deputy suggested that we have land too long on our hands.  That is correct, undoubtedly, but Deputies of experience will realise the necessity for retaining certain lands in the hands of the Land Commission, particularly in the congested areas, so that there shall be proper division and better circumstances shall be created for the people who live in very evil circumstances in those congested areas.</P>
    <P>I will go back now to the main question of Land Commission policy and the Land Commission generally. Deputies in the House here have known for a long time that the Farmers' Party is a myth.  We did not realise, of course, that the members of the Farmers' Party were mythologists. Deputy Cogan produced a mythological tale the other day to make his point.  My colleague and friend, Deputy Halliden, is also a mythologist.</P>

      <P>Deputy Donnellan with his ten moral cocks and Deputy O'Donnell with his infinite capacity for jest are both folklorists.  I have been wondering if it was not the example of that inspired publicist, my friend Deputy Phil Mahony, that has enthused Deputy Blowick and even Deputy O'Higgins with a desire for sanitation, but there is one thing about Deputy Cogan's speech and his mythological references.  He has got something, I agree in great measure, that might be worth consideration, the question of fusing the Land Commission and the Department of Agriculture. Their work is so much interrelated that it might be worth the consideration of the Government to revert to the system that obtained in the beginning when the Land Commission <Col N="1846" /> and Department of Agriculture were one.</P>
      <P>I have a completely open mind on that.  Even if Deputy Cogan could not provide for what would happen if a Minister were lost in the process.  I listened to other Deputies speaking on the land question but I was more impressed by what Deputy Fionan Lynch said than by any of the others. I remembered that Deputy Lynch was of the same political vintage years as myself and felt like a certain Kerryman, ni bheidh ár leitheidí arís ann. Deputy Lynch said the purpose of the Land Acts was to place the farmer as the owner in fee simple of his land.  I think it is a good definition but it is not quite wide enough, because the placing of the farmer as the owner in fee simple of his land presupposes his occupation of those lands.  Many estates had no tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many estates were excluded in the operation of the various Land Acts, and I would like to be careful in trying to say what I think is the ideal policy in regard to land to-day.  I think that the farmer ought to be placed in the utmost security on his land.  All this talk about the farmer having no security is disproved by the fact that, at the present moment, according to the speeches of everyone who spoke and to general knowledge, there is a tremendous demand for land.  That tremendous demand and that tremendous price would not be there if the people who purchased the land did not believe they were secure in their holdings.  I believe there is no bottom at all to the argument that security has been destroyed, but beside that security the policy is, I take it, to have as many agriculturists on the land as is consistent with maximum production. Some people believe that all Government policy should be economic policy.  Other people believe that it should be social policy.  I believe that it should be a social economic policy. I believe that those who consider Government policy merely from the point of view of hard cash, and forget the social implications are wrong, and that those who merely want a social policy and are prepared to ignore hard economic facts are also wrong.  In <Col N="1847" /> land as in everything else, there is the question of saturation and of diminishing returns, and again I have an open mind in regard to the size of the farm that should be allotted by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan mentioned a farm of 1,000 acres which was, to his mind, of tremendous value to the country.  It is quite possible that a farm of 1,000 acres may be of tremendous value, but a farm of 1,000 acres requires an enormous capital and calls for control by men of special training and great capacity.  Many of these large undertakings I have seen throughout the country have rather a habit of becoming unstuck.  I do say that there is a limit to the length to which the Land Commission policy or any Government policy should go in the acquisition and division of land.  It would be a very bad policy if we reduced the farms in this country to one dull level of dead uniformity.  I think there ought to be farms of varying and different sizes, and as Deputy Cogan says, there is a place for the good large farmer and a place for the good small farmer.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Dillon comes along with the story that the gold of Midas would not be of any use to us if we pursue the policy of land division, I am reminded that something like 15,000,000 acres have passed to the farmers through the operations of the Land Acts.  The amount of land available now, considering mountain, bog and waste, is not of any great extent, comparatively speaking.  The amount of money to be expended has no relation to Deputy Dillon's example. I think you might as well let the tail go with the hide and finish the job. But there can be no progress without security.  If men are not secure in their holdings, we will have disruption and discontent, and it has never been the policy of the present Government to dispossess any particular individual, no matter how much land he holds, if he has been working that land satisfactorily and for the benefit of the nation.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies praised the Land Commission.  Deputy O'Higgins said, <Col N="1848" /> I think, that it is an excellent Department. Deputy Murphy rightly pointed out that the tolerant, wise way in which the Land Commission are collecting the land annuities has been responsible for the success of the collection, and I think that after what Deputy Murphy said the other night, Deputies generally should give up the habit of knocking the collection branch of the Land Commission when they have done their job in a wise, tolerant and effective fashion.</P>
    <P>Certain things were said, particularly in relation to Fianna Fáil clubs, about grabbers and emergency men.  While Deputy O'Higgins held that the Land Commission was a magnificent Department, Deputy Dillon informed us that it was now regarded as the friend of the grabber and the emergency man. The grabber was possibly the meanest type ever bred in this country.  He took advantage of a law passed, not for the benefit of this country, to despoil his neighbour, and the emergency man was as low a type as the grabber.  Both of them were the particular instruments and tools of those of 30, 40 or 50 years ago who were fighting for security of tenure.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donnellan raised the question of the Ashtown Estate in Galway. I was not aware that there was an Ashtown Estate in Galway, but my memory of an Ashtown Estate was concerned with Waterford, a place called Glenaheira Lodge, and when I heard of the grievance from Galway, I remembered &ldquo;Grievances from Ireland&rdquo; which emanated from Glenaheira Lodge.  The man who was bombed out of Glenaheira Lodge, if Deputy Heskin will remember it&mdash;whoever bombed him out&mdash;was one of those who was associated with emergency men and grabbers in trying to retain security of tenure for certain people in this country.  Fianna Fáil was not bred from that type.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick was not here when I was talking about the mythology of the Farmers' Party.  He is rather a visionary.  Mind you, I am one myself. The thing Deputy Blowick visualises and hopes for will, I trust, come true but I am afraid I cannot apply any <Col N="1849" /> immediate ointment to his soul.  Like Deputy Blowick, I think that the women folk who work on farms are the last of the serfs.  I feel the conditions under which they work are vile, and the Land Commission, the Government and the Deputies here should take every step to try to improve the conditions under which women have to work on the farms.  But expert medical evidence is often very contradictery. When I heard Deputy O'Higgins speaking about sanitary conditions in the country as if the whole countryside was a foul and dark latrine, I was rather amazed.  There is no immediate prospect, and Deputy Blowick must know it, of installing hot and cold water in farm houses throughout the countryside.  A prominent English politician, speaking in the House of Lords the other day, deprecated the constant use of the bath and pointed out that there was no necessity in the world for the installation of pipes for sewerage or plumbing in the country. I live in the country among the people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and they are in favour of a national survey.  I passed eight water barrels in the county of Tipperary during a two hours' drive in mid-March.  They are badly off even beside the Suir, and somebody will have to tackle the water problem.  The Land Commission should see that the people get a proper water supply.  It is the most glaring thing we are in need of.  You cannot get hot water&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>You cannot get hot water out of the Suir anyhow.  I do not think there is any use in talking <Col N="1850" /> about the installation of outside plumbing in the farm houses of this country at the present time.  The point Deputy O'Donnell raised is worthy of attention, however.  There is a shortage of water on farms, and it is one of the difficulties that often holds up the division of land.  The Land Commission has to try to make every effort to provide water, and to divide estates so that water will be available for all the tenants.  The provision of water on farms referred to by Deputy O'Donnell is needed also in my own constituency, particularly in the eastern side of it, and I suppose eventually we will solve that problem by a co-operative grid system throughout the country.  It cannot be solved otherwise.</P>
      <P>Deputy Roddy is a much more experienced hand than Deputy Blowick.  He has reason to be anyhow, and Deputy Roddy raised the question of the training of allottees and the provision of capital for them.  I am rather unfortunate in my publicity&mdash; Deputy Halliden and others see to that.  I said in a speech I made last year that nobody should get land but farmers and I hold to that.  I think that if a man is not experienced in land, if he has not been used to working on it, there is no use in giving him a farm and all the leaflets and pamphlets and technical training in the world will not substitute for the experience man gains in his youth on the land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies here may have read many things, but they must <Col N="1851" /> not have read the Bible.  They are not aware of the saying that the eyes of the fool are on the ends of the earth.  We are told what happened in Denmark and all about Scottish land law and English land law and so on. All these are beside the point.  It is pointed out that in Denmark a man can mortgage his farm and raise so much money on it.  As against that, does not the State put up the money for the purchase of the farm for the allottee here?  Is that not a far better type of assistance than any Dane can get in any Danish bank?  Now, whether he is a member of a Fianna Fáil Club or just an honest man, the allottee who gets a farm from the Land Commission, with a house and fences on it, no matter how you select him, is arbitrarily selected.  There are a dozen just as good and suitable men in every parish as the man who eventually gets the land.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell raised his hands in wonder the other night as to how selections were made.  We must leave the question of selection to the inspectors of the Land Commission, who are experienced, who get to know all the facts, and who ought to have, and I believe have, no political bias. Have Deputies who suggested that members of Fianna Fáil Clubs are grabbers and emergency men who get all the land read Section 6 of the 1933 Act, which certain people in this House tell you has destroyed security of tenure?  Whatever else it does, does it not completely take out of the hands of any politician or any political Party the question of dealing with the giving out of these lands?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that you must get a man capable of farming and put him on the land.  When you have got him, you could, in his own parish, get a dozen men just as suitable and just as good. Therefore, he gets an advantage over his fellow-man possibly of some £600 or £1,000.  It is altogether wrong that one man should get so definite an advantage over his fellow-man and at his fellow-man's expense.  Having given him that, there is no point in putting &ldquo;a second hump on Jack Madden&rdquo; Along with giving a piece of land <Col N="1852" /> worth from £600 to £1,000, is it seriously suggested that we should also put at his disposal another £500 or £600 of capital?</P>
    <P>I think the Deputy, who was formerly in the Land Commission and who made such a suggestion, must have never considered the implications of this matter seriously.  I have no wish to deprive any man of an opportunity of getting land.  The policy is to place as many people firmly on the land as will be consistent with maximum output. Therefore we must put on the land a man who is capable of taking the farm you give him, putting in his stock and going to work immediately. I do not believe that it is wise that we should give people land who are incapable of working it and who have not the capital to work it.  I think it is wrong and foolish.  There is speculation in land.  By the way, is there a time limit, Sir?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a deputation to see me on this question of the purchase of land and big houses with it.  The declared purpose of that deputation, whatever the real purpose, was to preserve these houses as hospitals or schools or for some other purpose like that.  Now, the Land Commission, of course, and every other Department have permitted the destruction of certain houses, with which I do not agree.  But, in general, the majority of these big houses that I know, and I am very familiar with them, are not structurally sound, have no artistic value and no historic interest.  From my unregenerate point of view, I choose to regard them as tombstones of a departed ascendency and the sooner they go down the better&mdash;they are no use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of annuities has been raised time and again and, no matter what assurances Deputies get, they still continue to raise it.  Now, the reduction of the land purchase annuities under the provisions of the Land Act, 1933, does not extend the duration of the payments.  I could give a very detailed explanation of this <Col N="1853" /> question of annuities.  It is an intricate question and many reservations have to be made because of the different conditions in regard to annuities.  But the main point that people are concerned about is: does the reduction in the annuities extend the time of payment.  It does not.</P>
    <P>I have to come back again to the question of migrants, which Deputy Roddy raised.  Of the 122 Gaeltacht migrants who came to County Meath, eight went home; and of the 189 group migrants transferred last year, one went home and he came back again. Deputy Giles said that we broke our promises in dealing with the migrants. I wish Deputies would stand on one particular foot or the other and not dodge between the two.  The Deputy's normal complaint is that we give too much to the migrants.  In answer to his last complaint, I say that anything we promised the migrants we gave them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would take too long to explain the whole matter.  I will let the Deputy have the fullest explanation of the matter.  But the main point is that the reduction does not extend the time of payment.  Deputy Blowick raised the question of the length of time for which estates in the congested areas are in the hands of the Land Commission.  It does, of course, seem incredible that land has to be held by the Land Commission over such long periods.  The difficulty in the matter is that it is not land we are dealing with, but with men and men's minds. There is so little land available for the many claimants that we must take every opportunity to try to migrate some of the people from the congested areas before we will have enough land to satisfy in any way those remaining, and if Deputies persist in saying that local men shall get preference over migrants in Kildare, when migrants in Kildare get only 5.9 per cent. of the land divided, we can never deal with <Col N="1854" /> the real sore in this body politic, the congested districts.</P>
      <P>I was terribly surprised by Deputy Tunney's statement.  I thought Mayo men were clannish, that they would stick together and help each other like Kerry people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not at all a bad idea.  Deputy Tunney says that there is an estate in Oldtown, County Dublin, on which two migrants from County Kerry have got farms to the detriment of the local County Dublin people.  I will not say that Deputy Tunney fouled his own nest&mdash;that is a nasty thing&mdash;but he rather &ldquo;knocked&rdquo; his own people.  In order to show that he was not attacking Kerry people, he said he did not believe that either Kerry or Mayo people should get the land.  Deputy Tunney is not the first man who left his country for his own good, and I do not think he should quite close the door&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I know Kerrymen who have been migrated this year from the Magheries to Leinster and I think that, as farmers, they will be an example to all the province of Leinster. <Col N="1855" /> The man who has to work on a hard, coarse mountain farm may not immediately fall in with local methods in County Dublin, but at least he brings an energy and a capacity for taking punishment which many people in County Dublin, not even Malachy Horan, could excel.</P>
      <P>Deputy Donnellan and Deputy Beegan raised the question of the Ashtown estate.  The forestry section were offered 1,000 acres on that estate and I asked the Land Commission to inspect it and to take out of it whatever was of value to the Land Commission. The Land Commission took 143 acres as being of value, but there was no previous agreement of any kind with the owner.</P>

      <P>I mention quit rents because they have a habit of cropping up in my own constituency.  The Quit <Col N="1856" /> Rent Office is part of the Land Commission now and Deputy Dillon has said that it will be my responsibility in future to describe what a quit rent is.  Deputy Dillon, as Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, has had the responsibility of describing what a quit rent is for the past few years, and I am sure a Deputy with so didactic and pontificatory mind as Deputy Dillon finds tremendous enjoyment in enlightening his colleagues in the matter.  I suggest to Deputy Dillon's American friends that if the Statue of Liberty ever falls into New York Harbour, they ought to put him up on a pedestal as a substitute, for the enlightenment of the world. Deputies will remember that the Statue of Liberty is hollow.  If any Deputy is not satisfied with the explanation of a quit rent given by Deputy Dillon&mdash;he will find it in the reports of the Public Accounts Committee&mdash;I will make an effort to be helpful in the matter.  I will give footnotes and a glossary.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission is not functioning at full strength.  Emergency conditions have militated against the working of the Land Commission, but we are doing our best under very difficult conditions to meet the viewpoint of the country in regard to the carrying out of known policy.  I confess that I always had a personal prejudice against the Land Commission.  This prejudice gradually grew less as my years of experience in politics lengthened, but I still have a prejudice against the Land Commission.  It has not been completely dissipated, but in my association with the Land Commission, I have learned that the unseen burden of work, the burden of work which cannot be shown and cannot be appreciated, which the Land Commission has to tackle is greater than that of any other Department.  It is easy to criticise, but no matter how critical or how well-informed we are, when we are not quite inside the organisation of the Land Commission, we really cannot understand the great burden of unseen and unappreciated work which the officials have to do.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum, not exceeding £152,580, be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1945, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with Forestry (9 &amp; 10 Geo. 5, c. 58, and No. 34 of 1928), including certain Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>In introducing the Estimate for this Vote last year, reference was made to the difficulties which war conditions had placed in the way of forestry operations.  Developments during the past 12 months have not improved the position.  Attempts to secure supplies of rabbit-netting from America have been unsuccessful.  In fact some 5,000 rolls manufactured there to the order of the Forestry Division have been taken for war purposes by the American Government, and there is no prospect of securing additional supplies anywhere.  In these circumstances, it is pleasing to be able to record that the planting programme last winter has been maintained at nearly the figure of the preceding winter, 4,318 acres.  Efforts will be made to maintain the planting programme next winter in the neighbourhood of 4,000 acres, but it is extremely doubtful whether this can be done unless circumstances change for the better.  The restrictions on planting affect the present time and the immediate future, whereas the extent to which seed sowing in the nurseries can be carried out affects the extent of planting programmes some years hence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purchase of seed is becoming increasingly difficult.  Some seed is being purchased in Canada and the United States and it is hoped that it will arrive in time for sowing this season.  Supplies are also being secured from Scotland.  They have been looked for in Spain and Switzerland and we shall possibly get a little from Switzerland.  The collection of homegrown seed has been extended as much <Col N="1858" /> as possible and a total of 35,000 lb. of seed of the following varieties is anticipated: Japanese larch, Norway spruce, silver fir, Scots pine, oak, beech, ash, sycamore, etc.</P>
    <P>The net Estimate for the current year represents a decrease of £7,053 as compared with the total provision for the year 1943-44.  There is a substantial decrease in the provision for the acquisition of land.  This is accounted for by a general unwillingness at present to dispose of lands of any value for grazing and by the carrying forward of a considerable sum from the current year in the Land Acquisition Fund.  There is also a decrease in the amount to be provided for travelling expenses following the completion of the field work on the census of woodlands undertaken on behalf of the Department of Supplies.</P>
    <P>The decrease in the provision for the acquisition of land must not be taken as indicating that it is not proposed to continue acquisition at the most rapid possible rate.  My Department is anxious to build up the greatest possible reserve of land in anticipation of an accelerated rate of planting when conditions return to normal.  Offers of land for sale are not coming in at the same rate as in previous years and in many cases where land has been inspected and valued the owners have refused a price considered to represent its maximum value for forestry purposes.  Nevertheless, the forestry division has succeeded during the past year in acquiring over 5,000 acres of land which, though small, is at least sufficient to replace in the reserve the area planted up during the past planting season.</P>
    <P>The census of woodlands is approaching completion.  The work in the field has been finished and the checking and compilation of the returns is well advanced.  The complete results will be available within a few months and will enable the Department of Supplies, or the Department of Industry and Commerce, to judge whether further restrictions on the use of timber are necessary in view of the fact that bulky cargoes such as timber are not likely to be available immediately after the cessation of hostilities even <Col N="1859" /> if imports of other materials are more rapidly resumed.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the provision required under the different sub-heads of the Vote, as set out in the printed Estimates, it is proposed to refer only in detail to those items which show an appreciable difference as compared with the preceding year.</P>
    <P>With regard to sub-head A&mdash;Salaries, Wages and Allowances&mdash;amounting to £23,463, the increase required under this sub-head is due to the appointment of three additional forestry inspectors and by additional bonus to the lower paid staff which is offset to some extent by a reduction in the clerical staff employed upon the compilation of the census of timber.  The provision under sub-head B&mdash;Travelling and Subsistence Allowances&mdash;of £4,500, shows an appreciable decrease due to the completion of the field work on the census which necessitated constant travelling upon the part of the outdoor officers.</P>
    <P>Sub-head C (1)&mdash;Acquisition of Land: Grant-in-Aid, £10,000&mdash;shows a reduction of £20,000 as compared with last year.  As already explained, this is not due to any policy of restricting purchases of land for forestry, the aim being quite the opposite, but to certain temporary factors such as the high returns which are being secured from sheep grazing.  The abnormal demand for sheep is making owners of rough mountain grazings reluctant to sell at all or, at any rate, to sell at a figure commensurate with the value of land for forestry purposes.  Another operative factor is the diminution in the rate at which the Land Commission is able to purchase estates.  A considerable area of land not suited to agriculture but suitable for forestry is normally secured in this way.  A further restriction on land acquisition during the past two years was the devotion to work on the timber census of the services of about half of the available senior technical officers. With the termination of that work it will be possible to concentrate greater attention on the task of securing additional offers of land and of dealing more expeditiously with the inspection <Col N="1860" /> and valuation of any offers on hand or that may be received in future.</P>
    <P>It is anticipated that a balance of about £50,000 will be carried over in the Land Acquisition Fund from the year 1943/44 and this, with the addition of the provision of £10,000 now asked for, should be sufficient to provide for probable acquisitions during the year, but, if it should be found necessary, the Dáil will be requested to provide additional funds for this purpose later in the year.  At present the Forestry Division is committed, subject to the usual legal formalities, to the purchase of 10,593 acres at a cost of £27,110 from private landowners and of 4,479 acres at a cost of £12,760 from the Land Commission.  In addition, negotiations are in an advanced stage for the acquisition from private owners of additional areas totalling 3,556 acres and negotiations are in progress with the Land Commission for the purchase of about 4,447 acres.  These offers are of course in addition to any new offers that may be received during the present year.</P>
    <P>It may not be out of place to stress once again that for the purposes of economic forestry, it is necessary that State forests should consist of blocks of sufficient extent to keep the costs of fencing, cultivation and supervision within an economic limit.  The acquisition and planting of small detached areas or long and narrow strips with excessive lengths of boundary is not economic.  Once, however, a sufficiently large area has been obtained in any district it is frequently possible to add small areas either immediately adjoining the larger blocks, or in close proximity thereto, which could not otherwise be considered for purchase.</P>
    <P>Sub-head C (2)&mdash;Maintenance and Cultural Operations&mdash;amounts to £167,290. The provision required under this sub-head is practically the same as was provided last year.  The increased wages payable to the forestry workers as compared with the earlier part of last year is offset by probable reduction in expenditure on materials and to the probable completion early in the year of the second scheme arranged with the Department of Supplies for the <Col N="1861" /> supply of firewood to Fuel Importers Ltd.  It is estimated that when this scheme is finished about 105,000 tons of firewood will have been put into Fuel Importers' dumps in Dublin, Cork, Wexford, Waterford, Limerick and Dundalk.  This with schemes for the supply of about 20,000 tons to the Dublin Corporation and 8,000 tons to the Department of Defence has made great inroads into the stocks of firewood timber in the State forests.  It is unlikely that any further appreciable quantities can be provided and whatever is left over will probably have to be reserved for local requirements.</P>
    <P>Nursery operations are being extended, as far as seed requirements can be met, with a view to the provision of adequate stocks of transplants for increased planting programmes when the present state of emergency has passed and conditions become normal. Though the outlook is not very hopeful it is still possible that a fair quantity of seed may be procured.  In order to make up for deficiencies the aid of some woodland owners who have suitable trees and of some timber merchants who were known to be felling trees of good quality has been enlisted with promising results.</P>
    <P>Sub-head C (3)&mdash;Timber Conversion &mdash;amounts to £8,948.  The provision made under this sub-head is in respect of the working of four fixed mills and ten portable crosscutting outfits.  Of the fixed mills, two, those at Dundrum, County Tipperary, and Cong, County Mayo, are continuously worked and are engaged in the cutting of timber for local requirements and the manufacture of fencing posts, gates, etc., for the Department's own use; the mill at Avondale, County Wicklow, is used mainly for the training of forestry apprentices, and the mill at Ballyfarnon, County Roscommon, is only occasionally employed on the preparation of fencing materials for the Department's own use.  The portable crosscutting outfits are being utilised, at various centres, turning out firewood blocks from scrub and inferior timber of various sorts.  Part of the output has to be retained for transmission to Dublin and the remainder is sold locally.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1862" /> The demand for firewood is everywhere very keen, but the supply is not unlimited and sales have to be restricted to a small quantity to each purchaser.  Additional engines were ordered last year, partly to replace some that have been in continual use for years and are showing signs of failing, and partly for the manufacture of new outfits, but it does not appear likely that delivery will be obtained.</P>
    <P>I move to report progress.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again later to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>At one o'clock to-day I was referring to the fact that the Minister had been a fairy godfather to the shareholders of the Great Southern Railways and the Dublin United Transport Company because he had given them in compensation for the stock which they held a sum of money which is fantastic compared to the normal actuarial value of this stock and much more, I suggest, than the shareholders themselves ever dreamed they would get.  Under the Bill we give to the Dublin United Transport Company shareholders something like 26/- for shares which were quoted a few years ago at 7/6. If they have an enhanced value it is only because of the emergency in which passengers have been almost tinned in the limited accommodation available for passenger transport.  Similarly the Great Southern Railways shareholders are getting a fantastic price for their stock.  We have guaranteed £16,000,000 in debentures as to principal and 3 per cent. interest on this £16,000,000 redeemable debenture stock so that if the company does not make a profit they can come along and say: &ldquo;Come on lads you promised in 1944 to guarantee 3 per cent. on the £16,000,000 redeemable debenture stock, hand out now the equivalent sum in dividends.&rdquo;  If it should happen to fail, then the State through the taxpayers will be liable to refund to the stockholders £16,000,000 principal <Col N="1863" /> which the State guarantees under this Bill.  An examination of the movements of railway stocks is particularly interesting.  In March of last year the chairman of the Great Southern Railways Company who is the Minister's nominee painted what can only be described as a very depressing picture of the finances of the railway. He said that no dividend could be paid and that the reason for the nonpayment of dividend was that on over 50 per cent. of the company's lines no profits were being earned.  Generally the picture he painted was rather distressing from the point of view of the shareholders and indeed not very encouraging from the point of view of prospective investors.  It gave very little encouragement from the point of view of the gamblers in stock exchange shares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What happened after March, 1943? Ordinary stock worth £9 in March, 1943, had jumped to £52 by March, 1944.  Preference stock worth £14 in 1943 was worth £52 in March, 1944, and debenture stock which was worth £56 in 1943 was worth £90 in March, 1944.  It is very clear from this that the method adopted by the Minister to compensate shareholders in respect of their share interest in both companies has been very unsatisfactory and certainly unprofitable from the point of view of the taxpayers who have been called upon to guarantee the principal and interest of £16,000,000 of debenture stock.  If, for instance, the Minister had bought the shares of this company in 1943 he would have bought them at approximately £5,000,000 less than the shareholders are getting for these shares to-day.  Because of the method adopted by the Minister, the position to-day is that&mdash;and the public ought to realise it because it is being done in their name&mdash;these people are getting £50 to £80 for shares which could have been bought 12 months ago for from £12 to £15.  I do not know why the Minister is compensating these people on such a generous basis. It is little wonder that these people realise the Minister's generosity when, notwithstanding a campaign against the Minister's and the directors' proposals, <Col N="1864" /> they have accepted the Minister's guarantee with such enthusiasm.</P>
    <P>The transport and railway companies have been operating on the legislation passed in 1933.  The whole community knows that that legislation was in operation and that the companies concerned were subject to its provisions and the investing public knew if they were buying shares in these companies that they were subject to this legislation.  It seems to be a reasonable proposition to suggest that in these circumstances the value of the shares held by the shareholders in both companies should not be the artificial values which are the outcome of an emergency situation, but the average value of the shares over the past ten years.  If the Minister would apply that method to the valuation of the shares&mdash;and it is a reasonable one&mdash; then the shareholders will not get for their shares at the public expense the inflated price which they will get under the scheme of compensation in this Bill.  Reading through the Bill one thing stands out prominently&mdash;the care and solicitude bestowed on the capital interests and the solicitude which the Minister has shown towards the holders of capital invested in the companies. Wherever their interests were affected the Minister is most generous and lavish.  Evidence of that is to be found by the examination of the compensation provisions in the Bill.  Shares not worth a song a few years ago have now become gilt-edged securities, and as I have already said, we are paying £50 to £80 for shares worth £12 to £15.  Wherever the capital interests were concerned the Minister has been generous in the method of making provision for the people concerned.  The Minister has guaranteed the profit of gamblers on the stock exchange who have now managed, because of the advance information they possessed, to get shares the value of which has been considerably enhanced because of the community's guarantee of the principal and interest of the £16,000,000 debenture stocks.  While there has been a very generous and magnanimous attitude adopted towards the capital interests concerned in the Bill, there <Col N="1865" /> has been a most niggardly and unsatisfactory attitude adopted in the Bill towards the staff.  The Minister told us there was to be provision in the Bill for compensation for persons who may lose their employment as a result of this merger.  When one examines the Bill one discovers that this applies only to persons who may lose their livelihood within a period of six months following the operation of the Bill so that as between the 1st July next and the 31st December next anybody who loses employment will get compensation in the manner provided in the Fifth Schedule of this Bill.  But everybody knows that it inevitably takes some time before a scheme of this kind gets into operation.</P>
    <P>Some preliminary work has to be done.  Plans have to be formulated. They are subject to examination and review and, finally, a decision as to their implementation has to be taken. Then the process of putting them into operation begins.  It is very difficult, and oftentimes impossible, to have a scheme of this kind in operation within six months of the nominally operative date.  I suggest to the Minister that the effects of this merger will become obvious only after six months from the 5th July next.  But any person who loses his employment with either company after 31st December next will get no compensation whatever under the provisions of this Bill. To obtain compensation he must lose his employment within six months after the date of operation of the Bill.  If he loses his employment seven months after the date of operation of the Bill, then, although he may have 30 or 40 years' service, he can get no compensation from the company.  The company may, for its own reasons, say: &ldquo;We shall tolerate redundancy for six months because, after six months, the reins are off so far as we are concerned and we can do what we like with the staff.&rdquo;  They can adopt the attitude that, by tolerating redundancy for six months, they will be free to do what they like by the end of that period and that it will be better for them to put up with redundancy for that time and save the cost of pensions for life in the case of persons <Col N="1866" /> with service of five years or more. Even if the company do not adopt that attitude of deliberately, and legally, avoiding their moral obligations, they can slow down and soft-pedal in connection with reorganisation. They can permit that reorganisation to develop leisurely, so that it will become operative only after six months from the date of the operation of the Bill.  In that event, the company can ride away without making any provision for compensation for railway employees who may have given a life-time of service to the railway industry.  If the Minister thinks that he is treating the staff justly, I do not know what his conception of justice is so far as the staff is concerned, though his conception of justice so far as the shareholders are concerned is most marked in the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Assuming that redundancy takes place within six months from the date of operation of the Bill and assuming that a man is dismissed within that period, another interesting situation develops.  It is a defence by the company against a claim for payment of compensation, if they can show that the dismissal of the man or his redundancy was brought about by the closing of railway lines.  If the railways company want to get rid of a certain person, they can say that they are closing a certain line.  That is sufficient.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand why this provision is put in&mdash;that it is a defence against a claim for compensation if a line is closed&mdash;if the Minister says there is provision in another Act for dealing with cases of that kind.  Another clause of this Bill appears rather strange from my point of view&mdash;that it is a defence by the company against a claim for compensation that there has been an alteration in the methods of working.  If there is an alteration in the methods of working and if that brings about the dismissal of an employee, that is a defence against a claim for compensation by the employee.  The company can, in the month of August, introduce new methods of working. As a result, they can dismiss staff. Having dismissed that staff, they have got rid of their liability to them because alteration of the methods of working is a defence which the company can legally plead against a claim for compensation by the dismissed staff.  Having got rid of the staff, the company might discover that the new methods of working were not satisfactory and they might get back to the original methods of working.  In the meantime, they could have unloaded any number of staff on the market without any liability to pay compensation. I should like the Minister to examine that matter so that he will see that he is opening a very dangerous door which enables the railways company <Col N="1868" /> to exploit the difficulties of their employees.  It seems to me that the latter provision is calculated to deprive staff of an opportunity of obtaining compensation when they lose their livelihood.  In consequence of an Act of this Legislature, nominally introduced in the public interest, many old railway employees may be sentenced to what can be described only as economic death.</P>
      <P>One aspect of this Bill deserves special mention.  While directors are to be compensated in an unprecedented manner&mdash;some of them pretty generously, having regard to their circumstances&mdash;and while stockholders are to be treated with equal generosity, there is no provision in the Bill which I can discover to safeguard the existing rights of the present staffs, as set out in the Railway Acts of 1924 and 1933. I shall develop that point in a moment. I want now to refer to the superannuation scheme.  In the Bill, there is a provision whereby the company is empowered to establish a superannuation scheme.  The Minister has indicated that the staff may be compelled to contribute to the scheme, even though they may be in violent conflict with the principles on which the scheme is based or in violent conflict with the method of administering the scheme.  They will have no voice in determining the manner in which the scheme is to be administered.  They may be in violent conflict with the provisions of the scheme and in complete disagreement with the management of the scheme and, yet, under the provisions of the Bill, they will be compelled to contribute to it.  The company and the Minister have to be satisfied with the scheme but the folk who have to subscribe need not be satisfied but may, in fact, be in violent disagreement with the scheme.  It is their privilege to pay; they are not supposed to be satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister what exactly the company has in mind&mdash;or, rather, what the chairman has in mind because he is the company&mdash;so far as superannuation is concerned.  In the course of a speech which he delivered in March last, the chairman indicated that he proposed <Col N="1869" /> to set up a scheme somewhat on the lines of the Dublin United Transport superannuation scheme.  Under the latter scheme, I understand the company has power to cease its contribution to the scheme on giving three months' notice.  That is the most amazing type of superannuation scheme of which I have over heard, where one party to the scheme&mdash;the party who is responsible for the management and the entire control of the scheme&mdash;can say: &ldquo;I can give you three months' notice that I am not going to pay any more.&rdquo;  I suggest to the Minister that if a company, whether it be the Dublin United Transport Company or the new company, is to be enabled to get rid of obligations of that character by a provision of that kind, that provision can very well be utilised to blackmail the staff into accepting reductions of wages or worsened conditions of employment under the threat that if they do not do that, then the company will withdraw its contribution to the superannuation scheme and that the superannuation scheme will not be as favourable as those which were operative when the company was making a contribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an insurance scheme, not a superannuation scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just using the phraseology in the Bill.  I suggest that the whole attitude of the company and of the chairman is an attitude of hostility, naked hostility, and that that attitude of the chairman of the company has manifested itself long ago towards the trades unions.  The chairman of the company does not believe in trades unions; he believes in little organisations without any strength, without financial resources, which can be chloroformed by schemes of social services and deprived of all ability to stand for the rights of their members.  That is the kind of organisation in which the chairman of the company believes and, in discussions which he has had with representatives of the staff, the chairman of the company has been particularly anxious to exclude trade union representatives from any of these discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1870" /> I suggest that that has not been accidental.  If there were any doubts on the point, these doubts were removed by an intimation from the chairman in the discussions on the superannuation schemes that he would not discuss the question of superannuation with the trades unions at all.  He wanted to have the discussion with the ordinary rank and file, knowing that, as single individuals, they had no collective strength.  They could discuss matters with the chairman but only for the purpose of providing an audience for the chairman.  The idea that they had any ability to discuss these matters with any real purpose of safeguarding their interests was ludicrous, but that, nevertheless, was the method by which the chairman proceeded when these discussions were in progress.</P>
    <P>Recent correspondence in the paper indicates quite clearly that the chairman of the company has rather strange and unusual methods of doing other things and concluding other agreements. I suggest to the Minister that that type of attitude by the chairman of the company, particularly if he is to be chairman of the new company, is one that is going to cause endless difficulty for the Minister, and endless difficulty for the shareholders, and that it will possibly lead to a dislocation of the railway industry from time to time.  The chairman, while he may be chairman of the company, must realise that the company is not run by the chairman alone, that into the running of the railway industry go the creative talents of men who have given a life time of service to the company, that they have a vital interest in the running of the company and that they are not going willingly to tolerate that dictatorial attitude of the chairman in negotiations, in which in the past they have been treated as equal partners.</P>
    <P>I notice that in this Bill Section 55 of the Act of 1924 is conspicuous by its absence.  I have searched the Schedules to see whether Section 55 is repealed, but it does not appear to be repealed.  I, therefore, take it that the legal position is that anything in the 1924 Act which is not repealed in this Bill will still exist.  The Minister <Col N="1871" /> nods his head that that is the position, that Section 55, not being repealed, still stands.  Section 56 of the 1924 Act is, however, being re-enacted in this Bill.  Why has it been necessary, in order to continue the life of Section 56 in the 1924 Act, to re-enact it in this Bill if it has not been necessary to re-enact Section 55?  There may be some legal explanation for that procedure but the position should be cleared up.  It should be put beyond all doubt that the rights which are enshrined in Section 55 of the Railways Act of 1924 are preserved for railway-men because these provisions have been vital to the maintenance of peace on the railways since 1924.</P>
    <P>I, however, have some concern because of recent developments in the railway service for the future wellbeing of the railway industry.  I think the whole country will share the desire that, so far as the railway service is concerned, there should be industrial peace there because the railways provide a vital service for the whole community.  Everybody, no matter what his political viewpoint, even no matter what his economical or social viewpoint, desires that we should have an efficient, continuous and smoothly operating railway service.  If we are to have that efficient service, a service which will meet the needs of the community and which at the same time will provide satisfactory conditions of employment for the staff engaged in the industry, we can only get it by a scheme of collective bargaining, a scheme of negotiation between representatives of the shareholders on the one hand and representatives of the staff on the other hand, an exchange of views and a clash, perhaps, of interests, but all the time with that impact of reason on reason by which you may eventually evolve a scheme of wages and conditions which will provide reasonable satisfaction for the staff.</P>
    <P>My fear is that the railway management, as at present constituted, displays a tendency to break away from the principle of collective bargaining which has been a feature of the railway industry in the past.  I suggest to the Minister that it would be well <Col N="1872" /> worth his while to intimate to the chairman whom he proposes to appoint, and to the other directors, that it is his desire and the desire of the Legislature that the principle of collective bargaining, as between the directors on the one hand and the railway trades unions on the other, should be maintained and operated to the fullest in a spirit of peace and harmony because that is the only way in which you can maintain industrial peace in the railway service.  Apart from a few unofficial and sporadic strikes, mainly of road workers who were outside the scope of the railway negotiating machinery, there has been peace in the railway industry since 1921.  With, I think, the exception of a short strike by a break-away organisation, in the main there has been, since 1921, peace on the railways so far as the unions are concerned, which is the best evidence that they have played their part in the efficient running of the railways and in the avoidance of cause of friction.  I suggest to the Minister that he should intimate to the chairman and other directors of the new company that it is his desire that that state of affairs should be continued and that every effort should be made to avoid friction in the operation of the railway service.</P>
    <P>The scenes which took place at Kingsbridge last month and the truculent and arrogant attitude adopted by officials of the company towards railway trades unions are not calculated to maintain peace in the railway services. I think those controlling this vital service for the community should be told definitely by the Minister that an attitude of truculence and insolence is something which the community is not prepared to tolerate and that the country is not prepared to risk an interruption of its railway services in order that the bad temper and dictatorial outlook of certain people may be gratified.  I think the Minister, from his experience in handling industrial disputes and his experience in the Department of Industry and Commerce, must realise that there is no better method of adjusting disputes than by means of the conference table.  There, if you can get reason on both sides, you can usually evolve a satisfactory settlement. <Col N="1873" /> In the long run, it is at the conference table that a satisfactory solution of such difficulties must be found.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister desires that the railway service should be maintained as an efficient service and that it should operate free from any danger of constant industrial friction.  But if that condition of affairs is to be arrived at, then the Minister ought to make it clear to the new directorate that the goodwill of the employees of the railway service is an essential requisite for the maintenance of an efficient transport service.  I think before this Bill passes through this House the Minister should consent to meet certain amendments which will be introduced on the Committee Stage designed to protect the interests of the railway workers and designed to protect them against possible exploitation at the hands of the directorate of the company if the Bill goes through in its present form.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support the amendment put down in the names of Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy McGilligan and to add a word of protest against the unwisdom of introducing this Bill at the present time when matters pertaining to Great Southern Railways stock are <i>sub judice.</i>  The Minister suggested that there was nothing in the Bill that related to the questions before the inquiry.  I suggest that there is the question of a pension to a particular individual and there is, also the question of the guarantee of certain stock.  The House may decide in relation to the guarantee of certain stock and the issue of new stock that is outlined in the Bill, that if the finding of the tribunal is that confidential information has been abused and that leakages have occurred, no guarantee should operate in regard to any stock that has changed hands as a result of such leakage of information.  The House may decide that we should guarantee stock held before any speculation occurred in regard to the reorganisation of transport in this country.  I suggest that we should very seriously consider <Col N="1874" /> the wisdom of refusing to guarantee any stock that has changed hands as a result of any leakage of information. Obviously we must be restrained in references to the matters that are the subject of inquiry, in view of the fact that the matter is <i>sub judice</i>, but it is utterly ridiculous for the Minister to attempt to suggest that you could not relate this Bill to the matters that are before the tribunal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware of that.  The most notable characteristic of the Minister's speech, in my opinion, was the paucity of the information given to the House.  Whatever information was given was altogether insufficient to enable Deputies to make up their minds on an important and comprehensive measure of the magnitude of this Bill.  There was no information or no forecast as to the possible type of transport that is likely to be available in the post-war period. There was no information regarding the mileage of the railways that is likely to be preserved and the branch lines that are likely to be closed. There was no information as to the amount of road development necessary for the carriage of goods or for passenger service.  There was no attempt to give any picture of the type of transport required for agricultural purposes in the post-war period and the type of services envisaged for agricultural purposes.  There was no estimate of the actual net earnings of the company, their ability to meet their liabilities under this new financial provision, the payment of dividends and the redemption of stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister gave us no information whatever on those aspects of the problem and I suggest that the House is entitled to full and frank information on these points.  I think the House is being treated in a very discourteous <Col N="1875" /> and shabby fashion.  The Minister has not even informed us as to whom he has consulted.  He has not told us what railway or transport experts have been consulted in this matter.  I am sure the Minister does not claim that he or his Department is an authority on these matters.  He has not told us who has been consulted outside the Department.  Those in his Department who have been dealing with transport for a number of years, to that extent, may claim that they can speak with some authority on some aspects of our transport problem, but the Minister failed to give us any information as to who are the people he consulted and who helped him to formulate the scheme at present before the House.  Has the chairman of the Great Southern Railways Company been consulted and, if so, what are his experiences in dealing with transport? It is true that he has some experience in the matter of bus and passenger and road transport services and another individual associated with him may claim to have some experience in a limited way in the matter of road transport services, but I fail to see who was consulted who could claim to speak with authority on rail problems.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Transport Tribunal and praised its report. While there is a good deal of very valuable factual information in that report, it is extraordinary that none of the recommendations of either the Minority Report or the Majority Report has been implemented.  There again the Minister made no attempt whatever to give us the reasons why he has completely departed from the recommendations of the Transport Tribunal in that respect, even on the financial side of it.  In the proposals put before the tribunal by the railway company it was set out that £2,000,000 approximately would meet the requirements for the reorganisation of the company.  The tribunal recommended that they should reduce that amount to £1,250,000 and, in the Majority Report, expressed the opinion that with certain restrictions on private transport, capital to the amount of £1,250,000 would be ample to provide <Col N="1876" /> the necessary extra buses and lorries and the reorganisation of rolling-stock on the railway.  The Minister has given no details whatever as to the type of development that is going to take place.  He informed the House that it is unlikely that there will be any great development until the war is over.  We all appreciate the fact that there is no possibility of securing materials, buses, lorries, rolling-stock, locomotives for the necessary reorganisation. But the House is asked to provide a very substantial sum of State money without getting any details of the exact requirements, and without any forecast as to what type of national transport is required for the post-war period.</P>
    <P>So far as the Transport Tribunal is concerned it struck me when reading the report that the tribunal was not so much concerned with the provision of an efficient and reasonably cheap type of national transport service as with the preservation of the old Great Southern Railways Company, what sort of transfusion could be provided for a company that was slowly but surely dying, and what provision could be made to infuse new life into the type of transport organisation that would be needed in the future.  A cheap and efficient transport system is a vital consideration in the development of agriculture.  We hear a great deal about the expansion of agriculture and I am sure the Minister appreciates the importance of it, but we got little or no information on that aspect of the problem.  When the Minister asked the House for authority to set up the Transport Tribunal some six years ago he made reference to certain types of transport competition that seriously affected the statutory companies, and gave the impression that it was likely certain restrictions would have to be placed on some individuals. I am glad the Minister has seen fit to change his mind in that respect.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave no information as to the present financial position of the Great Southern Railways Company or the Dublin United Transport Company, although the House is considering the question of the value of the existing stock of these companies.  He <Col N="1877" /> advised the House to bear in mind the history of transport legislation here, and the writing down of certain stocks in 1933, from £26,000,000 to £12,500,000. When people put their money into public concerns of that sort they cannot expect the State to guarantee them against loss for all time.  I do not want to be unduly critical, but I think they have been treated more than generously in fixing the valuation of the existing assets of the two companies round about £13,500,000.  No matter what effort the Minister has made to defend the wisdom of bringing the Dublin United Transport Company into the new scheme, it appears to me that it was brought in deliberately to bolster up a rotten inefficient company, and that it is on that structure the Minister proposes to build a new organisation.  On that basis he expressed optimism as to the future of the new company and the possibility of making it an organisation that will give us cheap transport. But he did not indicate how that is going to be brought about.  He did not indicate what the annual financial liability will be on the redemption of the very substantial capital sum involved, if the State is not going to be mulcted in loss.  The Bill proposes to create a national transport monopoly and a transport dictator with a board of six &ldquo;yes-men&rdquo;.  He has not given any reasons why any individual should be put into the position of a virtual dictator.  The five other members of the board may be in absolute agreement as to the wisdom of taking a certain line of action, but if the chairman is not in agreement his decision goes, and that is the end of it.  In effect that suggests that one man is wiser than the other five.  How the Minister can defend the wisdom of putting a man in an all-powerful position, when dealing with a very complex problem, I do not know.  I am sure no one can claim to know the complexities that arise from day to day and to take a decision that might involve the whole future of transport.  It appears to me to be an extraordinary way of dealing with this question to put such a power into the hands of one individual.  If the chairman is absent through sickness or for some other reason the Minister may <Col N="1878" /> nominate someone to act in his place. In fact, the chairman may be a meeting in himself, and may make decisions without any co-operation from other members of the board.  In a situation like that where the other members are merely ornaments and are unnecessary, I do not see why they should be paid salaries.  Have we, in fact, a man possessing the necessary qualifications to fill that office with success, a man with such a knowledge of national transport, road and rail problems that this Parliament can with confidence leave grave national decisions in his hands?</P>
    <P>One big objection that I have to the Bill is this: that there is a very strong analogy between this type of legislation and the type of legislation proposed in the Arterial Drainage Bill. Recent legislation seems to be shaped and moulded on the same lines.  The line is this, that, for example, when the Arterial Drainage Bill is passed into law all power and authority is to be handed over to the Board of Works. No representative of the people, no local authority, and not even this Parliament can exercise any further power or control over that legislation once it passes into the hands of the Board of Works.  We have the same thing in this Bill.  Complete authority is to be handed over to an outside body in the person of one individual who is not even being asked to put on the Table of the House an annual trading report. The position is to be that the moneys provided for that body in the first instance are not to be voted by the Oireachtas.  They will go to it from the Central Fund.  Power is being taken in Section 17 to finance this scheme in that way.  The position may arise, of course, that some further advances may have to be voted by the Dáil, because it is doubtful if the company requires extra money that it will be able to get it in the ordinary way by the flotation of a loan.  It is provided in sub-section (5) of Section 17 that the company will repay within a period of 12 months any advances made to it.  If it is not in a position to make that repayment, then the money is to be provided by a Vote of the Dáil. Will the Minister tell us why the <Col N="1879" /> money which is being provided for the company in the first instance is not being provided by a Vote of the Dáil?  While that is not done, the Minister can come along 12 months afterwards, when certain commitments have been entered into, and ask the Dáil to vote certain sums of money already advanced out of the Central Fund.  Surely that is not a democratic way of providing money for this concern. I suggest that we should not give authority to any Minister to make, in the first instance, payments out of the Central Fund, and that if later these advances cannot be made good by the flotation of a loan or in some other way he can, by getting a Vote of the House, make good the repayments.  That shows clearly that this Parliament will have no power whatever over this concern once this Bill is passed into law.  In the case of the Arterial Drainage Bill, all power is to be handed over to the Board of Works, while in the case of this Bill all power and authority are to be handed over to an outside dictator, despite the fact that substantial sums of money are being provided by the State to finance the scheme.  I take very strong exception to that proposal in the Bill.  The Minister has not made any effort whatever to defend this new method of financing outside business.</P>
    <P>Provision is being made for the redemption of stock between 1955 and 1966.  I wonder what is the necessity for redeeming the stock within such a short period?  Is not the obligation to do so going to impose a heavy financial strain on the company?  It seems to me to be an unreasonable provision. The amount of money that will be required to meet the capital outlay involved in the reorganisation of the company to meet interest charges and for the redemption of capital, is going to be a very serious matter.  The Minister has given us no estimate of the annual sum that will be required to meet all these charges.</P>
    <P>On the question of the closing down of branch lines, whenever and wherever the board decide that it is uneconomic to work a branch line, the Minister is taking power to make the <Col N="1880" /> decision of the board effective.  There is no provision for the holding of any type of inquiry before the closing down takes place.  No group of individuals is to be allowed to put a case forward as to why the line should remain in operation.  Surely that is not reasonable. Power is also being taken for the abolition of the Railway Tribunal. Some of its powers and functions are to be transferred to the High Court; but its other powers, particularly those dealing with the fixation of maximum freight charges, are, according to the proposals here, to be vested in the Minister.</P>
    <P>I do not say that the Railway Tribunal has functioned in the best interests of the railway company or the country as a whole, but I agree that the idea behind the setting up of it was absolutely sound.  Before that tribunal the carrying company had the opportunity of making its case for the charges it proposed to levy for the carrying of particular types of goods.  The particular sections in the community that had to bear those charges had an equal opportunity of making their case to the tribunal.  The departure from that system proposed in this Bill has some very important aspects, so far as the carriage of agricultural produce is concerned.  We know that in many countries a departure has been made from the orthodox method of charging on a tonnage basis.  That has been done in the interests of agriculture. It would be interesting to compare those charges with the charges in operation here, and of how they have affected the free flow of agricultural produce.  Under a proper agricultural policy, it ought to be our aim to ensure that there is a free flow of agricultural goods from all parts of the country, and that the remoter parts of the country are not unduly handicapped by the operation of a transport system of freight charges that are detrimental to their interests. I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he will make an order compelling the creameries to supply their butter to grocers in the future in units of 6 ozs.

      <P>Following the introduction of the 6 oz. butter ration, creameries were requested by my Department to facilitate traders, where possible, by making up the roll butter in 12 oz. or 18 oz. units, or alternatively, to supply the butter in bulk quantities.  It may not be practicable for some creameries to make up the <Col N="1888" /> rolls in these units, but traders can always take their supplies in bulk lots. I do not propose to make the Order suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether he is aware of the fact that turf is being sold in Kildare town at £3 10s. 0d. per ton, and whether he proposes to take any action to ensure that such exorbitant prices will be substantially reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Supplies of turf are available in the town of Kildare at substantially lower prices than that quoted by the Deputy, and consumers who are paying £3 10s. 0d. per ton have, therefore, the remedy in their own hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister take action if any trader in the town asks the sum of £3 10s. 0d. per ton for turf?  Is it not obvious that that is a high price?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand there is a licensed merchant in the town of Kildare who is selling turf at £3 per ton, and an examination of his costings would appear to suggest that he could not sell it at any lower price.  The bulk of the supply comes into the town and is sold by hucksters, or the Kildare equivalents of the Dublin bellmen, and it is true that they sometimes charge for small lots prices which, reckoned per ton, are out of all relation to the proper price of turf.  It is difficult to prevent people buying turf in small <Col N="1889" /> quantities at inflated prices.  They do not have to do it; they can procure a supply at lower prices, but the mere fact that they can does not always mean that they will.  I think the Deputy is aware of the difficulty of supervising all these sales.  I know that arrangements which have been made will enable residents of the town to produce their own turf this year.  This will ensure that a very high proportion of the townspeople will be independent of purchases.  They are making arrangements to produce their own turf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give consideration to the fixing of a ceiling price for turf in these areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be almost impossible to do that, because the turf is produced at different bogs which are at different distances from the town, and there are different circumstances. It would be impossible to fix a price for all the bogs unless one fixed a maximum price for the bog farthest away.  Obviously that would not be reasonable.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he has any information to give in reference to the submission made to him by letter concerning the tying up of the fleet of Government barges on the Grand Canal system; also the conditions, wages, rentage of barges, tolls, etc., in connection with the working of these barges, and if he will state who is the manager of the barge fleet.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's recent letter in this matter has already been answered.</P>
      <P>Conditions of work and wages of persons who are employed in the operation of State-owned barges are matters for the individual hirers of the barges.  Particulars of the rental of barges will be found in the Official Reports, Vol. 93, No. 3, column 1012. The maximum tolls chargeable are established by Emergency Powers (Increase of Maximum Charges of Grand Canal Company) Order, 1943, S.R. and O. 1943, No. 264.  The Grand Canal Company acts as agent for the purpose of renting out State-owned barges.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Another interesting point is that the people dealing with the Grand Canal are agents for the Government barges.  These barges are charged at £1 5s. 0d. a week, although the capital cost of each of them was about £1,000.  Nineteen of them are <Col N="1891" /> lying idle because it is not worth while to work them.  The men get £4 10s. 0d. for working, and the company gets £6 5s. 0d.

The Unemployment Insurance Acts of 1941 and 1943 enable service in the Defence Forces, employment on ships of which the registration has been changed from this country subsequent to the 2nd September, 1939, and absence for employment outside <Col N="1892" /> this country during the emergency period to be disregarded for the purposes of this provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The existing arrangements are working satisfactorily, and do not appear to call for any alteration. They are as follows: Where private producers are working under a definite contract to sell to the county council a payment on account representing 80 per cent. of the value of the work done is made (if required) when the turf is cut and spread.  When the turf is saved and ricked on the roadside ready for removal, a further payment on account can be made, if required to bring the total payment up to 80 per cent. of the value of the turf.  Final payment is made when the turf is measured and taken over by the county council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been given to understand that private producers who make application for an instalment when they have turf cut and spread will not be granted it by the county manager.  That means that they have to go for a long period, from the cutting to the ricking of the turf on the roadside, before they can get any assistance in the form of income which is due to them.  It would be of considerable assistance if the county manager could see his way to give them some instalment when the turf is cut, spread and footed.  It would also be an encouragement.</P>

      <P>Cork County is one of the counties where the rate paid to road workers was higher than the agricultural rate, and as a continuance of that position would not be justified in existing conditions, in view of the national importance of agriculture, I could not approve of a further increase of 5/- a week to road workers.  To do so would only encourage the seeking of employment on road work to the disadvantage of agricultural work. Accordingly, the Cork County Council was notified that an additional temporary emergency bonus not exceeding 2/- a week was being approved for road workers.  In the case of carters, the bonus rate was fixed so as to bring their pay to 12/6 per day, the maximum rate prevailing in other rural areas.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply to a similar question on the 22nd February last.  Since then no complaints from local residents were received in my Department.  A report was received from the City Manager on the 29th March, in which it was stated that the matter had been considered in detail at a conference between the representatives of the paper mills and representatives of the Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council.  One of the mills installed machinery to minimise the amount of fibre in the effluent reaching the Camac River, but it is understood the other mill concerned has practically found it impossible to obtain the necessary machinery for the purpose.  I understand that it was agreed at the conference that if the mill owners cleaned the river from Clondalkin to Inchicore, the corporation would arrange for its cleaning below Inchicore.  It has been further ascertained from the corporation that the mill owners had portion of the river from Clondalkin to Drimnagh cleaned at the end of March last, and that the engineers of the corporation and the county council had inspected the work on the 4th ultimo, and were satisfied that it had been completed properly. It has also been ascertained that the work of the cleaning of the river from Drimnagh to Inchicore, including the mill-race, was commenced on the 24th ultimo.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Senior)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he can state the number of sucker calves which have been slaughtered and dressed in the southern counties for the British market during the month of March, 1944, and further, whether it is not more expedient to substitute the killing of old dried-up cows for such calves in order to preserve future herds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the practice to supply particulars of exports subsequent to August, 1939.  I may say, however, that calves which are used for the dressed meat trade are mainly those which are not suitable for retention in herds and are sold for immediate slaughter.  The export of old cows in the form of dressed meat is not economic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not correct that many of these sucker calves are of quite good stock and yet it seems to be a deliberate policy to get rid of them when dried-up cows and scrub cattle could easily be substituted?  Surely it should be the policy to get rid of the scrub cattle and the dried-up cows in this way and keep the sucker calves as long as there is food for them?  The present policy is just as bad as when the Minister went in for killing calves years ago and selling their hides.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I say it, and therefore the Deputy should take notice.  So <Col N="1904" /> far as the export of calves which are used for the dressed meat trade is concerned, no farmer in the south will sell a calf that is suitable for retention in the herd.  Calves are sold only because they are not suitable for that purpose. The canning of dried-up cows and scrub cattle is a different matter altogether. It is a question of closing down for a period in order that the firms might be in a position to work full time for the rest of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>One Dublin firm closed down, 170 skilled men were put out on the streets, and they are getting unemployment money.  At least two or three factories were closed in Dublin, factories that might be usefully engaged in canning this stuff.  These cattle are going at the rate of nine to the 100, not fit for sale.  The calves I speak about are marketable calves that are sold to provide veal for the English people.  Skilled men cannot get work in Dublin.  All this is to save the Roscrea factory&mdash;that is the trouble.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I was pointing out, as regards the functions of the Railway Tribunal, that it is proposed to hand some of them over to the High Court, while some of them will be exercised by the Minister.  It is true that the Minister has provided a transport advisory <Col N="1906" /> committee which will investigate certain matters.  But that committee has no power to initiate any inquiry except it is so directed by the Minister.  Neither has any individual or group of individuals power to bring any matter before the advisory committee except the Minister feels it is desirable.  It might so happen that in certain cases the Minister, for political or other reasons, might think it unwise to refer a particular matter to the advisory committee.  I think that, in comparison with the old method, whereby the carrying company, an individual or group of individuals, could bring any matter related to the fixing of freight charges for any particular commodity before the Railway Tribunal and make a case for it, the proposed method of handling such a matter is not by any means an improvement.  I am not saying that there was not some room for improvement in the old method, that the best results were got from the efforts of the Railway Tribunal.  But surely their terms of reference could have been altered to some extent so as to permit of the fixation of maximum charges that would be in the best interests of the country as a whole, not merely in the best interests of the carrying company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In examining the maximum charges fixed by the Railway Tribunal in relation to a variety of goods, one thing that has struck me as rather peculiar is that the rate of charges on agricultural commodities operates to a far greater extent against the free flow of these commodities than in the case of industrial goods.  For instance, if you take 5 per cent. of the value of particular goods to be a fair charge for the transportation of such goods, that not more than 5 per cent. should be used for the purpose of transporting any particular commodity, we find that, in the case of woollen and worsted yarn, 5 per cent. of the value will permit the transportation of that commodity over a distance of 700 odd miles; in the case of electrical machinery, 379 miles; in the case of wool, 372 miles; in the case of books, 366 miles; in the case of butter, 373 miles.  But, in the case of raw material <Col N="1907" /> for the farm, such as rock phosphate for instance, 5 per cent. of the value of the commodity will not permit it to travel by rail at all.  It will permit it to travel by road two miles at the rate of 2/3 per two miles.  In the case of household coal, it can only travel two miles by road; it cannot travel by railway at all, on the 5 per cent. basis. In the case of potatoes, it will not allow them to travel by rail at all, but will allow them to travel seven miles by road.  In the case of sulphate of ammonia, it will not permit it to travel by rail at all and only 14 miles by road.  In the case of wheat, it will permit it to travel 17 miles by rail.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question of the fixation of charges.  Machinery is being set up for the fixation of charges under the Bill.  This is not a question of administration at all.  It is a question of the machinery provided for in the Bill for the fixing of freight charges.  The Minister is taking special power to review these.  But, judging by his attitude, I am not convinced that he is the right man.  I do not think that it should be left to any Minister to make decisions in these matters.  In the case of potatoes, I want to point out that it takes 20 per cent. of their value to transport potatoes from Athlone to Dublin.  On that basis, one can understand why Dublin was short of potatoes last year. Surely in an agricultural country like ours that aspect of the problem must be examined and must be given consideration. The Minister realises that where marketing boards have <Col N="1908" /> been set up, for instance, in Northern Ireland, a pig will be carried over one mile for 8d. and the same charge operates if the pig is to be transported 50 miles.  That is what I want to get the Minister to appreciate&mdash;that you cannot apply the same scheme to agricultural production as to industrial production.  If you do, if it is merely on a ton-mile basis you fix the charge, then it will be detrimental to the remote districts or the more backward districts.  If the Minister concerns himself with an examination of the area of supply so far as the City of Dublin is concerned, he will appreciate that, as compared with Cork, Waterford, Limerick or other centres, it is very much wider in extent and in scope than the area of supply of the requirements of these other centres.</P>
      <P>For the purpose of export of certain commodities also, whatever sort of organisation is set up, we ought to ensure that the freight charges that will be fixed will operate, not primarily in the interests of the carrying company, but in the interests of the agricultural industry and of the country as a whole.  If we are to set up machinery to deal with the fixation of maximum charges in the post-war period we certainly ought to ensure that the machinery so set up will concern itself with that aspect of the problem. I am suggesting that, so far as the initiation of any inquiry by the advisory committee is concerned, or so far as the giving of any opportunity to individuals or group of individuals to get an inquiry initiated is concerned, it will be far more difficult to have that done under this type of machinery than under the Railway Tribunal as operated at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to the question of redundancy of workers.  I think it is a fact that the redundancy must arise within a six-months' period and that any workers discharged outside the six months will not be entitled to any compensation.  Section 55 of the 1924 Act has been referred to.  So far as I recollect, the period in respect of redundancy provided for under that Act was seven years; any individual who was found to be redundant under the amalgamation which took place as <Col N="1909" /> a result of the 1924 Act was entitled to compensation under that section if the redundancy arose within a period of seven years.  Obviously, one would suspect that the period of six months may possibly be taken advantage of If employees are not discharged within the six months' period, their services may deliberately be retained for the purpose of evading the provisions for compensation under the section.  I suggest that the Minister should reconsider the period of time provided for redundancy.  I think it is an unreasonably short period.</P>
    <P>I think that this is a very inopportune time to contemplate reorganisation. Even if it were necessary to subsidise the railway company from this until the end of the war when we may have a better idea of how things will shape themselves, it might be very desirable to see what type of transport is likely to be available and what our requirements are likely to be in the post-war period rather than by guessing at what they will be.  The Minister said that we are dealing with something that we cannot foresee with any exactitude, and that is true.  We are actually planning for transport requirements without having any realistic idea of what they are likely to be.</P>
    <P>To my mind, the unification of transport makes it more vulnerable from many aspects and therein lies a danger.  It may make it more vulnerable from the labour point of view, in that if the country is dependent on one monopoly organisation in respect of transport, it is quite on the cards that we might have a strike which would paralyse the whole country.</P>
    <P>In that regard, I am glad the Minister has seen fit to allow lorries owned by private individuals for carrying their own goods to continue in operation. Certain provisions in the Bill in this connection are rather unorthodox, but I suppose the 1933 Act is being abused in so many ways that it is scarcely fair to blame the Minister for having recourse to the method he has adopted, by which a man is assumed to be guilty until he proves himself innocent of carrying <Col N="1910" /> goods other than his own.  So far as the ownership of a lorry by two or more individuals is concerned, it seems an extraordinary provision that a lorry cannot be operated except for the carriage of goods owned by both people.  That is almost impossible and may inflict very definite hardship.  I can understand what the Minister is getting at&mdash;he wants to stop certain abuses&mdash;but he will hurt certain individuals carrying on legitimate business. Suppose there are two small traders, or even two small farmers, who decide to operate a lorry for the carriage of their own goods.  It is not economic for each to own a vehicle as there is not sufficient work, but there is sufficient work if they combine.  The Minister's provision will definitely operate against that procedure because that lorry would be used for the carriage of each man's goods separately. It might carry the Minister's goods to-day and my goods to-morrow. I wonder how will the provisions affect co-operative societies?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>In the case of licensed hauliers, it appears that, for the moment anyhow, they are to be left untouched and the Minister has taken power to extend the licences in cases where it is desirable to extend these licences under the 1933 Act to certain other goods and commodities.  It appears that it is the intention to allow them to continue to operate their lorries, but there is no assurance that they will be allowed to do so for all time.  Is the provision in regard to acquisition under the 1933 Act not still in operation?  There is a definite limitation in that there is no possibility of additional private individuals coming in to sell transport.  I think the preservation of the existing lorries would be very healthy because a certain amount of healthy competition is absolutely essential to ensure that the monopoly transport company will work efficiently and at a fair price. We have not got sufficient information from the Minister.  I have already referred to that, and I want to say that my attitude to the Bill, so far as my <Col N="1911" /> interpretation of its various provisions is concerned, is that I am opposed to it and intend to vote against it, unless the Minister is prepared to give us more definite and detailed information.</P>

      <P>I join with the other speakers who have suggested that, because of the magnitude of the problem with which the Bill deals, the whole matter should be approached with care and caution and that any suggestion of the Bill being rushed through should be avoided.  I think there will be agreement that, no matter what is in the Bill and what it is proposed to do under its clauses, the present position of transport cannot be altered by the operative date, which is given as July 1st.  If that be so, I suggest that there is no apparent reason why the measure should be taken even on Second Reading to-day, but whatever may be said so far as the Second Reading is concerned, I suggest that, having regard to all the interests involved, at least a reasonable interval should be allowed to elapse between the Second Reading and Committee Stage and that that interval should not be less than four weeks, or three weeks as an absolute minimum, so that interested parties may have an opportunity of studying a Bill which runs into 117 sections and 10 schedules. I feel certain that that point of view will be put forward with some force by later speakers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the usual practice on occasions of this character to taunt members of the Opposition that they can approach matters of this kind in a rather lighthearted fashion because they have not got responsibility, and I was rather glad that the Minister, in his speech this morning, complimented, inferentially, if not directly, the members of the Labour Party for the trouble they took in connection with their examination of this whole transport question. It is perfectly true that, for some months past, members on these benches have examined this problem and that, as the Minister indicated, a copy of their findings was sent to him.  The only line of divergence <Col N="1912" /> which I could find in his speech from our proposals, which are, of course, proposals for a nationally-owned and controlled concern, was that he did not now agree with nationalisation.  He gave as his reasons the dangers, as he sees them, in relation to subvention and other matters, and particularly the question of political pressure arising out of policy or staff.</P>
    <P>We deeply deplore the attitude of the Minister in that respect.  We had reason to believe that it was his personal policy&mdash;he expounded it on more than one occasion&mdash;and it was certainly the policy of his Party.  Railwaymen generally believed&mdash;and I can speak as a railway man myself&mdash;that, given the opportunity at some time or another, the Minister particularly would implement such a policy.  He has given as one of his reasons for not adopting that policy the question of the subvention of traffic, but, broadly speaking, as has been indicated already, there is no very great difference so far as the Bill is concerned in that respect, because certain people will receive subventions of one kind or another under it.  So far as political pressure may arise, we have the example of the Post Office.  The Post Office is a national concern since the setting up of the State, and if I am to infer from his remarks that the employees of a nationally-owned transport concern would use their position, perhaps effectually, to bring about a set of conditions which would operate in their favour, might I point to the position of the Post Office employees, who are generally regarded as the lowest paid grade of State servants, so that apparently the political influence which they have been able to wield for the past 21 or 22 years is rather negligible.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have noticed from our proposals that, so far as nationalisation is concerned, the viewpoint put forward from these benches was that the concern would be managed as a utility corporation and that we proposed to proceed along these lines, on the basis of compensation which would not violently infringe the rights of anybody concerned.  We demonstrated in that memorandum that, on the basis of our compensation, we could, as a matter of fact, have made a better <Col N="1913" /> bargain for the new concern, a nationally-owned concern, which would have relieved it of not less than £155,000 paid in interest yearly.  That point of view, however, does not commend itself to the Minister and we shall have to turn to the Bill itself.</P>
    <P>The Bill is remarkable, in my opinion, both for what it contains and for what it omits.  There is abundant evidence that great care is being taken of certain interests, particularly the interests of the directorate and the stockholders, but so far as the staff are concerned the same solicitude does not seem to have prevailed in the drafting of the Bill.  Deputy Norton has already referred to the question of compensation so far as the directors are concerned.  The Bill provides that certain officers of the company, continuing in office after the 31st December of this year, may still be retained and may get the benefit of compensation for two and a half years, as against the position occupied by the ordinary employee of the company. After all, it cannot be assumed that these officers are in a different category from the ordinary employees of the company.  Surely, the employees of the company are very directly concerned, since, without their labour, the company could not be operated at all. It would appear, however, that so far as protection for these employees is concerned, after 31st December of this year no protection can be afforded to them, while it can be given to certain other officers of the company.  Apart from that, however, the position is infinitely worse so far as certain employees are concerned, whose services, after that period, will be declared to be redundant.  Under the Bill such employees are deemed not to have qualified for compensation if they come into certain categories, such as the closing down of branch lines or altered methods of working.  Quite frankly, so far as altered methods of working are concerned, any change in working conditions might be used to show that the employee concerned might have no rights whatever.</P>
    <P>In plain language, so far as this Bill is concerned, there is no protection for <Col N="1914" /> the ordinary employees whatsoever.  It is quite obvious that what is meant in this Bill is that the period of redundancy could not possibly operate after a period of six months, and that, therefore, there can be no question of compensation for such employees.  Accordingly, it is my belief that so far as that arbitrary line is concerned, the Minister will have to move away from it. The most vital matter that I am concerned with, if I might be permitted to represent their viewpoint here, is the rights of the employees, as defined under previous Railways Acts.  I am particularly referring to Section 55 of the Railways Act of 1934, which was afterwards incorporated in a later Act. That section had reference to the regulation of rates of wages and conditions of service for the employees.  It laid down that rates of pay, hours of duty and other conditions of service of railway employees should be regulated in accordance with agreements made, or from time to time to be made, between the trade unions representative of such employees of the one part and the railway companies and other persons by whom they are respectively employed of the other part.  Reference has already been made to the fact that that particular section is not included in the present Bill, whereas Section 56 of the Act to which I am referring, presumably, is being re-enacted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might be permitted to explain that.  Section 55 of that Act still applies and remains in force so far as all railway undertakings are concerned.  Section 56 applies to the Great Southern Railways Company alone, and is being re-enacted here.  Section 55 is still in force and will apply to this company as to all the other companies.</P>

      <P>It is not necessary to do so.  It applies to every railway company operating here.  The only difference between Section 55 and Section 56 is that Section 55 applied to every railway company, while Section 56 applied <Col N="1915" /> only to the Great Southern Railways Company, and it is now necessary to ensure that the same conditions will apply to the new company.</P>

      <P>Well, I am glad to hear that statement from the Minister, but I am sure he realises that the position will have to be made abundantly clear on a later stage of the Bill. Now, I come to the question of superannuation. I pointed out to the Minister already, that so far as that question is concerned there is a big point affecting the clerical staff.  Up to a few years ago, the clerical staffs of the railway companies had a savings fund, with headquarters in London.  It was operated through the Railway Clearing House, but it did not prove to be too satisfactory so far as the rates of pensions of retiring employees were concerned.  Four or five years ago, however, a number of English railway companies came to an arrangement with certain of the Irish railway companies, which proved to be more satisfactory.  Under that arrangement, so far as the staffs themselves were concerned, it was not necessary to have the assent of the clerk concerned as to the payment, on his retirement, of 12 months' salary and the benefits accruing, <i>pro rata.</i>  All the railway companies in Ireland gave their consent to the reorganisation of that fund, with the exception of the Great Southern Railways Company.  The staffs of the other companies are benefiting very considerably from that reorganisation. They have the advantage of 12 months' salary on retirement, and also the advantage of better benefits.  What happens now, however, is that you have a clerical worker employed by the Great Northern Railway Company in the Railway Clearing House down the road here enjoying those benefits while a clerk in a similar position stationed at Kingsbridge, at Cork, or anywhere else is deprived of these benefits.  The result of that is that there is a good deal of bitterness.  I feel quite sure that the Minister does not know to what extent these benefits have been withheld from employees of the Great Southern Railways Company, or for <Col N="1916" /> what period of time they have been withheld.  I am quite sure that he is not aware that the clerical employees are not deriving the result of the benefits of the reorganisation to which I have referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of a rather complicated scheme there is what is known as a system of supplementary benefits which they will be paying in the normal course.  The present arrangements are allowed to stand in the Bill but we do hope that as a result of what may take place in committee it will be possible for the Minister to indicate to us that the withheld assent will be given.  The only reason given for the withholding of this assent is that the fund happens to be domiciled in London.  But the fund has been well managed and has the advantage of having a general committee.  Members of the staff of the Great Southern Railways here are sitting on that committee with the members of the manager's committee and take the opportunity of improving it in every possible way but as I say they are deprived of the benefits which have accrued to their colleagues even in this City of Dublin, in Belfast and elsewhere by the withholding of this assent, that is so far as the superannuation of the clerical staff is concerned.  There is, of course, in this Bill provision for another superannuation fund to which Deputy Norton referred.  That is the one by which members of the staff will be called upon to subscribe to a fund to the satisfaction of the chairman and the Minister.  Presumably it is understood that this fund will be on the lines of what has been described as the Dublin Transport Company Fund. I want to tell the Minister quite frankly that the lines upon which that fund of the Dublin Transport Company is being run would not appeal in any way whatsoever to railwaymen. The fund of the Dublin Transport Company is merely insurance to which I understand a subscription is made by the company which can be withdrawn on three months' notice. If a man were contributing for 30 or 40 years and if at that stage the company decided to withdraw from the <Col N="1917" /> fund then the fund would collapse so far as that man was concerned.  The railwaymen's idea of a superannuation fund involves a matter of joint control and I urge upon the Minister that view strongly because they will insist that it be expressed here to-day so far as we can do so.  The words which the Minister employs in the Bill may be deemed to be entirely unsatisfactory. Naturally I will have to refer here to the question of the Dublin transport position to which I noticed the Minister devoted quite a good deal of attention this morning.  So far as the Labour Party is concerned even if we were dealing with a national form of transport we consider that Dublin has a special position because it has one-sixth of the population of the State and even in a nationally controlled scheme there would be room for a municipal scheme here.  The Minister himself subscribes to that and I believe the reasons he gave for doing so still hold.  There are special features attached to Dublin transport particularly in regard to facilities for town planning, housing and other things which would make it most imperative to have a special form of transport.  The Minister will say: &ldquo;Well why not in Cork, Waterford or Limerick?&rdquo; but Dublin happens to be the only one of them that has its own form of transport at the present time.  Cork, Waterford and Limerick are under the Great Southern Railways so that the position is not at all comparable from that point of view.  In that respect attention has been drawn to the fact that under an Act option was given to the Dublin Corporation to purchase the concern after 40 years.  That position was waived or slowed up in 1927, I think, on account of the Lucan line and I think there was a further extension of the period.  In the final analysis it was open to the corporation to purchase in the year 1966.  I gather from the Minister that he does not dispute that right in so far as the tramways are concerned.  In that respect I say that some of us who are members of the municipal council will have to consult with our law agents, in view of his statement, that is, that the right only refers to the tramways <Col N="1918" /> and not to substitute lines.  That is a moot point and will have to be looked into.  Another aspect of the matter is that there is the question of the way-leaves which amount in value to us to £15,000.  There is the question of rates which was a very serious question up to now, but the rates have been a diminishing factor since the tracks have been taken up in part.  It was understood so far as the wayleaves were concerned that that was part of the price which the corporation of that period was paying for the withdrawal of its opposition to the monopoly which the tramways company then desired and that the wayleaves would be paid in perpetuity.  That is the opinion of our law agent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>These are the principal points to which I want to refer in this Bill.  While more properly it can be dealt with in Committee, having regard to the number of amendments that will be put down in the length of time that will be necessary to examine the Bill in order to secure amendments of the type that we would like, I am going to urge the Minister to ensure that there will be an adequate interval, an interval of not less than three weeks before the Committee Stage is taken.</P>

      <P>Everybody in the <Col N="1919" /> House and in the country admits that we must have railways which must be maintained if the agricultural community is to carry on successfully. From that point of view I wish to give full credit to the Government for their efforts in trying to keep the railways going and to give reasonably good employment which I hope will be better and more plentiful than it is at present. There is a point that I wish to bring forward regarding the Dublin United Transport Company.  The Lord Mayor has referred to our law agent's advice. Our law agent has advised us that the Great Southern Railways and the Dublin Transport or Tramways Company as it formerly was, had existing contracts of various kinds, statutory and otherwise, with the corporation, and we have not been able to discover in the Bill any provision for the transfer to the new company of some of the obligations of the dissolved companies secured by the Dublin United Tramways Act of 1881.  He points out to us that you are leaving us with all the liabilities and taking from us the assets.  Dublin Corporation asked us Dublin members to put forward these views as to how it will affect Dublin City.  We all express the hope, as I have already stated, that the maintenance of the railways will be continued, but Dublin must not be asked to nurse the baby to too great an extent, and if there is to be any heavy expenditure in order to keep the Transport Company going, Dublin ratepayers must not be called upon to bear more than their fair share of the burden.  You are taking the wayleaves from us. People notice the difference in the concrete roadways and the area where the tram passes, which is in stone sets. All these stone sets have to be maintained by this company.  You withdraw the wayleaves and leave the corporation in the position, it is my opinion, that we may have to continue to build strong, solid concrete roadways in order to carry heavy bus traffic, and the result may be that when new routes are opened, say, at our new corporation schemes in Crumlin, Kimmage or West Cabra, which are long distances away, Dublin Corporation may have to put down new solid <Col N="1920" /> roads at considerable expense to carry the traffic, while the profits received from the high fares charged for short distances will be diverted to purposes other than the building of roadways.  The Dublin public may find themselves under a serious impost to make these roadways, and I ask the Minister to see that Dublin will get fair play and that we will be in no worse position&mdash;I will not ask for more &mdash;in the future than we are in to-day. In order that the new company may show profit and help other portions of the system that may not be paying their way, there should be no increase in the fares to our people in the city and there should be no curtailment of the distances travelled for the fares charged.  We can see if things do not go well on the railways there will always be the inclination to look to Dublin and to try to draw from the Dublin Transport Company moneys that should be put into improvement or better value for the travelling public in the City of Dublin.  For instance, we have all agitated in this House in days gone by for ½d. fares or for cheap fares for workers travelling long distances and for ½d. fares for schoolchildren.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All these things were talked about in the past.  In my opinion this is the opportunity to revive them in the hope that the Minister will keep in mind that if he can get away with leaving things as they are, he will be doing well and will give us some guarantee that there will be no further heavy impost put on our people but that they will get the same value as they are getting to-day.  It may be that with the Minister's advice, assistance and ability we may get better value in the future.  Having drawn attention to the fact that there is nothing in the Bill to that effect, I would ask the Minister to introduce some clause that will see that the corporation contracts with these people will be carried out. For instance, the Increase of Charges Act, 1918, is deleted from the Bill, that is, the charges for the electricity and water.  Not many years ago when the Tramways Bill was passing through the House, when the corporation found itself with increased expenditure <Col N="1921" /> in order to provide water for Dún Laoghaire and, I think, Blackrock, the charges were increased and the Bill, when passing through the House, was amended so as to allow these increased charges to get through. It is quite possible that the Minister will say that these things are already provided for in some other portion of the Bill that we ordinary people have not seen.  If they are not provided for I am sure the Minister will see that they are reinstated.  Now, I spoke about the fares and the distances to be travelled, and I hoped the fares will be no higher and the distances no shorter, that there will be accommodation for passengers, and that proper shelters for passengers using the services will be provided by the transport company. Go down to Aston's Quay, on a stormy, wet day and see the people waiting for all these long-distance buses.  Aston's Quay has taken the place of a big railway station, but there is no toilet accommodation and no shelters for the people.  You will see people gathered from O'Connell Bridge to the Metal Bridge waiting for long-distance buses in all kinds of weather.  There is insufficient shelter and rest-places, insufficient toilet accommodation, and people have to leave their queues to look after their children and may not be able to get back into the proper places.  The Minister referred in his statement&mdash;I was not quick enough to catch his exact words&mdash;to an advisory committee, and he mentioned the type of people who would be on that committee. The various vested interests are to be represented on that committee, but the Minister did not say a word about the user.  People like the Lord Mayor, the City Manager of Dublin, the law agent or the President of the Chamber of Commerce are never put on any committee the Government have power to nominate. I ask the Minister to see that the general public, the users of the railways and buses, will get representation on these committees, as I believe is done in the case of the London Transport Board.  At least, that has been conveyed to me.  I have no personal knowledge of the composition of <Col N="1922" /> the London Transport Board, but I am informed that the public are represented on it and that they give good advice and valuable help to the people in charge of transport there.  I earnestly hope that users will be permitted representation on this board, so that the claims of Dublin may be put forward.</P>
    <P>The question of way-leaves has been referred to by the Lord Mayor.  When various Bills were going through, it was understood that these way-leaves were granted in perpetuity.  Now an arbitrator is to be appointed.  This arbitrator will not be one agreed to by the parties concerned.  The municipality, which has the ratepayers' interests at heart and which may have to suffer heavy losses by the withdrawal of way-leaves and by the necessity for building and maintaining new roads, will have to submit its claim to an arbitrator to whose appointment it will have nothing to say.  He may be bus-minded and railway-minded and&mdash;I shall not say indifferent to the corporation's claims &mdash;not sufficiently interested in those claims as against the desire to see the transport of the country put on a proper basis.  I hope that an arbitrator who will have the goodwill of all parties concerned will be appointed.</P>
    <P>There are a few other matters to which I wish to refer.  I shall not detain the House long because I have never availed of the 20-minute period allowed.  My usual time is 10 minutes. Reference has been made to recognised pension schemes but the Minister has not said a word about a rule by the railway company about the giving of a small allowance during the pleasure of the board in cases where men have to go out after long service.  Quite recently, a couple of men have been retired at 62 years of age and 63 years of age from the Great Southern Railways. They thought that they would go on to 65 years.  These men had to go out without any compensation for their unexpired time.  They were physically fit and were doing their work splendidly, as the railway company said.  But they were found redundant and they got an allowance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1923" /> I do not say that it was a very good allowance but they do not complain of it.  The allowance is given during the pleasure of the board.  I ask the Minister to see that no injustice will be done to these men under the provision regarding the pension scheme.  I know the Minister's sympathy is with these men but some oversight might occur by which they would not come under the Bill.  When the Bill became an Act, the Minister and the board might be faced with the difficulty that these men were not in any recognised or legal pension scheme.  They are merely getting an allowance subject to the pleasure of the board.  They should be properly protected by the law, so far as it is possible to do so.</P>
    <P>Let me draw attention to another point&mdash;a small point.  Two years ago, a railway engine driver came before the Old Age Pensions Committee of which I am a member.  He had 16/- a week.  Workers of that type go out on that small pension after 35 or 40 years' service.  One week before he reaches 70 years of age, the person concerned gets a notice stating: &ldquo;As you will be 70 years on such a date, your pension of 16/- will be reduced by 10/-, because you will be entitled to the old age pension.&rdquo;  That applied in the case of an Old I.R.A. man, named Tom Gaffney, or Tom Gillespie, I am not sure which.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>It applied in more than one case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely want to give an instance.  I know the Minister has his heart in the right place and that now is the time to remind him of these small things so that they will not be overlooked.  Tom Gaffney gave service to the I.R.A. as a railway driver.  What he did or what he carried I do not know.  Nine or 10 years afterwards, he went out of the railway service about 66 years of age and he got a pension of 16/-.  At 70 years of age he was told to apply for an old age pension.  Then the railway company cut off 10/- from his allowance.  The I.R.A. tribunal decided that they would give Tom 9/- a week. The moment he gets the 9/-, off comes his old age pension, so that Tom, <Col N="1924" /> having served about 40 years with the railway company and having served in the I.R.A., is left with 16/-.  That seems to be looked upon as the standard for old people.  To give the Government and their friends their due, after a new Bill was introduced, Tom's pension of 9/- was increased to a reasonable sum.  I hope these things will not occur with the new board.  In some cases, railway workers apply for the old age pension.  The railway company stop 10/- from their pension from the company.  Then comes along an old age pension investigator who discovers that a son or daughter is allowing the pensioner 7/- or 8/- a week.  As a result, he may get nothing.  These are small matters which come before local authorities every day in the week.</P>
      <P>I shall not delay the House further except to say that the corporation hopes earnestly that the Minister will see that justice is done to the people of the City of Dublin and that adequate compensation is provided for the way-leaves.  I do not mean compensation in respect of the period for which the way-leaves had to run but compensation for the fact that the corporation is apparently now to be deprived of the option of taking over the bus services and of running them under the control of the municipality.  By Act of Parliament the corporation had the right to take over the tramway services any time up to the year 1966, I think, and run them for the benefit of the people of the city.  I hope the Minister will still leave us that right and that when the matter is being considered all these questions will be taken into consideration and that the arbitrator will not think that he is appointed to protect Government and railway interests alone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Sir John Esmonde Sir John Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join in the general chorus&mdash;so far it has been practically general&mdash;of protest against the hasty consideration of the Second Reading of this Bill.  The Minister stated in his opening speech that the principal object of the Bill is to facilitate long-term transport policy.  I think he will agree that all Parties in this House should have an adequate opportunity of hammering out that <Col N="1925" /> long-term policy.  I do not base the case for the postponement of the Second Reading on the enormous amount of public money that is involved in this Bill but on the Minister's own statement. Frankly, I am not in the position, in which I should like to be, to make an adequate contribution to this debate because in the short time at my disposal it was possible to give only a hasty examination to this measure. This Bill when it becomes an Act will include not only one Act of Parliament but several Acts dealing with vitally different matters.  I shall give an illustration of that in a moment.  I think it very unwise to have this Second Reading debate carried out in such a great hurry.  I can quite see the Minister's own point of view, that he has taken a very great interest in this matter, and that having reached the key point of efficiency probably in being able to tell the Dáil in his usual eloquent fashion what the Bill is about, he probably would not like to postpone the Second Stage to a later date.  I think, however, that it would have been better in the interest of a long-term policy if the debate had been postponed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I followed the Minister's opening remarks very carefully and took one or two notes as he went along.  With many of his statements and sentiments I am in through agreement, namely, as to what the object of a transport system should be and what is the best method to bring about an efficient system.  I do not, however, believe that this Bill carries out these objects and intentions. The Minister went to great pains to outline these objects and intentions.  He told us that the Government were not going to do this or that and assured us that such-and-such would not be the law, but his statement really boils down to this: that this is a Bill to amalgamate the company known as the Great Southern Railways with the concern known as the Dublin United Transport Company.  So far as I could follow the Minister's remarks, that is what they amounted to.  He said that the public generally had lost confidence in the concern known as the Great Southern Railways Company and that it was necessary to give it a new name <Col N="1926" /> and a new start in life, by amalgamating it with the Dublin United Transport Company and giving the joint concern a new name.  The Bill is undoubtedly drafted, so far as I can judge in the short time which we were allowed to read it, with a view to facilitating a long-term transport policy.  So far as I could make out it gives this new company complete control, with certain minor exceptions in certain districts, over passengers and goods and in fact every form of traffic.</P>
    <P>These explanatory statements I have come to regard with a certain amount of suspicion because they are worded in such nice language that when one reads an explanatory statement one thinks one has read the Bill.  In the explanatory statement here, however, the effect of Section 9 of the Bill is entirely overlooked. That section is dealt with in Part II of the explanatory statement which purports to explain the effect of Sections 6 to 27.  Here we have coming into being as a result of legislation the biggest statutory company I suppose in this country, indeed one of the biggest statutory undertakings in the world of its kind.  Naturally any person who has any knowledge of the administration of a business company would look to the explanatory statement to see what powers of doing business the company possess and what form of business the company could engage in.  While in fact this Bill has the effect of amalgamating two public transport undertakings, it sets out in Section 9 the powers of the new company.  By a nice use of phrases, we find that this company can as soon as it is incorporated operate shipping services and create new activities of all kinds.</P>
    <P>We have it stated in the Bill that the expression &ldquo;transport services&rdquo; means transport services by railway, tramway, inland navigation, sea, air or road.  That is the object of this company.  Further we are told that the expression &ldquo;transport undertaking&rdquo; means any undertaking operating any transport service.  So while there are in existence two undertakings which are to be taken over and to be amalgamated to form the working core of this new organisation, under <Col N="1927" /> Section 9 the new company will have power to acquire any undertaking which carries on transport services by railway, tramway, inland navigation, sea, air or road.  We are giving that over to one man who is to act as chairman of the company, who is to form himself the quorum for any meeting, and who is to be appointed by whatever Government is in power.  That is what the Bill means, that we are going to have a traffic dictator, in the air, on the ground and under the ground in this country.  There is not a word about that in the explanatory statement. If those who come in here armed to speak on the Second Reading are relying upon the explanatory statement, they altogether miss the purpose and object of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I quite agree that if it is necessary to facilitate a long-term transport policy, it is necessary to deal with all those matters.  But is it the consensus of opinion in this House, as representing opinion in the country, that we should give to one person, helped by a chorus of &ldquo;yes-men&rdquo;&mdash;and I shall deal with those in a moment&mdash;sole control of every form of transport in this country?  I do not think it could possibly be.  If the Bill were acceptable on general principles and could be amended in Committee, I would be in favour of it because I think we should have some form of proper organisation in this country in charge of transport.  I am at one with the Minister when he says that the idea of transport is to give the best possible service at the least possible cost to the community, that is to say, it must be efficient and economical. Efficiency is to operate through a particular man at the head of affairs.  Presumably, economy is to operate also in that way.</P>
    <P>When the Minister came to consider this long-term policy he had three alternatives.  I am with him in saying that there should be amalgamation and co-ordination, particularly having regard to the vast increase in travelling facilities by air, modernisation of plant, electrification, and so on.  He had three alternatives.  He could bring into being as a creation an ordinary <Col N="1928" /> business company with certain checks by the Government and Legislature on its activities; he could nationalise the railways, or he could adopt the third alternative, which is something that has not yet been fully tried out, and which I would not recommend should be tried out, an undertaking of such gigantic proportions and of such importance to the country in the future, namely, the managerial system.  There has grown up during the last ten years in all countries in the world what has come to be regarded as the managerial system.  It is more familiar to us, perhaps, in connection with the administration of our local authorities, and so far as that is concerned, I think it is working well.  That system is being introduced into business not only in this country but in other countries. That is the 20th-century approach to efficiency by one school of thought. The Minister has adopted that expedient and I do not think that it is the correct one in connection with this particular matter, for this reason: If the Minister could produce a superman&mdash;make him dictator, if you like&mdash; to run our transport services efficiently and economically, well and good; but no such man, I suggest, could be produced or, if he could be produced, a successor for him could not be found. The Napoleons of business and so on are thrown up only once in a way, and their successors often make a mess of the job they have done.  The general public, who are the persons vitally concerned, should have control over this undertaking.</P>
    <P>Transport facilities grew up as a result of the joint stock companies, the railways and similar companies amalgamating, and in all countries big companies were created, and in this country the Great Southern Railways. Their primary object was to produce revenue for their shareholders, for the successors of the persons who had originally put up the capital to build the railways.  The matter went a step further.  The railways acquired ships, and later buses and lorries.  Then the point of view grew up that the general public were the people who were entitled to be served.  We must approach this problem of long-term planning in regard to transport from <Col N="1929" /> one point of view only, namely, what is the best way to create an organisation that will serve the public with proper transport facilities, having due regard to sectional interests, such as the interests of those who owned the capital of the company to be acquired, the workers employed, and so on? I am not so much concerned, except where justice is not done or where hardship is created, with other matters. The interests of the general public are what we are concerned with here, and I cannot conceive that the interests of the public can be safeguarded with the existence of a traffic dictator.</P>
    <P>In the days of competition, if the public did not like one form of transport, they used another.  The Minister is against competition.  I think he said he did not believe in competition. That is, presumably, because the undertaking has to be so vast that it must absorb all competitors.  But competition was the check that guaranteed efficiency to the public.  If you did not like the railway, you went on the bus. If you did not like a particular railway, you travelled by another.  If you did not like the route via Holyhead you went via Fishguard.  These were the checks the public had.  Under the proposed new system the public has no check whatsoever.  It has no check through the Legislature.  The laying on the Table of the Dáil of railway accounts is no check whatsoever.  If I want to move a cat or a dog, or a bullock or a parcel, or myself, I have a choice of going by air, by road, or by sea, but I must make use of this particular organisation.  I am looking ahead to the time when the whole scheme is working according to the terms of this Bill.  If there is something wrong, what redress have I?  If something goes wrong in regard to the postal service, I can go to my local Deputy and have the matter raised. There is no way in which the public can ventilate their grievances in connection with this public undertaking. They will just have to grin and bear it if anything goes wrong.  There is no check whatsoever, and we are going to hand over control to a dictator who can tell the members of the public who may not like his administration, to <Col N="1930" /> use a transport expression, where they get off.  That is the end of it.  If this Bill is going through&mdash;as I suppose it will be machined through here &mdash;there is one thing I think we should insist on&mdash;and I think the Minister ought to agree to it&mdash;that is, that there will be some place to which an outraged member of the public can appeal, whether it be the representative of a big manufacturing firm, or a small farmer who has not had a proper wagon for his beast, or an old age pensioner travelling two miles who cannot get a proper seat in a train. Let there be some tribunal or some place to which everyone can go in order to see that the dictator at the top maintains what the Minister is seeking for in this whole Bill, namely, efficiency.  I believe the transport system, if run efficiently, would pay for itself, and not only that, but would be able to redeem a considerable amount of the capital outstanding.  It cannot do that without being efficient.  I do not believe this Bill will promote efficiency with the methods by which the Minister envisages.  The Minister's words were that there would be efficiency and economy.</P>
    <P>Another matter which must not be lost sight of is that there is no mention anywhere in the Bill of the Great Northern Railway Company.  As I understand it, that is an Irish company. It operates in Ireland, and has not got any level crossings on the Border.  Of course, that is one of the difficulties we are up against in long-term planning.  Leaving that question aside, how could there be a long-term transport planning policy if we do not include within its ambit a transport company that is operating over seven or eight important counties?</P>
    <P>That fact is not dealt with.  I do not know what the position is with regard to road traffic as I do not live in the great northern end of this State.  I do not know if they have operational rights.  When this Bill goes through we will have one system operating to the fullest extent in one part of the country and another operating partially only in another end.  I assume that the Minister's answer will be what I mentioned <Col N="1931" /> in connection with Section 9, that the new company to be brought into existence will have power to acquire the Great Northern Railway Company.  I do not see how we could intelligently discuss a long-term transport policy without taking some cognisance of the existence of the Great Northern Railway.  In approaching this problem we must do so from the point of view of the public and not from the point of view of sectional interests concerned.  The employees must be justly treated, and the shareholders of the concerns being acquired must be justly treated.  The latter have already registered their views.  I know that there is a certain amount of dissatisfaction amongst the employees regarding their position.  I have not had time to go into that aspect of the matter, but as regards the shareholders of the company I want to know what they exist for at all.  What is the object of having any ordinary shareholders?  Is that a bit of window dressing?  Is the reference to them put there as a suggestion that this will be still an ordinary company, and not a dictatorship?</P>
    <P>Speaking from recollection, I understand that the qualification for a director is ownership of £1,000 of nominal capital in ordinary shares.  I think these shares represent something in the neighbourhood of £4,000,000.  It could be easily arranged by a dictator that he would be able to control the election of the qualifying directors who would act for him.  Even if these directors wanted to they would not be able to represent their shareholders. I cannot see the object of having ordinary shareholders at all unless they are to have some say in the management of the concern.  On the one side you have proprietors of common stock without any representation; on the other side you have the public, the users of transport, without any representation; and in the centre you have the chairman.  That is what this Bill amounts to.  It gives to the company to be brought into existence, subject to some statutory rights which the Minister has in a later part of the Bill, power to do certain <Col N="1932" /> things in the way of acquisition and gives it complete control of all transport.  Does the Minister think that to be wise long-term planning for transport?  We have had enough of experiments.  I give the Minister credit for trying to meet the situation and for trying to work out a plan, but I do not think he has gone the right way about it.  If the Bill did not contain the disabilities I have pointed out, I would be at one with the Minister, because I agree with what he aims at, but he has gone the wrong way about it and for that reason I cannot support him.</P>

      <P>If any Party has a grievance it is this Party, because the announcement in the newspapers on Monday was the first intimation we got that the Bill was to be before the House to-day.  We are certainly going to oppose this measure, not so much on the lines of the Fine Gael Party, but because we believe, as Deputy Esmonde stated, that the Bill, so to speak, would mean real dictatorship.  I disagree with the Deputy when he said the chairman is going to be a dictator.  I do so because in my view the chairman is only chairman in name, as the real chairman will be the Minister.</P>

      <P>Sub-section (3) of it says that the chairman alone shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of the board.  Sub-section (1) of Section 37 says that the chairman is the personal choice of the Minister.  It provides:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister shall...appoint a person to be chairman and the term of office of the first chairman shall commence on the establishment date.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore the Minister is to select the chairman.  The chairman forms a quorum; the chairman shall give his <Col N="1933" /> decision, and a decision of the board will not count without the concurrence of the chairman.  Therefore, there is only a chairman in name.  Members of all Parties in the House agree that something must be done so far as the transport of the country is concerned.  What use is a Bill of this kind if the ordinary person is given no opportunity of putting forward his grievances to any body except to a chairman in name?  His complaints will count for absolutely nothing.  Sub-section (8) of Section 37 allows the Minister to influence the chairman by the prospect of a rise in his salary.  That will depend on the opinion of the Minister.  Sub-section (6) of Section 37 completes the control of the Minister over the chairman.  I could go on for an hour with this, but I do not think there is any need for me to do so.  To be honest about it, I only read the Bill this morning.  So far as control is concerned, I do not think that a more undemocratic Bill than this ever came before a Parliament That is my honest view, and I think it is very unfair of the Government to try to force the Bill through. I would expect the Minister or the Government to set up some type of tribunal that would be independent of this so-called board, which, of course, is the hidden chairman, a tribunal to which the ordinary man could go with his complaint.  The great objection so far as the Great Southern Railways were concerned, was that when the company was doing well it had nothing but disrespect for the ordinary public. I believe, in the words of another Deputy, that the Minister's heart is in the right place, that he wants to remedy the present situation, but what we are not in agreement about is his method of doing that.  I do not believe that you are going to make bad worse. So far as the Great Southern Railways are concerned, financially or otherwise, it would be impossible to do that. While you are Minister, and even though I say you are the hidden dictator&mdash;I do not use that expression in the usual sense&mdash;I believe you are dead serious about improving the position.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister to take back this Bill and add a section to it giving people down the country who have grievances about transport the right to go before some tribunal to make their complaints instead of to one individual who is called the chairman of the company. I think that is necessary.  I believe that this Bill is a step in the wrong direction for the reason that it sets up a complete dictatorship in many ways.  As far as I and the members of this group are concerned, we intend to vote against the Bill.  We fully realise that some measure, even some drastic measure, is necessary as far as the transport of the country is concerned.  While that is so we still believe that in the past the Great Southern Railways was a dictatorship, so to speak.  What is this new transport company going to be but a still greater dictatorship?  For that reason we intend to vote against it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>We had an excellent dissertation from the Minister this morning on the recent history of the transport industry of the country and on the many legislative failures there were in trying to bring about a satisfactory position in it.  He indicated the magnitude of the problem that is before the House, its importance in the national interest and the equable frame of mind in which it ought to be approached by all Parties.  With all that I fully agree.  I, however, do not agree that the Minister is likely to get the conditions which he considers are necessary by the indecent haste with which he proposes to push this measure through.  Deputy Esmonde has reminded <Col N="1935" /> us that the Minister asked the House to look upon this as a long-term transport policy, and that it must not be mixed up with present dislocations of one kind or another in the traffic world.  Apparently, we must disabuse our minds completely of anything that is happening at the present time and consider this as a long-term policy.</P>
      <P>It is not as easy as the Minister suggests to give a dispassionate consideration to the proposals in this measure for a long-term policy and at the same time completely disregard the conditions which we know exist at the present moment.  According to a ruling given by the Chair, we have a set of circumstances which is not capable of being discussed on this Bill.  It is not possible to refer to certain personnel. But, it is equally impossible for us to keep the names of certain persons out of our minds, persons who are going to be intimately connected with the control of the railways.  I do suggest, with regard to the particular incident which has been referred to that it would be much better if this Bill were withdrawn until the tribunal, which is now sitting, had made known its findings.  We have at the moment the position that there is a dislocation of services owing to a fuel shortage. That matter was discussed in the House within the past fortnight.  The whole country is at present reading the correspondence which is emanating from the company and from the unions representing the men.  I do not think it is of an inspiring nature&mdash;the manner which the people who are in control of the railways at the present time have adopted in approaching a national crisis.</P>

      <P>There would not be any use in discussing this Bill in an atmosphere of complete unreality.  As representatives of the people, we should express what the man in the street thinks about this measure.  It is the general impression that there will be very little alteration in the personnel in control of the railways, when this measure is passed.  The description of that gentleman's powers has been dealt with adequately by Deputy Esmonde and Deputy Donnellan.  They are dictatorial powers and, seeing the way those powers have been used since the recent alteration made by the Minister, amalgamating the management of the Dublin United Tramways Company and that of the railway company, the people of the country&mdash;and especially the railway employees&mdash;have no reason to look forward with confidence to an extension of such dictatorial powers.</P>
      <P>It is the duty of every member of the House to approach this discussion calmly, in order to give co-operation to the Minister in introducing a measure the long-term policy of which will ensure the welfare of the transport industry.  We regret that the Minister did not see his way to go the whole hog of nationalisation.  Having gone to the extent of guaranteeing £16,000,000 capital from the ratepayers and taxpayers, I am at a loss to understand the omission of the £4,000,000. It appears to be left out in order to be utilised as a smoke screen, to preserve the private nature of the company. Sixteen million pounds is being guaranteed by the State and £4,000,000 is not being guaranteed.  On that account, there will be no opportunity in this House for discussion on the control of the company, because of its private character.  If anyone tries to raise the question, the Minister will be entitled to say that he cannot allow a discussion, as the company is privately owned and controlled.  On the other hand, the ratepayers and taxpayers will be held liable if the company fails to provide the dividends, in the final analysis, on the £16,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1937" /> We will have the satisfaction of knowing that the board can be elected, but the members constituting the board must be prepared to stultify themselves completely before accepting a seat. They can sit under the chairman, or the chairman can sit without them.  He can make decisions on his own, if they are not present; and even if they are present, he can make decisions himself. No decision can be arrived at without his concurrence.  It is an insult to the intelligence of the members of the proposed board, and also to the members of this House, to ask that the control of transport affairs be entrusted to such a board.  It would be much better and more decent to set down in black and white that the Minister has lost all confidence in boards and proposes to set up a dictator, to run the railways in conjunction with the Minister and the Government. That is the plain English of it and it would be better to put it in that way.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in introducing this Bill, said that the railways must continue to be the backbone of the transport industry.  That is heartening news to railwaymen.  Many of us believe that the controller who is likely to be the nominee is anything but rail-minded.  I should like to know if the Minister's expression that the railways are to be the backbone of transport will have any effect in influencing the controller or dictator to a like point of view.  Evidence could be adduced to the contrary, even up to the moment.  He has adopted anything but rail-minded tactics and that does not seem likely to change, unless there is a change of heart.  I was glad to hear the Minister make that statement this morning and hope he will be in a position to give effect to it, if this Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>In regard to the railway employees, the Minister certainly clarified one point, which was causing great difficulty in the minds of railwaymen, that Section 55 of the old Act would still operate.  Certain sections of the Act were being re-enacted and others were not referred to.  I would like to know why the pension clauses set out in the legislation of 1924 and 1933, should not likewise be allowed to remain.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1938" /> Every other portion of the Railways Acts has been made effective, except that to provide pensions for railwaymen, which was part and parcel of that legislation.  Various reasons were adduced for the failure to give effect to the pensions scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not quite correct.  Section 33 of the Act was made effective in full, but did not result in a pension scheme.  It required that a scheme should be prepared and submitted to the Transport Tribunal, which was to report as to whether it met the reasonable requirements of the employees.  The trouble arose from the fact that the tribunal reported that the scheme did not meet the reasonable requirements of the employees.  That contingency had not been provided for in the Act.  As a result, that section of the Act was discharged and nothing followed from it.  There is in this Bill a new section, which does provide for finality, if necessary, by Ministerial Order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>The point made by the Minister is correct.  In the original Act the company was to provide a scheme. In the second Act, the company was to provide a scheme satisfactory to the representatives of the men.  A scheme was submitted which was found to be unsatisfactory.  Many interviews took place in the Department between representatives of the company and union representatives, and the company's representatives refused to budge an inch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not quite correct, either.  May I interrupt the Deputy for a moment?  By 1939, we had <Col N="1939" /> succeeded in getting agreement on a scheme between the company and the unions.  At that stage, however, the company was not in a position to pay any contributions, as its finances were so weak, and the scheme could not be proceeded with until some legislative changes had been enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>We want, at any rate, if and when this pension scheme becomes operative, that it be a satisfactory one. I am not one to stand for a moment in the way of new railway legislation, and would not wish to continue for a moment longer than is necessary the scandal which is taking place of throwing railwaymen on the scrap-heap at 65, and putting them into the position described by Deputy Alfred Byrne this evening.  We have been looking forward for years in the hope that some pensions scheme may be introduced for railwaymen; but men have gone out of service and have died since 1933 and 1934, hoping with a hope that never materialised.  I would not wilfully stand in the way for a moment, and I hope that due consideration will be given to those men who, in recent years, have had to eke out a living on a miserable stipend, and who have been literally hungry in the streets of Dublin and in other parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time we do want, when providing new legislation, that this will not be left at the mercy of the dictator.  We absolutely insist that the men should have a voice and that, if they are to contribute, they are entitled to have a reasonable say in the scheme.  With regard to the scheme the Minister has referred to, and his point that, if that scheme were completed before the passage of this Bill, it would be passed and adopted, the railwaymen cannot be expected to accept that type of scheme.  It may be generous in its provisions, but the company has refused point blank to give representation to the men on the board controlling the scheme.  It is set down that the railwaymen can have no say whatever in it.  That is a condition of the scheme, of which the Minister may not be aware.  It is supposed <Col N="1940" /> to be similar in a character to the one operating in the Dublin United Transport Company, which is capable of being withdrawn at three months notice.  No one can realise the danger in such a scheme to organised workers. If, for instance, at one time or another, they think it desirable to make a demand for increased wages, this alleged pension scheme could be used as a threat against them and they might be told: &ldquo;If you persist with your demand, we will withdraw our contributions from the fund.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It cannot arise, because once a scheme is confirmed by Order under this, it is legally binding on the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that it could not happen if there is some representation given to the other side in the scheme.  It is mentioned that existing valuations, funds or benefit schemes will be continued by the various contracting companies, but one has already been scrapped.  A superannuation fund has been wound up compulsorily and the money handed back with the option of investing it in the company at 3 per cent.  That has been done before the operation of this measure.  I suggest those are indications of the trend of events, of what we are likely to expect from the people who will be placed in control.  We want to take such steps as are necessary for the protection of whatever rights we have and the additional rights we hope to secure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot say that the men have been generously treated, particularly in the matter of pensions.  The Minister indicated the generous provisions that are being made for retiring directors. They are fairly generous, but we are not quarrelling with that in the least.  But those terms form a shocking contrast to the complete absence of any protection for the men who will be compulsorily retired.  In the existing legislation it will be found that there is a period of seven years in which men are entitled to lodge objections and claim compensation if they can prove that they were made redundant by reason of amalgamation.  Even then it was difficult for the men, because the company was provided with <Col N="1941" /> all sorts of side-doors, back-doors and skylights through which they could get out and prove that a man's dismissal was not due to redundancy.  In this Bill only six months are allowed, after which a man has no claim whatsoever for dismissal.  The position is that the company would be unwise if they did not hold an employee for six months and then dismiss him, because in those circumstances there could be no claim for dismissal.</P>
    <P>The company are provided with every opportunity of proving that the men are not being dismissed because of the amalgamation.  They can point to altered methods of working, the loss of traffic and to a dozen other reasons, and it will be almost impossible for a railwayman to prove that he is being rendered redundant because of the amalgamation.  I do not think any Government could reasonably ask the Dáil to pass the measure in that form without putting in some protection for the railwaymen, the men who have made the railways possible, who have given their best years in the railway service.  Branch lines have been closed down and they may not be reopened. I think it is unfair to ask us to agree to a measure that contains no provision of protection for the ordinary workers on the railways, while at the same time generous provision is made for the men who had nothing to lose but everything to gain by being directors of the company for a couple of years.</P>
    <P>The Minister was really amazing on the point of disagreement with the Labour Party's proposal for nationalisaction. He advanced a couple of reasons against nationalisation.  One rather amazing reason was that if the railway service was nationally controlled the railway workers would be so influential politically that they might endeavour to compel the Government to run unnecessary and uneconomic services.  I honestly believe that if the railwaymen were working for a nationalised railway service they would be as loyal to those in authority as ever they were to a private company.  I might mention in this connection the analogy referred to by Deputy O'Sullivan, the Lord Mayor of Dublin.  Nothing like <Col N="1942" /> that has happened with the Post Office workers and I cannot see why the railway workers should be so influential in political circles that the Minister would be afraid they might exercise a political pull and thereaten the Government in power if they did not get all they required.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that a nationalised service would automatically mean a subsidised service.  I wonder how he comes to that conclusion. He stated that it was the experience in other countries that a nationalised service automatically meant a subsidised service, and he went on further to suggest that a subsidised service would mean an inefficient service.  We heard the Minister also mentioning the possibility of an impecunious Minister for Finance dipping into the railway pool as an alternative to fixing heavy taxation.  On the one hand, according to the Minister, the railways if nationalised must be subsidised and, on the other hand, there is a danger that their accumulated funds may be used as a pool to come to the assistance of a finance Minister in order to help to balance the Budget.  Then there was the third point of the political influence that the railwaymen might be able to wield so as to threaten the period of office of the Government in power.  I do not think the Minister need have any worry and I feel sure that he will not lose one wink of sleep suffering from any of those three terrible nightmares.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity that the Minister is not in a position to give expression to his own honest-to-God views.  As a matter of fact, I would prefer not to say anything here as Deputy Keyes if I could but repeat the speech made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lemass, in 1931, because I believe there could not be a more effective contribution towards the nationalisation of the railways than that statement. Nothing that I could say in my own poor way could be as effective in favour of nationalisation as the Minister's 1931 statement.  The position now is that the Minister, instead of having <Col N="1943" /> advanced, has receded.  What attempt has he made to try to improve the position? I remember him when the 1933 legislation was going through.  We urged him to go the whole hog, and the Minister said: &ldquo;No.  I think private enterprise is entitled to one more chance.&rdquo;  Further on he said that if that attempt was not a success, then nationalisation could not be ruled out of consideration any longer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have now arrived at the stage when the Minister tells us that he is going the whole distance.  The proposed company will have a capital of £20,000,000, and they are making it more or less a State enterprise.  They are prepared to guarantee £16,000,000. I suggest that this is merely a smoke screen, and the company will be left at the mercy of a dictator.  It will be immune from Parliamentary questions &mdash;questions put in the Dáil in the hope of a reply.  Why the Minister is so blind to this extent I cannot understand. Even now he ought to reconsider that aspect.  He is not going to inspire confidence among the people by this type of control.  Deputy Esmonde and the leader of the Farmers' Party are not enamoured of a dictatorship, and the Labour Party certainly are not.  We cannot subscribe to it.  We suggest that the board that will be initiated by the Minister will be only a board of cyphers.  The whole thing will be under the control of a dictator.  An advisory committee would be useful on a nationalised railway, but certainly not as advisers to a dictator.  It might be that the dictator would dictate to the Minister himself. Deputy Donnellan is afraid that the Minister will be the chairman.  I am afraid the manager will be the Minister. So far as that is concerned, the fear is mutual.  The only thing about it is that the Minister and the chairman, or the chairman and the Minister, will be completely independent of the control of this House as to how matters are being run or ruined in regard to the railway.  I am anxious for legislation that will make a success of the railway; but I have no confidence that this Bill will do it.  I believe that the Bill is being rushed with indecent haste, and that the present time is inopportune <Col N="1944" /> for discussing it.  I think the Minister is unwise in bringing it forward now, because, while we are anxious to have the legislation brought to fruition at the earliest possible date, the maxim, <i>festina lente,</i> could be usefully applied.  I believe that the postponement of the discussion would result in a better measure and a better frame of mind on the part of the country and of Deputies.  I think we shall lose nothing by postponing the consideration of the measure until the atmosphere is cleared, so that we may get some more reasoned consideration of the proposition which we put before the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the most important and, at the same time, one of the most controversial measures brought before this House by the present Government, and I think that it is incumbent upon me to express the view which has already been expressed by the leader of my Party, that their attitude towards the House in the way in which they are rushing on this Bill is an insult to the House and an attempt to undermine Parliamentary institutions in this country.  It does not quite stand alone.  We had an important Bill&mdash;the Drainage Bill&mdash; which only reached the hands of some Deputies on the very morning of the Second Reading.  We made very little protest.  The Bill followed out the report of a Government Commission and, because we were willing and anxious to facilitate the carrying out of public business, we made no protest. We discussed a Bill, which we had no opportunity of reading, for the first day, at any rate, on which the Second Reading went on.  It was adjourned for a week and then, of course, we had an opportunity of reading it.  Taking advantage of that, and because the House did not protest, a contentious measure, a measure of the first importance, a measure which is introducing a completely new principle into this State, a Bill which is introducing a method of dealing with public money which, so far as I know, is entirely unprecedented, is brought in and we are asked to discuss it fully after a very <Col N="1945" /> few days.  If there was ever a Bill which Deputies should get time to consider before Second Reading, it is this Bill.  Whether it is fear, or whatever emotion brought about the Minister's attitude, I think that, if the Minister were deliberately attempting to prevent harmonious discussion of this Bill and were endeavouring to create an acrimonious discussion upon this Bill, he could have taken no surer course than the course he has taken.</P>
      <P>We are asked to discuss this Bill which is half hidden away by a smoke screen.  We are asked to discuss this Bill as if we did not know from where it emanated.  At least, I suppose we can say from where it emanated, but we are supposed to discuss this Bill without any consideration of the particular individuals who are to work it.  What is more, we are not only asked to say that it is for the good of the country and the well-being of our people that Mr. X should be given control of State transport, but we are asked also to hand over&mdash;because that is what it amounts to&mdash; £16,000,000 of public money to a private company without having the remotest idea of how that money is to be spent or invested.  Taking the Bill itself, the Bill does not state, nor does the White Paper, how much of this £20,000,000 is to go to the present shareholders of the railway company. No doubt we could calculate it if we had all the material before us.  But certainly it is one of the matters as to which the Minister might have informed us in his opening statement. As to where the balance is to go, we are not informed at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister gave us a very graphic description of the condition of the Great Southern Railways.  He told us that it had unstandardised and obsolete equipment, that it required new equipment.  He told us that it was hardly possible for it to carry on. He told us that the time was coming when actually it would not be able to pay its current expenses.  That is the condition of the Great Southern Railways that the State is now asked to acquire&mdash;a thoroughly bankrupt concern, according to the Minister.  The <Col N="1946" /> Minister stated, of course, that he thought a good deal of that was due to bad management, and that at the present time the management was better.  The Minister assumes that such alteration as has been made in the management has been an improvement, but what evidence has the Minister given us that the alteration has been any improvement?  I know from the point of view of a passenger upon that railway that I can see no possible signs of improvement or of efficiency. The last day I was going home from Dublin when I left Westland Row at 10 o'clock and at 11 o'clock I knew that I had not reached Liffey Junction, I could not see that there were any great signs of efficiency.  Possibly I might not mind a train breaking down in the course of its journey&mdash;you could make every allowance for the fuel supply&mdash;but when I discovered an engine starting off from Westland Row in such a condition that it cannot reach Liffey Junction, I certainly think that there is very great inefficiency somewhere.  I see no sign of the improvement which the Minister talks about.  So far as I am concerned as a passenger on the line, all I can see is that the new management is not one bit of an improvement upon the old, and I am making as much allowance as one is bound to make for the fuel situation.</P>
    <P>We have a completely bankrupt concern, as the Minister says, and what are we doing with this bankrupt concern? We are giving it a present of £16,000,000 of Government money, because it is exactly the same thing whether I give a person a present of £16,000,000 or whether I guarantee the interest on £16,000,000.  If the Minister would pass a special Act to give me a present of £1,000,000 out of State funds, or if the Minister would give me a guarantee that, if I borrow £1,000,000 from the Bank of Ireland, he will pay the interest, I would not really care, if I had the option, which of the two I got.  I would have a magnificent time on either.</P>
    <P>That is the position here.  A bankrupt company is being given £16,000,000 of public money.  I think it is the most astonishing thing that has ever been done.  If the State proposes to take <Col N="1947" /> over a particular undertaking, I do not see that the State is bound to pay, nor indeed do I think the State, as trustee for the public, is morally justified in paying to the owners of the concern any higher sum of money than the owners are entitled to.  We have very often had discussions here about the acquisition of land, and we have heard complaints that land for public purposes is being bought over too cheaply. That is being done, but here we have the State taking over a bankrupt concern and paying good hard cash for it. My first objection to the Bill is that the State is being asked to pay to the shareholders of the Great Southern Railways far and away more than the Great Southern Railways are worth. There can be no question about that, and there can be no question that they are being given millions more than their company is worth.</P>
    <P>I cannot deal, and I am not attempting to deal, with the inquiry into stock transactions, but I can deal with the facts which led up to the inquiry. Everybody knows that when it was bruited abroad that this largesse was proposed to be scattered by the Fianna Fáil Government amongst the shareholders of the Great Southern Railways, however it was so bruited abroad, the shares immediately boomed and boomed on the Stock Exchange and that, although it passed completely and entirely unnoticed by the Minister, there was an amount of vigour in the dealings on the Stock Exchange which was entirely unprecedented. Why was that?  Why was there this extraordinary boom in these shares?  It was due to this particular fact, that the shareholders were to get twice as much as they were entitled to get, and therefore the shares doubled in value.</P>
    <P>I have as much sympathy as anybody can have with persons who had money invested in railway stocks&mdash;some persons had their all and others a great deal of money which was of tremendous importance to them invested in railway stocks&mdash;and who, when railway stocks went down, owing to road competition and other things, lost all their property.  I have the greatest sympathy with them, but I do not see how <Col N="1948" /> this House, as trustees for the public, is liable to make good to them a loss of that nature.  I remember when there was a catastrophe in Dublin about 40 years ago.  There was a national insurance company which was looked upon by all persons in Ireland as being one of the most solvent bodies in which one could conceivably put one's money.  Unfortunately for the shareholders, the shares were not all paid-up shares.  That company speculated, or, at least, dealt largely with business outside the country. There came the earthquake and fire in San Francisco and the company was unable to meet its liabilities without calling up all the uncalled-for shares, which created woe, havoc and desolation in many households in this country.  But no one then proposed that, because the shareholders in that company had lost their money, the State should step in and make good the losses.</P>
    <P>If the unfortunate shareholders in Great Southern Railways have shares that were of little or no value, the State is not justified and this House, in my judgment, is not justified, in being charitable to them, and in giving them, out of mere charity, a great deal more than their shares are worth.  We might like to do so, but as trustees of the public, as trustees for the taxpayers, we have no right to buy over, and I say we have no moral justification for buying over an undertaking at twice its value.  That is one of my main objections to the Bill.</P>

      <P>To continue, Sir, the story of the various <Col N="1949" /> sub-heads, I now come to sub-head D&mdash; Grants for Afforestation Purposes&mdash; amounting to £1,000.  A review of the progress made under the earlier schemes shows that the rate of planting on private lands has been disappointingly small, and the Department has had under consideration for some time past the question of the best method of inducing and assisting landowners to plant trees on their own lands.  The grant of £4 per acre which has been payable up to the present has been found to be inadequate, and the minimum of five acres required under the scheme ruled out many persons anxious to plant but who could not devote such a large area to the purpose.  With the consent of the Minister for Finance I have, therefore, decided to increase the total amount of the grant from £4 to £10 per acre and to reduce to one acre the minimum area necessary to qualify for a grant.  The grant will be payable in two instalments, one of £5 immediately after planting has been satisfactorily carried out, and a similar amount after a period of five years, provided the plantation has been satisfactorily maintained in the meantime. Maintenance will involve the replacement of failures, adequate fencing against stock and rabbits and such other attention as may be necessary to enable the plantation to establish itself successfully.  At the present time stocks of plants in the commercial nurseries are limited and fencing wire almost unprocurable, so that no immediate increase in the rate of private planting can be expected, but it is hoped that in the near future as many landowners as possible will take advantage of this scheme and that there will be a considerable amount of private planting done to supplement the efforts of the State Forestry Service to increase the area of woodlands in the country and to provide from our own resources in the future a greater proportion of our needs in timber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Department's hopes are to be realised, and if any great advantage is to be taken of these grants, it is essential that there should be adequate <Col N="1950" /> stocks of plants to be had, and it is hoped that nurseries which cater for the trade in forest trees, will, in their own and in the general interests, proceed to build up stocks of healthy young trees as rapidly as possible. Admittedly seed is at present both dear and hard to get, but the prospects of an assured market for the produce should encourage nurserymen to do their utmost to get supplies.</P>
    <P>Sub-head H&mdash;Appropriations-in-Aid &mdash;comes to £54,140.  There is a considerable decrease in the estimated revenue for this year as compared with last year mainly in consequence of a falling off in large sales of timber. Such a decrease is inevitable in view of the fact that the quantity of mature timber in the hands of the Forestry Division was limited and heavy inroads have been made into that stock. Sales to the same extent as in the past few years could only be made by disposing of all the remaining stands, and it is considered desirable to retain a few lots against possible urgent demands for vital national purposes. On the other hand, increases are expected in the returns from sale of sawn timber and small local sales of both timber and firewood.</P>
    <P>During the past year about 35 large lots of timber, comprising 26,000 trees were advertised and sold, and 72 smaller lots, comprising approximately 10,000 trees and 60,000 poles, were sold locally either by tender or auction.  As regards firewood, 3,925 tons of logs were sent to Fuel Importers and about 16,000 tons sold locally. The output of firewood blocks was disposed of to the extent of 3,393 tons sent to the Dublin Corporation and 7,000 tons sold locally.  In addition, the Forestry Division has, at the request of the Department of Defence, arranged to make available for Army use some thousands of tons, and the work of felling and preparing this is already in hands.  In view of the great demand and the limited supply of firewood now available in the State forests the proper disposal of lots as they become available is one of the Forestry Division's most difficult problems, and while it is impossible to satisfy all the demands made upon the <Col N="1951" /> Department, or to undertake to supply large quantities to particular firms or individuals, I am satisfied that the Forestry Division is doing its best and that its efforts to be fair and reasonable to everybody are meeting with success generally.</P>
    <P>So far as the Forestry Act is concerned, the volume of felling on private estates shows no signs of abatement, but it is very disturbing to note that the amount of felling done illegally is increasing.  There are no acceptable excuses for actions of this nature.  Generally speaking, no obstacle is placed by my Department in the way of felling of small numbers of trees required by landowners for their own use, and a little forethought will enable any person who wishes to fell trees to comply with the requirements of the Forestry Act, and to secure consent to the felling of such trees as it is not essential to leave standing.  The excuse is frequently made that immediate felling was necessary on account of tillage operations, and that the crop in a particular field was badly damaged the previous year by overshading trees, and so on.  But surely the obvious course in such circumstances is to lodge a felling notice immediately and not to wait until the field is being ploughed and then proceed to fell either without lodging a felling notice at all or without waiting for the consent of the Department. Explanations of this kind are not good enough.</P>
    <P>As regards replanting operations to be undertaken as a condition of the issue of a licence to fell, the Department is aware that at present suitable plants are both scarce and expensive and fencing materials almost unprocurable. In these circumstances an extension of the period within which the planting must be done is granted in every case in which it is asked for, but this does not mean that the replanting condition has been waived.  When conditions return to normal, and particularly in view of the considerably increased monetary assistance now being offered every case will be taken up again and prosecution will follow <Col N="1952" /> where it is clear that no serious attempt is being made by the licensee to comply with the obligations he has accepted.  It is hoped, however, that such action will not be forced upon the Department but that in fact, with the aid of the increased grant, persons who have suitable land available will not only carry out their contracts but will undertake additional planting.</P>
    <P>A very detailed report of the activities of the Forestry Division for the five years ended on 31st March, 1943, is at present being printed and copies will be laid on the Table of the House as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Owing to circumstances over which my Department has no control it was not possible during the past year to introduce the new legislation in regard to afforestation matters mentioned by my predecessor in introducing the Estimates for 1943-44.  A Forestry Bill has now been drafted and I hope to be in a position to acquaint the House with its provisions in the course of the present year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>The main statement which was contained in the Minister's opening remarks was with reference to the increase of the grant for afforestation from £4 to £10 per acre.  I am very glad to hear that, because I think that it will certainly help along afforestation, generally.  I also think that wisdom has been shown in dividing the grant into two, because I am afraid that experience will show that the second half of a great number of grants will not be big. The defect, of course, in the original Forestry Act, as has been shown by practice, is that people who are bound to replant trees are quite prepared to plant ten trees for every one tree that they cut down, but there the matter stops, because you can buy young trees rather cheaply, stick them in the ground, and you do not care whether they grow up or not.  Possibly half of these young trees are already dead before they are planted in the ground and the others are just struggling along.  It will be very difficult to ensure that efficient replanting will take place, but there certainly is an inducement for efficient replanting <Col N="1953" /> and that trees will be put into places where they can get an opportunity of growing.  For instance, you take a place where there has been a plantation, with drains cut and all that, some 70 or 100 years ago when the real planting of this country went on.  If the plantation drains were allowed to be closed the old trees were able to absorb a good deal of moisture and fight against such moisture as there was, but the new trees die away because of the undrained condition of the soil.  One of the difficulties which the private planter has got at the present moment is the want of wire fencing. It is impossible now to fence against rabbits and if you do not fence against rabbits you may be certain you will have 50 per cent. casualties among the trees you put out.  I know, because I tried it myself.  I did about an acre of planting this year.  I was fortunate in having some trees, 4 or 5 ft. high, and the rabbits did not touch them; but anything that is about 2 or 3 ft. high, which is higher than you get out of the nursery&mdash;I had got mine from a nursery two or three years ago and they were much larger&mdash;the rabbits simply destroyed.  It is mere waste of time unless you can fence out the rabbits.  There is also another thing which I would suggest to the Minister on the question of replanting. I do not think you should entirely concentrate upon the conifers.  I think that in planting, certainly in my own neighbourhood, the primary thing to do is to plant a particular type of timber which will satisfy the needs of that neighbourhood.  I believe any country Deputy would agree with me that the three types of timber you want are: No. 1, larch; No. 2, ash, or, if you like, ash No. 1 and larch No. 2; and then you want for rafters and that sort of thing for which larch is not suited some sort of spruce that will not warp in the way larch warps.  A Deputy in this House, tremendously keen on forestry, circulated to every one of us a book written by Mr. Mackay upon forestry in Ireland.  I do not know what the views of the Department upon Mr. Mackay's books were, but from my little knowledge of trees I dissented very much from Mr. Mackay's views.  He had the idea that <Col N="1954" /> we should plant nothing but sitka spruce solely for pulping and making into paper.  Well, I am not in a position, and I do not know that anybody in this country is in a position to say that sitka spruce is a tree that one can plant with perfect security.  I do not think that anybody can say that a tree that has not been in this country for more than 60 or 70 years, if I am not wrong, is a tree you can perfectly rely upon.  I would very much rather rely on the old-established trees that we know do succeed.  If you are going in for mere weight of timber I certainly would prefer to see a silver fir than a sitka spruce.  But to get back to the point I was on, what the Irish farmer wants is larch for his carts and for his wooden gates, and he wants ash for his spade handles, harrows and anything in fact for which you want timber.  I think it is a pity that there is not some ash among the trees which the Department directs to be planted; there should be no scarcity of it.  There is great scarcity of larch.  I do not know why there should be because larch, I understand, can be grown from the native seed; but if you write to any nursery you will find that you cannot get larch.  It is almost unobtainable. I do not think, if you ask for 10,000, all the nursery men in Ireland could supply them to you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is very unsatisfactory and as I say I do not see the reason for it.  There is no difficulty in getting ash.  I venture to think I could supply 20,000 seedling ash myself because in my part of the country all you have got to do is to fence a place around an ash or a sycamore tree and you will have so many ash and sycamores that the place will be an impenetrable thicket.  There is no difficulty about seedlings as far as ash and sycamore are concerned. There is one other matter.  It is a matter of detail which I think the Minister should consider for his new Bill. At the present moment there is no definition of a tree.  Of course it is very easy to tell that a full grown ash, beech or larch is a tree, but there are border-line cases where it is very difficult to say whether the thing is a tree or whether it is not.  For instance if you see, let me say, a seedling larch an inch high and you pull it out you <Col N="1955" /> have not cut down a forest tree.  When it is a good ash plant you still have not cut down a forest tree but if it is of a diameter let me say something you put one hand round is it a tree or is it not?  I think there ought to be some definition.  I have known the Department in making clearings to declare things to be trees that I know I myself would not have thought are trees. I would have said it is a thing which in 25 or 30 years will be what you call a tree but I would not call it a tree now.  Then there are border-line types of trees.  I thought myself for example that a hazel would not be called a tree until I discovered that in the view of the Forestry Department a hazel is a tree, but an ordinary person would not have thought that it was. Then you take other types.  Would you call a black sally a tree or would you not?  These are matters which are very hard for the ordinary person to know. Though wishing to be a most law-abiding person I am afraid I have been breaking the law because I have allowed people to come into my place and cut down hazels.  I did not think I was breaking the law but seemingly I was.  I would like to have some definition of a tree&mdash;I know it is difficult&mdash; put into the Minister's new Bill so that we will know precisely where we are. You can name the types of things that will be improper to cut&mdash;you shall not cut beech, ash, oak or any conifer over a certain diameter&mdash;and then you can leave out all the other things which it does not matter whether you cut or not.  In fact, hazel and alder are things which it is rather a blessing to cut. There is another thing I gather from the Minister that I am glad to hear and that is that we are to have an official record of work which the Forestry Department has done.  From what I have seen by personal contact with officials of the Forestry Department both in the office and upon the land they seem to know their work extremely well.  I think it will be a help to the people and especially to people who either by compulsion or for pleasure are anxious to do new planting that they should get and have ready for reference the views of the Department both as to the values of the trees they <Col N="1956" /> are planting and the soils upon which it is advisable that trees should be planted.  You may make very bad blunders if you plant the right tree upon the wrong soil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHCrowley" hpid="Mr. F.H. Crowley Mr. F.H. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F.H. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making a more or less serious complaint against the whole mental outlook towards forestry development.  I am fully satisfied that to all intents and purposes forestry development does not exist.  I am not blaming the Minister for that outlook.  I think it has been in the country for the last 20 years.  I am going to give you certain figures which I think ought to satisfy you that we are not forestry-minded in this country. Every other European country has a higher percentage of acreage under trees.  In Germany there is 27 per cent. acreage under trees and, in fact, it is supposed to have reached 30 per cent. now.  Norway, Sweden, Finland and Lapland have an equal percentage, but this country has only 3 per cent. under trees.  Compared with the German acreage this is a ratio of 100 to one. In the United States at the present time the Forestry Department is counted the most important Department after the Department of Agriculture, and takes a place before industry.  In Canada the Forestry Department is one of the most important of the whole lot and the acreage planted by the Governments of the two countries named is exceptionally high. I may be wrong in my conception of what the capabilities of this country are from the forestry development point of view, but I will give them to you for what they are worth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have about 4,000,000 acres of grazing land not fit for tillage and that grazing land could not by any stretch of the imagination be converted to tillage by reclamation or otherwise.  Of that grazing land 2,000,000 acres might be brought under forestry.  It would take about 40 years, 35 to 40 years, to plant that 2,000,000 acres and for it to reach maturity, which would give you on the average about 60,000 acres to be planted per year, and once it reached the age of maturity you would get an output&mdash;and I disagree with the last Deputy who spoke as to the quality of <Col N="1957" /> wood we should grow&mdash;you would get an output of wood pulp equal in value to 25 to 30 million pounds.  I am giving you that figure based upon the price of pre-war wood pulp.  The demand for wood pulp is increasing day by day, the virgin forests of the world are being cut down; and any country, after the war, that can produce spruce trees will have an opportunity of producing cellulose and other things, including artificial silk, and that country is going to score on the double.  As I said earlier I am not blaming the Minister one way or the other but something must happen to rouse us as to how we are neglecting the development of forestry.  Nobody can say we are developing forestry when only 3 per cent. of the land is under forest and you have 30 per cent. in Germany, with nearly an equal figure in Norway, Sweden, Finland and Lapland, and a rapid development of the acreage taking place in the United States and Canada.  I am blaming the Minister for one thing only and that is slowness in the acquisition of land.  I am not asking him immediately to proceed with the big scheme I put forward but I do say that certain places, and some of them big stretches of land, have been offered to the Department of Forestry in Kerry.  I believe that most of that land grew forest before and is able to grow it again.  I am satisfied that the officials of the Department have too conservative a mental outlook towards the acquisition of land.  It is all very well to hold out the plea of a dead safety line and say &ldquo;I am not going to take the risk.&rdquo;  I am not asking the Department to take a risk I am asking them to acquire land that has been offered in places such as Cordell, Scartaglen, Kilgarvan, Glencar and Kenmare.  I see nothing to prevent the acquisition of land in the areas I have named.  I do not wish to say very much more, but I would like to ask the House to take the question of the acquisition of land very seriously.  Once the chemist enters the field, we must remember that he has put wood pulp into 2,000 articles, 500 of which are almost in daily use, so that, if we choose to think in terms only of furniture factories, our acreage might be small, but if we consider what other <Col N="1958" /> countries are doing and the possibilities of wood pulp and cellulose, our output should be far greater.  I am not blaming the Minister.  Our mental outlook as regards forestry for the past 20 years and the mental outlook of the Irish people is responsible.  In five or 10 years, when we become more forestry-minded, a high compliment will be paid to Mackay for the book he published.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredPByrne" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne (Junior) Mr. A. Byrne (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know very much about the technical end of forestry and I shall not delay the House in pretending that I do.  But I do know the price of a suit of clothes and the price of bread, butter, milk, and other necessaries of life.  It is to the effect of these on the employees of the Department of Forestry that I desire to draw the attention of the House.  The Book of Estimates shows us very conclusively that the foresters of Ireland are about half-paid.  The foremen and trappers are also only half-paid.  Practically every Deputy has said at some time that, in matters of wages and conditions of employment, the State should give a lead.  In this case, the State is lagging far behind. I think that no member of the House will deny that.  The Book of Estimates shows that Grade I foresters receive from £170 to £210, that Grade II foresters are on a scale of £130&mdash;£170, and that foremen receive £120.  These figures are a disgrace to the community, especially when we realise the great importance of the work they are doing.  That has often been emphasised in this House.  I am told that some of these men have university degrees.  In the first place, they have to go through three or four years of gruelling training.  Then they have to go back and take a degree in agricultural science or some similar subject.  When one thinks of the years they have to devote to training and when one thinks of the hard and important work they are doing, it is not an exaggeration to say that they are about half-paid.  If we could get the Minister to press for their establishment as civil servants, with pension rights and cost-of-living bonus, it would be a good day's work.  I ask the House to join me in urging on the <Col N="1959" /> Minister that that be done.  The allowances granted to foresters are also meagre in the extreme.  Foresters must supply their own bicycles, for which they are granted an allowance of £2 per annum, which would not buy a couple of tyres at present prices. Their lodging allowance of 7/6 is not a great deal for the State to offer its employees, either.</P>
      <P>I want to direct the attention of the Minister to part of his answer to a question of mine last week when he said that foremen may occasionally be placed in charge of small forestry units and while so employed are paid a special allowance of 5/- per week in addition to ordinary remuneration.  If a foreman is in charge of a small forestry unit, surely he has, while so engaged, to do the same work as a forester, and surely he has the same responsibilities as a forester.  I asked a question last week also as regards the holidays granted to members of the forester and foreman grades.  I asked the Minister, and I repeat the request now, to remember that these men are stationed in places which are at the back of Godspeed.  It takes them a great deal of time to get to civilisation for a start, and then if a man has to travel, say, from Cork to Mayo, he will spend a long time in so doing.  In these circumstances, two or four days extra should be allowed to foresters, so that they will have sufficient time to get home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that the holiday allowances are considered adequate, having regard to the leave allowances of analogous classes in the Civil Service generally, and in outside employment. Why should these holidays be fixed in accordance with those allowed in outside employment?  Should not the State give a lead in these matters?  It has brought in Conditions of Employment Acts and a Holidays (Employees) Act to endeavour to get outside employers to grant decent conditions to their employees.  I submit that the first thing the State should do is to grant those conditions to its own employees.  Let them give a lead instead of trailing behind, as they have been doing.  We had an Estimate for <Col N="1960" /> the Department of Posts and Telegraphs last week, and it was obvious that that Department is one of the worst in this respect.  I suggest to Deputies who are interested in the progress of forestry that the Department of Forestry is not very much better than the Post Office.  It is said that, in the post-war years, there will be necessity for large-scale employment. One of the things often mentioned in that connection is large-scale forestry activity.  If returned emigrants and demobilised soldiers are to be asked to take up forestry work, we should ensure that they get a fair return for their labour.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was one bright spot in the statement of the Minister in introducing his Estimate.  That was when he said that during the year he expected to introduce a Forestry Bill. I hope that I did not misunderstand the Minister's statement in that respect. That is one thing to which the people are looking forward, especially in the west of Ireland, where there are thousands of acres of land that could never be made arable, lands that, to all intents and purposes, are waste at present.  If we tackled this problem, say, 20 years ago, as I hope the present Minister will now tackle it in the Bill which he has promised to bring forward, what a happy condition as regards timber we would be in to-day. To indicate what is possible in this direction one has only to go down to Recess in Connemara&mdash;I am sorry that Deputy Mongan is not here at the moment to bear me out in this&mdash;to see what has been done by a foreigner.  It was left to the foreigner to come in and show us what could be done in the wilds of Connemara.  If the Minister would only go down there and see what has been done in that desolate region I am sure it would be a revelation to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney has spoken in praise of the proposal to advance from £4 to £10 per acre to assist forestry.  Of course, that represents an improvement, but does the Minister or his Department seriously suggest that any considerable progress in afforestation will be made in that <Col N="1961" /> way?  What is required, I suggest, is large scale planting on these thousands of acres of land that can never be made arable.  If that were done, as I say, 20 years ago we would find ourselves in a very satisfactory position as regards timber to-day.  The Minister has proved himself to be a very successful organiser in other spheres of activity, and I expect that the new measure which he has promised will be one of a far-reaching character, so that the people of this country will be under no illusion as far as forestry is concerned. I hope the Minister will not say, as he said in replying to some remarks of mine on another Estimate, that I am trying to stand on two different props when I make reference to a certain area in my constituency where his Department appears to have taken over from the Land Commission a certain area of arable land.  At the moment it appears to be their intention to plant portion of this arable land.  I put down a question in relation to this matter some time ago, and when I made an effort to refer to it last week I was told that it was a matter for this Estimate.  It appears to be very hard to separate Land Commission functions from those of the Forestry Department.  I certainly find it hard to separate them, as both Departments are administered by the one Minister.  The lands to which I refer are situate on the Ashtown Estate in the Woodlawn area.  Some of that land is being fenced and is taken over by the Forestry Department.  It is land which is definitely arable, and would be badly needed for tillage purposes. Considering that there are some thousands of acres of land which is not arable and which would be very suitable for afforestation, I would ask the Minister not to reserve this arable land for forestry purposes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that one of the things that hampers forestry activity and operations in this country is the anxiety of the forestry section of the Department to avoid incurring public criticism because of mistakes they have made.  I believe that the Forestry Department have some skeletons in the cupboard, and they are most anxious <Col N="1962" /> to keep them in the cupboard.  It should be remembered that quite a lot of the work carried out by the Department is experimental work.  We are anxious to plant land that is not arable and not suitable from the agricultural point of view.  Deputy Donnellan has advocated a policy of that kind just now.  Of course, if we are going to produce commercial timber, we must have some degree of fertility in the land in which it is planted. That is why it is so easy to criticise the Department for failure to plant areas that are not arable.  What I mean by skeletons in the cupboard is that there are undoubtedly cases where plantations have failed.  These plantations have failed possibly because the soil had not been examined.  There is a high degree of iron in some soils which operates against plant life.  In the same way the problem of planting a lot of bog land has to be considered, as, where it is possible to get young trees established at all, you may meet with success.  There again a good deal of experimental work is required.  I believe that problem has been solved in other countries by simply turning up one sod on the other and putting in the young trees.  In that way you can secure the establishment of the young plants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say that we should not be inclined to criticise whatever failures may have occurred in that respect in the work of the Department, because, as I have stated, a lot of this work is experimental, and if failure occurs, it occurs from conditions over which the Department have no control. If we want to strike out on a bold scheme of afforestation, we must be prepared to incur a number of failures.  I can understand, of course, the attitude of trying to hide those failures, because our Parliamentary system obviously makes for a situation where a Deputy who observes such failure will take the opportunity to expose it.  The reaction of the Department is to try to hide the failure.  I want to say that should not be the spirit that animates the forestry section, because I think we all appreciate that failures are inevitable in the circumstances. I think that much more experimental work should be carried <Col N="1963" /> out with regard to the planting of certain areas that are almost waste and useless from the agricultural point of view.</P>
    <P>Of course, the question of afforestation has very much wider aspects than merely the provision of timber for commercial purposes.  Trees, we know, affect the climate, the rainfall, and the health of the people generally.  Looking at the question on the whole, and attempting to forecast what the supply of timber in the post-war period is likely to be, I think the House is wise in urging on the Minister the necessity of going ahead with an expanding scheme of plantation, because the enormous destruction that has occurred in Europe during the war will strain the timber resources of the world in the post-war period to a very great extent. There is no doubt that we cannot look forward in our time to cheap timber, even for years after the war. I believe that no cheap timber will be available in our time, or perhaps for a considerable time afterwards.  For that reason I join with other Deputies in urging the Minister to lay plans now for the further planting of trees. Little can be done at present because as the Minister has wisely pointed out, we must have a certain amount of wire available to keep off the vermin which destroy young plants.  There is also the question of the capacity of our nurseries to produce the necessary young plants, and the question of the acquisition of land; but we could be preparing the way for future years in the acquisition of land for this purpose, and by carrying out more experimental work.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fred Crowley referred to the people of this nation becoming forestry-minded.  I think the biggest culprit in the destruction of trees in this country was and is the tenant farmer.  I have seen estates divided in my own constituency, in the rest of Leinster and in the west where the tenant-farmers were not satisfied until they cut down every tree and bush.  It was a suicidal policy but that happened, and every Deputy who would admit facts knows that has happened all over the country.  Certainly <Col N="1964" /> we need to create a forestry mind here.  Deputy Hughes was correct in his statement that barren land will not grow good timber; it requires reasonably good land.  It is from the reasonably good land that the cities and towns are now getting their supply of firewood.  It is not from the barren soil, it is not from the cut-away bogs. You may get a Scotch fir there but it is no use and would probably set the house on fire.  The good elms and ash and other good trees are grown on reasonably good land.  As I said before on this Vote, if there was one redeeming feature in connection with the old landlords&mdash;I never held a brief for them and I think they were a good riddance&mdash;it is that they preserved any timber and any bushes that were preserved in this country. That must be admitted and put to their credit.  The minute the estates were divided, every whin bush was cut down.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see the present Minister in charge of this Department because I have listened to him on this subject and I hope he will put his theories into practice and not let the dead hand of the Civil Service paralyse his efforts&mdash;as I heard a very distinguished citizen of this State say about all Governments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that treason? Well, I am in the House at present. The Minister said in connection with the felling notices issued during the present emergency that the Forestry Department will enforce the provision in regard to replanting.  I sincerely hope that that will be done.  It has never been enforced.  Outside Wicklow, the county I represent is the greatest timber-producing county in Ireland, on statistics.  I have seen thousands of trees cut there and exported in the years preceding this war, particularly ash for aeroplane construction, and not a whin bush has been set.  I put a point to the Minister: Several large farms on which that timber grew have changed hands. Several estates have been sold.  Will compulsory powers be enforced on the <Col N="1965" /> new owners?  That is a nice point for consideration.  If we are to do the work laid down in the Act in regard to the replacement of timber cut down, that point will have to be considered seriously by the Government.</P>
      <P>The Forestry Department have laid down that beyond a certain height you cannot grow timber in this country. In the northern part of my county where there is a considerable acreage of timber and where a forestry unit is in existence some mountains or hills have been left bare although the butts of old trees are to be found in these places.  I have gone through Connemara several times, to which Deputy Donnellan referred, and in places where the Forestry Department contend that trees cannot be grown I have seen the roots of substantial trees unearthed by people working the bog.  I should like an answer from the Forestry Department to this question: If trees could be grown to maturity in these places 50 or 60 years ago, what has happened that they cannot be grown there now?  I think the Department have no answer to that and that they are simply throwing dust in the eyes of the people who are interested in afforestation in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to a timber census.  We should like particulars in regard to that.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney referred to certain types of trees which are native to this country. I think that theory can be developed to a great extent because in places subject to gales and storms, particularly in the west and south, in Kerry, and other places, if technical knowledge is applied to the problem, good results may follow.  We should study the experience in Norway, where trees grow at enormous heights over cliffs where one could not imagine how they could take root.  If the system practised in the north of Scotland, where they start with scutch grass, bent grass, furze, and follow that with bushes, and then follow with timber, were adopted here by the Department, I think it would be successful.  There was a gentleman over here from Germany&mdash;I do not know if he is in the Department at the present time&mdash; who did some good work.  If he had <Col N="1966" /> special knowledge in regard to this matter and if it were applied to this particular aspect of afforestation, it would be all to the good.</P>
    <P>In connection with the export of ash to English factories and saw-mills, in the years preceding the war, a very considerable amount of ditch ash was cut down and exported.  Particularly in the midlands, it was quite a common thing on a large farm to cut down 100 to 300 trees of ditch ash.  In the reconstruction of ditches under the farm improvements scheme, planting of ditch ash should be encouraged.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <P>On this Bill it seems to me that we have three points for consideration, one of which has been already dealt with in respect of the propriety of continuing the Second Reading under certain circumstances; secondly, the action of the Government with regard to the legislation; and thirdly, what could be an acceptable policy for the transport industry.

      <P>I am afraid like the Great Southern Railways I was running a little late.  Before the adjournment, I pointed out that I considered there was no justification for making a free gift of a large sum of the money of the people to the owners of railway stock.  I expressed my sympathy with those persons whose moneys were invested in an undertaking which has turned out to be insolvent, but I have no sympathy at all with the persons who have been speculating and gambling in these shares, and who have become owners of shares that are going to be bought up by the State at a <Col N="1967" /> price far in excess of their true value. In so far as that goes, I have dealt with a considerable portion of this sum of £16,000,000, which is to be handed over to this new body.  What is going to be done with the balance, a very large number of millions or a comparatively small number of millions?  I am not quite sure of the amount, but it is certainly a sum running into many millions.  What is going to be done with that sum?  The Minister has not given us the slightest indication how that sum was arrived at or how it is to be spent.  It would seem to me that if an ordinary company were going to float debentures and issued a prospectus, they would tell every prospective buyer how it was proposed that the money would be spent.  They would tell the value of their property, and how it would be enhanced by the new amount of money which was going to be put into the coffers of the company by reason of the floating of these debentures.  If a company sent out a prospectus saying that they wished to raise £4,000,000, £5,000,000 or £6,000,000, but were going to keep a dead secret how the money was going to be spent, I think they would have a very poor chance of raising it in the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But the Minister comes to this House and asks us to vote away the moneys of the people of this State without telling us how these moneys are to be expended, and without giving us the slightest indication of how this sum of £16,000,000 was arrived at.  Has somebody worked out a scheme and handed it to the Minister?  Does the Minister approve of that scheme?  If he does, why does he not let the House have it? What is the reason for the secrecy? Has the Minister consulted a single expert?  We do not know.  As far as we can gather not a single railway expert has been consulted about this scheme.  Yet we are asked to guarantee the interest.  That is the same as giving the amount we are asked to put at the disposal of the new company&mdash; an immense sum&mdash;without knowing how the company are going to spend it.  Has anybody calculated what amount will really be needed?  It seems to me to be a very curious method of <Col N="1968" /> doing business.  It certainly does not commend itself to me.  I do not think it will commend itself to any member of the House who as a trustee of public funds recognises his responsibility for the welfare of the people.</P>
    <P>We have no idea if any scheme has been worked out, and the Minister will not tell us.  Surely, before bringing a Bill of this kind before the House he ought to be in a position to say: &ldquo;I have got experts to examine this matter and to tell me what ought to be done; they have told me what it will cost to have the things which ought to be done carried into effect.&rdquo; The Minister, however, has done nothing of the kind.  We are simply taking a leap in the dark, giving to an unknown body a guarantee of what is, considering the resources of the State, an immense sum of money.  We have not been told how a single penny of that money is going to be spent.  We have a certain amount of indication that lines may be doubled and that new carriages may be required.  One of the lines, I think, mentioned by the Minister was the line from Dublin to Cork.</P>

      <P>Is it proposed to double that line?  Surely, that is a matter that ought to have been taken into consideration before any sum was arrived at.  Can we be told how much money it is proposed to spend on the railways, on the buses and on other means of road transport? We are not told.  We are left entirely in the dark.  What we are being asked to do is to put an enormous sum of money at the disposal of somebody who, for practical purposes, is uncontrolled. We do not even know who that somebody is&mdash;an absolute dictator. I frankly confess that Deputy Donnellan took my breath away.  Does Deputy Donnellan think that the person, whom the ordinary individual considers will be a dictator, will not be a dictator at all, but will be the mere puppet of whatever Minister is in power?  I see nothing in the Bill to justify that.  I would very much prefer if there was a great deal more Parliamentary <Col N="1969" /> control.  In fact, I wish to see a great deal more Parliamentary control than there is over this body.</P>

      <P>As far as I see, for practical purposes there is none.  I do not think I need follow Deputy Donnellan any further.  His argument did not appeal to me, nor do I suppose it appealed to many other people.  The Minister says that there is no alternative except nationalisation or some such scheme as this. I am willing to accept that.  I am as strong a believer in individual effort as any person could be.  I understand there are occasions when one discovers that private enterprise has broken down, when the State must come in.  I believe in private enterprise in preference to State control whenever there is a choice to be made between them.  But when there is no real private enterprise that can be successful&mdash;and this Bill is not private enterprise&mdash;then I think that State control is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to point out to the Minister, if he is not already aware of it, that State control of Irish railways is not by any means a new idea.  Like other members of the House, I have not had the opportunity of thinking over this Bill and refreshing my memory upon certain matters which I should like to bring before the House.  Therefore, in what I have to say I must trust to recollection. Owing to the insane rushing of this Bill, I have not, as I have said, had an opportunity of refreshing my memory.  I do, however, remember that in or about the year 1836 a Railway Commission was set up by the British House of Commons.  The recommendation made by that commission was, that the Irish railways, owing to the condition of Ireland&mdash;distinct and different from the conditions in Great Britain&mdash;should be State constructed and State controlled.  The House of Commons did not carry out that recommendation.  That was at the time when the doctrine of <i>laissez faire</i> was growing in England.  At the time when the doctrine of <i>laissez faire</i> was at its height, when it was a sort of <Col N="1970" /> gospel in Great Britain that nobody could challenge, and when the Marquis of Hartington, afterwards Duke of Devonshire, was Chief Secretary in this country&mdash;about 1872 or 1873&mdash;he made certain recommendations to Mr. Gladstone, then Prime Minister, for the betterment of the affairs of this country.  His chief recommendation was that the Irish railways were giving bad service, and that they should be nationalised.  Therefore, in the very height of the doctrine of <i>laissez faire</i> a Liberal Chief Secretary considered that <i>laissez faire</i> must be departed from, that private enterprise had failed and that the nationalisation of the railways must come in.  Therefore, I say that the nationalisation of railways in this country cannot be regarded as a step towards socialism or anything of that kind.  It is one of those exceptions to private enterprise that the nature of the thing demands, because private enterprise has not been successful, and probably from the nature of things can never be successful in giving a cheap and adequate railway service here.</P>
    <P>The Minister started off with the assumption that everything was perfect, that the railway system in this country was a magnificent system until road transport came in.  That seems to be his fundamental proposition.  It was the other way about.  The railways never at any time gave the people of this country an adequate cheap service.  If the Minister is interested in railway history and goes back through numbers of an old magazine called the <i>New Ireland Review</i>, which was edited by the Rev. T.A. Finlay, S.J., he will find a series of articles upon what was called &ldquo;The Vampire System of Irish Railways&rdquo;, written by Mr. Moran, who afterwards founded <i>The Leader.</i>  I read the articles as they came out, and at that time Mr. Moran seemed to me to make out the case that the Irish railway system was strangling agriculture and industry in this country.  In consequence it follows that the Minister's fundamental assumption against nationalisation&mdash;that private enterprise was a success until road transport injured it&mdash;is a completely unjustifiable assumption.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1971" /> What are the Minister's arguments against the nationalisation of the railways? The Minister is a very well trained debater.  He is an expert rhetorician.  There are few more expert in the House.  When the Minister sets word against word and sets up one argument against nationalisation and a second argument to destroy his first, then, competent rhetorician that he is, he must be conscious that he has an extremely bad case.  Take his two main arguments against nationalisation of the railways&mdash;that there will be demands from this, that and the other place for increased services and reduced rates, and that no Minister or Deputy will be able to hold his seat unless he accedes to those demands, no matter how outrageous they may be.  Let us assume that there will be these outrageous demands and that there will be these unconscientious Deputies and weak-kneed Ministers, for all time in this country.  Then let us take the other side put by the Minister&mdash;the Minister for Finance, he tells us, finding it very hard to balance his Budget, will go in, to use his own phrase, for a system of rapacious profit-making.  How does the Minister square the two?  On the one side, we have a Government that will accede to every request, reasonable or unreasonable, and on the other side, there is a rapacious Minister making most unreasonable charges.  Is not one argument swallowing up the other? On which of them does the Minister rely?  Does he believe the future will show the weak-kneed Minister or the rapacious Minister?  A man cannot be weak-kneed and rapacious at the same time, nor can he carry out a weak-kneed policy and a rapacious policy at the same time.</P>
    <P>There are many points in this Bill which are more suited to discussion on the Committee Stage than at the present moment.  I have kept very strictly to the main principles which are embodied in this Bill.  I submit to the House that, in every way, a new departure is being made and that no justification for that new departure has been given to the House by the Minister.  We do not know what it is <Col N="1972" /> proposed to do.  Is it proposed to set up a new body, on which all except one will be figureheads?  We do not know whether, if so, that one will be a wise man or an unwise man, whether he will be above suspicion or subject to suspicion, whether he will be trained or not in railway services.  We know nothing about him, and we know nothing about the policy which is to be put into effect.</P>
    <P>We are giving away to owners of a bankrupt concern a free gift of millions of pounds of the people's money, and we are turning aside and rendering impossible the true cure for Irish transport&mdash;which, in my belief, is nationalisation.  This is not a step towards nationalisation, as some Deputies seem to think.  It is a step retarding nationalisation and putting it further off.</P>
    <P>There is one last consideration I wish to put before the House.  Is this just the time in which it is wise to tie ourselves down to enormous expenditure in transport?  Transport will change enormously within the next few years, but how far it will change no man living can tell.  We do know there has been an enormous improvement in road transport where large lorries are concerned.  We do know&mdash; what is more important still&mdash;that there has been an enormous development in flying.  Surely, if one were to prophesy regarding the next five or six years, one might say that nobody who now is called a first-class passenger, will go from Dublin to Cork, Dublin to Galway or Dublin to Belfast otherwise than by air?  As far as one can possibly judge in these progressive times, air transport in large countries is a certainty and, even in a small country like this, it seems highly probable that there will be a tremendous amount of air transport.</P>
    <P>I read an account in a paper the other day&mdash;though I cannot say how far it was accurate&mdash;of a small modern aeroplane which can rise out of a field approximately the size of this chamber and descend into the same space and which will cost only a few hundred pounds.  We are told that these machines are not a dream, but are <Col N="1973" /> actually flying in the United States at the present moment, being used there for war purposes.  If that is correct, there will be an immense amount of flying after the war, not merely for long distances but over short distances like Dublin to Cork and Dublin to Galway.</P>
    <P>There will be a good deal of through carriage by air from various places to different markets and, in that way, the air may revolutionise a great deal of our farming system.  There could be, for instance, on the west and southwest coasts, where our climate is good, places where there are early vegetables and flowers, articles which are in terrific demand in England, and if they could be carried straight away at a cheap rate by air, say, from Glengariff to Covent Garden, there would be a very considerable divergence in traffic from our railways.  How far air transport will be the method of the future, I do not know, but I do know this much, that a Minister who laughs at it and who thinks that it cannot develop to that stage, is a Minister who is not capable of grasping the real problem of transport after the war.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that before we enter into the discussion of this legislation, those of us who are concerned with public probity are compelled to express our point of view and to join in the protest that is embodied in the amendment introduced to-day.  I notice that the Minister, in the course of his speech, was very definite in stating that the legislation before the House is not only not of a temporary character, but embodies almost all that the Government have in mind with regard to transport legislation for the immediate future and the post-war period.  If that is so, regardless of what may be the approaches that the different Parties in the House may make to any proposals, surely there is everything to be said for these proposals being discussed in an atmosphere that is removed from all forms of contention, from anything that may distract Deputies or debar the legislation from being considered and judged on its merits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who move among the public <Col N="1974" /> must of necessity agree that to try to get such calm and collected discussion in the present circumstances is almost impossible.  I say it is unfair to expect it from Deputies, and while we may agree that this House is not bound by public opinion and is free to decide its own course, there is another factor that we should bear in mind.  Right over different portions of the world in the past few years legislative chambers have fallen into disrepute and the ordinary parliamentary system of government has in many cases been overthrown.  One of the reasons why that change took place was because between the parliamentary bodies, the legislative chambers, and the mass of the citizens of these countries, a gap was allowed to broaden until finally it could not be bridged.  One of the causes that bring about such a gulf between the citizens and the legislative bodies is a feeling on the part of the citizens that at critical times their ideas and thoughts of what is a proper and suitable way to deal with legislation are being ignored.</P>
    <P>I submit that outside the House the activities of a body set up by this House are the subject of keen concern and interest to every public-minded citizen.  It is not a question of what is transpiring in the proceedings of that body or what may come before it or come out of it.  Undoubtedly the ordinary citizen concerned with the problem of transport in this country is of the opinion that the time is not now opportune to deal with these legislative proposals and that it would be much better to delay consideration of this measure for a little while.  I think it is not only unfortunate from the point of view of the standing and the probity of the House and its good influence over the citizens of this country, but it is a mistake of the highest order that we should be asked to proceed with the Second Reading of this Bill.</P>
    <P>A number of points have been dealt with already by those who have spoken.  One point occurs to me, and it seems a vital one.  The railway service is supposed to be owned by those who hold the various stocks and shares.  We are continually being told that any company established under <Col N="1975" /> the present system of stocks and shares has a widespread ownership and that a great number of the smaller investors are the real owners of those concerns.  Anyone who has gone to the trouble of inquiring into that position knows that it is not correct; that for all practical purposes these companies are owned by a very small group, controlled by a very small group, whose actual holdings of stocks and shares may not in any way represent the bulk of the total issue.  I think that position applies particularly to the railway system and it is not impossible that those who are, in fact, the owners of the railway company, may be among those who will have to answer questions in another place.</P>
    <P>We do not know what will be the outcome of that inquiry, but it is not unreasonable to believe or to fear that, as part of the proposals that the Minister asks us to endorse here, it may be that we will be required to hand over public money to persons who have been, if you like, the subject of censure elsewhere.  If such a position were to come about, I do not think any member of the House could excuse himself for having failed to foresee that possibility, that we would have taken from the citizens a large capital sum which we may have to meet in certain eventualities, a recurring annual charge, and handed it over to persons found not to be following the strict course of conduct that is required.  I do not want to go further along that line, but that alone should be sufficient to convince any member of the House who is exercising ordinary free, independent judgment, that we should pause here for a period and allow ourselves to approach these proposals, not only in a calm atmosphere, but from the angle that we should know whatever conclusion we will reach will not be prejudiced by later developments arising out of what may transpire outside the House.  From that point of view I think it is good policy, apart from the standpoint of the political Parties to the proposals, to agree that we should postpone the Second Reading of this Bill.</P>
    <P>So far as the Government's proposals <Col N="1976" /> are concerned, I listened very attentively to the Minister's statement, and, as Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney says&mdash; and he is experienced in debate&mdash;I do not think the Minister was ever in a more difficult position than he was to-day. I have listened to many speeches here that have been illogical, ill-considered and ill-thought-out, but I do not think I ever listened to a speech that was so illogical as the Minister's to-day.  Practically every point he made he contradicted later; every case he built up he later knocked down.  He did not know what he believed in, what he wanted, or what he would like the House to adopt.  He proceeded on a certain number of assumptions.</P>
    <P>He set forth what he believed should be the aims of the transport system.  I do not think anybody will quarrel with him on the aims he set out, but when it comes to prescribing and setting up the machinery by which we are to realise those aims, then his difficulties begin.</P>
    <P>First of all, he has the major difficulty that he has had completely to change his own policy; that what he stood for some years ago he has to repudiate now.  It is quite possible that wisdom has grown with years and experience and the responsibility of office.  Nobody will deny that the Minister has a right to change his mind; but it is not sufficient merely to change your mind; you have also to justify that change.  So far there has been no justification put forward by the Minister as to why, in 1931, he could stand over a system of public ownership of the transport system of this country, and, in 1944, he is not only prepared, but is the main party to handing over this transport system to a group who are determined not only to obtain control of what they have got, but to secure and so entrench themselves in control that they will own and dictate the course of the lifestream of the people of this country, because that is what transport is.</P>
    <P>We have not to look at this matter solely as a question of legislation from the ordinary point of view of who owns and controls, and who is to reap the benefit of this legislation, not only for to-day, but for years to come, but, in <Col N="1977" /> effect, when this legislation becomes law, who are to be the prime owners. Is it to be the citizens of the country as a whole?  Is it the very large industrial groups, the agricultural population, the mass of citizens who rely on transport for their own personal needs, or some small group who have already secured a monopoly of one vital system in the City of Dublin and openly bled it at an almost unheard of rate for the last four years, and now want to add another national system to their monopoly?  Is it to be a group that, through their financial and interlocking directorates in different companies, control not only the financial life, but, not satisfied with that, now want to control the basic transport of the country, and to control it, not on the basis of what they themselves put into it, but on the basis of what the citizens are to give them out of their pockets?</P>
    <P>These are the things which we have to consider and which the Minister has side-stepped.  He says that the railways are the kernel of the transport system. I do not know how far we can accept that statement from him when we realise that during an emergency period when everybody recognises&mdash; some of us may have been a little late in doing so&mdash;that railways were so essential to the community and when they fall into such a crisis that immediate action has to be taken, the man who is put in charge of them is not a railwayman but a roadman, a man who, as far as I know, has never expressed any great sympathy with or appreciation of the railway system.  I am not going to be put off by the suggestion that within this legislation there is no indication of who is to be the chairman.  We all know who is to be the chairman and that he is to be the same individual who has neither railway experience nor sympathy with or appreciation of what railways mean in the life of the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us that one of the reasons for the difficulties experienced by the railways during the last year or two is that the legislation provided by the Government in past years to enable them to overcome the various new forms of competition, was not availed <Col N="1978" /> of by those who were running the railways and so he proposes to give them new legislation.  I wonder what guarantee he has that, even now, they will avail of these opportunities, because we are not installing in the railways a new management.  All we are doing is covering up the old dead hand which has controlled the railways for the past 20 or 30 years, and it is quite possible that, just as they failed in the past to avail of the opportunities, so also will they continue to fail in the future. Those who have proved to be repeated failures year after year, in the Minister's own words, are hardly the people who are now justified in coming along and telling us: &ldquo;If you will only pass new legislation and give us a new chairman and a guarantee of £16,000,000 of public money and £500,000 a year to pay interest, we can put the railways on their feet.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister also told us that one of the reasons why he is not in favour of nationalisation is that, under his proposed system, those in charge of the railways will be left on their own to run their own business as they think best; that there will be no interference by the State.  These two part-time directors who represent the private owners of the company will have that peculiar ability to apply themselves to increasing and enforcing the efficiency of the system, to see that there is no mal-administration and, like all good private business people, will bring about efficiency by the ordinary business methods which a State official is incapable of.  I wonder why they have not done it before.  Nobody interfered with them.  The result, however, is that the running stock is obsolete, the equipment useless, and the whole thing is bankrupt.  Yet we expect that because we pass another Bill to give them a little blood transfusion with our money, they will change their character overnight and become capable administrators. Possibly a miracle is to be worked by the chairman.  All the faults and the bad features of the old directors are to be miraculously changed because a certain individual becomes chairman for the future.  Peculiarly enough, in the other monopoly that was given by virtue of this Government's legislation nothing has happened to <Col N="1979" /> make that efficient except one thing, that we have an emergency and, because of that emergency, we have peculiar conditions owing to which this local monopoly has been able to earn profits that it was not capable of earning in the years before.  Probably, when we have peace again and are back to normal times, those who think there will be a great surplus to take over from the Dublin Transport Company in order to give a further blood transfusion to the railway system, will be disappointed, because I doubt if Dublin citizens will continue to put up with the present transport system and continue to pay the outrageous fares they are called upon to pay at present, so that there will be very little, if any, contribution to come when the shareholders of the Dublin Transport Company receive their ordinary 3 or 4 per cent.</P>
    <P>Another point with which the Minister makes great play is that he does not like nationalisation because it involves subsidies.  It may be that my understanding of the English language is different from the Minister's, but I take it that a subsidy is any form of money given by the State to any particular undertaking to enable it to meet its particular difficulties.  We say that we are guaranteeing to this company that if, in certain eventualities, they are not able to meet interest at the rate of £500,000 a year they can call upon the Minister for Finance and he will be obliged to pay up what is required.</P>
    <P>Maybe that is not a subsidy.  But I am quite sure that those who are going to receive the 3 per cent. will not be very much concerned with whether we call it a subsidy or not, so long as the money is forthcoming. In addition, we are also prepared, in the event of disaster coming upon the company, to provide another £16,000,000 if those who may invest their money in the company are disappointed and find that the company cannot carry on.</P>
    <P>It seems to me, if we are to enter into commitments like that, it would <Col N="1980" /> be better if we were quite honest about the thing and said openly that we are subsidising this company and making very sure that the subsidies are to be utilised for supplying the transport needs of the country and are to be under the most strict control of the State and the particular bodies over which it has power.  But, because the Minister says that nationalisation means subsidies, therefore nationalisation stands condemned. Yet, the whole basis of his Bill, the whole new feature it introduces, outside of certain changes in regard to the board of directors, is the subsidising of this company in the most wholesale fashion and in a form that not only calls upon the State to provide the public money but, when the public money is provided, those who represent the State, the legislative Chambers, have no further say in the control of the company.  That is a subsidy, not in the form of nationalisation, but in the form of loot for those who are not prepared to put their own money into the undertaking without a State guarantee.</P>
    <P>Neither does the Minister like nationalisation because it implies politics.  I wonder what kind of politics and what kind of political pressure brought about this Bill?  The Minister tells us that if we had nationalisation, it would mean that we would have workers on the railways forming a group to bring pressure to further their own particular interests, and sections of traders forming another group to further their interests and to bring pressure to bear on the Minister and the legislative Chamber.  All of these groups would be working against the public interest and creating difficulties for the efficient running of the railway system.  It seems to me that we have a fairly good example of what pressure by a group does at present.  That group is not a large group such as might be made up of the mass of railway workers, of traders, or the industrial or agricultural sections of the community, but a small, very confined and very exclusive group whose numbers are not in any way excessive, but whose power, <Col N="1981" /> not only financial but political, seems to be quite unlimited at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister thinks we should make sure that, in whatever system of transport we propose in the future, the profit motive should be subordinated to the needs of the public.  That is quite a good point&mdash;that we should subordinate the profit motive to the needs of the public, so long as we guarantee at least 3 per cent. to those who are not prepared to put their money into the undertaking unless the Government assures them that they will not lose any money on the deal. That is the only profit motive we propose to introduce.  It is a very interesting new side-light on the reason why private investors should invest their money in any form of undertaking.  So long as they have a cast-iron, 100 per cent. guarantee, the money will go in, and they are quite satisfied to be limited to 3 per cent., but, at the same time, we are to ensure that the profit motive will not interfere with public needs.  Yet, on top of that, we have to find up to 6 per cent. for the ordinary shareholders and also some unknown sum to redeem these stocks which are to be given to the other section of the stockholders.  Where the line is to be drawn between the public needs and the search for profit, I do not know, and the Minister has been very careful to leave us in the dark up to the present.</P>
    <P>He tells us that nationalised railways in other countries have not been a great success, and that there have been particular reasons in each case for their being nationalised, or built by the State directly.  One reason which he indicated was in order to keep foreign control from being extended over the transport system, and another was that private bodies were not prepared to provide the transport services which the State felt were needed.  Did he overlook the fact that here in our own country we have had a private body which, for the past 30 years, has failed to provide us with our transport needs, and which, year after year, has shown itself incapable of making a success of its job, not only on the basis of private enterprise but on the basis of almost complete and wholesale support from <Col N="1982" /> one Government after another, and of restrictions on competitive forms of transport?  Yet we are not only to continue that inefficient system of private enterprise in our railway services, to allow the same people to continue to run our transport into the ground, but we are to provide them with an additional sum from the public purse to play around with.</P>
    <P>It is not correct, as the Minister said, that all nationalised systems of railways are unprofitable, and it is not correct, either, to leave it in that bald fashion.  The people of this country would not be so much concerned with the ability of the railways to earn profits, if they got a system of transport which could, within reason, provide for the transport needs of the various walks of life, and which did not entail an undue financial strain upon the State's resources.  The question of profit is a secondary consideration. We agree, and I think the Minister agrees, that a transport company is not an ordinary profit-making concern, that it is a service in the same form as the Post Office, water supply, public health and sanitation services, and surely, if the people are satisfied that the system of transport which they have is efficient from their point of view, is a system which meets the needs of industry, agriculture and personal transport and which does not lay an undue burden on the State in the form of extra taxation, the question of profit is not very important.</P>
    <P>He seems to think, however, that because certain nationalised railways in other countries cannot show 3 per cent., 4 per cent., 5 per cent. or 6 per cent. they, therefore, stand self-condemned. The question is not one to be judged in that light.  It is a question to be solved by the citizens of these countries as to whether they are satisfied with their systems under nationalised control.  If they are satisfied, and most of them seem to be, there might be a very good headline there for us to follow, instead of looking at it from the other point of view, that because we have not got the ordinary commercial balance sheet with its declaration of dividends in relation to these <Col N="1983" /> systems, the system of nationalised transport stands self-condemned.</P>
    <P>If that argument were correct, it was equally correct in 1931.  At that time the Minister was quite eager to see a nationalised system here, but something has happened in the meantime, and what, in 1931, he was prepared to set aside as not of any great consequence becomes of overwhelming importance in 1944.  Therefore, the system which, in 1931, would meet our needs is no longer to be applicable to-day, and we have to go back to the old, out-moded, exposed and inefficient system of private enterprise, which, even in the present emergency, has been incapable of meeting the responsibility placed upon it and which has had again to be taken in hands by the State and shown, to some small degree, how it should meet its responsibilities.</P>
    <P>One peculiar thing strikes me about this Bill, and particularly the Minister's statement.  Curiously enough, many people seem to think that we have in this Bill a system of nationalisation of railways because it is fairly well dressed up, and there is a good deal of scenery gathered around it to give that impression, but it is quite clear from the Minister's statement that he has no such foolish idea.  He is quite certain that he has not brought in a system of nationalised transport. I wonder exactly to what extent he believes that himself.  We have, first, proposals to provide public moneys; we have secondly, a chairman appointed by the Minister, a chairman who has almost complete overriding powers, who, in himself, will form a quorum of the board of directors, and without whose concurrence no decision can be taken, and who is appointed for a fixed period, but who may be removed by the Minister, and, therefore, must inevitably be subject to the influence and pressure of the Minister. This chairman is the directing force in this proposed company.</P>
    <P>In addition, powers are given to the Minister to require this company to provide services here, there and everywhere, as may be decided, on the <Col N="1984" /> advice given to him by the advisory transport board.  We have everything which goes to make it nationalisation, except one thing, that is, that the fruits, if there are any, of this transport system are not to go back to the State which is prepared to provide the capital and interest, but are to be passed over to this group of private investors whose property to-day, apart from this frenzied and feverish speculation, would be worth almost nothing and whose ability to run the concern has proved to be completely bankrupt.</P>
    <P>I wonder why the Minister does not take his courage in his hands and say: &ldquo;If we are to do all these things; if we are to provide public money, guarantee interest, take over almost complete control, through the chairman, of the management of this company, then let us be quite honest and aboveboard and say that we are nationalising the company, and to the extent to which the public has to provide the moneys for this company, any return from that company should go to the relief of the public purse.&rdquo;  That would be a far more honest, a far better and a far simpler way of dealing with the problem than this involved system which is set up purely for the purpose of cloaking and covering up the fact that we are now creating a further monopoly and handing it over to the same group which at present handles the local monopoly we have created in the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>We, on these benches, are supporters of and believers in nationalisation.  I do not think that there is any great argument to be made in support of the proposal put forward by the Minister.  The very fact that he has gone to such lengths to argue against nationalisation in regard to such an enterprise as this shows that he himself is not completely satisfied.  The very fact that Deputies on various sides of this House, such as Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, who certainly could not be accused of being in favour of the policy of the Labour Party, now realises that private enterprise, in connection with such an essential factor in the nation's life as transport, is obsolete and unworkable, should be a convincing argument to the <Col N="1985" /> ordinary man or woman that nationalisation is the only remedy for the present chaotic conditions in connection with these essential services.  All the arguments that have been put forward by the Minister against nationalisation only go to show that he himself is in favour of it.  The arguments of the Minister and of some other Deputies who have spoken here were evidently designed, however, to cover up the fact that although the Minister is endeavouring to preserve or put into the Bill the essence of nationalisation, he is concealing the one essential thing, and that is that he is leaving the control of transport in this country in the hands of a group of people who have already proved themselves to be incompetent and unable to carry on without the help of the State, instead of putting our transport position into the only right position in which it should be, which is under State control.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to refer to the price that we are to pay for this.  I suppose that everybody in the House has thought over the problem and asked himself why we should be asked to pay such a large sum as £13,000,000 for a system of transport which everybody realises has been unprofitable for quite a number of years, has been bankrupt in ideas, unable to meet its commitments, and which has nothing but out-of-date and obsolete materials.  Everybody must realise that if we, or anybody else, had undertaken to buy out that company some years ago, we could probably have bought it out for £2,000,000 or £3,000,000, and that the company themselves would have considered it to be a great bargain at the time.  In that connection, it must be remembered that just a few years ago the interests of certain stockholders were wiped out at the stroke of a pen.  It is hard, therefore, to understand why the Government should be so generous in connection with the interests of the stockholders at the present time, when we remember what was done a few years ago.  Some two or three years ago the State wiped out about 90 per cent. of the private property of stockholders. Now, it seems that we are <Col N="1986" /> going to the other extreme.  It appears that now we are going to give something like £13,000,000 for property that, according to the Minister's own statement, is useless and obsolete.  During the short period since last year, when this matter was first foreshadowed, the price of railway shares has gone up by almost sixfold, and we are now to buy at the top figure.</P>
    <P>If we used ordinary common sense, such as people buying or selling shares on the market would use, surely we ought to try to get a fair price, and surely that price should be the price at which these people would value their own concern during normal years, let us say, before the war.  It is not a question of this House or any other body placing a value on the stocks and shares of any concern.  The value of stocks and shares is placed on them by ordinary commerce in the ordinary markets.  At one time, just a few years ago, the value of the shares concerned was as low as £3 10s., and now it has reached £52.  I think, therefore, that the purchase price should be based on the normal price of stocks bought before the war.  In that way we would be able to save ourselves a few million pounds and would also be able to save the State, possibly, a very considerable amount in connection with the guaranteeing of dividends.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that, not alone from the point of view of our responsibilities here as representatives of the people who elected us, but also as citizens of this country, who are pledged to guarantee the ordinary citizen in this rights and properties as a citizen of this State, we are under an obligation to reject this Bill, not only because, on the face of it, it is an outrageous piece of legislation, which is obviously designed to give the control of an essential service to a small group of people in this country at the expense of the State and of the ordinary citizens of the country as a whole, but also because the proposals contained in the Bill are self-condemned on their own face because they propose to deprive the citizens of this country of their ordinary rights to transport services, and put the transport <Col N="1987" /> service completely under the control of a company which, certainly for the past five years, has proved itself to be obsolete in its ideas, useless, and absolutely unable to continue working without help from the State.  As Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney said, we are reaching a stage now when we shall probably see grave and far-reaching changes in methods of transport. Transport services may take an entirely new form.  There is one thing, however, to which the ordinary citizen of this country is entitled, and that is that whatever system of transport is to prevail in the future, it should be a public system, exercised in the light of day under the sanction of the duly elected representatives of the people, and not under the archaic method of private control which has been proved to be a failure in connection with such essential services as transport, not alone here but in every other country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not being an expert on transport matters, I face this debate with an open mind.  I think, however, that it would be churlish on my part if I did not admit that the Minister made a strong case for the Bill.  That fact, however, does not prove that it is a good Bill.  It may only prove, perhaps, that the Minister is a very good debater.  However, with much of what the Minister said, I am in agreement. I agree that in the post-war period the needs of this country will have to be served by the most up-to-date and efficient system of transport that can be devised, but I would ask the Minister: are we wise at this moment to commit ourselves to an expenditure of over £16,000,000 of public money to bolster up public transport? We must remember that there are two systems by which goods and passengers can be transported.  There is the public transport company or privately-owned companies, and there is also the mode of conveyance provided by the individual himself.  Now, are we certain that the mode of conveyance of goods, or the mode of travelling by individuals through their own means of conveyance, will not prove to be, in the post-war period, the most efficient <Col N="1988" /> means of transport?  If it should prove to be so, then this expenditure of over £16,000,000 of public money on a public transport company will be absolutely unjustifiable.  Not only that, but we shall have to face the fact that in establishing such a company with such wide powers, and in entering into those financial commitments, we may be tying this nation down to a system of transport which may prove to be inefficient.  As a result of the passing of this Bill, we may be tying our people down to utilising a public transport company&mdash;which will now be the only transport company available &mdash;which may prove to be utterly inefficient. That, I think, is a serious objection to the Bill, because it must be remembered that we are now living in a transition period, a period when science and invention are making the most rapid progress.  As I say, it may easily become possible that the private individual, whether he be a farmer, a shop-keeper or a manufacturer, may find it more economic to convey his goods from his own factory or shop to the consumer in his own vehicles instead of using the services of a public transport company.  In the same way, the private individual may find it cheaper and more efficient to travel in his own vehicle.  If that is so, and if the privately-owned lorry or privately-owned car or plane should turn out to be the cheapest modes of transport in the future, is it not unwise to tie us down to a public transport system to the extent that is envisaged in this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect of the matter to which I should like to refer. The Minister has given very definite assurances that he will not interfere with the privately-owned lorry or car, but is it not almost an absolute certainty that any Government in the future, particularly when there is so much money guaranteed behind this proposed public transport company, will utilise all its powers to restrict any opposition or competition from private enterprises?  As the Minister himself pointed out, the privately owned lorry or car is the most serious competitor of the public transport companies.  There will be often in the <Col N="1989" /> future ways and means by which the privately-owned lorry and car might be put off or restricted in the use of the public road.  The Minister may repeat, again and again, that he does not intend to introduce legislation restricting the use of the public highways or means of conveyance, but the Minister is not the only member of the Government.  There are quite a number of ways by which the private lorry and private car can be restricted in their operations.  They can be restricted by various activities on the part of the Minister for Finance in the matter of taxation.  Here, again, the Minister for Industry and Commerce can wield his influence with the Minister for Finance to put a dangerous rival of his own company off the road.  Frequently, Ministers for Finance, when introducing their Budgets, have acknowledged that they were introducing proposals for taxation at the request of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Here, an opportunity will arise for the present Minister for Industry and Commerce or his successor to advise the Minister for Finance to restrict competition with this State-guaranteed company. Therefore, I think it is unwise to commit the State to such enormous expenditure on this public transport company at present.  I think that it is also unwise to eliminate an independent transport company which has been successfully operating in this city and merge it in the new company, thereby making the new body much more cumbersome and also increasing the commitments of the State in the matter.  My own personal opinion is that we should confine our commitment, at this particular juncture, in respect of public transport, to the minimum.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that he does not approve of the subsidisation of transport.  I think that, if he meant by that that he does not approve of utilising the ordinary revenue to bolster up public transport, the House will agree with him.  But it is possible to subsidise any company, particularly a monopoly company, without actually paying out public money to that company. A company enjoying a monopoly <Col N="1990" /> and supported by the State can extract from its customers whatever subsidy is required.  I agree with the Minister when he says that public transport ought not to be subsidised out of the public purse.  I am one of those who hold that a case can be made for subsidising production in many cases because, then, you are adding to the volume of goods produced within the State.  But it is always unwise to subsidise transport because, in that case, you are adding nothing to the volume of goods produced.  You are simply encouraging the movement of goods or of passengers as the case may be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>You can provide cheap rates for agriculture by subsidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said that there are other methods by which agriculture can be helped which would be more beneficial than the subsidising of transport.  I do not propose to go into that question very deeply at the moment, but I think it would be better to subsidise agriculture directly than to subsidise it indirectly by way of subsidising transport.  This new company, by reason of its enormous size and power, will tend to interfere in various ways with the rights of firms and individuals and with the rights and interests of districts.  Is there any provision in this Bill to safeguard the interests of people who are interfered with?  Is there any provision in this Bill for an appeal tribunal of any kind to which people who are aggrieved can apply for redress?  I have failed to find any such provision. Servants of the company may suffer loss of employment or reduction of wages or some other disadvantage. Firms may suffer disadvantage by reason of the inadequacy of the services provided by this company.  Districts may suffer disadvantage owing to the closing down of branch railways and failure to provide an adequate substitute.  There is no provision in this Bill for a tribunal to which these aggrieved people can appeal, and without such a tribunal grave injustice can be inflicted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Byrne who has the advantage, perhaps, that he brings to bear on <Col N="1991" /> most matters, not appeals to theory but actual facts relating to human beings, has brought to the notice of the House the inconvenience which travellers suffer from the fact that no bus shelters are provided in the city for people travelling long distances.  Here is a type of grievance from which the ordinary public may suffer and for which they have no redress.  He also drew attention to a grievance which the local authority might suffer by reason of the fact that they are required to provide up-to-date road services for this new transport company. He was referring to the City of Dublin but the same situation might exist, and probably will exist, in the various counties in which we shall have this public transport company availing of public roads provided by the ratepayers of the various counties.  Justice demands that this transport company must make an adequate contribution to the construction and maintenance of these roads.  If we have a system by which this public company pays an adequate contribution to the local councils by way of road tax, petrol duty or otherwise, and if it is sufficient to cover the cost of the construction and maintenance of the roads required, there will be no injustice inflicted but here, again, there is a case in which local ratepayers could possibly be wronged.</P>
    <P>While the Minister has stated that this new company will not interfere with the conveyance of goods or merchandise by private individuals, there is in one section of the Bill a provision that a restriction will be imposed where a group of individuals own a lorry for the conveyance of their collective goods.  That restriction, I think, is unjustified.  I think that if a group of farmers join together to purchase a lorry to have their farm produce conveyed to market or town, they are entitled to utilise that means of conveyance.  They will not be carrying for hire; they will be merely carrying their own goods.  The provision in this section means that they can carry only goods which were originally co-operatively owned, such as the property of co-operative societies.  I do not think <Col N="1992" /> that restriction should be imposed.  I do not think that the State should step in to prevent individual citizens from joining together to own and utilise up-to-date means of conveying their goods.</P>
    <P>The Minister, I think, has strongly condemned nationalisation, but he stated that this new company would have all the advantages of nationalisation with none of its disadvantages.  I think the contrary is true, that this new company will have all the disadvantages of nationalisation without any of its advantages.  It certainly has not the advantage that would accrue in the case of nationalisation from the fact that the public through this House would be able to express and assert their rights in the management of this company. There is no effective control, no effective means by which this House can exercise control over this company, as far as I can see, except by sacking the Minister, and I do not think that that would be the most suitable means of exercising control.  It would be a pity to dispense with a good Minister in order to get rid of a bad manager in this company.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donnellan referred to the fact that the Minister has fairly wide powers in the appointment and removal of the manager of the company. That is true, but unfortunately those powers are to a great extent restricted to the Minister.  As far as I can find in reading the Bill, there is very little opportunity for this House to exercise control over the operations of the company.  The Minister has wide powers certainly but the House, as far as I can see, has practically no power whatever and I think that is definitely a disadvantage.  It establishes a position in which the State has got to put up the money by guaranteeing money subscribed by the shareholders but the people have not the right to exercise control.  I think the Minister would be well advised, having regard to all the circumstances, to withdraw this Bill. The establishment of what is described as a dictator, over rail, road, sea and air transport at this particular moment, is inopportune particularly when we have a certain atmosphere of doubt and uncertainty regarding the manner in which the existing company has been <Col N="1993" /> managed and the entire future is in a state of complete uncertainty and doubt.  It would be, I think, in the public interest that the Minister should withdraw this Bill or set about amending it in such a way as to give the people who are directly concerned, the public, some voice in the management of this public company and, further, to restrict as far as possible, State expenditure in a venture so uncertain as this at this particular time.</P>
    <P>Further, it would be desirable, I think, that the whole system of transport should be again reconsidered. Expert opinion should be sought and the interests directly concerned throughout the country consulted.  The railway system as operated in the past was never entirely satisfactory.  The Minister referred to various Acts which were introduced to bolster it up, and there is a grave danger that in the future the new company may prove as unsatisfactory and as dangerous to the best interests of the nation as the railway companies were in the past. There is also a danger to which the Minister indirectly referred when he gave an assurance to the City of Dublin that this Transport Company would make for the prosperity and wealth of the city, inasmuch as transport was mainly the business of conveying goods to and from the City of Dublin.  I am not so sure that that should be the main function of transport in this country.  I think the main function of transport in this country should be to convey goods in whatever directions they need to be conveyed. There should not be imposed upon this nation a particular line of economic development which tends to draw everything in the country towards one particular centre, namely, the City of Dublin.  I do not think that the City of Dublin should be the hub of our entire transport system.  That is one of the reasons why I strongly urge reconsideration of the whole matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>One thing I admire in regard to this matter is the complete change of attitude on the part of all Deputies.  For the past 12 months, ever since rumours of this Bill first started in the country, there were <Col N="1994" /> various wild statements as to what the Bill would do.  Every Deputy, no matter to what Party he belongs, particularly Government Deputies, I think, had roads made to their houses by every fellow in the country owning a lorry and every merchant, saying that their lorries were going to be driven off the road, that every poor fellow working for hire would get no further opportunity of working for hire, that the Minister was going to bring in a Bill to sweep them off the road and to confine the traffic to the railway company.  This Bill has been introduced, and none of these wild things that we were told about is going to happen.  Deputy Cogan says that we want an efficient transport service in the country.  We do.  If there was anything that bore out the fact that we want an efficient transport service, it was the present emergency. Deputies who cast their minds back a very few years will remember what happened in the various country towns when everything that had to be sent to and from the towns was sent by lorry.  Then the railway company began to consider closing down branch lines and Deputies were immediately summoned by the very merchants who took their transport from the railway company and asked to get the branch line maintained even though nobody in the town was using it.  If there was anything that brought out the absolute necessity for the railway system in this country it was the present emergency. Consider the condition of affairs prevailing in the districts where branch lines were closed down.  If Deputy Cogan wants an efficient transport service, this is the only means of getting it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cogan, admitting in the first place that the rights of individual carriers are protected in the Bill, says that the Minister may do this, that and the other.  The Minister may do that at any time, even without this Bill.  Transport rights have been restricted from time to time and the rights of private carriers have been restricted, as Deputy Cogan well knows, without this Bill at all.</P>

    <P>There are a few matters in the Bill that I am anxious about.  Firstly, in <Col N="1995" /> regard to the financial provisions of the Bill, I think the first care of this House should be for the ordinary worker.  If we are going to give compensation to directors and if we are going to guarantee dividends to shareholders, we should first of all be prepared to guarantee that the position of the ordinary worker in the railway company will not be worsened.  I think it would be very unfair to see a group of directors who, by mismanagement or misfortune, are now in the position that the State has to take over from them, getting compensation while the sufferer of that mismanagement, the ordinary worker, is put out without any compensation.  I, at any rate, am far more concerned with the ordinary worker than I am with the racketeer in shares.</P>
    <P>I would also suggest that all stock that was transferred since July, 1943, should be taken over at the July, 1943, price by the Minister for Finance.  I think that would end one set of racketeers in this country.  It would give us a nice share-holding in this company.  I certainly would suggest that as a fair means.</P>
    <P>There are a few small matters that can be dealt with on Committee Stage.  There is, for instance, the question of the abolition by this Bill of the Railway Tribunal.  I have very happy memories of the Railway Tribunal.  On the only occasion when I troubled them I got complete justice and I would require to be very well satisfied in regard to what is going to replace them.  At one time, about June, 1943, the railway company introduced new rates.  In one district in my county they increased the freightage rates to the farmers by 150 to 200 per cent., and as I had to prove afterwards before the Railway Tribunal, they cost this nation between 250 and 300 tons of wheat at a period when we could very ill afford to lose any wheat by the exorbitant freightage on sea sand that was required for manuring the soil for the cultivation of wheat.  I must say that the judge on the Railway Tribunal met us very fairly and we got a reduction on that item alone of £2,800 a year as compared <Col N="1996" /> with the new freightage rate imposed by the company in June, 1943. Some steps should be taken to prevent exorbitant charges by any company that is going to have a monopoly of transport.  The action of the railway company in that matter cost this country between 250 and 300 tons of wheat at a period when we could ill afford to lose even one cwt. of wheat. I am anxious about the abolition of the Railway Tribunal.  Part IV states that the Minister may make an Order altering the classification of maximum rates, but before doing so may require publication of such proposals, so that any objections or representations may be considered.  Any proposal to alter a rate should be published in the Press so that everybody concerned would know that an alteration was about to be made.</P>

      <P>Another section states that the owner of a vehicle will have to prove that it is his property.  I am concerned about the conveyance of beet.  The sugar company owns beet from the time it is sown.  If the beet cannot be delivered to the factory it remains the property of the farmer but he will not be paid for it.  The present arrangement is that he will be committing an offence if he conveys it.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is entitled to his opinion.  When I see something in this Bill that I think is wrong I am going to speak about it so that the Minister may have it rectified.  That is part of his duty.  Is it not provided that onus of proof of ownership of a vehicle in which goods are carried <Col N="1997" /> rests on the owner of the goods?  The beet sown by farmers belongs to the sugar company, and the Civic Guard would have to be satisfied about ownership of a vehicle carrying it.  I am also concerned about the position of agents who buy wheat for millers and generally convey it to the mills. The wheat does not belong to the agents.  It belongs either to the millers or the farmers.  Advantage should be taken in this Bill to rectify certain anomalies that exist.  It is all right to say that nobody will bother about these things, but farmers want to know their position.  They do not want favours.  They want justice. This is the time to draw attention to matters that Deputies consider require explanation.  This Bill, in my opinion, is necessary, but there are points raised by it that I am anxious the Minister would take the opportunity to deal with.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  If the Deputy has anything to say about the Bill I will be very glad to hear him. I want to know if the position of workers is going to be worsened by the passing of this Bill.  In my view, the ordinary workers should be the first care of any legislation and the 3 per cent. should go as compensation to the workers rather than to the shareholders.  It is the duty of the State to protect the workers and that is provided for in the Constitution.</P>

      <P>As usual Deputy Corry tried to make the best case with the greatest number of words, so that he can go around the country later and tell the boys how he stood up to the Minister when dealing with this Bill.  He talked about the Constitution and the workers.  That was not a bad line.  He is also going to do away with racketeers and he wants the Department of Finance to take over the railway shares at the price at which they stood some years ago.  The Deputy can deal with matters very simply when he wants to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1998" /> Deputy Corry comes in here and makes a half-hearted speech attacking his own Minister.  He will cut that bit out of the Official Report and show it to the boys down the country so that they will be able to say what a great fellow he was, standing up to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. If Deputy Corry wants to deal honestly with the position of the workers let him put down an amendment proposing to delete the provision for compensation to the directors; let him put down another amendment fixing a certain sum to go to the payment of compensation to the workers, and a third amendment calling on the Minister for Finance to take over these railway shares at their quoted price on the 1st July, 1943.  If Deputy Corry is prepared to do that, then it could be said that there was some merit in his argument, but unless he is prepared to do that, how can it be said that there is any merit at all in it?  He opened his speech by saying that people on this side of the House had criticised lightly the provisions in the Bill which, according to him, are going to wipe out private transport and licensed hauliers.  Possibly it was a very good job for everyone in this country that at one period some members of the House did make themselves vocal about the abolition of private transport.  Maybe it was well that was done before this Bill came on.  One objection that I have to this Bill is that it is not going to deal with transport at all.  Looking at transport in a national way, this Bill might as well never have been brought in. First of all, it does not go half far enough, and, in my opinion, it is merely another attempt to bolster up the Great Southern Railways Company. The Minister said that at one period the railway company suffered severely from what he described as unfair competition.  That was one of the reasons he said why the railways got into a bad state.  But I put it to the Minister that there is absolutely no provision in his Bill to prevent any type of unfair competition against the new company except perhaps the things that the Minister has already the power to do under present legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1999" /> The State is being asked to guarantee a very considerable sum of money for the issue of debenture stock in this new company.  Roughly, a sum of £13,500,000 will go into the taking over of the stocks that are already in the hands of certain people.  The balance of £6,500,000 will deal with what I would consider ought to be the most important thing for the new company, and that is the re-equipment and reorganisation of the system.  I understand that, at the moment, the Great Southern Railways are in a very bad state as regards rolling stock, equipment, permanent way and other classes of material necessary for the carrying on of the business of the company. It is perfectly obvious that if that situation is going to be dealt with in a big way before the end of the war, or immediately after the end of the war, the handing over of that sum of money in the way outlined will not do at all.  There are a lot of people who do not like the sound of the word &ldquo;nationalisation.&rdquo; They forget that we have nationalised many things in this country but under another name.  If the intention of the Bill be to deal with transport matters sectionally, then for my part I would prefer to have nationalisation.  I would prefer that to the guaranteeing by the State of vast sums of money for debenture stocks in what is going to continue to be, to all intents and purposes, a private company.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry's argument about the shareholders of the company was very cheap.  At the moment there is a lot of public uneasiness and public comment about the stock market transactions in Great Southern Railways shares, and of the sudden rise in the price of them last year.  It ought not to be forgotten that a big number of people in this country who are not by any means well off, a number of widows and orphans who had small amounts of money, have all their savings invested in these railway stocks.  It should be remembered, too, that at one period this stock was a trustee stock.  That was the case 30 and 40 years ago, but, due to mishandling by the railway company, and to legislation passed by this House, the capital of the people that <Col N="2000" /> I speak of, which was invested in the company, was reduced to a point where it was not worth the paper it was written on.  Whatever was the cause of the operations on the stock market in these shares, at any rate the poor people who are the owners of that stock got a chance, to use Deputy Corry's phrase, of getting a bit of their own back.  I wonder do Deputies realise that, 30 or 40 years ago, investors in big public concerns regarded these railway stocks as an ideal investment. They were looked upon as being most secure by the small investor in this country.</P>
    <P>Listening to Deputy Corry, and the language he used, one would imagine that investors in Great Southern Railways stocks were millionaires.  The fact is that the bulk of them were people who had saved a couple of hundred pounds which they put into these stocks at a time when they were regarded as equal to, if not better than, Government stock as a security. It should not be forgotten either that various national and political incidents that happened in this country did not help the Great Southern Railways.  For a considerable time the railways were on the downward trend, due in part to competition from road transport&mdash; passenger and freight carrying.  Then there was mismanagement, indeed one might say lazy management.  During all this period the railways company remained asleep.  All that contributed to the wiping out of the little capital belonging to the people that I speak about&mdash;the small investor.  And, on top of all that, there was the legislation passed by this House, particularly as it affected the ordinary shareholders. Under that legislation they were almost completely wiped out, the nominal value of the ordinary stock being reduced from £100 to £10.  Does Deputy Corry seriously suggest that this House would be justified in taking over the holdings in railway stock of those people at whatever figure they stood at on a particular date?  Is that what he suggests, that their little investments in Great Southern Railways should be taken from them?  Why should those poor people be wiped out now, especially if this Bill is going to re-establish the railways and make railway <Col N="2001" /> traffic in this country a paying proposition, and if it is going to be a solution of the country's transport difficulties?  Those small shareholders have been suffering losses for the last 20 or 30 years.  They have seen their capital reduced by 90 per cent.  They have not seen a dividend for the last 16 or 17 years.  Why should Deputy Corry seek to have them completely wiped out now?</P>

      <P>If Deputy Corry had suggested that steps should be taken to check over the stock books and only give the &ldquo;knock out&rdquo; to the people who bought these stocks when there was the sudden rise in their price last year, there might be some sense in what he said.</P>

      <P>If that is Deputy Corry's view, then I invite him to put down an amendment to that effect, and we can have the matter thrashed out in Committee.  I put it to the House that Deputy Corry's statement on this particular subject justifies the motion to this Bill which has been tabled by this Party.  If Deputy Corry is as uneasy in his mind as he pretends to be about the operations of the racketeers on the stock market, as he has described them, then I put to him that he ought to vote for this motion to postpone the Second Reading of this Bill until the tribunal that has been set up has made its report.</P>

He wants to tell everybody <Col N="2002" /> how anxious he is about the ordinary workers on the railways, that he is the one man in Dáil Éireann who is going to nail the racketeers, that he is the one man who had the pluck to tell the Minister where he gets off and how to deal with the racketeers.  But in spite of all that, Deputy Corry does not want to wait for the report of the tribunal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious that you were never trained.  The Deputy made a bold statement about the amendment which it is proposed to make to the Road Transport Act of 1933.  This part of the Bill deals with merchandise road transport.  It was no wonder that the Minister laughed at Deputy Corry's interpretation of the words &ldquo;own goods&rdquo; in the new section.  The Deputy said that he wanted certain anomalies wiped out that exist in the Road Transport Act of 1933 and the Road Traffic Act.  Under the present legislation it is impossible, as we all know, to get a conviction in the courts against the private lorry owner, because he can always make the defence that the goods he is carrying are his own.  If he is found on the road with a load of stuff and a Guard questions him, and if he says the goods are his own, that is a good defence.  Deputy Corry wants that sort of thing to continue. Does the Deputy seriously suggest that the licensed haulier established under the 1933 Act, and who because of that has to pay extra tax and insurance, is not entitled to be protected against the fellow who is ostensibly carrying on as a private owner, but who, in fact, is taking work from the licensed haulier as well as from the railways?  These private owners have been taking business from the licensed hauliers which the latter were legally and morally entitled to. It was that kind of unfair competition that did a lot of damage to the railways and to licensed hauliers.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
