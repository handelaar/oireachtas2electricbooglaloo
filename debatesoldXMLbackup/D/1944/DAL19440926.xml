      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the sub-committee set up by the Cabinet to consider post-war plans has given special consideration to the problems which will arise on the return of thousands of Irish men and women now engaged in war work in Great Britain; and if adequate plans are being made to provide returning emigrants with work and homes.</P>

      <P>As I stated in reply to a Parliamentary question addressed to me by Deputy Martin O'Sullivan on the 19th instant, the Cabinet Committee which was set up to direct the post-war planning activities of all Departments has approved in principle a large number of schemes.  One of the main objects in view in the preparation of all these schemes is the provision of employment and housing which will be available for all our citizens whether they have remained at home during the emergency or return home after it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not proposed to make separate provision for those who have emigrated during the emergency and who may return later&mdash;as such&mdash;but as I stated on the 19th instant, special attention is being given to the planning of works with a high employment content for the larger urban areas and for those rural areas which experience has shown to be most likely to need works of this kind, and it is from these areas <Col N="1926" /> that a high proportion of those who have emigrated in recent years have gone.</P>

      <P>The Government have this matter under active consideration and are in touch with the Vatican authorities and with the Irish Red Cross in regard to it. The Red Cross are about to send an initial consignment of foodstuffs for distribution.  Although the difficulties created by the war restrictions are very great, it is hoped to arrange for further consignments at an early date. The Deputy may feel assured that the Government are prepared to help in every way possible.</P>

As the Deputy is aware the whole question of emigration is under constant review in order to meet the requirements of changing circumstances.  In June last the Government, as a result of extensive emigration during the past four and a <Col N="1937" /> half years, decided that it was necessary to take special steps to ensure that the supply of labour in this country for essential services would not become endangered.  To this end an embargo was placed on the emigration of men from rural areas and towns with a population of 5,000 or under, to the exclusion of migratory workers and members of the professions, and I do not propose to seek exemption from that regulation in respect of any other class of worker.</P>

      <P>The number of civilian employees at the Curragh Camp whose services have been terminated since the 1st January, 1944, is 77.  Owing to the difficulty experienced in obtaining materials for building and maintenance purposes there was not sufficient employment on hands to justify the retention of a large number of these employees.  Suitable alternative work was not available.  Other reasons which led to termination of service in a lesser number of cases included such grounds as unsatisfactory performance of duty, dishonesty and resignation at own request.</P>

      <P>If that is so, something will have to be said on amendment No. 22.  A case was made by Deputy McGilligan, when he moved amendment No. 22, for allowing somebody, such as the High Court, to decide what equivalent amount of stock in the new company would be granted to holders of stock in the two dissolved <Col N="1953" /> companies.  I put it in a different way previously, and the House, in considering this matter, should keep before it the fact that we are concerned in the first place with justice to the country as a whole, from the point of view of national economy, as well as the burdens that the upkeep of our transport system will impose upon it; and in the second place, we are concerned to do justice to people who already had capital in the companies.  The proposal is to give an amount of stock in the new company of equivalent nominal value to what stockholders held in the old Great Southern Railways. From our point of view, we should not be asked to decide in the way suggested.  I take it that Deputies have had before them the report of the inquiry into railway stocks.  As pointed out that report showed how the Ministerial, and the Departmental view, and how the mind of the chairman was developing since February of last year.  On page 25 of the report it is shown that the chairman of the Great Southern Railways in February, 1943, considered that a proposal might be made to form a statutory company with a capital of not more than £10,000,000, to take over the stock of the Great Southern Railways stockholders.  A point arises on that on which we would like to get some information from the Minister.  The White Paper circulated, and the facts before us, indicate that the stock being substituted in connection with the Great Southern Railways represents £11,547,290.  That is what we infer from the statements published and from the figures given at the tribunal of inquiry into public transport in 1939. On page 25 and also on page 61 of the report of the inquiry into the stock there is a suggestion that the total amount of capital in the Great Southern Railways was £12,691,451.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be advisable to know that the explanation is, as to the difference between £11,547,290 and £12,691,451; whether the stockholders we are dealing with hold stock of the nominal value of £11,547,290 or £12,691,451 which the chairman said in February, 1943, should be purchased for £10,000,000.  At the end of the <Col N="1954" /> month the Minister's outlook was that the £10,000,000 in the statutory company, formed in the way suggested, should buy up and take over not only the whole capital of the Great Southern Railways, but also the whole capital of the Dublin Transport Company. That is one point which shows that Departmentally there was an outlook which inevitably indicated compulsory conversion.  The secretary of the Department went through the process of submitting to the Minister certain calculations based on market quotations designed to bring the new capital within the range of £10,000,000. In 1943 it was still Departmentally considered that £10,000,000 of the new statutory company should be utilised to buy up the shares of the Great Southern Railways, if not of the Dublin United Transport Company.  From what appears on page 27 of the report, I think it was intended at the same time to take up the stock of the Dublin United Transport Company inside the amount mentioned.  It was only in September that we came across the Minister's present proposal.  It is not clear yet if the Government accepted that proposal wholeheartedly, or if they did not accept it, had no objection to it.  The Minister has commented on that.</P>
    <P>I think the picture given of what was in the Minister's mind warrants our getting a much more satisfactory explanation as to why the House is asked, without substantial details or plans being before it, to give the stockholders substituted capital of the full nominal value of that in the Great Southern Railways, and increased value for what is in the Dublin Transport Company.  We are going to be asked to bear a big amount of the capital in this new company that we should not be asked to bear.  We are going to be asked to bear it in a way that seems to suggest that the whole of it will be given in cash or in some other way to the stockholders by 1960.  The matter has been brought before the House in such a way that an enormous amount of capital was to be repaid to holders of debentures, and to those who gave overdrafts as a result of the excessive charges that were taken from <Col N="1955" /> the users of Dublin transport in the last few years.  The chairman of the company indicated to the Department, according to what appears on page 28 of the report of the tribunal into stock transactions, that he hoped to redeem the substituted stock out of revenue &ldquo;as he had been able to do in the case of the Dublin United Transport Company owing to the economics effected by reorganisation.&rdquo;  Whatever part the economics effected by reorganisation may have played in enabling the chairman to repay capital in the case of the Dublin Transport Company is not quite clear, but a picture is given of the way in which economics are going to be brought about in the general railway position, to enable the new company to repay £9,000,000 of substituted debentures between now and 1960.</P>
    <P>This country has missed very substantial opportunities of getting a decent start since the last war.  After the last war, instead of being able to settle down to our business and to organise the whole energies of our people and our industries with good administration we had a struggle against military oppression from 1918 to 1921.  In 1922 and 1923 we had a struggle against internal strife and from that period until recent years the political situation was such that the energies of our people could not be concentrated in a unified way on the work of the country.  In 1932, when the world was beginning to recover from the great depression of 1929-1932, we had again political difficulties of one kind or another which prevented us, in the first place, from making a proper start and, in the second place, from taking advantage of the rising condition of world economy from 1933 on.</P>

      <P>I am putting in a few pithy phrases the fact that, through not properly facing our business, or through not being given a proper chance of facing our business, we did lose opportunities for putting the economy of our people as a whole on a correct basis at critical times.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are asked by this section to take the nominal capital of the Great Southern Railways and to give it full blooded life, to secure that the transport users of the country will pay interest on it between this and whatever time it is redeemed and that £9,000,000 odd of it will be recovered from the users of our transport system between now and 1960.  We are asked to do that at a critical time in the world's economy and at a critical time in our own affairs, at a time when in so far as transport is concerned it should be the one thing which should be stripped in every possible way of overhead charges, so that our production and our distribution might proceed in a more effective way in relation to the cost of living here and our competitive position abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am simply stating that in a simple way in connection with the amendment which says that the House should not be asked, by acquiescence in the section, to give full-blooded life to the amount of stock in the Great Southern Railways at present.  I think it shocking that we are asked to do business in this way.  We had confusion and bad feeling here in connection with the use of certain expressions last week, but if the matter were dealt with in a simple businesslike way, the brains and the minds of every Party could be brought in a systematic way to understand what we are asked to do here and there would be no danger of our being at cross purposes.  One does not find oneself at cross purposes when one is dealing with arithmetic, with the multiplication and division table, and here we are simply dealing with figures, with an estimate of what value ought to attach in particular circumstances to <Col N="1957" /> certain capital being used in a particular way.</P>
    <P>I am making my case upon the only ground upon which the case is worth making and the only ground on which we have any business in dealing with it here.  The only basis on which we have any business dealing with it is the basis of the national well-being, and the responsibilities we bear in relation to that national well-being, to ensure that no action of ours here will prejudice in any way, so far as our joint minds and understandings facing the facts which ought to be clearly and plainly before us can guide us, that national well-being and to ensure that we will take the best possible decision.</P>
    <P>The submission in Deputy McGilligan's amendment is that this body, even with the facts definitely before it, is not necessarily the best body to take this decision, but that this body, without any of the facts before it, is incapable of doing what it has a responsibility for doing, that is, taking the best possible decision in the country's interest.  Therefore, the suggestion is that a body such as that contemplated in a subsequent amendment by Deputy McGilligan should deal with the considerations with which we are now asked to deal blindfold.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment was considered at considerable length in the Dáil last week, and I think it is only a waste of Parliamentary time to repeat <i>in extenso</i> the arguments then used.  I want to repeat briefly the reasons for which I oppose the amendment.  First, it is unfair.  It amounts to something approaching confiscation.  The proposal is to compel the shareholders of the Great Southern Railways by legislation to surrender their shares in return for stock in the new company on a basis related to the revenue earning capacity of that company at the worst period of its history.  There could be no justification whatever for going back to the dates mentioned in the amendment for the purpose of determining the value to be given to stockholders of the company unless we had the intention of ensuring that the lowest possible amount of nominal <Col N="1958" /> value of stock in the new company is to be given to the shareholders in that company.  I think it would be approaching dishonesty for the Dáil to adopt the amendment.</P>
      <P>The second reason is that I think it desirable that we should proceed by way of agreement.  Whatever case there may be for utilising the power of the Legislature to proceed without agreement with the shareholders of a company such as this, there are good reasons of public policy why we should proceed by agreement.  We sought to obtain an agreement with the shareholders of these companies as to the basis upon which their existing holdings would be surrendered in return for stock in the new company.  We got agreement, or at least a substantial measure of agreement, in each case, and the Government is committed to that agreement and will not consider any departure from it.  The Government would be breaking a moral contract if it were at this stage to consider any other basis of action.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy inquired as to the difference he found between certain figures representing the nominal value of the stock of the Great Southern Railways.  I presume that Deputy Mulcahy has read the various documents presented to him with some care, but, if so, he has not succeeded in properly correlating the various items and information given to him.  The lower figure he mentioned represents the nominal value of the four major stocks of the Great Southern Railways &mdash;debenture, guaranteed preference, preference and ordinary; but in addition to these major stocks, the company have a number of subsidiary stocks, or had a number of such stocks, because they have in large measure been redeemed for cash during the present year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total nominal value of these subsidiary stocks exceeded £1,000,000. There is an amendment, amendment No. 195, which deals with them.  They represent various issues of shares made for the purpose of securing capital to finance various extensions&mdash;the North Wall extension, the New Ross and Waterford Extension Railways, the City of Dublin Junction Railways and <Col N="1959" /> certain other issues.  The difference between the two figures quoted by the Deputy represents the difference between the nominal value of the major stocks and the nominal value of the total stocks issued in the name of the company.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy is determined to refer to a figure of £10,000,000 which was mentioned provisionally during the early stages of the consideration of the proposals in this Bill.  He apparently is determined to try to read into that figure a significance which its authors never gave it.  It represented an indication, not of the arrangement which would be regarded as most equitable in relation to the shareholders of the existing companies, but the sum total of the capital liabilities which we think the new company should have.  The intention under this Bill is to effect, by means of the redemption of stock, a reduction in the capital liability of the company to in or around that figure.  That £10,000,000 represents the amount which we considered at one time could be substituted for the existing stocks of the two companies to be amalgamated, and contained no provision for the new capital which the new company will require to finance the reorganisation in contemplation.  In fact, the proposals in the Bill, although somewhat in a different form, do not vary considerably in that respect from those originally in mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's remarks make it clear that the original capital of £10,000,000 was apparently intended to be substituted for the entire Great Southern Railways capital <Col N="1960" /> of £12,691,000 and the entire capital of the Dublin Transport Company of something over £2,000,000.  I do not see the point in the Minister's remark that the new proposals are substantially the kind of proposals that were being made then.  It emphasises very much the necessity for deciding that some body other than this House in Committee will decide the issue that is attempted to be decided here.  The Minister has attempted to explain the undesirability of passing this amendment by pointing to a date in subsequent amendments&mdash;that is, 1st March, 1943&mdash;as making provision that the stockholders of the Great Southern Railways would be dealt with in the most equitable possible way.</P>

      <P>The most inequitable possible way.  Deputy McGilligan said he accepted, to some extent, the Minister's statement of the conditions of the railway company at that particular time and he expressed himself quite satisfied to substitute another date for the date that was there.  At any rate, whatever date can be substituted, or is put there, it is perfectly clear to me that the House is being asked to do something it ought not to be asked to do and that the users of transport will be asked to bear a burden they ought not to be asked to bear when they will be asked, under the Minister's proposal, to bear the cost of fully reinstating the capital of the Great Southern Railways as at its nominal value in the new company.</P>

That would, therefore, mean that Section 13 would hold, subject to amendment No. 27, if that amendment were carried.  The framework which I was trying to get in was, first of all, to reinstate the dispossessed holders by putting down the date 1st March, 1943, for everybody. That has failed.  The second point was in respect of those who were to get stock, that is those who were declared to be entitled&mdash;to see that that should be determined by a decision of the High Court.  That also has failed.  The third amendment was to take those who had come in since 1st March, 1943, and say with respect to those: if we cannot reinstate the dispossessed stockholders, we will see that those who have bought since 1st March, 1943, will not get the same terms as the rest, but only such terms as the High Court will give them.

      <P>Amendment No. 27 had to be put down for a special purpose. It was to apply first of all to all stockholders and secondly, if that failed, it was to apply at least to those who became stockholders only after 1st March, 1943.

      <P>I do not intend to repeat it.  I only wish to deal with the period since 1st March, 1943, which is <Col N="1965" /> somewhat different.  The proposal in this amendment is that anybody who, immediately on the establishment date, is the holder of stock, but was not the registered holder of the same stock on 1st March, 1943, will not get the substitute stock set out in Section 13, but will have the value of his stock determined by the High Court and get a cash payment or its equivalent. Part of the case already has been made on behalf of those who were stockholders for a long time and who sold &mdash;on my argument&mdash;on account of the depressing statements made by the chairman and the Minister.  I do not want to repeat that argument, but rather to deal with the people who did not hold any stock in the company &mdash;at least, did not hold this stock, for which they are to get compensation&mdash; and who only came in since the 1st March, 1943.  With regard to these people, I ask the House to say there should be a different attitude, that we should tell those people they bought &mdash;according to the evidence before the inquiry&mdash;entirely on their own view as to what the stock would be worth, without any hint of a Government guarantee.  Therefore, the Government is not pledged to them: they cannot say they had any knowledge of any Government undertaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The evidence of certain people before the inquiry was that they bought as investors and speculators.  The whole matter is still in the control of the House and the House is not pledged to those who bought between the 1st March and the 25th October, who bought without any information whatever, simply because of their view of the way in which the railway was working and their judgment in regard to it.  We should say to those people: &ldquo;You will not get the terms, because you bought in ignorance of those terms.&rdquo;  Take the other lot who bought since the 25th October.  They bought merely on the statement that the Government had a proposal.  The Government cannot bind this House. It was clear to those who bought then that these proposals would have to run the gauntlet of criticism in the House and they bought with that risk.  I suggest that we should bring that risk <Col N="1966" /> home to them.  There were some people selling out and others were coming in, but some came in on what I call the depressing statements made by the chairman and the Minister. One of those who came before the tribunal said he regarded those statements as a direct tip, but the tribunal has reported that they were &ldquo;in the main gloomy and not regarded as encouraging&rdquo; and as a result of the speeches certain stocks began to fall. If certain people pride themselves on ability to read between the lines and come to the conclusion that there is a good bargain, it is their look-out if the bargain turns out to be not so good as they thought.  At any rate, I maintain we are not pledged to those people.</P>
    <P>There is one point I wish to make with regard to one other matter, which arises on another amendment but which is appropriate to this.  It is recognised from the evidence given before the judicial inquiry that only one-tenth of the entire stock changed hands but that there was pretty substantial purchasing and that some people put themselves in the way, if the measure went through, to make substantial profits.  They have taken their place&mdash;and will do so in a stronger degree&mdash;amongst the new capitalists of this country.  It is proposed at a later stage, on the financial fabric before us, to borrow but there is no statement as to what the rate of interest will be.  It looks, however, as if some people will be able to make on the double.  They have bought stock cheaply and they find it has now appreciated fairly heavily.  They now have potentially or actually made large sums of money and are possessors of great credit with banks on account of the hold they have.  Are they the people to whom we are to go later to borrow&mdash;possibly at 5 per cent., at a time when money is ranging between 1 and 1½ per cent.?  Are they to become the strength of the new capitalist position?  They are the people to whom we will have to go, so to speak, for a loan on which this whole Bill will be floated.  I suggest that whatever point may be made about people who made money in any other wise, <Col N="1967" /> we should not give further plums to those who bought between the 1st March and the 27th October.</P>

      <P>I should like to withdraw my amendment in favour of No. 27.  I think the amendment proposed by Deputy McGilligan covers the point more effectively.  He seeks to have the compensation to be awarded to those who purchased shares since the 1st March, 1943, decided by the High Court and I think that is a reasonable proposition.  To fix a definite amount, an arbitrary amount, as is implied in my amendment, might be unfair to some of those shareholders, but I think nobody could object to the fixing of the amount of compensation by a tribunal. There is no doubt whatever that some people will make very large profits out of this entire transaction. It does not matter very much whether the information on which they acted was obtained inproperly or not.  They certainly did have definite information.</P>

First of all, let us take the position with regard to the judicial inquiry: they made it clear that there was abnormal dealing since 1st March, 1943, and particularly from August to October, 1943, thereby showing that something must have happened to influence people to purchase on a large scale.  There is no doubt that these shares were purchased at a low price in the early stages and that very large profits were thus made.  It is not our function as a democratic representative assembly to put easy profits into the pockets of any citizen of this State.  It is our duty to see that whatever compensation is <Col N="1968" /> awarded, whether it is in the shape of shares or in cash, to any particular section affected by this Bill, is ascertained judicially and impartially by an entirely disinterested body.  That is what the section proposed by Deputy McGilligan provides.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only say that Deputies opposite are bad losers. They fought an election campaign some months ago on the basis of a discreditable campaign directed against the characters of certain individuals.  They knew that a judicial tribunal was investigating their allegations and their insinuations at that time, but they took advantage of the fact that the tribunal had not reported in order to try to get their stories across to the people.  Deputy Cogan went around Wicklow spreading these insinuations and allegations at every election meeting.  No doubt, there were people in Wicklow who believed him.  When he was subsequently brought before the tribunal and put sitting in the witness chair, on oath, he remembers the ignominious performance he gave there and the fact that he was constrained to admit that he knew nothing whatever to justify any statement he had made.  The tribunal has reported now, as a matter of fact, that there was no information available to anybody that was not available to everybody, that nobody used or disclosed improperly any information concerning the Government's proposals in relation to transport reorganisation.  They have reported that there was no direct evidence of any disclosure of any information. They have reported that none of the Deputies who, in this House or outside this House, had made statements in the matter was able to produce one shred of evidence to justify those statements.  They said, in relation to the circumstantial evidence, that the bulk of the circumstantial evidence available showed conclusively that there was no such disclosure of information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that the tribunal has reported, I again want to draw the attention of the House to the fact that not one of the Deputies associated with that campaign, not one of the Deputies who <Col N="1969" /> made these allegations, has had the decency to apologise for having made them, has had the decency to withdraw any one of the allegations or insinuations he made.  On the contrary, they are trying to keep these allegations alive by such amendments as this we are now discussing, proposed by Deputy McGilligan, and that which Deputy Cogan submitted before the tribunal had reported and which he now withdraws, after the tribunal's report is available.</P>
    <P>The suggestion is that there are certain classes of Great Southern Railways Company stockholders who, for some reason, should be penalised by legislation.  That is the suggestion. Whatever the proposals in the Bill in relation to the shareholders of the Great Southern Railways Company may be, the Deputies say that certain classes of shareholders should be taken out and treated on a worse basis, that they should get less value for their shares than other shareholders. What is the justification of that preposterous contention?  Is the person who bought shares in any different position from the person who refused to sell shares?  Whatever information there was available concerning the affairs of the Great Southern Railways Company or the legislative intentions of the Government, was there for everyone, for every shareholder of the company and for every member of the public who might have been at any time interested in the shares of that company.  Nine out of ten of the shareholders of the company did not sell. Are they in any different position from the shareholders who bought?  Some people made the right assumptions from the facts available to them and some people made the wrong assumptions. The proposal is that we compensate those who made the wrong assumptions and penalise those who made the right assumptions.  Was there ever a more preposterous suggestion put before this House?</P>
    <P>If we are going to deduct from the value given in exchange for their shares to those who acquired them since March, 1943, should we not treat those who refused to sell their shares since March, 1943, on precisely the same basis?  If not, why not?  Take <Col N="1970" /> all the people who became owners of shares in the Great Southern Railways Company since March, 1943.  Are we going to treat them all alike?  Some got them by inheritance.  Are they going to be penalised also just in order to maintain in some form the campaign with which Deputies opposite were associated during the general election?  Some got them by gift.  Some got them, as I mentioned before, as security surrendered in respect of unpaid loans. Some bought them.  For every person who bought shares, some other person sold.  Nobody was compelled to sell. Every seller was a willing seller.  Every seller thought he was doing the best thing by himself when he parted with his property for cash.  Others thought it better business to buy that property for cash.  These are the ordinary risks that people who engage in commercial enterprises take.  So far as we are concerned, we know that every one of these individuals had precisely the same information, precisely the same opportunities of judging upon the facts, as any other and there is no reason, in justice or equity, why one should be treated differently from the other.  So far as the Government is concerned, it will resist any such proposals to the last.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, in Deputy McGilligan's remarks a suggestion that the fall in the value of the stocks of the Great Southern Railways Company in 1943 was in some way engineered. In fact, of course, there was a very small fall in the value of the stocks of the company during that period.  There was also in his remarks a suggestion that nobody could have known that a Government guarantee in respect of capital to be invested in this company would be available.  Anybody who took the slightest interest in the affairs of the Great Southern Railways Company or in the various actions that had been taken in the Dáil concerning that company could not but have known that the question of a Government guarantee was very much in the forefront.  Not merely did the Transport Tribunal in 1939 report that any new capital to be provided for that company would have to be <Col N="1971" /> provided by Government guarantee, but those who read the report knew that the company's management had stated to that tribunal that there was no possibility of obtaining new capital except on Government guarantee.  The speech of the chairman of the Great Southern Railways Company in March, 1943, to which Deputy McGilligan referred, made a very definite reference to the question of a guarantee.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan is, of course, trying to keep alive the flickering embers of this campaign that he engaged in, but all decent members of the Dáil and all decent members of the Opposition in the Dáil will surely accept as the end of that episode, that discreditable episode in our public life, the publication of the tribunal's report and let the matter rest at that.  We have got to deal with this body of individuals whose interests we are affecting by the terms of this Bill as a body.  To attempt to discriminate between one and the other of them, just because of political reasons, would bring this House into contempt and into justifiable contempt.  I hope there will be found in the Opposition Parties some members who will have the courage to stand up and say they will not be associated with it.</P>

      <P>I suggest that the House ought not to have any red herrings drawn across the track of the particular matter we are at present discussing.  The Minister considers that the report issued by the tribunal that inquired into dealing in Great Southern Railways stocks should settle all the so-called slanders.  The Minister is entitled to misrepresent any statements that are made either inside or outside the House in any way he likes but when we are dealing with serious matters affecting the economy of the country the House is entitled, calmly and clearly, to take everything that comes before it in an official way, and in an unofficial way, into fullest possible consideration.  Let me direct the attention of the House to the report of the tribunal of inquiry into dealings in railway stocks, at pages 49 and 50.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1972" /> On those pages the report deals with a case where businessmen, having been advised, on the 27th May of last year, that certain privileged freight rates hitherto enjoyed by their firms were going to be withdrawn and having made a calculation that the withdrawal of these privileges would cost their firms, between them, an extra £5,200 a year, and a further calculation that if only 35 firms had to pay as much as their firms, the company would have profits sufficient to pay a dividend on certain stocks, and feeling that business generally in the country was going to be hit in this particular way, invested money, up to a nominal value of £30,000 in railway stock.  They did that on the grounds that business in the country was going to be made pay through the nose by whatever scheme had been arranged between the Minister and the chairman of the Great Southern Railways Company.  The proposed buying was so big that it took about a month to complete, and then, later on, an order for the sale of them was given on the 7th October, before the pot had completely boiled over, but the idea of the giving of the order to sell that nominal £30,000 worth of stock was that the purchasers wanted to make their profit.  Now, we are in days, and we are going to be in days, when the Government, handling industry in one way or another, or the impact of Government regulations on industry in general, in one way or another, is likely to affect the fortunes of individuals, groups of individuals, or companies; and, in fact, in this particular case, the fortunes of a large number of individuals have been adversely affected while, on the other hand, a large number of individuals, through their cleverness in watching the situation, have made money at the expense of the people who lost.</P>
    <P>If this Parliament is going to pass over the extraordinary happenings arising out of the Government's handling of the present situation, and if, in the future, we should allow things like this to happen, whereby, as a result of the Government's mishandling of the situation, clever people, reading the signs of the times in a clever way, are enabled to make <Col N="1973" /> money at the expense of others, then we are going to have unnecessary hardships and losses caused to ordinary, honourable people, as a result of transactions by rather clever people, although perhaps ordinarily honourable people, on the stock exchange. I think that such a situation would be highly undesirable, and I do not think that the proposal made, either by Deputy McGilligan or Deputy Cogan, should be treated in the way in which the Minister just now has treated it.  The Minister may have his own fight to make over certain aspects of the criticism that was made against his handling of the situation in the past, but we are dealing with a different thing, and we are dealing with it in a systematic way, as a result of which the House has been given an opportunity of examining the facts, particularly with regard to their bearing on the conduct of future business in this country, and I think that it is in that spirit, Sir, that we should approach the question now.</P>

      <P>The Minister, while stating that he wanted to deal with this amendment on its merits, sought to bring in other matters which, in my opinion, he would have been better advised to leave out.  He sought to bring in, in connection with the case he was making against this amendment, the evidence that was given at the Railway Stocks Tribunal, and he definitely stated that I made an ignominious withdrawal before that tribunal.  I withdrew nothing, and the Minister knows that.  I withdrew nothing before that tribunal.  I made no withdrawal, either ignominious or otherwise, and the Minister knows that.  I made no apology of any kind, as the Minister knows.  I pointed out to the tribunal that a statement that I was alleged to have made in a local newspaper was incorrect inasmuch as it was abbreviated and an important point in that statement was omitted. I had pointed out, in the course of my various speeches in Wicklow, that the tribunal was inquiring into certain charges, but I myself made no charges, either inside this House or outside it. All I did was to point out that the <Col N="1974" /> tribunal was investigating certain charges that had been made.</P>

I made no withdrawal whatever, and I think that, if the Minister reads my evidence, he will find that that is correct.  There is, definitely, a case for this amendment being fairly and reasonably considered on its merits.  It seeks to ensure, not that anybody will be victimised or penalised in any way, but merely to see that justice will be done, and that that justice will be done through the medium of the High Court.</P>

      <P>The Minister repeated on this amendment the statement that he made but did not substantiate on a previous amendment of mine, and that is that I suggested that the fall in Great Southern Railways stock was engineered.  If the Minister can produce any phrase of mine to substantiate that allegation, I shall be glad to hear it.  It was found that, after various speeches made both by the chairman of the company and the Minister, there was a depression&mdash;sometimes a sharp depression and, at other times, what might be described as an ordinary depression&mdash; but certainly the fact was brought out that, as a result of those speeches, there was a depression that would not induce people to buy these stocks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I want it to be understood that I am approaching this question in a purely objective way.  I have not said one word here about the falling-off <Col N="1975" /> being engineered, but there is, undoubtedly, the fact that certain falls took place and, as I suggest, these falls were due to the discouraging statements made by the Minister and the chairman of the company.  Then, other people went into buying transactions, described in the judicial report as &ldquo;hectic&rdquo;, &ldquo;absolutely abnormal&rdquo;, &ldquo;exceptional&rdquo;, &ldquo;inexplicable&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Now, it is the people who came into what the Minister described as &ldquo;the boom&rdquo; that we want to deal with.  We want to deal with the type of buying that was described as &ldquo;hectic&rdquo;, &ldquo;absolutely abnormal&rdquo;, &ldquo;exceptional&rdquo;, &ldquo;inexplicable&rdquo;.  There is no question here of deliberately setting out to penalise people who were investing in the ordinary way.  If that abnormal buying had been the result of a leakage of information, then the stock would have been taken from these people; they would have been penalised, possibly, to the full extent of the stocks they had got as a result of that leakage of information.  I am simply dealing with the fact that certain persons bought in circumstances of feverish activity, as it was described by the tribunal, although that activity took place, as the tribunal pointed out, in an inexplicable way, after the statements made by the Minister and the chairman of the company, which were described as gloomy.  I do not think you are dealing fairly with an amendment of this sort, which has been put down seriously to deal with people who have suffered as a result of these transactions, by referring to those who, from 1943, inherited shares or got them by gift or otherwise, because these would be only a very small fraction of the people whom we are endeavouring to cover by this amendment.  I am aiming, mainly, at the people who bought during that particular period, and I am sure that it should be possible to remove from the scope of this amendment, those who received stocks through the ordinary process of law&mdash;such as inheritance or in other ways&mdash;other than by purchase in the market.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the Minister's attempt to confuse the argument about <Col N="1976" /> those who refused to sell and those who bought.  I tried to compensate those who had been induced to sell. I wanted to put them back and make them proprietors of the railways as they had been.  That has failed.  I now take the other point of view, and am tackling those who became the new proprietors of the stock as from the date on which, say, the buying started and on which the discouraging remarks were made.  I am taking account of two classes.  The first, those who, I think, would not have sold in the ordinary way had it not been for the depressing statements made.  Notwithstanding those depressing statements they found somebody who was going to lift the shares which had given them some small profit.  They were anxious to take that small profit at the time. They were more anxious to take it because of the discouraging statements made.  Those people were not protected by any note from the chairman which stock exchange witnesses before the tribunal said would be a proper and usual thing seeing that movements and negotiations were on with regard to a State guarantee.  In view of that they should have been encouraged to hang on to their shares. The shares were issued on the market for those who wanted to buy and people did buy in the circumstances.  I do not seek to penalise those people. I do not ask that they should be deprived of their stock.  I do ask that the High Court should assess the value that those people should pay back in cash: that they should not become proprietors of the railway or holders of the substitute debenture stock.  I am simply asking that the High Court should find out what is the fair value of the property that they bought and hand back that amount in cash.</P>
    <P>It must have been known that reorganisation was on foot.  The matter was being canvassed.  The vivid phrase was used by a stock exchange witness before the tribunal that reorganisation, from the point of view of Great Southern Railways stockholders, was a word of very unhappy memories. Reorganisation to those who had been holders of that stock, and who knew how the stock was slashed in 1933 <Col N="1977" /> must have contemplated that their stock was going to be cut down.  The debenture stock had not been very heavily cut in 1933, but people thought that it would be the stock that would be slashed this time.  People's minds ranged over these matters in a variety of ways.  In regard to stock in which there was very little movement earlier, there was considerable movement between March and August, 1943.  I do not think that the new proprietors who bought in that period should get the same terms as the people who held on to their stock through thick and thin.  I doubt if anybody, fairly judging the matter and keeping his mind clear of the red herrings that have been drawn across the matter by the Minister, would say that the two lots of people on any consideration should be put on a footing of equality. I am asking that this new group of people should be given the conditions which the High Court, after full advertence to the facts, would say represented the value of their stock.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If I understand Deputy Mulcahy correctly, he apparently regards it as a sound principle that the State, by legislation, should protect those who engage in stock exchange transactions and lose thereby.  Now, since joint stock companies were first formed people have dealt in the stocks of those companies.  They have bought and sold them, thinking they would secure a profit from such transactions.  Some people bought well and made profits.  Other people were less lucky and less skilful, and lost.  That process will go on so long as there are joint stock companies in existence, and so long as there are markets in which shares in those companies are available for buying and selling.  I think it would be a very wrong principle to establish that there is any obligation on the Government or the Legislature to protect those who engage in these transactions and lose money.  People have lost money on such transactions before, and will lose money again.  The only interest they can harm is their own.  I do not see that there is any reason, on grounds of public policy, why they should be protected from their folly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1978" /> Deputy Mulcahy quoted a particular reference in the tribunal's report to the shares bought by two Dublin businessmen, but I think the Deputy himself has missed the very obvious significance of that particular transaction.  In the first place, those two men bought the shares because of certain deductions which they had made from facts which had become available to them concerning changes in the freight charges of the Great Southern Railways Company. I think they made wrong deductions. No doubt they still got the right result.  I must confess that the logic employed by those two individuals was particularly bad.  There was no reason to assume that the alteration upwards of the freight charges, with which they were acquainted, was not due to the higher operating costs being experienced by the company rather than to a situation which would enable the company to pay dividends on its shares.  The particular fact that I want to draw attention to is that these two individuals, who were referred to in the tribunal's report, are not affected by this amendment at all.  These individuals were not buying Great Southern Railways shares as an investment. Most of those who bought shares during that period bought them as an investment and still hold them. The two individuals, on whose case Deputy Mulcahy is relying, did not buy as an investment.  They were concerned only with a possible capital appreciation, and when they got that they sold out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>And has happened before. People have bought shares at 2d. and sold them at £5; other people have bought shares at £5 and sold them for 2d.  That has happened in the case of various companies.  I know an individual who owns shares in the Dublin United Transport Company, one of the companies affected by this Bill.  He bought one lot of £1 shares in that company at £2 per share and another lot at 7/- each.  Fluctuations occurred in the value of shares between <Col N="1979" /> two wide extremes.  When this individual purchased the shares originally at £2 he thought they were good value.  Subsequently the shares fell on the market to 7/-.  He bought a second lot of the shares at 7/- in order to average out the cost of all the shares which he held.  Those who sold the shares at £2 thought they were doing well, while those who sold at 7/- subsequently discovered that they had made a mistake.  People will make errors of judgment of that kind, and there is no obligation on the Government, or the State, to protect them from the consequences of their errors.</P>
      <P>I submit in all seriousness to Deputy McGilligan that there is no essential difference between those who bought shares and those who owned shares and did not sell them, and, therefore, whatever treatment is fair for one class of person is equally fair for the other. Those who held Great Southern Railways shares in March, 1943, at the prices then recorded, and held them against the possibility of the shares going up in value, had the opportunity of selling, and are in precisely the same position as those who bought shares at that time in the expectation of a rise in the market.  I want to point out that, during the whole period up to August, 1943, there was no fall worth talking about in the market value of Great Southern Railways shares. Deputy McGilligan repeatedly uses words of doubtful meaning, such as the word &ldquo;induced&rdquo;, in the phrase that people were induced to part with their shares.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>People sold their shares because they thought it was good business for them to sell them.  I want to emphasise that, during that period, there was no catastrophic fall in the value of the shares.  There was no reason for those who held shares in <Col N="1980" /> 1942 to assume that the market quotation, or the situation, in 1943, would be any worse than it had been in the previous year.  The average values of the shares during the period of 1943 up to August were very little different from the average values during the whole of 1942.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cogan does not like my referring to statements made by him before the tribunal.  I shall not do so but, during the course of the Second Reading debate on this Bill, he said: &ldquo;The type of treatment which the House may decide to mete out to the railway shareholders will be influenced, to a great extent, by the report of the tribunal.&rdquo;  We have now got the report. I want the Deputy to refer me to the paragraph of that report which, he suggests, should influence us into segregating the railway shareholders into two classes, one class to be treated much less favourably than the other. Surely there is nothing in the report which would justify such a course. The fact is that Deputy Cogan put down his amendment before the report was available and when he hoped the report would be different.  He now finds that his hopes have not been realised and he has not the moral courage to admit it.  If the report had disclosed that people had secured shares by reason of the improper use of information or by reason of the improper disclosure of information, the Dáil could not fail to take note of the fact.  I indicated on a previous occasion that we would take note of such a fact.  But we have had a very unambiguous report from the tribunal. At one time I had thought that it would not be possible for the tribunal to submit so unambiguous a report.  I submit that, in that report, we do not find justification for any attempt to differentiate between those who had railway shares prior to 1943 and those who subsequently acquired them.</P>

      <P>The Minister has constantly referred to the conclusions of the tribunal, which are based on the evidence of Mr. O'Donohoe and Mr. Murphy.  He says that the logic of the attitude of these gentlemen and their buying of shares, consequent on the views they had formed, was rather odd. That strikes at the root of the tribunal's report.  Its whole foundation is acceptance of the views of Mr. O'Donohoe and Mr. Murphy.  They eventually say that the buying of the stocks was caused by the purchases made by those gentlemen, on the lines to which the Minister has referred.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite obviously, they treated this transaction as the pivotal matter in the whole affair and the Minister says that it was quite an illogical business.  I pass from his view on that.  It may be possible to deal with it at another time.  The Minister said that Deputy Mulcahy, backing my amendment, said that this House should interfere to correct the mistakes made by those who speculate on the stock exchange.  I did not hear Deputy Mulcahy say anything of the sort.  I heard Deputy Mulcahy advance a certain argument which I, myself, endeavoured to make.  Nobody holds that this House should be dragged in to recoup those who lost through investment or speculation on the stock exchange or to take from those who have succeeded either in investment or speculation on the stock exchange the fruits of their activities. <Col N="1982" /> But I say&mdash;and I think this is what Deputy Mulcahy says, too&mdash;that if people have been swayed&mdash;I use that word rather than the word &ldquo;induced&rdquo; which seems to cause the Minister so much trouble&mdash;into parting with their property because of statements made by Ministers responsible to this House, the House should take cognisance of that and attempt to do something to secure greater justice for people who would not have acted, as I suggest those people would not have acted, as they did but for the statements which were made.  If a Government nominee makes statements and, as a result of those statements, proprietors of railway stocks are induced to sell, we should provide a remedy for what was thus inadvertently done&mdash;I do not say deliberately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming on to page ten of this report, the chairman made a speech at the annual general meeting in March, 1943.  The speech was &ldquo;generally regarded as gloomy and had a very depressing effect on the market.  Some holders proceeded to get rid of their stocks and this occasioned some activity and a sharp fall in prices.&rdquo; A question was put by Deputy Davin in March and the tribunal says that, &ldquo;following the Minister's reply, which was non-committal, prices again fell slightly.&rdquo;  The people who were anxious about their position waited to get some encouragement from the reply by the Minister to Deputy Davin and, not getting it, they joined in and sold and prices again fell.  Prices had fallen sharply before that.  &ldquo;On the 26th May, the Minister spoke on the Estimate for his Department and, following his speech, which was not regarded as encouraging&rdquo;&mdash;the sober phrase of the tribunal&mdash;&ldquo;prices fell again&rdquo;.  The speech made by the Minister in June at Inchicore, which could not be regarded as encouraging, is omitted.  On the next page they say that dealings in the company's stocks were described to them as &ldquo;absolutely abnormal&rdquo;, &ldquo;a boom&rdquo;, &ldquo;absolutely hectic&rdquo; and &ldquo;inexplicable&rdquo;.  If the Minister would only put himself in the position of the people who were dispossessed because of this &ldquo;inexplicable&rdquo; buying, who had their minds influenced <Col N="1983" /> by the gloomy statements by the Minister and the chairman, he would adopt a more reasonable attitude and endeavour to secure that those who stepped into the shoes of those folk would not get the same treatment as those who remained owners all the time.</P>
    <P>There is a principle involved&mdash;not the principle the Minister endeavoured to shove over on Deputy Mulcahy.  If Ministers of nominees of theirs in responsible positions use words which cause people to sell their shares and it is found that those people sold seriously to their detriment and that other people, because they took another reading of the words&mdash;that is the only reason given at the moment for the purchases&mdash;are found in possession of property which has considerably appreciated since it was parted with by the others, the House should do something to rectify the mistake.  I ask them to do it in this way.</P>

      <P>The remarks made by the Minister with regard to my statement go to show the way in which he is trifling with the House.  If anything has been put before the House regarding the Minister's proposals, it is that justice should not be done to people who had their money sunk in the maintenance of the railway company. That is the note on which he is trying to press these costly proposals on the House.  When speaking on an amendment like this the Minister says that we want to protect speculators. We moved in this matter in order to warn the Government and the speculators that in times like these, when Government action is likely to have an impact on commercial and industrial life, and to affect the stock exchange, careless handling of the situation by the Government should not be allowed and speculators would not be allowed to reap the harvest.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so. We are not concerned with anything but the general situation which was so fully dealt with by Deputy McGilligan and by other Deputies, as a result of the speech by the Government appointed chairman of the company, at a time when definite Government proposals were being formulated dealing with its financial affairs.  Considerable and irregular sales of stock arose, which inflicted hardship at a time when we suggest people had, for a long period, been holding stock.  That put substantial amounts, as a result of such speculation, into the pockets of others.  The proposal in the amendment would establish the principle that speculators were not going to get away with substantial profits, simply because of mishandling of Government proposals at any time, either in industrial or commercial life and, in view of what has happened, it would be a necessary warning.  The Minister wants more or less to blur over the particular type of case mentioned, which indicated why it was necessary to take action.  The fact that persons were able to come in, and to get out with profit, emphasises the type of situation that could arise. This is not mentioned here because it is the type of case that would be caught by this amendment or as the most striking case mentioned in the report of dealings in stocks, but it would point to the fact that the Government should have prevented dealing in these stocks until their proposals were known, or they should have warned those with stocks who were tempted to sell to be careful about doing so.</P>

      <P>The section authorises the company to issue debenture stock for the purposes of providing money or paying off or redeeming any debenture stock.  I think it is desirable that we should permit the issue of debenture stock for the purpose of the acquisition by means of exchange of stock of any transport undertaking which the company may be authorised to acquire.  If such words were not inserted the company could not proceed with such acquisition except for cash.  They should be given a discretion in the event of an agreement with regard to the acquisition of another transport undertaking to acquire it by means of an exchange of stock.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to speak on the section.  When we come to Section 17, which deals with the State guarantee of debenture stock, the Minister for Finance is the ruling authority.  In this section it is the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Why is that?  Generally, it is the Minister for Finance who rules in financial matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance comes in with reference to the terms on which the debenture stock will be issued.  In Section 15 we propose to authorise the creation of stock and provide that stock with the consent of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, after consultation with the Minister for Finance.  I should say that the difference is this: in Section 15 the question at issue is one of transport policy, whereas in Section 17 the <Col N="1992" /> main question relates to finance policy. That is why the ultimate power of deciding whether or not debenture stocks should be issued for specific purposes is given to the Minister for Industry and Commerce in Section 15.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance will determine the terms under which debenture stock will be issued. The Minister for Industry and Commerce is given the primary responsibility of determining how much will be issued.  Surely that is ordinarily regarded as the function of the Minister for Finance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary question is whether considerations of transport policy require that the stocks should be issued with the Government guarantee attached, and that is a matter for consideration, in the first instance, by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be, but when you come to the financial side of it, surely it is the concern of the Minister for Finance.  As we have things at the moment, the Finance Department has a grip over everything in connection with finance.  I do not know that there is any other measure in which the Finance Minister is so dealt with.  This incidentally concerns not merely substituted debenture stock, but any debenture stock.  The amendment seeks to insert the words &ldquo;or for the purposes of the acquisition, by means of the exchange of debenture stock, of any transport undertaking which the company is authorised to acquire.&rdquo;  They are authorised to acquire pretty nearly all transport undertakings. The Minister for Finance will indicate the terms and the conditions under which he will allow debentures to be issued, but the Minister will determine the volume.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The main question will be one of transport policy, which should properly be decided by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in the first instance.  It is precisely the same procedure as in relation to capital issued to the Electricity Supply Board.  Again, the proposal <Col N="1993" /> comes to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in the first instance.  The decision as to the terms upon which capital will be made available to the Electricity Supply Board is taken by the Minister for Finance, but only after the Minister for Industry and Commerce has decided that it should be authorised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is how much stock will be created and issued from time to time, and it is not in connection with the substitution of stock but with any future debenture stock.  If it is a matter of transport policy to say how much stock should be issued, then you might as well indicate the rate of interest that borrowing should bear.  The whole thing will eventually react on transport.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why both Ministers names are in, but the primary function is given to the Minister for Industry and Commerce under this section.  The Minister for Finance comes in because he must be satisfied that the purpose for which the stock is being issued is one contemplated when the Bill was being framed.  It is for the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the first instance to decide whether this is a type of capital expenditure which would be approved having regard to the general transport policy of the Government.  It is only at that stage, when the question of policy has been decided and the decision has to be taken as to the issue of stock, that the Minister for Finance comes in on the finance question, which is his primary concern in view of the extent to which the State credit is involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Deputy will remember that there was a change following the original Act of 1927.  Subsequently, there was an amending Act which required proposals for capital expenditure to be separately approved. The Minister for Industry and Commerce does that.  When he has approved the programme submitted by the board, the Minister for Finance comes in and lays down the terms on which the money will be advanced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only raising it here because it seems to me that an amazing distinction is being drawn. Personally, I do not feel that the old scheme of having the Department of Finance gripping all the expenditure is the correct one in modern times, but I think it would be better to have the Minister for Finance enshrined here than any other Minister until we change that system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We could give the board power to go to the public for its <Col N="1995" /> capital, but we could not do it where there is a Government guarantee.  The Government must clearly have power to ensure that the public credit is not utilised unwisely or to an extent that would be unduly prejudicial to the stability of the national finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Having heard all about the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, I think on this section here we ought to hear something about the people. The thing that appears important from the people's point of view is this question of temporary capital.  I think this is the section upon which we might hear something about why such an enormous amount of the capital of this company is to be temporary capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This is hardly the appropriate section.  Section 16 is the section which provides for the redemption of substituted debenture stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>We deal here with Section 15, where the Minister is asked, for the purpose of providing money, to create and issue debenture stock, and I think, on the general principle of temporary capital in relation to this scheme, we could not have a more appropriate section on which to discuss it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear that you could alter the provisions of the Bill relating to the repayment of the substituted debenture stock without changing this section.  Therefore, it is clearly not on this section that that question arises.  I should say that the question which arises here is the total amount of debenture stock which may be issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister leave substituted stock aside for the moment, and just consider this: the capital of the company is to consist of not more than £4,000,000 common stock and not more than £16,000,000 redeemable debentures?  Now, we are considering that, as far as we know, with £9,875,556 in redeemable debenture stock, this section here under the words &ldquo;for the purposes of providing <Col N="1996" /> money&rdquo; would be the power I take it that would govern the creating of the additional debentures to the extent of £6,124,444.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to know, particularly with the large amount of debenture stock that is held in the company, what this money is wanted for, and, if this money is wanted, why it should be provided by way of redeemable debentures rather than additional common stock?  What is the policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The ultimate intention is that the capital liability of the undertaking should be reduced from the limit of £20,000,000, at which it is notionally fixed at the beginning, to something in or about half that sum. We consider that sound financial policy would require that the unproductive items on the credit side of the balance sheet should be eventually disposed of, and that would appear to involve that the full capital liability with which the company will start off or which it may acquire under the Bill should eventually be reduced.  We are proposing to put upon the company the obligation to redeem its substituted debenture stock by a specific date, 1960. Other stock will be redeemable stock, but the redemption terms will be fixed in relation to each issue at the time of issue; they will be fixed by the Minister for Finance under the provisions of Section 17.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea is that, if the circumstances of the company warrant it, this capital liability should be got rid of, because only to some extent will the issue of this capital be represented by an improvement in the actual assets held by the company.  Debenture stock, as Deputies know, is not as a rule represented by fixed assets.  It is frequently secured on fixed assets but the company's assets should, in fact, be represented by perpetual stock such as ordinary stock or preference stock.  It is desirable, therefore, in so far as the capital liability which the company will create after the war would represent the replacement assets which are <Col N="1997" /> already represented by capital liability embodied in the substituted debenture stock, that it should be at some stage amortised.  That is the reason why the provision is that the substituted debenture stock should be redeemed by 1960.</P>
    <P>There is obviously another reason.  It is proposed that the State will guarantee the interest on this stock.  It is desirable that the State's contingent liability should be limited not merely in amount but also in time.  It is hoped that at some stage it will be possible for the State to contemplate withdrawing that assistance to this company, enabling the company to proceed as an ordinary commercial enterprise, securing money upon debentures or the issue of stock, without the aid of a Government guarantee.  I think we must at this stage contemplate that the contingent liability accepted by the State will cease to operate; that, therefore, the stock carrying Government guarantee should be redeemable stock, and that there should be placed upon the company at the time that stock is issued the obligation to provide at some subsequent date for its cancellation.  I doubt very much if anybody will regard it as being sound financial practice to have a perpetual stock bearing a State guarantee.</P>

If it is necessary to exceed that limit, fresh legislation would be required. This fixes the limit of the liability which the State is accepting. It is desirable also that that liability should be redeemed in time.  That is why it is proposed that the stock be redeemable stock, and also that the company is to redeem it out of its revenue at some stage, so that the State's liability will be cancelled.</P>

      <P>I am more in a fog than ever after hearing the Minister. Section 15 puts this limitation on the total amount of debenture stock, including substituted debenture stock created and issued&mdash;it is not to exceed £16,000,000.  When I go on to this other section, I take it to be possible that the Minister for Finance, using blocks of £2,000,000, could issue one block of £2,000,000 and redeem it by substituted debenture stock.  He would have wiped out £2,000,000 worth of stock and substituted another.  As long as he keeps under the limit of £16,000,000, I suggest he could buy up any fresh blocks of £2,000,000 a short time after this measure becomes law and so become the proprietor instead of the substituted debenture holders and could make entirely new terms which would have nothing to do with 1960.</P>

That means that the total value of the new debenture stock that may be created and issued is the difference between £9,800,000 and £16,000,000, which is the total that can be issued.  There may not be any more than that issued and, if any of that stock is issued and repaid, it cannot be reissued.  The total value of the debenture stock that may be created is £16,000,000.

Its capital liability then will consist of the common stock, plus whatever new debenture stock has been issued in the meantime, if any.  That would be its total liability and it cannot exceed that, without fresh legislation. I contemplate, at some stage after 1960&mdash;it may conceivably be possible to secure this by agreement with any debenture holders there may be at that time&mdash;that a situation will arise <Col N="2002" /> in which the company will only have common stock and that any existing debentures will be replaced by agreement by common stock and the legislation changed to permit of that.  The ideal situation at which the company should aim&mdash;though we may not live to see it&mdash;is that the company would only have common stock capital and have no capital liabilities other than common stock and no obligation to pay interest or dividends unless the company earned them.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That, taking note of the consider able increase in the prices of commodities and the consequent depreciation in the purchasing power of money during the past four years, Dáil Eireann requests the Government to introduce proposals for the purpose of providing for persons over 65 years of age, who have ceased being gainfully employed, old age pensions at the rate of 20/- per week; and providing further that, in computing the means of applicants under the old age pensions code, any net income not exceeding £52 per annum will not be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I move this motion on behalf of a very deserving section of the community. The discussion of the motion is belated. It was set down originally almost two years ago, but because of incidents intervening and, I may say, owing to the general dilatoriness on the part of the Government in ordering their public business, to the detriment of Private Members' time, this motion and very many important matters have been an unduly long time on the Order Paper, with consequent hardship to the persons concerned.  In that connection, the phrase in the motion &ldquo;during the past four years&rdquo; should read &ldquo;during the past five years&rdquo;.  During all that time this section of the community, old age pensioners, have suffered hardship. They have not belonged to any particular religion.  They have not been associated with any political cult or creed.  They are merely the citizens of this State, whose only claim to consideration by this House is the fact that they are citizens who have reached the allotted span, who have given service in this State and who, in fact, are the State and have made the State. They are asking the consideration of this Parliament.  I am appealing on behalf of the old age pensioners to every section in this House.  It is really not a matter to be considered from a political angle.  We ought to examine ourselves as representatives here and apply to our claims and <Col N="2006" /> boasts of Christianity the acid test as to how we have treated the aged people.  I think that is a very fair test to apply.  I suggest, without fear of contradiction, that the stipend of 10/-, awarded to them by this generous State, was never sufficient to maintain body and soul together, but was a means of keeping them suffering and objects of public and private charity.</P>
    <P>I do not think that that is the way, this nation ought to approach this matter.  We ought to accept responsibility for the maintenance of our aged people in reasonable comfort, or else decide that we have nothing to do with them.  They have been given a miserable allowance of 10/- a week.  Whatever may have been their position prior to the outbreak of the world conflict in September 1939, their position since then has been much worse. Owing to the soaring prices of all commodities, the purchasing power of their 10/- has depreciated.  During this war there was introduced in this country&mdash; to prevent soaring wages, as we were told&mdash;stand-still wage Orders and an alleged stand-still Order to prevent increased profits.</P>
    <P>I shall not develop that point, because people know its history fairly well; but even after these Orders had been in operation for some time, the Government found it necessary to amend them and to allow increases to take place in the pay of certain workers in this country because, otherwise, they could not carry on the services of the State.  These people, because of the importance of their work to the State, could not be pegged down to the bottom of the ladder, and some allowance had to be made as a result of the increased cost of living, but the old age pensioners were left at the bottom of the groove until, late in 1943, what I can only describe as a miserly and miserable attempt was made to remedy their position by granting an increase of half-a-crown. Now, that half-crown was not directly administered from the Government, but through the public authorities, and I think that that method of distributing the money is despicable, and the public authorities have been made the object of public odium because of the <Col N="2007" /> miserly sum that was allocated to each council.  The effect of the present rules is that the relieving officer has to go around and make another means test in addition to the means test already existing.  It would appear that no two persons in the one house can get that half-crown and, in fact, the relieving officer has to prove that there must be absolute destitution in the house concerned before these people are entitled to get that rate.  I am saying that these people have a right to their old age pensions, not to save them form destitution but because they are entitled to it, having reached the age of 70.</P>
    <P>Now, according to the cost-of-living figures, we find that, as compared with mid-August, 1939, the figure has gone up by 71 per cent., while the purchasing power of people in receipt of old age pensions of 10/- per week has been reduced to zero.  What such a pensioner could buy in 1939, therefore, on his 10/- a week cannot be measured by what he requires at the moment. Apart from the fact that some of his requirements are out of his reach, those that can be bought have increased to such a price that they are definitely beyond his reach.</P>
    <P>While that is happening in Ireland, where we have Christianity, other countries have been moving ahead. This morning, reading the paper, we can see the new scheme that is proposed to be put into operation in England. For instance, under the new English scheme, as published in today's papers, there are provided retirement pensions of 35/- for a man and wife, and 20/- for single people&mdash;the retiring age for men being 65 years, and for women 60 years.  Their joint pension of 35/- is payable if the man retires at 65, even though the wife has not reached 60, provided that she is not working.  Those who go on working draw no pension, but when they retire their pension will be increased by 2/-, jointly, and 1/5, singly, for every year's work after the retiring age.</P>
    <P>Compare that with what has been done here in this country.  See also what they have done in New Zealand. <Col N="2008" /> Under the New Zealand Social Security Act, superannuation is universal and is payable at 65.  This benefit is payable irrespective of the applicant's income.  The superannuation is independent of old age pensions. The same person may get both old age pension and superannuation benefit.  In New Zealand, old age pensions are payable at 60.  The basic rate is 32/6 per week, or £84 10s. per annum, but the Insurance Commission may increase it by 10/6 to 43/- in the following cases: In the case of a married man, whose wife is not entitled to receive benefit in her own right; in the case of a pensioner who has dependent children under 16, in which case 10/6 is paid in respect of each child.  The old age pension in New Zealand is subject to a means test, but persons treated as single have the first £50 treated as free.  For a married couple, only one of whom is entitled to a pension, the free allowance is £136 10s.  Any friendly society benefit or pension to which the person concerned may be entitled is not used as a means test.  In other words, the persons treated as single have the first £52 free, and that is what I am asking for in this motion.  Under the New Zealand scheme there is a further allowance, amounting to £500, for the value of any annuity or matured insurance policy.</P>
    <P>These concessions are valuable, and there are many others, and I want particularly to stress the following because, in the case of our country, I suggest that the means test imposed by our Government in the case of these old age pensions is a penalisation of thrift, and I regret to say that when, in 1927, I made my first speech in this House, which was on the question of old age pensions, nothing was done about the matter.  Mr. Blythe was then Minister for Finance, and I want to draw the attention of the House now, as I did then, to the fact that the State is spending public money in advising people to be thrifty, to buy savings certificates, to make provision for the rainy day and for the up-growing of their children, while actually doing nothing to encourage thrift.  I suggest that there should be a headline over all that kind of advice, <Col N="2009" /> in view of the treatment which the Government is meting out to our old people, to this effect: &ldquo;When you have saved up your money and been thrifty, we shall duly penalise you when you reach 70 years of age.&rdquo;  That, in effect, is what occurs under the old age pensions code.  Any workman who joins a provident society and who pays 6d. a week into it, in the expectation that he can draw something from it in his old age, is penalised because of his thrift, and that is chalked up against him when he comes to apply for his old age pension.  I think that the present old pensions code is an encouragement to thriftlessness.  I have had a long experience of this question, and, as far as I can see, the only person who is entitled to the full old age pension when he reaches the age of 70 is the man who never worked in his life.  He can come along and demand his 10/- a week, and the Department cannot refuse to give it to him.  That is the code.  But if a man has children and has done the best he can to educate these children and put something by for a rainy day, when he reaches the age of 70, and applies for an old age pension, he is penalised because of his thrift.</P>
    <P>In New Zealand, as I have pointed out, any insurance or friendly society benefit to which a man may be entitled is not taken into account when it comes to the matter of an old age pension, and money received from the exchange or sale of property not exceeding £500, is not taken account of, and it should be also remembered that old age pensions in New Zealand are granted at the age of 65, whereas in our country we do not grant old age pensions until the person reaches the age of 70, and our old age pensioners are penalised, as I have pointed out, if they have any other means, no matter how small.  I wonder why the age should be 70.  The general age for retirement in this country is generally accepted as 65.  That is accepted as the retiring age in the Civil Service and in the commercial community in this country.  There may be exceptions, but I think it will be agreed that in the case of the vast majority of commercial undertakings in this country, such as the railways, or other big <Col N="2010" /> corporations, the retiring age is 65. Now, there is a gap of five years between 65 and 70, and I cannot understand why that gap could not be bridged.  I think that there should be some inducement for these people to retire and get out of the way of younger people, but this idea of pushing them out at the age of 65 and asking them, in effect, to live as best they can, until they reach the age of 70, being cold-shouldered by the State in the meantime, I think, is all wrong. Not alone that, but if, through the employment exchange, the State has been decent enough to give them something to live on during those five years, that is deducted before they can qualify for the old age pension.  I think that this whole thing is doing an injustice to the people concerned, and I suggest that it should be faced up to, not in any niggardly or miserly fashion, but in a generous way.  Of course, I realise that the Minister may say that it is all right for Deputy Keyes or Deputy Corish to put down this question, and then ask, where is the money to come from.  That is the usual thing.  The extraordinary thing, however, is that when it comes to asking for money for certain necessary purposes such as the defence of this country, millions can be provided during the emergency&mdash;and, of course, nobody objects to that&mdash;but I suggest that money which, with God's help, will be available in the near future as the result of the approaching peace, should be diverted for providing peace and comfort for our old people so as to enable them to be paid back for the services that they have given to this State.</P>
    <P>If I am asked where is the money to come from for this purpose, I may reply by asking, where will it go to? It certainly will not go to Timbuctoo. It will not go out of the country, but will circulate amongst the shopkeepers and others to meet the requirements of the old age pensioners.  With this increase, the latter will be in a position to buy more of the country's produce. Therefore, I submit it cannot be said that the increase will be wasted.  It will help to improve the social standards of the people.  The case for this increase is so evident that <Col N="2011" /> it does not call for further argument from me.  I appeal to the members of all Parties to give this question, which is not a political one, their sympathy and generous consideration.</P>

      <P>With regard to this particular motion, we have four motions on the Order Paper to the same effect.  One deals with old age pensions, another with blind pensions, and another with the position of unemployed persons.  I remember that, at the beginning of the emergency, when the responsible Minister introduced his standstill Order, his defence of it before the House was this: &ldquo;Put machinery into my hands to keep down the cost of living; if I do not get machinery in this form the cost of living will soar, and the poorest people in the land will be those who will be most severely hit.&rdquo; He got his machinery to peg down wages.  The Government was put in the position to peg down every form of allowance, pension or other income derived directly from State services. Despite the fact that the Government had that machinery in their hands, with power under emergency Orders to fix the cost of every article bought and sold, the lid was taken off prices and the cost of living soared while the incomes of the poorest people remained fixed.  It was, therefore, natural that crop upon crop of motions of this kind would be tabled and would have to be supported by every Deputy who believes that the humblest being is at least entitled to get fair maintenance. We on these benches urged the Government time and again to appoint some kind of commission to throughly investigate this whole question so as to arrive at a firm figure as to what is the minimum weekly cost of keeping alive one adult human being and one juvenile.  We have never got such a figure although it should be within the reach of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  If we had been furnished with it we could then satisfy ourselves as to whether motions of this kind are reasonable or unreasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2012" /> There is no disputing this point, that when the old age pension stood at a certain figure in 1937 and 1938, and when the Minister for Finance was faced with appeals for more elasticity in the administration of that scheme, he said in the Dáil that he knew that what the old age pensioners were getting was not enough to provide a bare subsistence, but that it was the most that could be given.  Therefore, the old age pension at that time was not enough to provide a bare subsistence costing approximately half what it is to-day.  This question must be answered: what is the position of the old age pensioner to-day, with his pension fixed and the cost of living doubled?  If we knew what the weekly cost of maintaining a human life is we would know how to approach motions of this kind.  The position is that we have a whole set of different standards, all of them bearing the stamp of the State.  Under the income-tax code, the cost of maintaining a wife before the war was estimated to be £100 a year, and of a child £60 a year.  If we take old age pension standards, we find that the cost of maintenance is considerably lower, while under the Department of Industry and Commerce the 2/6 a week for a child is not supposed to represent the child's maintenance cost.  That allowance is supposed to be augmented from other sources.  We have that fantastic state of affairs in this little island populated with a handful of people.</P>
    <P>In many cases we have the income of a humble home made up from seven or eight different sources, all with a different administration, different inspectors, different payees, and all visiting the home and investigating the circumstances associated with it. You have seven or eight inspectors administering small sums of 2/- or 3/- a week.  In the case of a good many homes you have national health insurance; unemployment assistance, possibly a blind pension, the old age pensions and perhaps home help going in. Surely, the time has come when all these various social services should be brought under one Department, so that you will have one inspector or investigator <Col N="2013" /> inquiring into means and one body paying.  The figure mentioned here may be excessive.  It may be outside the capacity of the purse, but the figure that was considered adequate in 1938 should, approaching the question in a sense of equity and balance, be raised at least 70 per cent. to meet the increased cost of living. None of the moneys that go by way of old age pension to any individual is spent on luxuries.  None of the moneys given in that way is spent in careering around this country or any other country.  None of it is spent on frolic. Every farthing of the few shillings that go to the old age pensioner is spent on bare maintenance.  In view of the alarming and uncontrolled rise in the cost of living, there is a responsibility on the Government to keep pace with that rise in the cost of living, at least with regard to people totally dependent on the State, seeing that all the machinery sought to control the cost of living was given and that it was as ineffective as the sieve against the incoming tide.</P>
    <P>We heard a reference to the age at which pensions should be given.  There, again, the Government is in a very weak position.  We have a number of pieces of legislation before us indicating that, in the opinion of the Government, a person is unfit for further work at the age of 65 years.  We had people thrown out of employment by legislation, not because they were not doing their job efficiently, not because their health has deteriorated but because they had reached a certain age&mdash;namely, 65 years.  We must assume that there was an honest intention behind such legislation.  We must assume, therefore, that, in the opinion of Government, a person is beyond and unfit for work and incapable of maintaining himself at the age of 65 years.  Then, we have the span of five years left during which people are to live on air or charity.  We cannot have two heads on the coin we toss.  We have got to face up to the problem of settling what the cost of maintenance is for an adult and a juvenile.  Seeing that the State takes to itself the right to ascertain the means that a person enjoys, at least <Col N="2014" /> that figure fixed as the cost of maintenance should be paid out.</P>
    <P>I should rather face up to this question in a way different from that in which we are asked to face up to it here.  We are asked here to approach a big national question, which requires investigation, by a number of individual, jerky motions, each motion dealing only with a symptom of the disease and none dealing with the disease as a whole.  Surely, we have reached a stage of development at which we can afford to lean back and see how the machine is working, whether the machine is defective or whether parts of it are overlapping. Surely, we have reached a time when there should be some experienced or authoritative commission or committee to investigate the whole question with a view to making recommendations.  I am never much impressed by arguments as to what certain other countries are doing.  When that kind of argument is used in Parliament, the Minister always staggers into the Dáil, carrying a number of papers, to tell us what other countries are not doing.  If certain countries are doing better than we are, there are as many others doing worse.  That type of argument does not get us very far.  I should like to see, in the first place, agreement on the point that what was considered reasonable when the cost of living was considerably less, cannot be considered reasonable at the present moment. With the development of social services&mdash;employment assistance, a type of unemployment insurance, development of the home help scheme, children's allowances and issue of blind pensions&mdash;there is at present a multiplicity of Departments, under different direction, all doling out tiny, little sums.  Part of the activity of the type of committee or commission I suggest should be directed towards making recommendations to co-ordinate and bring under a common head and common Department all these comparatively small activities.  That would lead to a very big reduction in overhead costs.  It would lead to easier administration and, above all, it would lead to an easing of the amount of annoyance and irritation caused to <Col N="2015" /> humble people by having a multiplicity of inspectors, each coming to investigate means, health or employment, under different schemes, under one Government administering a tiny island such as this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. T. Murphy Mr. T. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>A very large volume of support for such proposals as are outlined in this motion is provided by the news appearing in the papers this morning.  There is to be a revolutionary scheme of social progress in Great Britain, based on the adoption of the entire plan prepared by Sir William Beveridge.  I do not suggest that all that is outlined in that scheme, or, indeed, a great part of it, is possible of early attainment here, but I suggest that the move made ought to set all Parties in this House thinking and all representatives here thinking as to when a positive but modest step in that direction will be made here. Has the Minister made up his mind that it is time that some move was made to assist this very deserving and estimable class of the community?  The case for a substantial improvement in their position, if the Minister is not prepared to concede in full the demands in this motion, is unanswerable. Take the case of an old age pensioner who drew 10/- a week in 1939.  Without involved mathematical calculations, one finds that that 10/- would have to be increased to 17/- to enable that pensioner to maintain the standard that was then maintainable on 10/-.  That is a fair indication of the need for a change.  Surely nobody in this House or outside will, at this stage, defend the means test associated with old age pensions.  If a person be in possession of means in excess of £15 per annum, he cannot get a pension of 10/- a week.  Nobody will say that that standard is not in present circumstances antiquated.  There must be complete unanimity that the means test calls for immediate revision, so that a good deal of the injustice that arises when a person is precluded from obtaining an old age pension because his all-in means exceed £39 may be removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am of opinion that a means test must be associated with old age pensions, <Col N="2016" /> and I am not ashamed to say that I also believe that there should be a means test for children's allowances. That is my personal view.  I adhere to it, because I strongly believe that we must have some means test in connection with old age pensions.  But I put it to the Minister that the time has come when the means test should be revised, and a substantial approach made to the demand formulated in the motion, if the Minister is not prepared to go the whole way.  It is obvious that the Minister has had reason to give some thought to this matter, because it is one that has for some time past agitated the members of local authorities, as well as people in touch with the needs of the poor.  In fact, many local authorities have had to relieve old age pensioners out of home assistance funds.  Some two or three years before the emergency old age pensioners were getting 2/- or 3/- weekly in certain parts as home assistance. Nobody can suggest that home assistance is given on lavish or generous lines.  There is a rigid means test by officials of local authorities, and by county managers, and they were convinced that these pensioners needed assistance out of local funds. There is a complete case for getting ahead with the work of providing an additional measure of independence for old people.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the emergency old age pensions allowances that were granted, and to express my entire dissatisfaction with the scheme and with the whole position that has arisen in respect to it.  Applicants for old age pensions have to satisfy a means test before being entitled to get 10/- weekly.  If such people applied for emergency old age pensions allowances they have to satisfy a further rigid means test to establish their claims.  These allowances are paid on the basis of 80 per cent. subsidy from national funds, and 20 per cent. subsidy from local rates.  There is no doubt about this fact, that the test for getting these allowances is the test for home assistance or, in other words, for something approaching destitution. I do not think the Minister would justify that situation as the best that <Col N="2017" /> this State could do for the old people. A most extraordinary position has arisen in connection with these additional allowances.  There have been so many applications of obvious merit, that the number of allowances granted exceeded the total sum available in a particular county.  As a result there has since been a revision of the allowances granted and, as Deputy Keyes pointed out, a cutting off of allowances in some cases, where two old people living in the same house were in receipt of them.  When an old man received 10/- weekly, and where an old woman received 10/- weekly, if both got emergency allowances of 2/6, the position now is that the emergency allowance is withdrawn in one case, but is continued to whoever is head of the house.  There is also an urgent need for revising the age of eligibility for the old age pension.  There can be no doubt about this, that there is a sound case for reducing the age from 70 to 65.  I agree that the argument used in respect of any claim for social advancement is that it is a financial problem, but the Minister must now be convinced that all sections, even those who on former occasions did an injustice to old age pensioners, would be willing to bear any reasonable sacrifice that a belated measure of justice to the old people would demand.</P>
    <P>I confess I was disappointed with the speech of Deputy O'Higgins.  He suggested very properly that there should be an amalgamation of social services, so that overlapping and wasteful or extravagent administration in certain respects might be done away with.  That is going to take a considerable time.  Demands for coordination of that kind, which were frequently made in the past, would not be in any way weakned by tackling this question now.  As we know from experience during the last 20 years committees and commissions of inquiry take years to arrive at a conclusion following their deliberations. I do not think these people, as Deputy O'Higgins suggested, can afford to wait while prolonged investigations are being made.</P>
    <P>I admit that the case for the amalgamation of social services is a good one, and that the whole question must be <Col N="2018" /> examined in that light some time; but the question now is the urgent need of these old age pensioners.  There is also the unsatisfactory manner in which the meagre allowances granted recently have been paid, the dissatisfaction that exists, and the terrible increase in the cost of living.  I suggest that this is a motion to which the Minister ought to give sympathetic attention, and ought to be prepared to indicate his willingness to go a very considerable distance towards meeting, if he is not prepared to meet it in full.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Government have no case at all in relation to the matter of the age limit, in view of the fact that it was they who brought legislation into the House which makes it compulsory on a civil servant to retire on pension at that age.  Surely the Minister must realise that the old age pensioners in the country district, the men and women who spend their lives working hard on the land, the people who work the spade, the shovel and the slean; who work, in many cases, 12 and 14 hours a day, and produce food for the country under all sorts of weather and hardship, are not the people who could possibly continue to work after the age of 65.</P>
      <P>If the people who, as one might say, work in luxury, who never have to face the elements, but who have merely to sit at a desk and use a fountain pen for their livelihoods, are deemed not to be fit for work after the age of 65, surely the people on whose behalf I speak are not capable of working after that age.  Whatever is to be said about the amount of money asked in the motion, although I am in favour of it, I am quite sure the Minister will agree with our views about the age limit.  I cannot for the life of me see how he can object to accepting that part of the motion, and I expect him to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One other matter which I cannot understand is the means test as at present operated.  Under that means test, a man has to prove that he is a beggar before he can get consideration. The officials come in to a man in the country and actually count the number of hens.  They look around to see if there is any possible way in which they <Col N="2019" /> can put a halfpenny on his income in an effort to prevent him getting the pension.  I am a member of an old age pensions committee, and I was more than surprised at one thing I heard no later than yesterday.  An old age pensioner happened to have a little money in the bank, and the pensions officer set down the income from that little sum of £80 at 5 per cent., whereas he was in fact getting only I per cent. That is outrageous.  I feel that the Minister, who is more reasonable than a good many others, will do something with regard to these matters of the age limit and the means test now being operated.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I want to draw the Minister's attention is that, in North Galway, where there are small valuations of £5, £6 and £10, it is terrible that a father or mother must sign the little holding over to a son if there is to be any use in their applying for the pension.  Not only that, but the son must get married, or it will be said that the signing over of the holding was a trick.  I have come across cases in my own area of applicants being turned down because the son did not get married.  Surely the Act never intended that a person should not get a pension because his or her son would not get married?</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister will have no objection to the part of the motion which deals with the age limit, although the usual question: &ldquo;Where is the money to come from?&rdquo; will be asked.  We will be asked if we want to tax this, that or the other, which is the cry always raised when any effort is made to help the poor and needy; but when the civil servant, who is well able to continue working after the age of 65, is compelled by law to retire at that age, we hear no cry about where the money is to come from.  We were told it was well he should go at that age in order to make room for others and to help the unemployment position. The vast bulk of the old age pensioners are people who work on the land.  They slave on up to 70 years, 75 years and some even to 80 years of age.  They have, as a matter of fact, to continue working until the day they die, and if some of these people had <Col N="2020" /> some little hope of a pension at the age of 65, they might take things a little easier and so help the unemployment position.</P>
    <P>If we are not able to afford £1 per week to people in the rural areas, who comprise the majority of old age pensioners, after they reach the age of 65, it is a shame for us, because they are the people who produce the food and do all the slaving.  The other classes are only the people who give the orders, and it is much easier to give the orders than to carry them out. These people in the rural areas are the people who do the work, and I think it would be setting a good example if the motion were passed unanimously.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy O'Higgins speaking on the motion and thought it rather strange that he should be for it and against it.  So far as the old age pensioner is concerned, neither the present nor previous Governments gave them fair play or any real consideration. We have only to look back to the time when an attempt was made to take 1/- from them.  People tried to defend that attempt in the country, and I want to tell the Minister's Party that the action of another Party at that time went a long way towards placing the Minister and his Government in power to-day.  They themselves came along and said that the 10/- pension would be given to everybody, but, instead, not even the full 10/- was given, because, by reason of this low means test, the amount in the ordinary case is 5/- or 6/-.  I ask the Minister to remember that it was the bad treatment of this section by another Party which probably gave him and his Party the opportunity of being the Government of the country for a good number of years.</P>
    <P>I will ask him seriously to consider this matter, not that I say he may do it altogether for the sake of vote-catching, or anything like that&mdash;of course, politicians do not do those things, I know.  I believe that so far as the age limit is concerned, he and his Party will be unanimous.  Speaking on behalf of the group I represent, the people on the land, I may say that it is their wish, and this motion will have our unanimous support.  We feel it is <Col N="2021" /> a long-felt want, and we feel it is one thing that is lacking in this country.</P>
    <P>There is not enough respect for the aged and the poor.  If it was any section of the community other than the aged and the poor, I have no doubt there would be many a cry raised in this House for them.  If it was any other section of the community, such as the teachers' organisation, or other such organisation&mdash;not that I wish to belittle that profession&mdash;I believe their case would be made here in a very sound fashion.  I appeal to the Minister to grant what is asked in this motion, pensions at the age of 65 years of £1 a week, and also the abolition of the means test.  If it is at all possible, the means test should go.  I am in favour of its abolition.  The Government are not asked in this motion to abolish it and I am really sorry that that is so.  If the Government were asked to abolish it, that proposal would have the support of our Party.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <P>The point I want to get at is why, with such a large amount of temporary capital there, which apparently has to be paid back, it is proposed to go in for additional temporary capital.  The Minister said it was desirable not to have too large an amount of permanent capital in the company; that capital of this kind was necessary because it was expended and left no assets.  Take the present £9,000,000 odd debenture capital.  There is a lot of that not backed in any way by fixed assets of any kind.  If, on top of that, we have additional capital of a debenture kind that is going to produce fixed assets, on what is the new fixed debenture capital to be expended? If the Minister replies that it will be used for replacements, I did not understand from him whether it would be used to replace capital or to replace the actual fabric of the railway company.  It is a matter upon which <Col N="2022" /> we ought to have some information, because I think that with the enormous amount of debentures there already the idea of additional temporary capital to be added is a thing that would require some explanation. It seems to me to be objectionable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the primary reasons why it is provided that all debenture stock should be redeemable is because it is necessary to fix a limit in time to the State's liability.  Ordinary prudent financial procedure would suggest that the State should not enter into a contingent liability without a time limit.  I said the normal company procedure would appear to require that fixed assets should be represented by permanent capital subscribed upon ordinary shares, shares which would earn a dividend only when a profit was made, and that loan capital would normally be secured upon the fixed assets created out of the ordinary capital but would be required for other purposes than the type of capital expenditure which was represented in buildings and permanent plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this case you have the company constituted with a comparatively small amount in ordinary shares or common stock and a large amount represented by redeemable debentures.  To understand the position properly it is necessary to remember the history of the undertaking.  The undertaking is one in which a very large amount of money was originally invested, a substantial part of which must be regarded as lost, because it is represented by branch lines closed and abandoned and stock and equipment which are no longer of first-class utility.  The stock and equipment may be in use at the moment, because it is not possible to replace them, but if we are to have an efficient transport system after the war, we must contemplate that a considerable part of the existing equipment will be replaced by more efficient equipment and on the construction or purchase of that more efficient equipment capital expenditure will be incurred. That capital expenditure will not, in fact, be adding to the fixed assets of the company; it will be a replacement of assets rather than an <Col N="2023" /> addition, although there will be some additional assets secured.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Take the rolling stock, for example.  If, as is probable, it is regarded as desirable and necessary to replace the existing rolling stock either by rolling stock of a different character or more up-to-date design or a different composition of some kind, then clearly that capital expenditure is of the kind that should be repaid out of the earnings of that new equipment, if in fact there are earnings sufficient for the purpose.  The intention is that the company should redeem the loan capital out of its earnings. In so far as the loan capital is represented by substituted debenture stock, it is under an obligation to effect its redemption after a definite period of time.  For new debentures the circumstances of the issue of the stock will have to be determined and the redemption period will be fixed in relation to the type of expenditure in which it is proposed to engage.  If the company were proposing to borrow an amount of money for the purpose of erecting new stations, presumably the repayment period would be fixed on a different basis than if the money were borrowed merely to replace existing rolling stock which normally would have a shorter life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot determine in advance the circumstances in which new capital expenditure will be incurred and, therefore, the terms will be fixed at the time of issue by the Minister for Finance and they will be fixed in relation to the type of expenditure contemplated. In the case of the existing debenture stock, there is proposed in the Bill an obligation to redeem that stock within a definite period.  It is intended that this company should so conduct its affairs that in the course of 15 years or so, that is by 1960, when the substituted debenture stock will be due for redemption, its capital liability will be reduced in or around £10,000,000.  If the company succeeds in doing that, then at some later stage I would imagine that the management <Col N="2024" /> of the company at that time, in consultation with the Government then in office, might regard it as a desirable arrangement that the whole of the outstanding debentures should be liquidated and replaced by a common stock, so that the company would, in fact, have no loan capital, that its capital liability would be represented by its common stock only and there would be no interest charge.</P>
    <P>In answer to the Deputy's question, first of all the reason why it is intended to make the debentures redeemable is because it is considered desirable that there should be a limit in time to the State's liability, just as there is a limit in amount to the State's liability; and secondly, because we regard it as a sounder method of financing this undertaking having regard to all the circumstances.</P>

      <P>There is just a point to which I want to refer in regard to the wording.  I am not a lawyer, so I am not presuming to dictate to the Minister on the matter, but I cannot see that this phrase &ldquo;including substituted debenture stock&rdquo; does mean what the Minister intends it to mean. Should he not put in the word &ldquo;original&rdquo;?  Apparently the Minister means that the debenture stock will include the amount of the original substituted debenture stock, although some of it may have been redeemed?</P>

We consider that that amount should be enough; therefore, it is the maximum amount we are proposing to guarantee.  Probably a large part of the additional expenditure which the company must undertake will be financed out of revenue.  As the House is aware, the company appropriated to depreciation last year a sum in excess of half a million pounds. It is not intended that that amount should be put into a bank and left lying there.  It will be utilised for the purpose of financing some of the replacement of stock which is contemplated.</P>

I expressed the view that electrification by means of a third rail or overhead wire&mdash;that was the type of development adopted pre-war&mdash;in relation to the main lines of the company is extremely improbable.

There is no necessity for me to refer to documents going back as far as 1931 or 1932 or 1933.  I could quote a speech made by the Minister every year since he became Minister to confirm my statement&mdash;the Minister will not deny it, at any rate&mdash;that the transport policy of the Fianna Fáil Party was to devise a unification scheme under a policy of public ownership.  This is a complete reversal of everything the Minister has said on behalf of his Government in connection with their policy on transport, and even of what he said here on the opposition side of the House.</P>

It proposes to give a guarantee on behalf of the taxpayers, possibly involving them to the extent of £16,000,000, to bolster up and modernise the transport system, and at the end of a certain period to hand it over to the common stockholders of the company.  Is there any scheme to compare with this in any other country where a democratic Government exists to-day?  There are certain aspects of this section that are very closely related to the Fascist policy as exposed after Mussolini became Head of the Government of Italy many years ago.

      <P>The more we go ahead with this, the more I feel, every time I get up, that I must make an additional protest at the manner in which this Bill is presented to us.  The Minister has said a few things just now which, if we relate them to one another, make the position more obscure.  He stated, as far as I can understand it, that by 1960 he expects the capital of this company to be about £10,000,000.  He said, when considering the issue of additional debenture stock, that it was thought that £6,000,000 would be the outside necessary for all contingencies.  When we arrive at 1960 and we have the capital of the company £10,000,000, if £3,500,000 of that is common stock, then there is room for £6,500,000 debentures.</P>
      <P>But, as against that £6,500,000, we have to picture the £9,800,000 substituted debentures that will exist when the company is formed and the additional capital that may be required for some of the developments the Minister spoke about&mdash;up to £6,000,000, let us say.  Now, the £6,500,000 that is left of debenture stock in the £10,000,000 has to be juxtaposed in some way or another to the £9,500,000 of the debenture stock that will exist when the company is formed and whatever additional sum is added.  If, say, £3,000,000 is the amount of additional debentures created for the purpose of carrying out the additional work, then there can be only £3,500,000 of the £9,500,000 substituted debentures left there and it implies that £6,000,000 of that £9,500,000 would be paid off out of the capital.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but they allocated £500,000 for wiping off capital&mdash;or debts&mdash;at a time when their charges were of a shocking kind and were a shocking burden to the commercial community here and were a very big factor in raising the cost of living on the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must remember this about railway charges: railway charges have been fixed, since railways were first built, on the principle of charging what the traffic will bear.  That is the phrase in many countries which dominated the minds of the railway operators&mdash;the principle of &ldquo;charging what the traffic will bear&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the principle on which railway management worked and it seems to me very largely the only principle on which it can work. Conceivably, at certain times, railways may charge less than what the traffic will bear, in order to encourage a particular development, which ultimately will redound to their profit, or for some other point of policy.  In practice, however, in normal times, traffic will not move at all, or move only very sluggishly, if the charges are too high.  Charges, therefore, are so related to the requirements of the company and the nature of the traffic <Col N="2031" /> as to ensure that the maximum transportation will occur, yielding maximum revenue for the transport undertaking. In 1929, the Railway Tribunal determined a series of charges for the Great Southern Railways.  It was obliged by the 1924 Act to relate those charges to the standard revenue previously determined by the tribunal under that Act. The charges had to be such as to yield a standard pre-determined revenue. The charges then determined have not been exceeded even during the war. The charges which the Railway Tribunal regarded as practicable in 1929 have not been exceeded now, despite the higher costs temporarily in operation. In fact, from 1929 up to the outbreak of the war the company never succeeded in making those charges effective, because they were more than the traffic could bear and they had continuously to appeal to the Railway Tribunal to let them charge less than the standard charges, because the traffic would only bear less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Minister does agree that the luxury article bears a higher rate&mdash;Guinness' porter as against potatoes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Deputy Hughes talked about sending diamonds by the railway.  The railway could charge rates per ton for diamonds far higher than for potatoes.  The railways revenue is not determined by its rates policy, but by the facilities it provides. If it provides adequate facilities for those who have goods to transport, then it will be able to make more effective the railway charges which will be more remunerative to itself.  It is far more important that the railway should provide fast efficient services, the type of services the public wants, not merely the transportation of goods from station to station but perhaps from door to door, faster transportation, the type of re-organisation under which they will avoid delays in traffic and the loss to shippers and to traders which those delays involve.  Any cattle trader will talk about fast cattle specials and the deterioration that takes place in the value of stock when transportation is <Col N="2032" /> delayed.  It is the facilities rather than the rating policy that determines revenue and the purpose of this company will be to ensure that far better facilities will be provided than in the past and, if they are provided, the company will be able to make the rates effective and get the revenue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  The railway company found it easier to get traffic during the war, because there was less competition.  After the war, the company will have to compete not with other public transport operators but with private transport. I said before that I, as an individual, if engaged in some trade which involved a lot of travelling, would buy a car and travel in it, if it were cheaper and more convenient to do so than to avail of public services, but if the public services were substantially cheaper and equally convenient, in so far as they served every place I wanted to go, and were equally speedy, then naturally I would be inclined to avail of the public services in preference.  In goods transport, the same applies, only much more definitely so, in the case of the private trader who might buy a lorry for the removal of his goods.  Again, he will be influenced by the comparative economic advantages of having his own lorry or availing of the public transport service.  If the company cannot in fact provide for most classes of traffic a better and cheaper service than the individual can supply, I do not think it will have a future at all except to a very limited extent.  It is in the belief that it can do so in relation to very large classes of traffic, if not for all classes of traffic, that faith in the future of this company is founded.</P>

      <P>The Minister can have it whatever way he likes, but the motto that is going to be printed over the doors of the new transport company is: &ldquo;We will charge whatever the traffic will bear.&rdquo;  To show what a just and reasonable thing that is, what a proper and excellent thing, the Minister points out that last year they were able to put £500,000 to wiping out debts of one particular kind or another, at a time when, as I say, businessmen were being charged such shocking freight rates that they felt there must be business in it and invested money in this particular company.</P>
      <P>Again, on the Minister's theory, you are driven back to a consideration of what the Transport Tribunal, in 1939, said with regard to the Dublin United Tramways Company:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We are of opinion that the company should not be empowered to charge such fares as may be necessary to earn a net revenue sufficiently large to enable this proposal to be carried out.  In our opinion it is unreasonable to expect that for the next ten years the community residing in the areas served by the company should be obliged to pay, not only for the current cost of provision of the services placed at its disposal by the company ... but also to provide out of current revenue in such a short period so substantial a sum as £1,100,000.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We are being told quite pleasantly and openly by the Minister that under the scheme he is proposing here, whereby the transport company is going to charge what the traffic will bear, they are going to take, between this and 1960, £9,500,000 more than it would be necessary to take.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (2) (a), line 8, to delete the figures &ldquo;1955&rdquo; and substitute therefore the figures &ldquo;1945&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Sub-section (2) says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The following provisions shall apply in relation to the redemption of substituted debenture stock, that is to say&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  it may be redeemed at par in cash on the 30th day of June, 1955, or an any 31st day of December, or 30th day of June thereafter.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>My amendment would have the effect of making that read that it may be redeemed at par in cash on the 30th day of June, 1945.  It is bad enought to be resurrecting the Great Southern Railways Company stock at its full nominal value.  It is more undesirable in the circumstances in which the country generally is, to leave that stock there up to 1955, without a chance of redeeming it on better terms.  I am not quite clear as to the effect of the phrase, &ldquo;It may be redeemed at par in cash on the 30th day of June, 1955&rdquo; but if it would prevent the redemption of these debentures at a date earlier than that, I would object to it, because I think the country will wake up some day to see the mess that this represents, and will realise that if the British Government can get the money it requires for national work, to the extent of thousands of millions, at, say, 1.8 per cent., we cannot afford to pay at the rate of 3 per cent. for the carrying on of very necessary services here.</P>

      <P>As I read the sub-section it would prevent the debentures being redeemed until the 30th day of June, 1955, and the Bill provides that 3 per cent. will have to be paid, with a Government guarantee, on the debentures as long as they exist. I believe that we may be driven, by a clearer view of the situation, to changing radically the control of the railway company before 1955 and to <Col N="2035" /> clearing out these debentures and replacing them by cash, or in some other way, which could be got at less than 3 per cent. for such an important purpose as transport.  In order that we should have a free hand in that matter, I am anxious that any obstruction, which is implied in the sub-section as it stands, that would prevent these debentures being redeemed before 1955, should be removed.</P>

      <P>The position is that the company is given power to redeem these debentures at par, compulsorily, after 1955.  It can call in the stock and pay off the owners of it at par.  It may redeem the debenture stock, under Section 21, before 1955, subject to these conditions, that it shall not pay more than the redemption price for the stock; and it must redeem the debentures before 1960.  I do not see that the change proposed by Deputy Mulcahy would effect any purpose except to increase the market price of the railway debentures by about five points to-morrow.  If we accept the amendment, the company will be in no better position to redeem the stock than if the Bill is left as it is.  What we propose is that the company shall establish a redemption fund and it may use that to redeem these stocks.</P>

Of course, we could compel people to provide capital, and compel them to take whatever interest we liked to give on that capital. We could propose to give 1½ per cent. or 1 per cent., but I do not think it is desirable that we should do that.

      <P>The only thing to be said about capital is that it is money that has been saved for the purpose of investment, and people will only invest capital&mdash;in other words, the money they have saved&mdash;on the understanding that they will get some return for the money they consider worth while.  Let us suppose that I have won £100 from the sweep&mdash;I have not won it, by the way, but suppose that I did win £100 in the sweep&mdash;I can save up that money, by putting it in the bank, or I can spend it on furniture, clothes, or other articles, which I think I may need.  In other words, I can consume that amount of money within a month or six months, according to my desires, and I should be tempted to do that if there was nothing to be gained by keeping the money; but if, instead of spending the money on these things and getting its immediate benefit, I found that I could invest it in some stock which would pay 3 per cent., 4 per cent., or 5 per cent., then I might say that it would be better to have £3, £4 or £5 per year for my money than to blow in the whole £100 on furniture, clothing, and so on.  Of course, the interest rate on investments varies from time to time.  Everyone realises that.  At the present time, you can borrow money on gilt-edged securities at 3 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In this country.  You can ascertain, from stock exchange quotations of any type, what the rates of interest are&mdash;the rates at which people are prepared to invest money. At the present time, Government 3½ per cent. stock stands above par and people will lend money at above 3 per cent.  Some people will say that they do not want a gilt-edged security&mdash;a security that is beyond any risk&mdash;and that they will be prepared to take a chance in some particular concern because it may pay a bigger rate of interest.  Such a person <Col N="2038" /> may say: &ldquo;I shall get 6 per cent. or 8 per cent. by investing in this or that concern,&rdquo; but that higher rate of interest is offset by the greater risk which these people take.</P>
      <P>We think that we can get money at 3 per cent., and that is what is in the Bill.  We are proposing that the debentures of the Great Southern Railways Company, which were issued at 4 per cent., will be replaced by 3 per cent. stock.  The new stock may be issued at more, but we are only proposing to guarantee 3 per cent.  Now, what is the effect of the amendment that is proposed here?  It means that the stock may be compulsorily redeemed in 1945, instead of in 1955.  If we were to adopt this amendment, it would mean that Great Southern debentures, which are now at 95, would be 99 tomorrow.  It will influence the market, but will not be of any help to the new company.  I think that the proposal in the Bill is a much better scheme than that suggested by Deputy Mulcahy.</P>

      <P>To delete sub-section (2) (b).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment and Nos. 32 and 33, with the consequential, No. 34, meet much the same point and, I suppose, can be taken together.  However, this amendment approaches the question from a different angle.  As the measure stands, in respect of substituted debenture stock, the Bill says that it may be redeemed, at par, in cash, by the 30th June, 1960, and the Bill then goes <Col N="2039" /> on to say that if it is not redeemed before the 30th day of June, 1960, it shall be redeemed at par in cash on that date.  I do not see why it is necessary to put this compulsory business in.  Of course, the answer may be made that it is necessary to put in some date as the appropriate date, and that, therefore, 1960 is a convenient date, but I want to know why 1960 has been chosen as the appropriate date, and why it is necessary to insist on a date being put in.  If there is power to redeem substituted debenture stock, as is provided in paragraph (a) of sub-section (2), and if the company is doing well and is in a position to pay off capital liabilities, it will probably do so; but supposing that the company meets hard times, that there is a deficit in its finances, a falling off in trade, employment troubles, and all the rest of it, what is to happen then?</P>
    <P>Suppose that occurs in connection with the railway system, why should they be tied down to a redemption date which we fix in 1944, that is 16 years hence?  It may be that there are reasons, which the Minister will give us to prove that if everything goes well, and according to expectations, the whole of the capital&mdash; that is the substitute debentures&mdash; ought to be repaid.  The Minister cannot tell what fluctuations may take place in the meantime.  At the moment, the world is in a highly disorganised state, and no one can foretell what may happen in the next five or six years, not to speak of the next 16 years.  If this paragraph were omitted altogether it will not prevent the company from redeeming whenever they can do it.  The only point is that as it stands it binds them to a particular redemption date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue that is raised here is the question whether it is desirable that the company should be allowed to carry this capital liability for any protracted period.  Let us try to consider the position of this company. We have not got for it the type of balance sheet that we have for the <Col N="2040" /> Dublin United Transport Company, but if such a balance sheet were prepared there would be on one side of it the existing capital liabilities&mdash;or for Córas Iompair Éireann the capital liabilities contemplated by this Bill&mdash; and on the other side certain assets. These assets will take the form of land, buildings of various kinds, rolling stock and similar equipment, road vehicles and other transportable property. There will be some item representing good will.  Clearly, there must be, because the company has, as we know, engaged in considerable expenditure upon the acquisition and extinction of other transport licences.  There may have been other expenditure which is not represented by any fixed assets, but clearly that expenditure is not represented by any fixed assets.  Now, it is undesirable from our point of view that unremunerative assets of that kind should be carried for any length of time in the company's balance sheet. It may be that a proper valuation of the fixed assets will, in relation to the total nominal capital liability of the company, mean that the good-will item will not be very considerable.  Let us, therefore, turn to consider what those other fixed assets are.  They will be represented by the permanent way&mdash; the line&mdash;by a number of stations, by goods yards, workshops and rolling stock.  I think it is clear, if this company is going to be in a position to attract traffic to it, it must provide the efficient transport service that we contemplate.  To do so, a great many of the stations must be reconstructed; possibly the goods yards will have to be reorganised to make more economical working possible.  Certainly, a large part of the rolling stock will have to be scrapped and replaced by rolling stock of a different type.  A lot of its existing assets will, in fact, have to be replaced by corresponding, and more efficient, assets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear, therefore, that this £9,800,000 of a debenture liability, with which the company will start, will be represented on the other side of the balance sheet by a number of assets that will have to disappear, and with them should disappear the capital disability attaching thereto.  The view, <Col N="2041" /> therefore, is that the aim should be to effect an amortisation of that capital in 15 years.  We believe it is possible to do that; that the new system of working which can be brought into operation will permit of economies, apart altogether from the increased revenue that may come from increased business which will enable the redemption fund to be built up, to amortise that capital.  There will be new capital expenditure incurred, represented by new debentures in respect of which the obligation to redeem at par in cash in 1960 will not apply.  There will be some other redemption date, but it will not necessarily be that date.  In regard to the capital liability represented by the new assets that will flow therefrom, the intention is that a situation should be reached in which the obligation to pay interest upon the capital, represented by displaced assets, will no longer devolve on the company.  Deputy Davin appears to think that it will redound to the benefit of the common stockholders.  It is not intended that it should.  It is intended that the full benefit of the amortisation of capital, and the release from the obligation to pay interest on capital, will redound to the transport users, and in order to effect that we are fixing in the Bill a statutory limit on the dividends that can be paid to the ordinary stockholders. No matter how profitable the company's enterprise may become, the company cannot pay more than 6 per cent to the common stockholders.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, if the Deputy will remember, the 6 per cent. which was mentioned in the excess profits tax provision in the Finance Act was subsequently changed to 9 per <Col N="2042" /> cent., and many industries say that on the 9 per cent. they cannot pay a dividend. That, however, has nothing whatever to do with this.  Normally, people would be very slow, if not completely unwilling, to invest their money in common stock on which a dividend of not more than 6 per cent. would be paid, because, unlike preference or guaranteed debenture stock, there is, of course, no certainty that they will get any dividends at all.  There may be years in which they will get no dividends. Naturally, therefore, the investor in common stock will say, &ldquo;In return for bad years there may be years in which the stock will earn 8, 10 or 12 per cent.&rdquo;, and in practice 10 per cent. would not be regarded as an unreasonable dividend on common stock, having regard to the risk which the investor takes&mdash;the years in which he will get no dividend at all.</P>
      <P>Those who want the greater security of guaranteed or debenture stock will have to be satisfied, in normal practice, with the lower rate of interest. In this particular case, we are proposing to fix a dividend limit.  The intention of that is to ensure that when the stage is reached at which the company will have amortised its substitute debenture stock, and will have released itself from the interest charges attaching thereto, the additional revenue available will accrue not to the common stockholders but to the transport users, a benefit which will be represented either in a reduction of fares or in improved facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, to get back to the main issue involved here, the question which the House has to decide is whether the obligation completely to wipe out the £9,800,000 of substitute debenture stock in 16 years is too heavy an obligation to put on the company: whether we should prolong the period of redemption to the year 2,000, or prolong it indefinitely, and permit the company to carry that capital liability and pay interest upon that capital for a longer period, instead of the company so conducting its affairs that surplus revenue will be used exclusively for the redemption of this stock.  We believe that the sounder system of finance&mdash;even though it may <Col N="2043" /> be regarded as conservative and may involve that major effects of reorganisation will not be experienced by the people of this country for some years to come &mdash;is to put that obligation on the company, the obligation to build up out of revenue a redemption fund to enable that capital liability to be wiped out and these interest charges to be got rid of.  The assets which that capital now represents will disappear and be replaced by the new assets to which the new capital liability attaches.  That is the principle of finance which we are establishing in the Bill.  I am interested to know that it is Deputy McGilligan who is proposing a less conservative system of finance because, even though this may be regarded as conservative, it is not as conservative as the finance of the Electricity Supply Board.</P>

I contemplate that the company will have that obligation and that the chairman, who will be appointed by the Government, will be told that we expect the company fully to discharge the obligation.  If there should come about economic conditions so entirely abnormal that it would be unreasonable to expect the company to discharge the obligation in full, or if it could not possibly do so, I think we, as legislators, should meet here again and reconsider the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Leave out the emergency conditions and consider what was done by the Dublin United Transport Company before 1939.  Most of the changes which are now bearing so much fruit for that company were brought into operation before 1939 and were producing results for the company before 1939.  They were able in that period to get rid of very heavy debenture liabilities, acquired in the past, which were represented by no fixed assets in the company's ownership. As I told the House, even at the present time, goodwill represents 60 per cent. of the total assets in the company's balance sheet.  The company was able to effect a considerable improvement in the services it was giving to the public; it was able to effect a considerable improvement in the wages and conditions of employment of its workers and it was able to do all that without increasing the fares.  Between the commencement of the period of re-organisation and 1939 there was a reduction of fares.  I do not want to over-stress that because the House will remember that the company had a prolonged strike in 1935.  That resulted in the award of an increase of wages to its workers.  Not only did the company suffer a substantial loss during the period of the strike but it had to meet the amount of the increased wages to its workers.  Arising out of that, the company decided to increase its fares.  When re-organisation was entered upon at a later period, the <Col N="2045" /> view was taken by the directors that it had been unwise to increase the fares.  That was, I think, a very wise view.  The fares reverted to their original levels and, since then, there has been no increase.  Despite that, the company was able to effect these improved services, improve conditions of employment, with enhanced benefits and pensions, for its workers, and wipe out a substantial capital liability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There was some curtailment of the stages since the emergency by Government Order.  That was for the purpose of economy in petrol, tyres, and other equipment. The company should be blamed only for what it did of its own accord, not for what it was obliged to do by Government regulation.  If we were to go outside this country, we could get examples to support our belief that, by reorganisation, economies can be effected which will enable this capital liability to be wiped out while, at the same time, the general condition of the company will be improved, as in the case of the Dublin United Transport Company.  There is, as we know, far greater scope for reorganisation in the case of the Great Southern Railways Company than there ever was in the case of the Dublin United Transport Company.  That being so, by use of the same methods, we believe we can get even more substantial results.  One cannot stress too much the experience of the war years, because they are abnormal, but it is a fact that, even in the war years, the application of better management has brought about a substantial improvement in the company's finances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me explain that it is not intended that the whole of the new capital <Col N="2046" /> expenditure which the company will undertake will be financed by the issue of new debenture stock.  To the greatest possible extent, the company should utilise its surplus revenue to meet that type of expenditure and resort only to the issue of new stock when that course is unavoidable.  New stock represents a permanent liability, whereas expenditure out of current revenue does not.  I find it hard to make a convincing case that the company can, in fact, effect this amortisation of substituted debenture stock by 1960.  We believe it can.  We believe that it should be required to do so, that it is sounder policy to place that obligation upon it than to lengthen the period or release the company from the obligation completely.  Our belief that the company can do this while providing better transport services for the public must, naturally, be related to something approaching normal conditions. If conditions should be so abnormal that the company will be completely unable to earn the necessary revenue&mdash;without raising political issues I may say that I refer to something equivalent to the economic war, which, in 1932 and 1933, did, undoubtedly, affect this and other transport organisations&mdash;then, we should consider that position here, but we should place this obligation on the company now and expect it to discharge it.  We should be very slow to be convinced that such abnormal conditions had occurred as would justify us in releasing the company from that obligation.</P>

      <P>The revenue which remains after the expenses of working <Col N="2047" /> and fixed charges have been met.  The company will take in for the services which it renders a certain amount.  Part of that will go out in meeting the cost of providing those services&mdash;payment of wages, purchase of coal and other materials.  Over and above these working costs, there will be certain fixed charges&mdash;the interest charge on its debentures and certain other charges, such as the obligation which the company is undertaking in connection with its benefit scheme for employees. These charges will be met out of revenue.  At that stage, some revenue will be left.  Portion of that will have to be allocated to depreciation under the new system of financing which the company is adopting.</P>

I understand that it has made an arrangement with the Revenue Commissioners which involves the appropriation to depreciation every year of certain sums, instead of the old system of allocating from revenue certain sums to maintenance and renewals.  The depreciation fund will not, as I mentioned, be put on deposit in the bank.  It will be utilised to effect the type of reorganisation we contemplate.  The balance of the revenue will be available for the payment of dividend on the ordinary stock up to 6 per cent. or for whatever other purpose the company think fit to use it.  They can use it in lieu of incurring new capital liabilities or they can allocate it to the debenture fund or devote it to any other purpose permitted by law which appears, in the view of the directors, to be in the best interests of the company.</P>

      <P>The Minister has gone far outside the scope of the amendment I put down, but I may as well pursue the point now.  The Minister talked about the finances of the Electricity Supply Board concern and, in view of his last few <Col N="2048" /> words, it looks as if he was going to force upon this company the most conservative type of finance, which is probably that represented by the Electricity Supply Board.  It was the subject of comment in the Banking Commission's report that the Electricity Supply Board held obligations which no private company ever undertook, namely, amortisation, and at the same time the repair of wasting assets.  If that scheme were carried through as planned and was put into legislation under persuasion, it was because the public was misled, in the main by the Press into the belief that the whole thing was most fantastic. It was put in to secure public confidence, by being over cautious.  Under Electricity Supply Board finance, taking the average life of the plant as 33 years, the amazing situation aimed at in Electricity Supply Board legislation was that the people who get possession after 33 years will have a plant entirely free from debt, entirely modernised, and brought up to date. That is an amazing type of conservative finance.  No private company and few public companies had anything like that forced upon them.  From the Minister's last words I think something like that is going to be forced here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be achieved in the case of the Electricity Supply Board but for the emergency. What happened?  Consumers of electricity in this generation are paying charges which quite reasonably could be off-loaded on the next generation or on successive generations.  The reason <Col N="2049" /> for that was, firstly, the fear inculcated by the Press that the undertaking would not proceed successfully, and, secondly, there was the absurd idea amongst the public that there might be other ways of generating electricity than by hydro-electric power; that the whole Shannon business might become a back number, and that it was best to amortise the capital as quickly as possible.  Apparently we are setting out, not in a terribly well thought out way, to do much the same thing in relation to the railways.  I object to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next four or five years are going to be very critical ones in this country, and one of the things that the public will inquire into is the charges that passengers will have to pay for transport and that traders will have to pay for goods.  I do not think it will be possible under this Bill to give them a fair deal in the way of transport.  It is going to make it impossible to do so if the Minister sets out to depreciate the capital on some instalment system and, secondly, to insist on what was always regarded as a substituted type of railway finance, providing for renewals and repairs.  The second thing that arises in the amendment is that the Minister says that in so far as we can regard this substituted debenture stock as being represented by something in the nature of physical assets these assets are wasting, and will be disappearing as years go on. We are to have a policy of getting rid of the capital some day, by which time whatever life there is in the wasting assets of the railway company will have disappeared.  The position here is that there is a so-called redemption fund.  There need not be one penny in the redemption fund before 1960 yet, at one fell swoop, the company will be bound to redeem the whole amount on the 30th June, 1960.  One hopes that that will not occur.  The situation would be bad beyond the gloomiest fears if it had to do that.  If the Minister brought in some scheme where assets were valued, as far as the remnants of their life were concerned, and wrote off a certain amount of capital each year, according as the life of the assets disappeared, or was drawing <Col N="2050" /> towards a conclusion, I could understand it.  The situation is that there need not be anything put into the redemption fund for years, and that then the company could be forced to pay off the whole lot.  That is providing the back door is not open.  Of course there is a back door, which we discussed on Section 15.  There is no doubt that as far as two-thirds of this debenture capital is concerned the Minister for Finance can make more equitable terms, or terms more beneficial to the company than the terms in the sub-section.  He could take over and could associate with the debenture stocks which will be created, and pay off these debentures on easier terms than those here as far as redemption is concerned.  If the back door is not open then I think there is a very serious position facing the country.</P>
    <P>I saw a letter in the papers in which reference was made to the trains.  It contained a vivid description of the condition of an amount of the rolling stock.  I also saw reference to premises and to the trucks.  We know that the permanent way was under suspicion for a long time.  I am still suspicious as to how it was brought to the point of being given first-class certificate in such a short time.  The whole system has gone almost beyond redemption.  The chairman's statement did not produce any belief in the company's property when he said the permanent way and the rolling stock were not in good condition.  They would have to be brought into good condition. The company has to pay interest on debentures and has to redeem debentures, and presumably, if it is going to make a splash in Irish finance, will try to pay something on the common stock.  It has to pay a good deal of that out of taxed profits.</P>
    <P>The calculation I attempted to make the other evening seems to indicate that that is going to take £1,250,000. Outside the war years they never earned that or anything like it.  The average amount, after meeting working expenses, was about £400,000.  If they have to pay £1,125,000 they have nearly to treble the income and outside the war years they never earned it.  I object to a comparison with the <Col N="2051" /> war years.  The public are forced to travel by these conveyances.  They are allowed to exercise no discretion.  They are at the mercy of the charges imposed. Traders are also at the mercy of these charges and they are squealing about high charges.  Complaints have also been made to the Railway Tribunal.  I read of one where the secretary to the Minister for Finance described the whole thing as a blow aimed at the heart of a particular industry. We know the situation with regard to turf.  Transport affects us all.  I would rather have the system of putting repayment on the long finger than to force it at the cost of transport users or of the State.  That is why I want the clause left out.  If the money is there, and if there is good management, I hope the new directors will see that the money is paid when they can afford it, but I should like to give the same opportunity and enable them to reduce fares to attract more traffic to the railway system.  They may be prevented from doing that which, from a business point of view, they would like to do by the rigid finance shackles which we put in this section.</P>

      <P>I think that would be unwise.  I do not want to be taken as agreeing with the Deputy that the back-door to which he refers is there. I do not think it is.  The Deputy referred to the bad condition of the company's rolling stock.  That is precisely the fact with which we have to deal. That rolling stock has to be replaced. Deputy Davin has in mind the possibility that the railways may be electrified, and, without appearing to convey in the slightest the suggestion that there has been any decision to do so, let us proceed to imagine for a moment that that is, in fact, the decision of the board at some future date.  What happens? They decide that they have to get a new lot of engines, carriages and equipment of the kind and that all the old engines and carriages have to be scrapped.</P>

If the company says: &ldquo;We can afford to spend new capital on this equipment to replace existing equipment,&rdquo; we can say to them: &ldquo;Yes, we will agree to your doing so, on condition that, first, the additional revenue you get from the new equipment will be sufficient to meet the interest charges on the money you have borrowed to purchase the equipment, and secondly, over and above that interest charge, the amount required to wipe out the debt still attaching to the equipment you are going to get rid of.&rdquo;  That seems to me to be sound business practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a new business.  The analogy is wrong.  If I own a motor car and somebody invents a new kind of car which would be cheaper to operate than the one I have, I will buy the new car and scrap the old, if the advantage of doing so is sufficient not merely to enable me to pay the price of the new car but to recover the loss arising out of the forced sale of the old.  That is the position which arises here and it would seem to me to be wrong to say to the company: &ldquo;Not merely can you borrow the money to buy the new assets, but you can retain the money you borrowed in respect of the old one and continue to charge against the revenue derived from the operation of the concern the interest required to meet the demands of both lenders.&rdquo;  I think that would be wrong.  I feel that we should say to the company: &ldquo;In so far as you have to effect this reorganisation, <Col N="2053" /> this re-equipment of your concern, you should, within a period of 15 years, wipe out the capital liability you started with which is represented by these assets which you are going to get rid of.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is this difference between the arrangement contemplated here and that established in connection with the Electricity Supply Board.  The Electricity Supply Board was required to amortise the whole of its capital. Every penny it got was borrowed money, and, from the moment it got the money, it had to repay to the Exchequer interest and sinking fund annually.  It had, in addition to paying interest and sinking fund on the money it borrowed, to provide a depreciation fund sufficient completely to replace the assets created by the expenditure of that money.  This company will have a common stock which is not repayable, upon which no interest charges will arise and upon which dividends will be paid only if profits are earned.  To the extent that it has a common stock, it is in a different position from that of the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
      <P>We contemplate that it will have other capital liabilities indefinitely. While it may be true that a limit of £16,000,000 is fixed as the aggregate value of all the debenture stock that may be issued and while it may be true that each debenture will be issued with a redemption provision attaching to it, we contemplate, at the same time, that, in 1960, the company will have debenture liabilities even after the substituted debenture stock has been redeemed and, at some later stage, the position will be solidified, either on the basis of a company with permanent debenture capital and common stock, or, as I would think better, a company with common stock only, but if that stage is reached, the nominal value of the common stock would be substantially higher than the £4,000,000 mentioned in the Bill.</P>

      <P>That may be so, but it is these assets which, even though they may be as unsatisfactory as has been described, are earning revenue now.  These assets have to be used now, because no other assets can be got.  I agree that in a normal time, if competition were developing from private transport, the company could not hope to maintain itself with the existing equipment, but that equipment is worth something now.  It is raising revenue now and meeting the transport requirements of the country now.  At some stage that equipment will have to be modernised and improved considerably if competition develops, and it is precisely because that will be necessary that we put this dual obligation on the company not merely to effect such changes as will improve the revenue position, but improve it <Col N="2055" /> sufficiently to enable it to get rid of the old charges.</P>

      <P>The sub-section makes provision that debenture stock other than substituted debenture stock may be created from time to time, and that the redemption thereof may be decided as the Minister for Finance may approve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After all that has been said about this matter, I am entirely against the creation of redeemable debenture stock.  The case against it is the case that is being made all along.  I do not <Col N="2056" /> know how, under the type of economic conditions that are operating at the present time, the whole of the substituted debenture stock can be recovered between this and 1960 in the way in which the Minister says.</P>
    <P>This, I admit, would be quite an interesting discussion, and it could be a very useful discussion if we had any facts to go upon.  The fact that would be of most importance is missing out of the whole picture, and that is, how much debenture stock it is suggested would be raised for the purpose of carrying out additional developments in the transport system here.  We know that £9,800,000 substituted debenture stock has to be paid off by 1960, but we are given a very poor picture of what the additional debenture stock that is to be provided here will be spent upon and the amount of it there will be.  Deputy McGilligan has commented sufficiently on the hardship in present circumstances of requiring that where you have debenture stock with a fixed interest, at the same time it should be required that the capital would be repaid as well.  At any rate, until we see how this company gets on, repaying or wiping out the substituted debenture stock that exists to such an enormous amount, we should not saddle the company with any further addition of debenture stock that would be of a redeemable kind. It is for that reason that I oppose this proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no prospect that the Minister for Finance would agree to a Government guarantee attaching to debenture stock without a redemption condition.  He would regard it, and rightly so, as very bad finance from the national point of view to have a contingent liability on the Government of indefinite duration.  If the Government steps in to give the assistance of a State guarantee to this company, it should limit it in time, just as it limits it in amount.  That is the reason why the debenture stock is made redeemable, so that the Government's guarantee will be limited in time.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that there should be at least the power to attach a redemption condition to the issue of the stock.  What <Col N="2057" /> is provided here is that there must be a redemption condition attaching to it. It need not be a very onerous redemption condition.  The stock might be redeemed in 50 or 100 years, but the Minister for Finance holds strongly that there should come a day in which the Government will be released from its guarantee and the contingent liability on the Exchequer will no longer exist.</P>
      <P>It would, I agree fully, be a very onerous burden and an undue burden on the company to require it to redeem any new debenture stock issued prior to 1960; that is not contemplated. While there is no provision in the Bill which limits the discretion of the Minister for Finance in that matter, I can assure the House that will not occur, except the money is borrowed for some purely temporary purpose, and it would be regarded as sound practice that it should be redeemed in that period.  I mentioned before that it is probable the redemption condition will vary with the nature of the expenditure. If the company want to spend a couple of million pounds in the erection of railway stations, a 40 or 50 years' redemption condition would be reasonable.  If they wanted to spend money on rolling stock, a much shorter redemption period would normally apply.  We cannot determine those things in advance and there would be no redemption condition which could apply to all circumstances.</P>
      <P>The State is in this matter taking on a contingent liability, one it is true it may never be called upon to meet, but we should be concerned to ensure that the liability is not an indefinite one; that we will know it is not merely limited in amount, but also limited in time; that a stage will be reached when we will have discharged that liability and when there will be no longer any obligation attaching to the State.</P>

    <P>In sub-section (3), to delete lines <Col N="2058" /> 18 and 19 and substitute the words &ldquo;and conditions as regards the rate and payment of interest&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will have noted, the original provision in the Bill was to the effect that the rate of interest on debenture stock should not exceed 3 per cent.  It was considered that there may be fluctuations in market conditions and we examined the possibility of permitting the company to issue its 3 per cent. debentures at a premium or discount, according as the market conditions required.  There was substantial objection to that from the finance point of view, and it was clear that if that position was sustained some alterations in the provisions of the Bill would be necessary, because conceivably the company could not succeed in raising money in circumstances in which 3 per cent. debentures were discounted by the market and it could only issue 3 per cent. debentures at par.  If the existing 3 per cent. debentures were sold at less than par, no one would buy.  As there was objection on financial grounds to permitting the company to issue at a premium or a discount, we had to adopt the alternative provision that is contained in this amendment.</P>
    <P>We are contemplating the possibility of a variation in the rate of interest on the debentures.  There might be a first or second issue at 3 per cent., but an alteration of market conditions may require that the subsequent issue would be at 3¼ per cent., and there might be an issue at 2¾ or 2½ per cent. But if the issue could not be at 3 per cent. on stock of this character, the company might have to offer a higher rate of interest.  We are proposing that the State guarantee will not exceed 3 per cent. and, if it should be necessary for the company to issue at a higher rate, that issue will be guaranteed only to the extent of 3 per cent. This limits the State's liability on new debentures to 3 per cent., but it permits the issue of new debentures at par in varying market conditions.</P>

      <P>There is no implication. I may say that when I framed this Bill originally I had to deal with that possibility&mdash;that the market rate might be 2? per cent. or 3¼ per cent., but the company could only issue at par 3 per cent. stock.  I felt that it could meet that situation by issuing its stock at a discount or by issuing it at a premium, which would, in fact, mean that all its debentures would be 3 per cent. The Minister for Finance objected to that because it left again indeterminate the amount of the liability which the State was undertaking.  I could not say that the State's liability was limited to £16,000,000, because conceivably <Col N="2060" /> it might be more in certain circumstances.  In order, therefore, to permit flexibility, we had to devise the other system which enables the company to issue debenture stock at some other rate than 3 per cent., but if it has to go above 3 per cent. then the State limits its guarantee to 3 per cent.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 37:</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 30, to delete the words &ldquo;principal moneys and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I do not suppose we will get this very important question discussed to a conclusion on this matter which is not finance generally, but only finance as it affects transport; but I should like, on these amendments, to see if I can give a lead with regard to certain new views that are coming to be accepted even by orthodox people, and to see if we can get any volume of opinion to support them in this House.  I object &mdash;I think it is wrong&mdash;to tying this company down to the payment of 3 per cent. on debentures, but the House has taken a decision on that.  I have to approach the matter then from the point of view that it is not giving new financial proposals a proper run, in order to try to put it into the framework of what has already been said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask in this amendment that, when the Minister for Finance goes to borrow, he will not be tied to the ordinary old-time method, that of going to the people who own capital in the country and saying to them: &ldquo;We know you have money.  We know you have fruitful fields of investment for it.  We know we are asking you to <Col N="2061" /> do something in the nature of a mortification of yourself by lending it to us for transport purposes, and, therefore, we are going to pay you a big rate of interest on it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke here quite recently as if all borrowing must come out of savings to start off with, and as if all savings must be deducted from easy avenues of investment open to the people who have the money.  I suggest to the Minister that that view is nearly as old as the finances of the Electricity Supply Board, and pretty nearly discarded.  There are very few even orthodox financiers who, at the moment, will agree with the theory that borrowed moneys must come out of savings; that the only fund there is for investment is what people save. Unfortunately, in the case of most of us who are dealing with this matter, our savings are around our own persons.  With the cost of living as high as it is, if people want to save money from one purpose, like dining out, to put it into education, there must be a bit of a strain.  When you get into another class, where money has to be saved from insurance to put it into education, there is a greater strain.  The people of this country, under the impact of the last five years' peculiar finance, have had to save from such valuable things as insurance in order to spend money on food, and of course that is a very annoying type of saving.  That sort of personal attitude towards this idea of not spending money on one thing for which it is needed because you want to spend it on something else in regard to which there may be more urgency, accustoms people to thinking of national or community finance in the same terms.  I suggest that most of the people who write about finance have discarded that idea.  It was really an appropriate idea only at the time when there was what was called saturation of capital, when capital was under such demand that there was not enough of it to supply the demand.</P>
    <P>Then, undoubtedly, whatever was spent on the one hand had to be saved from something else.  But, with this war under our eyes, when everybody knows that there is money being spent which <Col N="2062" /> never was anybody's possession, money which certainly never was saved out of what they were earning, the sums are so vast that the mind simply does not accept that old-time conclusion of the saturation of capital.  Everybody knows nowadays that the money which is being spent is not money which anybody had at any time owned prior to its being put into munitions or anything else.  It was money that was created for the purpose, and there is nothing&mdash;this may be paradoxical&mdash;in the background; it is not because somebody in the past made the money, in the sense of having schemes of saving, but because there is something in front of it; because there is productivity arising out of the money that is being spent, under some idea of safety which is regarded as at least a good payment of insurance.</P>
    <P>I do not think we are going to fall out of the habit of regarding money in another way.  Banks and all sorts of houses simply create money.  Do not let anybody be shocked by that, and think it is something which is done elsewhere.  We have created money. We have printed money.  After the last five years' experience, we should have discarded the idea that the turning of printing presses on notes or anything that passes for currency is something as far off as Russia.  We print whatever notes are required here, and the requirements do not come from finding out what people have made, and whether they have deposits in the bank from which they can draw.  We print notes when people present us here with British legal tender and demand Irish legal tender instead.  We print it for them, and I suggest that we should print it at least as readily&mdash;always guarding against the dangers of over-printing&mdash;when the demand comes not from people who have English money and want it changed into ours, but when there is some good purpose for which Irish money is required.  I suggest, therefore, that when the Minister goes to get the sums of money which are required, he may create and issue securities bearing such a rate of interest, if any, not exceeding 2½ per cent., or subject to such charge to meet administration or service costs as he shall think fit.  I have previously <Col N="2063" /> said that he may borrow from any person or any corporation, fund or bank, including the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>I bring in the Central Bank because if there is any institution in this country which should be endowed with the power to print notes, to create money, it ought to be an institution somewhat under Government control, and the power should not be in the hands of the commercial banks as it is at the moment.  We could simplify, of course, the matter of currency in circulation at any time by this habit of changing cheques.  Cheques pass as quickly as bank notes.  They are all equally valuable as money, because the State assistance has to come in if there is any crisis.  I ask that the Minister should be allowed to borrow from any corporation, from any fund, or from any bank, including the Central Bank. I simply wish to ask that we should recognise that, in the financing of a transport venture, if it is to be a source of advantage to the Irish community, that service be rendered to the community at as little cost as possible.  One of the charges we should cut out is the charge for the loan of money.  The Minister is still in the days where he thinks he must go to the people who have money, that he must approach them as people who have other fields for investment bearing an average yield of about 5 per cent., and that he has to induce this money away from those people to this particular purpose by offering a bit more than the 5 per cent.  I suggest that that is not the situation in this country and I suggest that, if necessary, new money should be created.  It would have to be created under new conditions which would avoid the evils of overproduction of money in certain circumstances, but I do not think we need do that here.  That is why I put in &ldquo;a corporation, fund or bank&rdquo;.  We have in this country, lodged in the banks, according to the latest calculations I saw, the sum of £91,000,000. That was at the end of the year 1936. That was in time deposits&mdash;money lodged on deposit receipt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, at 1.8 per cent., on the other side.  The banks can afford to do that with a big amount of this money lying on time deposits, because they are getting such an extra amount on their other banking business. At any rate, there is ordinarily a very big amount of money completely or almost completely idle.  I think that the Banking Commission estimated that about £36,000,000 belonged to what is called the farming community.  That may include the publican in the town who has a piece of land on the outskirts.  I do not think it means entirely the agriculturists, as we would call them&mdash;the people who own and work the land.  Those people who are described as the farming community have that money there and are drawing 1 per cent. on it.  That money in the main is not in use in the country, but is there to be tapped at anything over 1 per cent.  If we were able to get the £16,000,000, or the £5,000,000 the Minister for Finance requires, out of that fund, it ought to be induced at 1½ per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On condition that we repay it at a week's notice?  You could not run a railway on that basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the old argument about liquidation.  There never was anything so nonsensical as this business about repayment.  The British have financed the war on a system called temporary borrowings and the temporary borrowings are being repaid by other temporary borrowings <Col N="2065" /> and the one is piled on the other.  No one believes that the people who lend that money are putting it there because they believe that, if they all rush into the banks together, they will get their money at a minute's notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If we use it for the railways, and that happens?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>They know that if they rusned into the banks or the railway for repayment, there would be the same critical situation as in 1914 in the United Kingdom and in this country.  The position is portrayed by the joke about the man who had a bit of money and hurried to the bank when the crisis was on, saying: &ldquo;If you have not got my money, I want it; but if you have it it does not matter.&rdquo;  It is exactly the same about the week's notice&mdash;mention of it shows the old-time finance state of the Minister's mind.  If that is all we want to get rid of, if there is over £100,000,000 left relatively idle here and only returning 1 per cent. to its owners and if what they require is the promise that at a week's notice they will get it, it is a very easy matter to segregate £5,000,000 or £10,000,000 or even £16,000,000 out of that £100,000,000 and say that the State will guarantee the repayment, if the people desire the money at a week's notice and will give State money for it.  You can print the State money inside a week, and that is all you require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to that, there is another fund, built at considerable expenditure of enthusiasm&mdash;the Savings Certificate fund.  A large amount of money was collected into that fund and then an Irishman who was very definitely connected with that movement broadcast to the public that the Government had called the savings enthusiasts into Government Buildings and had asked them no longer to push the sale of Savings Certificates, as they did not want all that money.  They said it was too large and was an &ldquo;At Call&rdquo; loan.  Again it was this idea of being able to meet a demand for repayment.  An enormous amount of money was obtained, and at the time this man broadcast there was about £7,000,000.  That was not the whole of <Col N="2066" /> the Savings Certificate fund, but was the amount gathered in at a particular period.  The point was that, if the £7,000,000 were called for at a week's notice, it could not have been paid, as the Government would have to step into the gap and give Government money or, in other words, go in for the process of printing money.  We have done that over and over again here when the conditions demanded. There is a very big amount of money in Savings Certificates and it is quite clear to those in charge of that movement that very large sums of money could be got at a low rate of interest and low rates of payment back to the people who own the money.</P>
    <P>All that money from either fund I have mentioned can be canalised down towards such a thing as railway finance.  I suggest that there should be power to do so.  My amendment only gives the Minister power to do this. If the Minister for Industry and Commerce shares the confidence of the Minister for Finance and if he is, in fact, speaking out of this confidence here, empowering either of these moneys to be used will not do much good as, with that viewpoint, they will not do it.  However, I would like the power to be there, so that when the time comes and someone is dealing with finance who has a more liberal outlook, they will be encouraged to go to those funds where the money is idle on time deposits or in Savings Certificates, or in such further sums as may be collected.  The peculiar thing is that in this country we must come to the conclusion always that we suffer from a glut of capital.  When you have a glut of anything, it generally cheapens, but in our case the capital remains dear.  It does not keep dear really, because if you get behind the scenes somewhere, you find that all the deposits are going to the financing of the British war effort.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is only bringing us back to war conditions.  Undoubtedly, there is a whole lot of capital here in the banks on deposit which should be represented by goods on shelves.  It is not because we cannot buy the goods.  Supposing we get back to conditions similar to 1936, 1937 or 1938&mdash;a normal period pre-war &mdash;and that all the money that should be out on consumable goods is again being invested in consumable goods, we still would have a vast sum of money idle&mdash;far more than we can invest here and more than we can get profitable investment for abroad.  The peculiar situation is that, although it is lying here, these owners are content with 1 per cent. and are no doubt being filled up with this idea that the <Col N="2068" /> reason they should take 1 per cent. is that, if they go in to-day for their £100,000,000, the banks will be able to give it to them inside seven days.  Of course, the banks cannot do anything of the sort, but on that pretence they are being held to this 1 per cent.  The real background is that, if everyone wanted the money at the same time, the Government would have to step into the breach and would have to pledge the whole credit of the State.</P>
      <P>The State clearly in these days must be in the background all the time.  It can, however, make living hard for itself by an improvident system of management.  A State which has within it men who can work, a certain amount of machines and a certain amount of raw material, is not in danger of going bankrupt. It may, however, make life hard for everybody.  If all the depositors with time deposits in the banks want to withdraw their deposits at the same time, there is no money in the banks to pay them, but there is Government backing.  That is sufficient and I want to cash into that system.  I move to report progress.</P>
