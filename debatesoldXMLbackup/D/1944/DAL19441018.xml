      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if there is any prospect of getting sugar sufficient to keep bee stocks alive during the coming winter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As already announced on several occasions I do not propose to grant special allowances of sugar for bee feeding during the coming winter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is a continuing danger of very considerable bee stocks being killed during the winter for want of some sort of feeding and, inasmuch as these bee stocks will produce far more sweetening matter in the form of honey than they would consume in the form of sugar, would the Minister not consider it to be good economics to provide a modest supply of sugar and thus secure additional supplies of honey?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In the early period of <Col N="179" /> the present year, I was continuously pressed by beekeepers to permit of the resumption of the export of honey on the ground that there was a supply far in excess of what could be consumed here.  Since March of the present year official notices have appeared in the Press every month reminding beekeepers of the decision that sugar would not be available for bee feeding and advising them to retain sufficient honey for that purpose.  I have no reason to think that the majority of beekeepers have not followed that advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In the event of certain beekeepers finding themselves without the necessary sugar or honey with which to maintain their stocks, will they get supplies of one product or the other, or will they be helped by the Department to get an adequate supply of feeding in a form which will meet their requirements?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we can take responsibility for that.  The decision not to provide sugar for bee feeding was arrived at last winter. Under considerable pressure from the beekeepers, I agreed last winter to provide sugar for that purpose.  It was intimated to them, however, that it would not be provided this winter. There was no evidence of a shortage of honey.  On the contrary, there was every evidence of a surplus of honey, and the beekeepers were advised, not merely by communication, but by repeated advertisements in the Press, to retain sufficient honey for the feeding of their bees this winter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied, if a beekeeper buys honey now from some honey dealer, that that honey can be made to take the place of sugar in keeping bees in health during the winter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand so.  Honey is the natural food of bees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know, but I am assured they require sugar.  If it appears that honey purchased from merchants who have a redundant stock is not an adequate feeding stuff for <Col N="180" /> bees during the winter, will the Minister consider this matter again?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether, in view of his decision to reduce the margin of profit allowed to wholesalers and retailers in the drapery trade, he is prepared to investigate the margin of profit in the case of various other commodities with a view to fixing, in respect of such commodities, lower wholesale and retail prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The margins of profit taken by wholesalers and retailers on the sale of a wide range of commodities, including all essential commodities, have been the subject of investigation in my Department during the whole period of the emergency.  Most of these commodities are the subject of Orders fixing specific maximum wholesale and retail prices, thus limiting the margins taken by wholesalers and retailers to the lowest levels considered equitable in the circumstances of sale of each particular commodity. In some cases, as in the case of clothing, the maximum trading margins are fixed by Order.  Traders' margins which are thus covered by Order are continually under review in my Department, and I do not think that special investigation, as suggested by the Deputy, with a view to reducing these margins is necessary.</P>

      <P>The Minister will recall that when the margins were fixed for clothing there was considerable doubt amongst the ordinary public as to the wisdom of fixing such high margins and while I appreciate that his Department has this matter under continuous review, will he not consider giving special consideration to the question of children's footwear, the prices of which are abnormally high and out of the reach of the ordinary working people?</P>

      <P>It is only in the case of footwear and clothing that control of prices is exercised by restriction of the margin of profit which traders may take.  In the case of other commodities, there are specific maximum prices which cannot be exceeded.  In the case of those commodities where the control is exercised by means of restriction on the margin of profit, that margin has been reviewed and has been, in fact, reduced by Order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he can state (a)  the classes of goods in respect of which preferential rates have been granted by the Great Southern Railways Company, and (b)  the number of cases in which preferential rates have obtained during the years 1942 and 1943.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Great Southern Railways Company do not admit that any of their rates have been or are preferential in the sense of giving an undue preference contrary to law. The exceptional rates below the class or standard rates, to which presumably the Deputy refers, have always existed in large numbers.  They formerly applied to particular commodities between particular pairs of stations.  As from the 1st July, 1943, they have been replaced by exceptional mileage scales applicable to particular <Col N="184" /> commodities throughout the company's system.</P>
      <P>The exceptional rates owed their existence to the fact that formal classifications of merchandise and formal scales of rates were frequently found to be too rigid for commercial development of business.  Local conditions of industry or trade or competition in carrying were found to need varieties of treatment to enable the traffic to travel by railway.  The system grew, however, to the extent that exceptional rates applied to about 80 per cent. of the total traffic.  They were not confined to particular classes of goods. The new scales are designed to remove the anomalies and quasi-preferences involved, and apply to about 65 main descriptions of traffic.</P>
      <P>The exceptional rates and scales have always been available for public inspection in the rate books required to be kept under Section 48 of the Railways Act, 1924, which is proposed to be re-enacted and amplified by Section 103 of the Transport Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the amount of the annual allocation which it is calculated Córas Iompair Eireann will require to make out of revenue for the purpose of the redemption of its substituted debenture stock on June 30th, 1960.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The annual amount which Córas Iompair Eireann would require to provide out of revenue for the redemption on the 30th June, 1960, of its substituted debenture stock amounting to £9,890,660 is £547,456.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In calculating this figure, it has been assumed that none of the stock would be redeemed before 1960, that equal half-yearly allocations to the sinking fund would be made for 15½ years, and that the effective rate of interest <Col N="185" /> earned by the accumulating sinking fund would not be more than 2 per cent. after deducting income-tax.</P>
    <P>In an answer given to a question asked by Deputy McGilligan on the 9th May last as to the amount necessary to redeem the debenture stock substituted for stock of the Great Southern Railways Company alone, a figure of £640,800 was given which, I regret, was not correct, due to a miscalculation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to reply to question No. 17 and question No. 18 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputy misunderstands the functions being carried out by my Department in relation to building in the post-war period.  A special division of my Department was established some months ago to deal with post-war conditions in the building industry with particular reference to shortage of materials and skilled labour. Associated with this division is an advisory council for the building industry, but the consideration of what I understand the Deputy to mean by &ldquo;post-war housing conditions&rdquo; is not a function of the new division of my Department nor of the advisory council.</P>
      <P>With the help of the advisory council and its committees, the new division is endeavouring to secure the maximum quantities of building materials for post-war projects and to deal with the problem of a possible shortage of labour.  From the information already obtained, it seems inevitable that some system of building priorities will have to be instituted.  The question of laying down and carrying out priority principles is at present under active consideration.  It may be assumed that housing will have a high place in any scheme of priorities that may be introduced.</P>

      <P>Under the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1934, the rate of weekly compensation is not less than 75 per cent. of the loss of average wages payable to the workman prior to the accident, subject to a maximum payment of 30/- per week; this maximum has been increased to 37/6 per week as from the 1st June, 1943, by Emergency Powers (No. 274) Order, 1943.  The Act also provides that where the rate of wages has increased in the workman's occupation after the date of his accident the court may, in certain circumstances, increase the compensation subject to the statutory maximum.  It is not at present proposed to make any further amendment of the Workmen's Compensation Act.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that a special and urgent housing problem exists for small landholders, whose poor law valuation averages about £15 and under, by reason of the fact that they are hardly considered eligible as applicants for cottages erected by the local authority, and whether, having regard to the fact that such persons are not in a position to erect houses with the assistance of grants provided under the existing housing Acts, he will take steps to introduce legislation to meet such cases.</P>

      <P>A generous measure of State assistance has been available to farmers for the improvement of their dwellings in recent years and widespread improvements in housing have taken place.  I cannot, therefore, accept the view that any urgent housing problem still exists for small landholders.  Under the various housing Acts passed since 1932, grants from £70 to £80 have been obtainable by small farmers, with holdings not exceeding £15 valuation, for the building of houses for their own occupation, while grants from £60 to £70 have been available to farmers, with holdings of a valuation between £15 and £25.  There were 9,703 houses erected by farmers with holdings under £15 valuation and the total amount of grants paid was approximately £760,000.  Of that number 2,726 were built during the past five years, and applications for housing grants are still being received in my Department. There were also 2,139 houses erected by farmers with holdings between £15 and £25 and in these cases the grants paid amounted to approximately £145,000.</P>
      <P>In addition, 27,496 houses have been reconstructed since 1932 by farmers with a valuation under £25, and grants amounting to approximately £1,000,000 were allocated for the purpose.  Assistance towards the building of houses by farmers has also been afforded through the Land Commission and the Gaeltacht Services Division of the Department of Lands.</P>

      <P>Recommendations in regard to the remuneration of these collectors have been received and considered.  The remuneration of both officers has shown an upward tendency in recent years.  In the case of the rate collector, he was appointed poor rate collector in addition to town rate collector in 1938 and his income was thereby increased by £75 a year.  He is also water rate collector.  His total remuneration from all these sources is approximately £280 a year.  His remuneration as rate and water rate collector has increased by approximately £20 as compared with the year 1939.  He is also in receipt of fees for franchise work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that applicants for an old age pension up to a maximum of 10/- a week are already subject to a means test before they qualify for payment, does the Parliamentary Secretary consider it reasonable that a further test should be imposed in order to enable them to qualify for the trifling additional sum of 2/6 a week, which is a very small contribution to the solution of their financial difficulties owing to the fact that the cost of living, according to the Government's own figures, has increased <Col N="192" /> by not less than 70 per cent. since 1939?</P>

      <P>I would remind the Deputy that the House has already decided that this extra 2/6 a week would be payable only to necessitous persons.  Seventy-five per cent. of the cost is borne by the State, and 25 per cent. is borne by the local authorities.

      <P>Although I have heard of some low yields of &ldquo;Manitoba&rdquo; wheat, as in the case of other varieties, I have also heard of many satisfactory yields and I have seen some excellent samples of the produce of &ldquo;Manitoba&rdquo; seed.  During the period from 1932 to 1935 many farmers throughout this country grew &ldquo;Manitoba&rdquo; wheat from seed supplied by the millers with satisfactory results, particularly on good land.  &ldquo;Manitoba&rdquo; wheat consists very largely of the variety known as Marquis.  This variety was tested in 1936 at 34 centres in 25 counties against five other spring varieties, and the results compared favourably with the other varieties in the trials.  It is not correct to say that any farmer was forced to grow &ldquo;Manitoba&rdquo; wheat.  I cannot entertain the suggestion to provide compensation to growers who happened to get a poor yield.</P>

Permits have been issued to seedsmen for the purchase from growers of approximately 180,000 barrels of seed wheat of winter varieties, and progress towards receiving that quantity has been made by the assemblers.  Permits have been issued for the assembly of approximately 380,000 barrels of seed of spring varieties and progress is being also made in this direction. These quantities represent an increase of 33? per cent. on those for the past season.  Arrangements have also been made under which flour millers will hold a reserve of about 70,000 barrels, largely of spring varieties, for use in case of any shortage.  In addition, many farmers will, in accordance with their usual practice, retain good samples of seed wheat for themselves. It will not be practicable to import seed wheat.</P>

    <P>During the discussion on Section 10 in Committee, Deputy Costello suggested <Col N="212" /> that the wording of the sub-section, as it appeared in the Bill originally, might operate to invalidate an agreement which would otherwise be valid between parties or to enable one party to break an agreement.

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the position which Deputy Norton referred to in the course of the discussion in Committee, relating to air services, could not arise.  Deputy Norton, as the House will remember, proposed an amendment that nothing in sub-section (2) of Section 10 would operate to authorise the company to acquire, by purchase or otherwise, any transport undertaking owned or operated by the State.  It was suggested that the section might be deemed to permit the acquisition by the company of air services, air ports or similar services and that this section if allowed to stand unchanged might be interpreted by the courts as overriding existing legislation.  Under existing legislation no person other than Aer Lingus or a subsidiary of Aer Lingus or a person granted permission, may operate air services.  In order to keep the two statutes in agreement it is proposed to insert here, after the word &ldquo;sell&rdquo;, the words &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister&rdquo;, which ensures that the position of this Bill will be kept in line with that of the Air Navigation and Transport Bill, 1936.</P>

    <P>(a)  carry on any hotel which was, <Col N="213" /> immediately before the establishment date, carried on by a dissolved company;</P>
    <P>(b)  carry on a hotel in the vicinity of the route of any of its transport services and for that purpose acquire any interest in land and (if necessary) erect buildings thereon;</P>
    <P>(c)  do all such things in relation to its hotels as might be done by an individual;</P>
    <P>(d)  dispose of any of its hotels and of any interest in any land held by it in connection with its hotels.</P>
    <P>It will be recollected that during the discussion on the Committee Stage doubt was expressed as to whether the wording of Section 10 was sufficiently wide to permit the company to carry on a hotel business.  Each of the companies that were amalgamated into the Great Southern Railways in 1925 had power to operate hotels, a power which was given to them by the statutes under which these companies operated. These powers were transferred to the Great Southern Railways Company and would, by this Bill, be transferred to Córas Iompair Eireann.  I had the sections examined and I found that there was no uniformity between the powers conferred by the various statutes upon the original railway companies which were, ultimately, amalgamated into the Great Southern Railways Company.  In order to get rid of that lack of uniformity and also to put beyond doubt the powers which the company will have, I am proposing this section.  There is a corresponding amendment to delete the various sections of the older Acts and, in future, the powers to carry on hotels and do all things necessary in connection with the carrying on of hotels will be uniform throughout the whole of the company's system.</P>

We are giving this company a monopoly of transport and control of their present hotels and I do not think we should give them this further power, seeing that we have a Tourist Board to deal with hotel traffic and the amenities required by tourists.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with that.  Transport legislation in all countries permits transport operators to undertake the development of hotels.  In fact, a great deal of the business of transport undertakers arises out of the provision of hotel accommodation. I do not want to be taken as indicating that no other arrangement for the development of hotel accommodation will be considered in future.  I am merely proposing to continue the existing situation in this case.  The railway company has power to carry on, acquire and construct hotels at present.  Those powers were given in the statutes which established the various companies which were, ultimately, amalgamated into the Great Southern Railways Company.  The only effect of introducing this section will be to secure that those powers will be uniform throughout the system, instead of varying, as they do at present, over different sections which were formerly under the control of independent railway companies.</P>

      <P>Not at all.  We are too much disposed to create half a dozen organisations to deal with the same thing.  I think that we should endeavour to get co-ordination and that, if the Tourist Board has any purpose, hotel traffic should be left under its guidance.  If the railway company or any other body say that a hotel is required in a particular place, then let private capital provide the hotel, subsidised and helped by the Tourist Board.  At present, we have the Tourist Board, the railway companies and private individuals interesting themselves in the hotel business. I have no interest in the matter but I want to see some measure of co-ordination. The railway companies have hotels at present.  They are associations of private persons and are entitled to have those hotels but we should not do anything which would accentuate the present position and multiply the number of bodies interested in the provision of hotel accommodation.</P>

      <P>In page 10, Section 12, after line 6, to add the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2) On the establishment date every person who immediately before the establishment date was an officer or servant of a dissolved company shall, by virtue of this section, be transferred to and become an officer or servant (as the case may be) of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="217" /> We consider that this amendment is necessary.  To show that it is necessary, I refer to Section 45 (4) (b) where the phrase &ldquo;by virtue of this Act&rdquo; is introduced.  Under Section 12, it is provided, too, that the several undertakings of each dissolved company shall, &ldquo;by virtue of this section,&rdquo; be transferred to and vest in and become the undertakings of the company.  The Minister assured us that, by virtue of the incorporation of the Railway Clauses Act, 1863, the insertion we propose was unnecessary.  But if Deputies refer to Section 45, they will find that &ldquo;the service or employment or dismissal under or by the company of any officer or servant of that dissolved company who is transferred, by virtue of this Act, to the company shall be deemed to be service or employment or dismissal under or by that dissolved company.&rdquo; We are merely anxious to secure that the protection which, I am sure, the Minister desires to give, will be actually given.  There seems to be some conflict of opinion as to whether or not the operation of the Railway Clauses Act, 1863, will be sufficient to effect our purpose.  If it is essential in Section 12 to use the phraseology which has been used, we think that it would be well to make the insertion which we propose and thus secure the position of officers and servants of the dissolved company under this Bill whether or not they are protected by the Railway Clauses Act.  Section 45 seems to raise a doubt as to whether the Railway Clauses Act suffices for this purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Deputy has not adverted to Section 8 (2) which says that.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Part V of the Railway Clauses Act, 1863, is, subject to the provisions of this Part, incorporated with, and forms part of, this Part&rdquo;.</P>

    <P>The effect of that sub-section is precisely the same as if we took the various sections of the Railway Clauses Act, 1863, and incorporated them as sections of this Bill.  They are incorporated by virtue of that sub-section and the Railway Clauses Act provides for all the circumstances which arise on the amalgamation of transport <Col N="218" /> undertakings.  Section 49 of the Railway Clauses Act provides that</P>
    <P>&ldquo;all clerks, officers and servants who at the time of amalgamation are in the employment of the dissolved company shall thereupon become clerks, officers or servants, as the case may be, of the amalgamated company, with the same rights and subject to the same obligations and incidents in respect of such employment as they would have had as clerks, officers or servants of the dissolved company and shall so continue unless and until they respectively are duly removed from such employment by the amalgamated company or until the terms of their employment are duly altered by the amalgamated company.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The effect of sub-section (2) of Section 8 of this Bill is precisely the same as if we took those words and inserted them in the Bill.  The Act of 1924, dealing with amalgamation, did not incorporate the Railway Clauses Act, 1863, but it provided that the provisions of that Act would be incorporated in every amalgamation scheme given effect to under it.  Precisely the same procedure was followed here, although under a different scheme, and the idea was that there should be a complete transfer of the rights, privileges and terms of employment of officers transferred to the new company as when employed by the amalgamating companies. For that reason, therefore, I think that the amendment is unnecessary.</P>

I propose, therefore, this amendment, the purpose of which is to require that if the chairman, at the time of his appointment as chairman, should be the holder of common stock in the company, he shall sell or otherwise dispose of it; and the purpose of the amendment is also to ensure that the chairman should be prevented from becoming the holder of common stock in the company during his chairmanship of the company.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy Davin, Sir, I move amendment No. 12:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 18, Section 40 (1), line 6, after the word &ldquo;board&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;other than the chairman&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is simply to prevent the position arising where one individual would be appointed to the two positions of chairman of the board and managing director.  I think the undesirability of having one individual appointed to the two positions should be obvious. Whether or not it is the intention that such a position should not arise, I think it is desirable that some provision should be inserted here to prevent that happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Without giving any indication of an intention in the matter, I would oppose this amendment. I think it is right that the chairman of the company should be free to become its managing director in certain circumstances.  For instance, I think that the circumstances that will exist during the period of reorganisation will be of such a character as to make it possible to contemplate an arrangement of this character and to regard it as a desirable arrangement.  For that reason, I think it would be undesirable to have a statutory bar against the chairman acting as managing director of the company in circumstances in which it would be considered that the best interests of the company would be served by having one man acting in both capacities, and where the person appointed by the Government to be chairman of the company was regarded by the shareholders and their representatives as the best person to occupy the position of managing director also.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is something to be said against that. Take the case of a chairman who was a man of outstanding personality and who was able to influence the other members of the board.  I think we should be very careful in regard to this matter.  I can quite see the Minister's point of view, but there is a danger that a man, acting as chairman of the company, with an outstanding personality, might be able to convince his co-directors that he was the only fit and proper person to occupy the position of managing director.  There are many people in this country who are able to convince other people, as a result of their outstanding personality, that they are the only people who are capable of doing anything.  I admit that there are not many such people, but there are some, and I think we should take care, when we are extending this statutory power, to prevent some man, who might be a good plotter, so to speak, having himself elected to the two positions.  I think that there should be two men: one to be chairman of the company, and the other to be managing director.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion, it would be wise, in the case of a huge commercial undertaking of this kind, that the two positions should be separate, and that the board should have the power of scrutinising the qualifications of the person to be appointed managing director. I think the Minister should consider this matter carefully.  It might be economy to give the one salary to a person occupying the dual capacity, but it must be remembered that in a large commercial concern of that kind a salary of £1,000 or £2,000 does not count.  What you want is effective management and effective control. Assume that there is a managing director who is also the chairman, how is he going to criticise himself with regard to the general management of the company: whether he is running it efficiently or inefficiently, whether he is doing a certain thing that is right or a certain thing that, perhaps, in the opinion of his co-directors, is not right and is bad for the system? <Col N="224" /> There is that obvious danger, and, therefore, I think that such a loop-hole should not be left open.  I agree with the Minister to this extent that I dislike creating a statutory bar, but there is a huge sum involved here. There is also involved the question of the general prosperity of the country. I think that these offices should be kept independent, and that provision should be made in the statute to prevent any attempt to rig the board of directors, and elect somebody who, as I have said, would have a talent for doing that sort of thing &mdash; that is, having himself elected to both offices.  I suggest to the Minister that the matter is worthy of consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of economy in this at all.  The question is, what is the most desirable arrangement? I would regard it as completely undesirable to have a statutory impediment on the appointment of the chairman as managing director.  I can conceive certain circumstances in which that would be the best arrangement, nor is it, necessarily, an undesirable arrangement.  It is not an unusual practice in ordinary commerce. One, for instance, could describe the chairman of the Electricity Supply Board as the managing director of that undertaking, and I do not think the arrangement has worked badly in his case.  I can contemplate a number of circumstances in which the chairman, the person appointed by the Government to represent public policy, if he is the best person for the post, could also suitably act as managing director of this concern.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Chair to bear with me because I look on this matter as one of the keystones of the Bill.  This leaves it open to very serious defects.  If the chairman is to be managing director, of course, that office technically makes him a director himself.  If the general board of directors are to be controllers of the concern, <Col N="225" /> they should be sitting there as critics: as the guides, philosophers and friends of the company as a whole.  I think they should be in a position to speak out their minds fearlessly as regards the person who is in the position of managing director. How are they to do that in practice if he is chairman and managing director at the same time?  We should not do anything that would be likely to handicap efficiency.  When we are putting this thing down inside the four walls of a statute, we should take care that anything of the nature I speak of would not happen.</P>

      <P>In page 19, Section 43, line 26, to delete the words &ldquo;closing of railway lines&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will recall that, on the Committee Stage of the Bill, he indicated that compensation would be paid, in certain circumstances, so far as the closing of branch lines is concerned, under Section 9 of the 1933 Act.  Since then considerable doubts have arisen on the Minister's statement.  We have actually got legal opinion on the matter.  The Minister may be interested <Col N="227" /> to know that the legal opinion received by us states, amongst other things, that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The retention of these words (&lsquo;closing of railway lines&rsquo;) is, in our opinion, most unsatisfactory.  We have examined all the principles of statutory interpretation relevant to this question and we are forced to the conclusion that an arbitrator might readily hold Section 9 of the 1933 Act to have been impliedly repealed <i>pro tanto</i> by Section 43 or, in other words, that a person who would otherwise be entitled to compensation under the 1933 Act is not so entitled if his redundancy is caused by the closing of a railway line resulting from the amalgamation of the Great Southern Railways and Dublin United Transport Company.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We feel, because of the anxiety that has arisen in connection with that paragraph in the Bill, that the Minister should put the matter beyond all doubt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand the basis of that opinion.  This Bill relates to Córas Iompair Eireann, and provides for the obligations of that company.  The Railways Act of 1933, to which the Deputy has referred, applies to all railway companies.  It establishes the law affecting all railway companies, and determines their obligations in certain circumstances.  I cannot, therefore, see how it can possibly be held by anybody that an obligation applicable to all railway companies under the 1933 Act is removed, even by implication, by the provisions of this Bill which relate to a single company.  I have had this matter fully considered by the legal advisers to the Government, and they tell me that there is no question whatever but that, in the case of the closing of railway lines, the obligation to pay compensation under the 1933 Act will apply to Córas Iompair Éireann as to any other railway company, and that there is no necessity whatever to make special provision in relation to that matter in this Bill.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not see that differences can arise?  Take <Col N="228" /> the case of two men.  One, say, is dismissed, presumably because of the closing of a branch line, and gets compensation if he comes under the 1933 Act.  Another man, working beside him, is dismissed for a reason other than the closing of a branch line.  His case for compensation will come under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>If the Deputy's point is that there are certain provisions in this Bill which are not in the 1933 Act, I think that is an argument for amending the 1933 Act rather than this Bill. As I have said, the 1933 Act applies to all railway companies.  It would, obviously, be an anomalous situation if you had more favourable terms applying to one company than to others in the same circumstances.  I doubt very much if circumstances, such as the Deputy imagines, will ever arise. If, however, you are to have any change in the circumstances of the 1933 Act, it should be effected by an amendment of that Act, and should apply, as I have said, to all.  I have the definite legal opinion that by the insertion of the words &ldquo;closing of railway lines&rdquo; there is not any likelihood of the Act being interpreted in the way the Deputy suggests.</P>

      <P>I can see there will be a certain amount of confusion in <Col N="230" /> this.  As I understand it now, the 1933 Act does set it out that if dismissal is shown to be due to closing of a railway line a man is entitled to compensation. Notwithstanding the fact that the amount of compensation will be judged pretty nearly by the same standards, there is included in this, which is the later measure a statement that right to compensation will be debarred because of the closing of a railway line.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest there may be considerable difference in the compensation. Men who have been dismissed owing to the destruction of lines and dislocation of lines will be compensated under the 1933 Act.  In some instances their service is broken, but that does not debar them under the 1933 Act.  Therefore, there will be very considerable difference in the compensation to two similar types of men dismissed for different reasons.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 19, Section 43 (1), lines 26 and 27, to delete the words &ldquo;or other economic cause&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="231" /> In his speech on the Committee Stage, the Minister gave two examples of what the term &ldquo;economic cause&rdquo; would cover, which would seem to be obvious.  One was the stoppage of the imports of petrol and the other the question of the imports of coal.  We agree that either of these would be an &ldquo;economic cause&rdquo;, but they are covered by the term, as far as the section itself stands.  Since the question of reduction in traffic is good defence so far as compensation is concerned, we do not see the necessity for an ambiguous phrase of this character.  I rather gathered from the discussion in Committee that the Minister himself was not too happy with this particular term, and I had hoped that in the interval he would agree to delete it, or would substitute some more satisfactory term.  As we see it, there is no necessity for a term of this character at all, because it will only lead to endless legal argument involving heavy costs on whomsoever may have to pay them.  We suggest that there is no necessity for it, and that the Minister might very well delete this phrase.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that if we are to try to substitute some other form of words for those in the paragraph at the present time, the only words we could find to cover the idea which it is intended to express there would be &ldquo;or a decline in revenue&rdquo; and I can imagine that Labour Deputies would not regard that as an improvement.  The Arbitrator under the 1924 Act did rule that the term should be construed in the sense of having relationship with saving money necessitated by a diminished revenue due to lesser volume of traffic or a modified scale of charges.  Some provision of that kind must be contained in the Bill.  The intention is that persons who lose their employment by amalgamation will be compensated, but that a person who loses his employment from any other cause will not be compensated under this Bill, and amongst the other causes are economies which either of the amalgamating companies could have introduced in any case, a decline in traffic, a decrease in the amount of work that has to be <Col N="232" /> done on renewal and maintenance, or the introduction of improved methods of working.  If these circumstances should arise, then there may be provision for the men who will be affected by them.  There may even be agreements between the company and the men's unions dealing with these circumstances, but, obviously, we are not proposing to compel the company to pay compensation in such circumstances. It was designed merely to secure people who may lose their employment as a direct result of amalgamation.  You do not cover all the circumstances under which fluctuation in the volume of employment might occur in the future if you leave out the phrase &ldquo;other economic cause&rdquo;.  It seems to me that some such phrase as that must go in, and as that phrase has been in previous legislation and as attempts have been made to give it an interpretation by the arbitrator under the previous legislation, I think it is better to leave it as it stands rather than to attempt to substitute for it some other phrase which might prove to be far more restrictive than this one is.  If we were to attempt to amend it by the substitution of some other phrase with a somewhat similar effect we would, I think, be creating the risk that a much narrower interpretation would be put upon it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made here to the Kerins case under the 1924 Act.  I have had the decision of the arbitrator in that case examined and I find that in effect the Kerins case was not lost because of any interpretation of the phrase &ldquo;other economic cause&rdquo;; it was lost on the ground of reduction of renewals and maintenance and that ground is still provided in this paragraph as it stands.  I again ask the House to remember that we are dealing here with entirely different circumstances from those which arose in 1924. The 1924 Act amalgamated 26 companies which were operating overlapping services.  Now we are proposing to amalgamate two companies operating more or less self-contained services.  There cannot be similar grounds for dispute as to the applicability of Section 45 to any person who <Col N="233" /> may lose his employment and there will be less inclination on behalf of the company to insist upon a very narrow or rigid interpretation because the few cases that may arise will not involve any more than a limited number of individuals.  Unlike the other Act, they had to fight a typical case, because substantial sums of money were involved, and the number of people who might be held to correspond to the case being fought, would be considerable.  That cannot arise here.  I have really no fear that there will be an attempt to impose too narrow an interpretation of the section.  I think it is a good rule always to take phraseology out of existing legislation where it is applicable, and particularly phraseology which has been the subject of legal interpretation.  We could never be sure that other words would not be given an interpretation different from what is intended.</P>

      <P>It is impossible to define when anyone would be superfluous. That has been said by people better qualified to judge than I am.  I am wondering why we should persist in putting into legislation words that are considered to be unnecessary and that a judge said were impossible of interpretation, seeing that we have already given the railway company every opportunity to do all things arising from &ldquo;economic causes,&rdquo; including lack of maintenance of services due to lack of revenue from traffic, and falling railway receipts.  All are covered.  I am wondering why this term &ldquo;or other economic cause&rdquo; is being persisted in.</P>
      <P>We are satisfied that whatever redundancy will arise, the instrument that company is provided with will be freely used to provide fruitful discussions in the courts at the expense of others, and probably to the detriment of people claiming compensation.

      <P>Certainly.  We say in relation to these people that if as a result of our action in the amalgamation of two companies workers are disemployed, they will be compensated. We are not ensuring that the employees of the company will be protected from disemployment due to economic causes in future, such as an alteration in the general circumstances, an alteration in the general methods of conducting traffic, new inventions and various things that might cause a fall of employment in any industrial occupation.  Whatever reasons are given for other occupations being changed, as well as the volume of employment, will be attached in this case. We propose to compensate people for what we do by amalgamation.  Once amalgamation is completed we recognise that economic causes may result in a fall in the volume of employment, but we are not proposing that workers with the company shall be indefinitely protected against economic causes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice that the Minister is trying to provide against economic causes with one exception. &ldquo;Economic causes&rdquo; covers a decrease in traffic, a reduction of renewal and maintenance and improved methods of working.  If my memory serves me, the only other matter is decreased revenue which apparently is not one caused by decreased traffic.  A decrease of revenue, the Minister said, could occur through reduced charges.  There are other charges involved.  Towards the end of the Committee Stage, the Minister gave a hint, and people are rather anxiously wondering whether it was to be taken as a signpost, that there might be an off-loading of traffic from the railway to the roads.  If that happened on a big scale, and it could happen without closing the railways which might not be so much used, it might bring about a reduction in revenue.  Does the Minister mean there is to be a policy of that kind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be a reduction in traffic, not a reduction in revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That might bring about a reduction in revenue.  If it did <Col N="236" /> not cause a decrease in traffic and if there was not the same revenue, apparently the Minister would say it was due to economic causes.  If there is going to be an off-loading, surely the permanent way which the railway company have to keep there might then show a decrease in revenue and it might be desirable to reduce charges to get traffic.  There might be a period in which an increase of traffic would not come in and revenue would decline. Does the Minister think that a proper reason for debarring people from compensation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say that that would not be a circumstance arising from the amalgamation.  That circumstance could arise if there was no amalgamation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not know. It could not arise unless there was power in a monopolistic concern to shift from one service to another.  That has not arisen.  Apparently that is what is in the Minister's mind in debarring people from compensation.  The Minister would call that &ldquo;economic causes&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not debarring people from claiming compensation.  I am providing that people will be paid compensation in certain circumstances and I have pointed out the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That will be taken, and was taken by a previous arbitrator, so to speak, as terms of reference. He found that if a reduction was due to economic causes, decreased traffic or decreased renewal work or improved methods of working, a man was debarred from compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What we say is that if a man's disemployment is due to amalgamation, the company shall pay him compensation.  If the company does not pay him compensation, the man has the right of appeal to an arbitrator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>And the arbitrator will then consider, as the pivotal point, whether the dismissal was due <Col N="237" /> to other economic causes, and, if so. the man does not get compensation The Minister in that context brings in this idea of decreased revenue, and I suggest that one way in which decreased revenue is going to arise is by this off-loading of traffic for a certain period when receipts will be down because of the attempt to get traffic on the new system.  In these circumstances, it does not seem equitable that whole-time employees of the system, who would in all probability have continued in their employment for years, should be debarred from compensation because of this changeover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That surely would not be a consequence of the amalgamation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest it would be.  It is a question of whether it would be called a direct consequence or a consequence in some way connected with it.  The position was that railway employment was supposed to be so definitely permanent employment that railway employees were excepted cases under the unemployment insurance code.  They were regarded as so definitely employed that they did not pay, but this unsettles that situation. I do not want to weary the House by repetition, but having had experience of putting through the 1924 Act, and later finding it part of my duty to try to get compensation for people who had been dismissed arising out of the amalgamation, I found that in a situation in which I felt it clear that individuals should have got compensation the arbitrator would not give it to them.  Men whose only experience was whatever they had got in the way of training of their hands, people at the age of 50, were being thrown out of whole-time employment at a time when they had no other field of employment arising out of their previous experience, and when there was nothing they could do.  They were thrown out without any compensation.  If there are very few people who will be affected by this, so long as the Minister continues to use that argument, not much harm is done by leaving the phrase out.  It may mean that <Col N="238" /> a small number of people will creep in who would not have got compensation on a strict interpretation of the provision, but it will not matter very much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy O'Sullivan has pointed out, there will be much more litigation over such a phrase as this than over a section which contains a precise phrase.  I should like to see in here the phrase &ldquo;decreased revenue&rdquo;.  Decreased revenue is something which can be objectively found and everybody knows what it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave an illustration during the Committee Stage.  I said that assuming that next year, after the company had been constituted, the supply of petrol or coal stopped, and services stopped as a consequence, that would be an economic cause, and nobody could say that persons who lost their employment through that cause lost it by reason of amalgamation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously that could not be related to amalgamation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Similarly, there are circumstances in which we could contemplate the company losing so much revenue that it just could not continue to pay the wages of all its workers.  That is what the arbitrator means when he said &ldquo;circumstances in which the company might have to cut its cloth according to its measure.&rdquo;  The company would have considerable difficulty in showing at any time that a decline in revenue was due to amalgamation. The effect of the amalgamation will be to improve the company's revenue, and I do not think there is much likelihood of a dispute under that head, but in circumstances in which the revenue had declined and in which there was a diminution in employment, we would not like the position created in which workers might feel that that situation was due to the amalgamation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, I want Deputies to understand that we say that if workers lose <Col N="239" /> their employment because of amalgamation, they must be compensated, but we want to ensure that there will be no tendency to continue to press claims which obviously cannot succeed because the company will be able to demonstrate beyond doubt that the disemployment of the individual worker was not due to amalgamation but to such circumstances as are stated here: a decline in traffic; a decrease of renewal and maintenance work; the introduction of improved methods of working or other economic causes such as those I mentioned by way of illustration.  If the company can show that the disemployment of an individual was due to these circumstances, the obligation to pay compensation may not arise. Whatever provision the company may make for employees as a whole, the statutory obligation to pay compensation because of amalgamation will not arise in these cases.</P>

      <P>I think the company will have difficulty in showing that loss of employment due to amalgamation was due to some other cause, if in fact it was due to amalgamation.  I have said that the amalgamation will have the effect of improving the company's prospects, of increasing its traffic, increasing its revenue and generally improving its financial status.  It will still be open to the company to adopt improved methods of working just as the present company could adopt them, but it will have difficulty in showing that the amalgamation worsened its financial position, or that any worsening of its financial position could possibly be due to amalgamation.</P>

      <P>Were these words not the subject of an adjudication by the arbitrator who declared that he saw no reason, notwithstanding the fact that they were there, to throw the onus away from the applicant?

      <P>I appreciate the provision which the Minister has made in this amendment.  It covers the one I have tabled, No. 55, and is very satisfactory. I should like to point out, however, that under the 1924 Act facilities were given for calculating under the British or the Northern Ireland annuity scheme, and I was wondering if the Minister is adopting the system that is now operating in the present company regarding the calculation. There is no annuity scheme under the Irish Post Office, and it appears they have been adopting the scheme operated by Britain and Northern Ireland.  I do not know if the Minister has anything special in mind as regards the annuity scheme referred to in the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 22:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 22, Section 48 (1), line 58, after the word &ldquo;provided&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;with particular regard to authorising and compelling the company (a) to erect posts, indicating compulsory and optional stopping-places for omnibuses, and (b) to provide adequate cloakroom accommodation at populous seaside resorts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Cork Corporation had this matter under discussion on several occasions and, arising out of their conversations, it was decided to get in touch with the <Col N="247" /> Gárda Síochána with a view to relieving, if not altogether abolishing, the confusion that exists on all of the bus routes in Cork City.  There are no indicators to tell passengers where the recognised stopping-places are.  Of course, by custom a number of stopping-places have been established, but there is no written word to proclaim to all and sundry that these are recognised stopping-places.  The consequence is that most citizens, including myself &mdash; I am a regular passenger on these buses &mdash; are left in doubt about where to stop for a bus.</P>
    <P>If I were off my own route I would be quite at sea as to where the stopping-places are.  When citizens are confused in relation to these stopping-places, how much more confusing must it be for visitors to the city?  They are frequently compelled to ask passers-by where they should remain in order to catch such-and-such a bus.  Knowing the difficulties citizens have experienced, and visitors to the city have experienced, in this connection, we thought it advisable to request the company to erect indicators at all the stopping-places.  The company have refused point-blank to do so.  They throw the onus over on the ratepayers of Cork City.  They might as well ask our citizens to put up signposts from Cork to Blarney on the Great Southern Railways as to ask them to put up these indicators on the side-walks of the city.</P>
    <P>As regards the portion of my amendment which seeks adequate cloakroom accommodation at populous seaside termini it would be better.  When I put down resorts I had in mind the scenes that have been witnessed from time to time at Crosshaven, a seaside resort about 12 or 14 miles from Cork City.  This place is much patronised, especially by working-class people from Cork City, on Sundays and holidays.  There have been some disgraceful scenes in Crosshaven as a result of the shortage of bus accommodation and the shortage of cloakroom accommodation.  In this civilised country one would imagine <Col N="248" /> that better services would be provided for our own people, not to speak of visitors from other countries.  One would imagine that in a country like this, which is supposed to be civilised at any rate, we would have adequate cloakroom accommodation, especially at the bus termini.  Disgraceful scenes have been witnessed at these places on Sundays and holidays.  Crowds of people are taken down there and some are left until 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning. In many cases people were compelled to remain all night because of the shortage of buses.</P>
    <P>As regards inadequate cloakroom accommodation, I have in mind Crosshaven and Youghal.  I trust the Minister will make suitable provision in this Bill in connection with the points I have raised.  Perhaps he may not be prepared to accept the amendment in the form in which I have submitted it, but if he accepts the spirit of it he could adopt more suitable wording. The principal point is that the company should be compelled to erect indicators setting out the compulsory and optional stopping-places for buses in the City of Cork, and to provide adequate cloakroom accommodation at seaside resorts.  I do not think it is asking too much, having regard to the fact, which is common knowledge, that the Cork City services are among the best paying services in Eire.  It is computed that they take out of Cork City alone something between £60,000 and £70,000 per annum in bus fares, so I do think that the least the company might do is to erect the indicators suggested in the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the first part of the amendment, the erection of posts indicating stopping places for omnibuses, the Deputy should take the matter up with the Minister for Local Government.  The administration of the Road Traffic Act is a matter for the Minister for Local Government.  An amendment of that kind would be inappropriate in this legislation.  There is power under an Emergency Powers Order of designating stopping places, and the Minister for Local Government may require the erection and maintenance of signs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, I understand, frequent difficulty in getting the consent of the local authorities to the erection of signs, but the only point I want to make at the moment is that the object which the Deputy has in mind has got to be secured by the use or amendment of the Road Traffic Act and not by the amendment of this Bill. The Road Traffic Act, as I have told him, is the responsibility of the Minister for Local Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be inappropriate to this Bill.  The regulation of traffic, as distinct from the provision of road services, comes under the Road Traffic Act, which is the responsibility of the Minister for Local Government. The provision of adequate cloak-room accommodation at seaside resorts is a matter for the local authorities catering for those resorts.  If the Deputy has in mind the provision of cloak-room accommodation at the termini of transport services, then under the existing law the railway company is required to provide cloak-room and waiting-room facilities at railway termini, and under Section 125 of the Bill it is being required to afford similar facilities in connection with passenger services by road.</P>

      <P>This may be a small matter, but it is an important one in Cork.  First of all, there is the question of bus stops.  The absence of indicators is an inconvenience even to the citizens of Cork.  The point has been raised already by a Deputy of the Minister's own Party, Deputy Daly, I think.  If the Minister would agree to Deputy Anthony's amendment now, I think we could do away with a lot of bickering and petty trouble over this question of bus stops.  We all look forward to tourist traffic at the end of the war and the Government is prepared to spend a lot of money in that direction.  I am not quite sure that I would go the whole way with Deputy Anthony in regard to those enormous and perhaps expensive rest-houses at seaside resorts like Crosshaven or Youghal, but I think the question of bus stops is one that affects everybody. When I hear Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Hughes advocating the erection of bus stops in Cork, I think of the Greeks, and I fear them bearing gifts, but I would ask the Minister to take Deputy Anthony's amendment in <Col N="252" /> a friendly spirit and put it in.  The absence of those stops is a great nuisance to people who come to a city like Cork.  It is quite a big city; it is not as big as Dublin, we know, but we hope it will be bigger.  I am asking the Minister to approach this amendment in a friendly way, and to accept it if he possibly can.</P>

      <P>In page 23 to delete Section 49, lines 14 to 31, and substitute the following section:&mdash;</P>

      <P>(a) an agreement or arrangement for the allocation or routing of traffic or for the pooling of receipts from such traffic or for differential rates on traffic passing by sea to or from the State, or</P>
      <P>(b) an agreement or arrangement varying or rescinding any such agreement or arrangement as is mentioned in paragraph (a) of this sub-section.</P>
      <P>(2)  Except in so far as authorised by an Order of the Minister, the company shall not enter into any agreement to which this section relates with any other transport undertaker.</P>
      <P>(3)  An Order under sub-section (2) of this section shall not be made in relation to any agreement to which this section relates save on the application of the parties proposing to enter into the agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="255" /> (4)  If&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  an application is made for an order under sub-section (2) of this section, and</P>
    <P>(b)  it appears to the Minister that the interests of any transport undertaker (not being a proposed party to the agreement) would be affected if the agreement were made,</P>
    <P>the Minister shall, before making the Order, give that transport undertaker an opportunity of making representations in relation to the agreement and consider any representations so made.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recollect that the question of the suitability of the original section was raised in Committee by Deputy Coburn and other Deputies. The proposed amendment provides that the company cannot enter into any agreement for the allocation or routing of traffic or rescind any such agreement with any other transport undertaker except under a Ministerial Order and no Order may be made save on the application of the partners.  If the interests of other transport undertakers appear to be affected, the Minister shall hear their representations before making an Order.  The amendment differs from the original section in so far as only parties to the agreement can apply to the Minister for an Order.  Previously, such applications could be made by any other transport undertaker affected by such agreement or by any representative body of traders.  Secondly, the matter is not referable to the Advisory Committee, which was one of the points made by Deputy Coburn.  Thirdly, provision is made to hear representations from any other transport undertaker whose interests appear to be affected; and, fourthly, the original section was incomplete as drafted, in that it left it open to the company to come to agreement with another transport undertaker without the necessity for a Ministerial Order, if they had not already got an agreement with any such undertaking.  That matter is now being corrected.

      <P>I move amendment No. 28:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 42, before Section 106, line 6, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The company shall pay to the Chairman of the Railway Tribunal on the abolition thereof a sum equal to the salary (less suspended pension) received by him as Chairman during the period of two years expiring on the day before the establishment date.</P>
      <P>This amendment raises the position of the Chairman of the Railway Tribunal Deputy Davin has one down in the same terms and with the same effect, though his wording is different.  The gist of both appears to be that the chairman will be put in a position approximating to that of the directors of the dissolved companies.  The Chairman of the Railway Tribunal was appointed originally for a fixed term of five years, after which the appointment might be on a year-to-year basis. The position in regard to the present chairman of the tribunal &mdash; there has never been any other chairman &mdash; is that he was previously a judge and qualified for pension rights arising under his original judicial office.  That pension was, of course, suspended while he was in receipt of pay as chairman of the tribunal.  As a matter of fact, he got the difference between such pension as he might have secured if he retired and the exact salary as fixed.  He has been enjoying that difference for a certain number of years.  There was no reason to expect that he would not have gone on enjoying that for years to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite true that he had no security and it can be objected that we should not give payment here, where there was no security of tenure, on the simple falling in of his particular post.  But that falling in was brought about by the introduction of this <Col N="258" /> measure and it is at that point that the analogy arises with the railway directors. The railway directors hold their appointments from year to year, from general meeting to general meeting, and might have been dislodged at any point.  Under this measure, the directors are being carried forward; those who were directors on the establishment day are being declared to be the shareholders' directors and there is a provision that, if there is no agreement on the matter, there is to be determination by lot as to which shall hold office for one year, which for two years and which for three years.</P>
    <P>The provision of the Bill go further and say that, if any of these people, who are carried forward by this Bill only on a year-to-year basis, likes to resign office, he is to be given two years of the emolument he would receive if he stayed on.  Therefore, with regard to the directors, the situation is that they have exactly the same tenure of office as the chairman of the tribunal.  In fact, in present circumstances, it might be said that their reliance on the continuance of their office was very much less than in his case, as there might have been considerable agitation over the way they behaved and managed the company for some time past, whereas no such complaint has arisen against the chairman of the tribunal.  We are continuing them in order to buy them out by this offer of two years' salary.</P>
    <P>I suggest that it would be a gracious thing to give the Chairman of the Railway Tribunal the same terms.  I suggest that he is owed something. Ordinarily, a person put into an office of that type &mdash; originally with a fixed period of five years and continuing thereafter from year to year &mdash; has an expectation that, unless he is given something in the nature of notice or warning, he may rely on continuing for a certain period.  I agree that he has no legal right whatever and could have been dropped at the beginning of any year after the first five and that, if that happened, he would have had no resort to the courts, but neither could the directors resort to the courts.  I suggest that the position is very analogous in his case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="259" /> It can also be said that, if he had not been given the fixed term originally, he would not have taken the post. At his time of life and with his experience as a County Court judge, there were other possibilities open before him.  There was the possibility &mdash;I suggest, the probability &mdash; that he could have accepted other lucrative employment and, by taking the railway tribunal position, he deprived himself of that.  He was given a five-year contract at the beginning and, apparently, that was sufficient to make him turn his back on other offices which might have been open to him.  It could be said after that that it was an appointment only from year to year.  That applies to a number of public servants, but they have all this, in any event, that on their agreeing to take up a position, they are appointed for a term of years and if they do not behave in any unsatisfactory fashion, or to put it positively, if they behave well, they are likely to be carried forward, because it is always agreed in getting people for positions of this type that one has to accept that unless there is some sort of inducement held out to them they will not take a short term.  They may take a short term on the understanding that if they carry out their duties efficiently, then they will be carried forward.  I think that in all the circumstances this amendment should be given favourable consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the amendment.  Deputy McGilligan has said practically everything that could be said in favour of it, but it might also be pointed out that the individual who is chairman of the tribunal enjoyed a very large practice prior to his appointment as County Court judge, and that alternative employment of one kind or another was certainly available to him.  He declined that on the understanding that he would be appointed for a fixed term. Under the original arrangement, the appointment lasted for five years, and it was then put on a year-to-year basis. As Deputy McGilligan has mentioned, compensation is being paid to the directors on the basis of two years' fees.  This amendment, if accepted, <Col N="260" /> would make similar provision for the chairman of the tribunal.  The fact that the tribunal is being abolished is not due to any fault of his, and it is reasonable to assume that, had the tribunal been continued, he would have continued to be chairman.  I understand that he discharged the duties of the office extremely efficiently, and in view of the fact that all other people who could be compensated are being compensated, it is possible that it was only through an oversight that no provision was made for the chairman.  I would urge on the Minister the desirability of accepting this amendment, or at any rate of accepting the spirit of the amendment, and of making some provision for this individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree at all that there is any analogy between the case of the chairman of the tribunal and the directors of the amalgamating companies.  The amalgamating companies, whatever may have been their history, had their origin in private enterprise, and the State, when it interferes with the operation of private enterprises of that kind, has an obligation to ensure that the consequences of its action are not unduly hard on individuals.  The Railway Tribunal was established by statute, and it was obviously within the power of this House to abolish it at any time. The chairman of the tribunal was appointed originally for five years, and has latterly been appointed from year to year.  There was no obligation of any kind to reappoint him at the end of the year, and no ground for the expectation that he would be so reappointed. In fact, I think I could say that the Government would have found difficulty in reappointing the chairman of the tribunal as far back as 1939, on the grounds of age, were it not for the fact that I then informed the Government that the reorganisation of transport, which we had in contemplation, and the new legislation which would be required to give effect to that reorganisation, would in all probability provide for the disappearance of the Railway Tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I can say that in the past four or five years the reappointment of the existing chairman by the Government <Col N="261" /> was determined by the knowledge that the Railway Tribunal would eventually disappear.  I could not, therefore, agree that there is any moral obligation whatever to provide compensation for the chairman on the abolition of the tribunal.  Having regard to the fact that on his retirement from the chairmanship of the Railway Tribunal the person concerned becomes entitled to a pension of £1,500 a year as Circuit Court judge under the financial agreement of 1938, I cannot agree that there will be any hardship caused by leaving the position as it is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  In fact, it was the knowledge that there was a certain saving arising out of the fact that this pension was in abeyance which influenced the Government in appointing the existing chairman in the circumstances to which I have adverted.  I might also say that I would regard it as completely inequitable to have this charge placed on the company.  Under the 1924 Act the company was liable only for half his salary; the Government was liable for the other half.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 32:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 45, Section 110 (4), paragraph (e), to add at the end of the paragraph, line 66, the following new sub-paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(iii) where, immediately before the operative date, a right of way was exercisable over the said bridge&mdash;</P>
      <P>(I) in case the railway company, before the date referred to in sub-paragraph (i) of this paragraph do the following works, namely, replace the said bridge by a crossing on the level over the site of the abandoned railway and render the said crossing fit and safe for use, a right of way similar to that which was exercisable over the said bridge shall, by virtue of this sub-paragraph, be exercisable over the said crossing, and any person for the time being entitled thereto may do all such things as are reasonably necessary for keeping the said crossing fit and safe for use,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="263" /> (II) in any other case, the right of way over the said bridge shall continue to be exercisable, and any person for the time being entitled thereto may do all such things as are reasonably necessary for keeping the said bridge fit and safe for use.</P>
    <P>This amendment preserves rights of way and is being inserted on representations from the Minister for Lands who considers that where the railway company replaces a bridge by a level crossing, a right of way thereover should be conferred on those persons previously entitled to use the bridge inasmuch as the company may proceed to sell the site of a line and the purchaser may be in a position to take objection to the use of the level crossing unless the parties using the level crossing have a legal right to do so. Again there may be a case where the railway company would choose to pay compensation on ceasing to be liable to maintain a bridge instead of constructing a level crossing.  If part of a holding is cut off by the line and access to the holding can be obtained only through the part of the line purchased by some person other than the landholder, it is necessary that the purchaser should be ready to maintain the bridge and repair the structure.  A right of way is conferred on the landholder in addition to being paid compensation for the burden of keeping up the bridge as a means of access to the land.</P>

      <P>In page 46, Section 110 (8), to add at the end of the sub-section, line 23, the words &ldquo;either by private treaty to the owner of the land on both sides of such line or by public auction&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment has also been suggested by the Minister for Lands and it is designed to prevent disputes arising in cases in which a railway line has been abandoned and the permanent-way is being sold.  The amendment provides that the land will be offered, in the first instance, to the adjoining landowners and, only if they decline to buy, will it be sold by public auction.  It is thought that there might be unnecessary cause for dispute if the land were put up for public auction, in the first instance, and purchased by persons other than the adjoining landowners.  The intention is that the land should be sold to the adjoining landowners, if they want to buy it.</P>

      <P>This is a drafting amendment.  In drafting this section, the draftsman used the limiting words &ldquo;in any vehicles&rdquo;.  That limitation is now being removed so as to bring the section in line with corresponding provisions in respect of railway and canal services.</P>

      <P>A couple of important matters arise on this amendment, and I want to get information concerning <Col N="266" /> them.  The Railway and Canal Traffic Act, 1854, applied mainly to railways, but also applied to canals.  It is now being applied to roads.  That Act was supposed to give a right of action in connection with undue preferences. That was in what was called the &ldquo;inequality clause&rdquo;.  That provision was found to be extremely deficient when cases came up for decision.  The law was amended, and I notice that this Act is being applied to the road business of the new company. Will that carry with it the amending legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It carries the Act, as amended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not so stated and, if the Minister will glance at other statutes, he will find the phrase used &ldquo;and Acts amending the same&rdquo;.  This Act never applied to road traffic.  We are making it applicable to something to which it never previously applied. When that section was brought before the courts, the judges exposed its weakness.  It was not applicable to any great extent and it was fortified by two other sections of the 1888 Act. So far as I remember, Section 25 and 27 are the sections which are specially applicable.  Under Section 27, there was <i>prima facie</i> evidence of a preferential rate or unequal treatment if it was found that the rates, fares or tolls varied as between one trader and another and, from that moment, there was an onus on the railway company to prove various things.  A few other provisions which followed were in ease of the railway company.  Section 25 referred to the granting of continuous services &mdash; that a company might be made link up with another company, even a private company, so that through rates could be demanded over a particular route.  However, the point I am mainly anxious about is whether or not merely bringing in this precise reference to the Railway and Canal Traffic Act, 1854, will necessarily carry with it later amending legislation.</P>

    <P>the expression &ldquo;the contemplated agreement&rdquo; means an agreement to be made between the bodies concerned with respect to the maintenance (including reconstruction), and control of the bridge;</P>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;the appointed period&rdquo; means the period of one year from the date of the passing of this Act, or such further period as the Minister may allow.</P>
    <P>(2) The bodies concerned may, within the appointed period, execute the contemplated agreement, but the contemplated agreement, if so executed, shall not have any force unless confirmed by the Minister, who is hereby authorised, if he thinks fit, to do so.</P>
    <P>(3) If the contemplated agreement is executed within the appointed period and confirmed by the Minister, the following provisions shall thereupon have effect&mdash;</P>

    <P>(a) the Chief Justice, at the request (made after consultation with the Minister for Local Government and Public Health) of the Minister, shall appoint an arbitrator to determine, after hearing the bodies concerned, the terms and conditions which, having regard to the circumstances then existing, should, in his opinion, govern the future maintenance (including reconstruction) and control of the bridge,</P>
    <P>(b) the determination of the arbitrator shall have statutory effect and it shall be the duty of each of the bodies concerned, and each of them is hereby empowered, to carry out the terms of the said determination so far as the provisions thereof are to be carried out by that body,</P>
    <P>(c) the remuneration of the arbitrator shall be fixed by the Chief Justice and shall be paid in equal proportions by the bodies concerned,</P>

    <P>Deputy Doyle moved an amendment on the Committee Stage which was <Col N="270" /> designed to provide, that in the event of the company, Dublin Corporation and the Canal Company failing to make an agreement in regard to the Victoria Bridge, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health should decide what was to be done and have power to impose his decision upon the parties.  I intimated that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health could not be regarded as an impartial personage in a dispute of that kind and that, in order to secure that something would be done in the event mentioned, I would produce an amendment providing for the settlement of the matter by arbitration. That is what is now proposed in this amendment.  If the parties agree as to what is to be done about Victoria Bridge, they are given power to put their agreement into effect.  If they do not agree, then the Chief Justice shall, at the request of the Minister for Local Government, appoint an arbitrator to decide what is to be done. Provision is made to carry into effect the decision of the arbitrator.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Sir.  I move amendment No. 45, which is an amendment to Amendment No. 44:&mdash;</P>
      <P>After the word &ldquo;suspended&rdquo;, where it occurs in the amendment, to insert the words &ldquo;or dismissed&rdquo;; and after the word &ldquo;suspension&rdquo;, wherever it occurs in the amendment, to insert the words &ldquo;or dismissal&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to amendment No. 44, I think it was Deputy Keyes who raised this question of the possible interruption of a person's employment by the Great Southern Railways Company by reason of his refusal to drive a train or to carry munitions or armed British troops during <Col N="273" /> the period from April, 1916, to December, 1921, and his desire was to arrange that any such period, during which service with the company was interrupted for such causes, would count as service with the company for purposes of compensation or pension under the Bill.  I said, on that occasion, that I agreed with the proposition in principle, but that there would be difficulty in getting formal words to cover the difficulty.  In view of that, the amendment I now propose is the best that I could do.  I propose, under the amendment, that where the Minister certifies that the individual's suspension was due to his national sympathies, and where the suspension occurred between the 1st day of April, 1916, and the 6th day of December, 1921, then that period of suspension shall be included in the period of his pensionable service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the Minister has tried to meet the principle, and I admit the difficulty of getting the proper wording to cover these cases, but all I am asking in my amendment is that the Minister should go a step further, in order to make it clear that his intentions will be carried out.  The Minister says that where the suspension of an individual during that period was due to his national sympathies, the period of suspension shall be included in the period of his pensionable service, but I have in mind the cases of men who were, not merely suspended, but automatically dismissed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I quite understand that, but I have explained that the draftsman found very considerable difficulty in getting the word &ldquo;dismissal&rdquo; into the section without providing for a limit in time, which might be very difficult to apply, and in those circumstances I felt that the best thing to do was to leave the amendment in the form in which it was drafted, and to give my assurance that if there should arise any difficulty in applying it, I shall take the matter up with the company, and I do not expect any difficulty in persuading the company to take the necessary steps to cover such cases if they should arise.  Because of the legal difficulty in meeting the matter of dismissal, <Col N="274" /> without making elaborate provisions covering the period of time in respect of which the dismissal operated, I should prefer to leave the amendment as it is, but I will give the assurance to the House that, in the event of any difficulty of that kind arising, in applying this provision of the Bill in the case of a person who was dismissed during that period of national difficulty, I shall take that matter up with the company with a view to getting an equitable arrangement with the company in respect of that individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I know quite well that the Minister's intentions in that regard are quite sincere, but the trouble is that the time may come when the Minister may not be in a position to take up that attitude with the company when these men are applying for their pensions.  In that event, the company may take a certain line and stand upon the terms of the amendment as it is set down here, as to whether it affects suspension or dismissal.  I do know that in some cases dismissal did take place here in the City of Dublin, and I have recently come across a case of a man in County Mayo who said he was dismissed because of his national sympathies during that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>But there is the question of a time limit.  For instance, a man may not have gone back to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but he was dismissed because of his national sympathies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, of course, but if he did not resume work the question of his suspension does not arise.  I think it is implicit, both in the Deputy's amendment and in mine, that resumption of work should have taken place, and, as I have pointed out, it would be extremely difficult to cover all that would be implied in the word &ldquo;dismissal&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>A fortnight ago, when the House adjourned, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health delivered a speech on this Bill which the Labour Party are sponsoring.  I repeat now what I said then, that I do not think the House ever heard such a lot of unadulterated nonsense as the Minister spoke on that occasion.  He started off by saying that Deputy Norton and Deputy Murphy were misleading the House; that they did not disclose the full purport of the Bill or what it would cost the ratepayer or the taxpayer as the case might be.  The Minister's speech was a sort of fi-fafum speech.  He was trying to frighten Deputies who perhaps had not read the Bill or who may not have been here when Deputy Norton and Deputy Murphy were speaking; people whom, by reason of the fact that there is certain discipline in his Party, the Minister knew he would be able to convince that, so far as the Government is concerned, it would be bad policy to have the Bill passed.  The Minister cried salt tears about the ratepayers. Apparently, he is not aware of what is going on in his own Department.  He, apparently, does not know that since this emergency started the local authorities have been called upon to raise huge sums through the rates every year in order to deal with an emergency which should have been dealt with directly by the Government.  At the present time, in the case of the Wexford Corporation, the ratepayers of that borough are being mulcted to the extent of almost 5/- in the £ in order to finance schemes for the relief of the people.  In consequence of the situation which confronts this country, that is a burden that should be borne <Col N="280" /> by the Government itself.  The Minister expressed alarm that the ratepayers would be mulcted in a huge sum if this Bill were passed, but neither the Minister nor his Department is so much concerned about the ratepayers, especially the rural ratepayers, when the annuities are not paid by certain people in the rural areas, because his Department has repeatedly stopped huge sums in the way of grants from certain county councils. The withholding of these grants results in higher rates being levied on the people in the county generally, including the people who would benefit under the Bill we are discussing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated that if this Bill were to become law it would be equivalent to the handing over of 10,000 cottages to people for nothing. Now, anybody could make a statement of that kind.  I might just as well say that, if the Minister's salary were divided amongst a certain number of people, and if by doing so they were given £2 a week each, it would be a desirable thing for the country.  It would probably be a more popular thing to say than what the Minister has said in regard to the 10,000 cottages. I suggest to him that that is not a serious way to deal with a problem of this kind, and I would ask the House to bear in mind that we have here a definite problem to consider.  The Minister objected to Deputy Murphy telling the House that the present Labourers Act was a dead letter.  I have no hesitation in repeating what Deputy Murphy said, because to all intents and purposes the Act is a dead letter.  Even on the Minister's own figures it will be found that only between one-fifth and one-sixth of the people concerned have expressed their intention, in one way or another, of taking advantage of the provisions of the 1936 Act.  The Minister also objected to Deputy Murphy saying that he himself did not agree with tenants purchasing their cottages.  The Minister said that was a dishonest thing for Deputy Murphy to do.  I submit that it was nothing of the kind.  I agree with Deputy Murphy that the people would be better off under their present conditions than if they were to buy <Col N="281" /> their cottages either under the 1936 Act or under this measure.  Deputy Murphy and I come here to express the views of our constituents &mdash; not our own views.  There are certain agricultural labourers in the country who are in favour of buying their cottages under a scheme such as this.  The Minister said that about 9,000 people have expressed their willingness to purchase labourers' cottages.  I wonder if an examination would reveal that all these people are agricultural labourers. Members of the House who are conversant with rural affairs know that there are certain people occupying cottages in rural areas who are not agricultural labourers.  They are people who have improved their position. Some of them have got land and some are tradesmen.  I do not object to that, but my point is that these people would be in a better position to buy their cottages than the man who is dependent on an agricultural labourer's wage week after week.</P>
    <P>The Minister went out of his way in his laudation of Deputy Coburn.  I submit that neither the Minister nor Deputy Coburn understands the text of this Bill, which does not propose to take over one single cottage.  I refer again to what the Minister said, that the Bill, if passed, would mean that 10,000 cottages would be handed over to people free of charge.  The machinery for effecting the sale of cottages is set out in the Bill so that all this talk about confiscation is all nonsense.  If it is confiscation, then the same charge can, and should, be levelled against the Bill, which the Government brought in and passed in 1936.  In the palmy days of Fianna Fáil their speakers went through the country telling the cottage tenants that they were going to get their cottages for nothing, but then, of course, when Fianna Fáil got into office the whole thing was changed, in this as in other parts of their programme.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that if this Bill were to become law it would strip the local authorities of the assets which would arise out of the original investment of £11,000,000.  I think the value of this investment to the local authorities <Col N="282" /> may be gauged by the fact that in my native County Wexford the average annual rental for a cottage is £3 9s. 8d., whereas the average cost of repairs is £6 9s. per cottage.  That does not mean that all the cottages in the area have been repaired.  As a matter of fact, comparatively few cottages have been repaired and month after month at the county council meetings practically all the members are complaining that cottage repairs have not been carried out to the extent to which they should be.  In Wicklow the average rental is £4 6s. 4d. and the cost of repairs, in 1942/43, worked out at £6 9s. per cottage.  In Tipperary South Riding, the average rental was £3 18s. 11d. and the cost of repairs averaged £12.  In Ua bhFáilghe the average rental was £3 17s. 1d. and the repairs averaged £16 10s. 0d.; in Westmeath the average rental was £3 4s. 5d., in the cost of repairs, £20; in Meath, the average rental was £3 4s. 5d., in 1942/43 the cost of repairs averaged £55 4s. 0d. per cottage.  In the case of Meath, in respect of a cottage which was repaired in 1942/43 it will take 17 years' rent to repay the cost of these repairs.</P>
    <P>In face of these figures I am at a loss to know how the Minister can say that there is anything approaching confiscation.  I am perfectly satisfied, and I believe that anybody who is attached to a county council will also be satisfied, that it would be a very good bargain for a county council at the present time to hand over completely all the cottages under their jurisdiction because, if the cottages received year after year the attention they require in so far as repairs are concerned, the liabilities of the county council in this respect would be three or four times greater than the assets accruing to them by way of rent.</P>
    <P>The Minister, dealing with the reference made by Deputy Murphy to the fact that in his opinion the 1936 Act was a dead letter, told us that 9,453 cottages had been taken over or were in the act of being taken over. That is about one-sixth of the total number of cottages in this country.  I do not think the Minister could accept that or put that forward as an <Col N="283" /> indication of the popularity of that particular Act.  The annual amount for repairs varies throughout the country between £115,000 and £150,000 and that really does not meet the bill in respect of repairs, because as everybody who is a county councillor knows, cottage repairs have not been attended to as they should be, especially in recent years.  There is, of course, the excuse of the war and shortage of materials but it will be found on examination that even before the war cottage repairs were not attended to as they should be.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, the Minister tried to belittle this Bill.  He told the House that Deputy Norton and Deputy Murphy did not make the Dáil aware of the true contents of the Bill, that the Bill was a confiscation measure.  I remember one time when the Minister would not hedge at a Bill of this kind.  I remember when the Minister made promises which would bring about greater confiscation than this Bill proposes.  I have no hesitation in recommending this Bill to the House.  I believe if Deputies were to examine the position carefully, to examine the liabilities of the county councils in respect of repairs and compare them with the assets accruing to them by way of rent, they would find that it would be a very good bargain for the county councils of Eire if they were to hand over the cottages without any payment at all.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about the extraordinary reduction that is brought about.  Surely he is not serious in suggesting that an average of 3½d. per week is an extraordinary reduction when it has to be considered that it takes, on an average, about three times the rental to repair the cottages. A great number of these cottages are old.  They are deteriorating rapidly and would require an annual expenditure in order to make them habitable for the people who are going to take them over.</P>
    <P>The Minister showed by his statement that he has not the slightest knowledge of the problem, that he does not know a thing about the position of agricultural labourers, that he does <Col N="284" /> not know the condition of the buildings that are under consideration in this Bill.  I hope Deputies will not be misled by the statement he made.  As I said, his speech was a sort of fi-fafum speech, in which he tried to frighten Deputies, to tell them that the Labour Party were out for confiscation. Of course, his little bit about Moscow and his reference to myself at the end might, of course, get Deputies' backs up, and make them think they were voting against something communistic. As far as Moscow is concerned, the Minister was nearer to Moscow on one occasion than I will ever be.</P>

      <P>The Minister in his speech a fortnight ago appealed, I think, to members of this Party, Clann na Talmhan, to come out strongly against this Bill.  He sought, I think, to raise the scare that this Bill, if enacted, would impose an increased burden on the local ratepayers. I, as a member of a county council of considerable experience, fail to see how this Bill would increase the burden on local ratepayers.  This Bill, if enacted, will reduce the revenue raised by way of rent from the cottage tenants by 50 per cent., but it will relieve the local authorities of the entire burden of the cost of the repair of cottages which, over a period of years, amounted to more than 50 per cent. of the rent.  Therefore, on the face of it, I cannot see that any loss will accrue to the local authorities or to the ratepayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a good and a sound Bill inasmuch as it seeks to do what every progressive person with a Christian outlook is seeking to achieve, that is, to vest in the largest possible number of citizens of the State ownership of their holdings, ownership of at least some portion of the real estate of this country.  I think I remember the time when the Minister made the flesh of certain old ladies in Rathmines and Rathgar creep when he talked about the communistic tendencies of the Labour Party.  I fail to see anything communistic about this Bill.  If any citizen, any member of this House, or <Col N="285" /> any Government were to devise a means to thwart Communism, a more effective means could be devised than to make manual workers in rural Ireland owners of their homes.  That is what this Bill sets out to achieve.  It will ensure that whatever Government may be in power, or whatever changes may take place in the outlook of our people on social questions, there will be, at least, 50,000 additional small property owners with a stake in the country.  That should weigh very deeply with everybody interested in the advancement and development of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>There are aspects of this Bill which require attention.  There were aspects of the original Bill which required to be carefully considered in order that the purpose for which rural housing was inaugurated would not be upset.  When it was first decided to embark on a policy of providing houses for agricultural workers, the scheme carried with it a definite contract on the part of the State, that people from whom land was required on which it was proposed to build houses, would be safeguarded, inasmuch as they would be assured of workers for their industry.  Therefore, a definite bargain was entered into between the State and the farming community.  The latter had to make certain concessions so that housing would be provided for their workers.  They had to give land in the first place, and had to undertake certain burdens which fell on the rates and taxes but, in return, they were assured they would have the benefit of the services of those who secured houses.  It was definitely part and parcel of the original Labour Acts that these houses would be reserved for agricultural workers.  As far as I understand the Act of 1936 and this Bill, it is not proposed to upset that arrangement, and I think in no circumstances could it be upset.</P>
    <P>This Bill, because of the conditions under which the houses were built, will confer ownership, conditional upon the occupants of cottages being agricultural workers.  That arrangement is not upset by the Bill.  That is an aspect of this question about which farmers are seriously concerned.  There <Col N="286" /> will always be a tendency for a certain number of labourers' cottages to get into the possession of people who are not agricultural workers.  I hold that it is a duty imposed on the State to see that that does not happen.  In many areas there is a serious dearth of agricultural workers, and if houses which were provided for them, so that they would be available for the agricultural industry, are diverted to some other classes it would be a most undesirable state of affairs.  This Bill does not propose to divert these houses to persons other than agricultural workers.  Therefore it contains no menace to the farming community.  I feel that, while the Bill may not confer a monetary benefit on the tenants, it will confer a social advantage on them.  It will tend to raise their status in the community, to make them owners of property, with an interest in that property, and with the right to transfer it to their heirs, provided they are agricultural workers.</P>
    <P>While I admit that the cost of repairs when carried out by local authorities has been exceedingly high, I believe that the tenants, when the responsibility is placed on their own shoulders, will carry out such work effectively, perhaps much cheaper and with greater satisfaction.  It very frequently happened in the past that when repairs were carried out they were not done to the satisfaction of the occupants.  When this Bill is implemented cottage tenants will be in a position to improve their homes as they think fit.  Taken in conjunction with the 1936 Act, which it seeks to improve, this Bill will confer a very great benefit on rural Ireland and on the agricultural industry.  Some people might be inclined to oppose the Bill on the ground that it might interfere with the further development of housing in rural Ireland.  I do not share that view.  I think the rent of ? per week outlined in the Bill, that is, 50 per cent of the original rent, which would probably be about 2/6 weekly in most cases, is quite sufficient to finance a proper housing scheme for our agricultural workers.</P>
    <P>I hold very strongly that interest charges on money required for housing <Col N="287" /> have always been excessive, and I believe there is no necessity whatever for any interest charge on money which the State requires to finance such a work of national development as housing, where a permanent asset which cannot be destroyed is created within the country.  For that reason, I hold that a tenant paying ? per week will repay the entire principal required for the erection of this house within the life of the house.  That will ensure that, even though this measure becomes law, housing will still go on, and tenants will be able, with a proper system of finance, to pay the full cost of the housing they require, without placing any burden whatever on either the taxpayer or ratepayer.  That is the position which should obtain if the State had not embarked on the peculiar policy of paying excessive interest rates for money which the State itself creates.</P>
    <P>In winding up his speech a fortnight ago, the Minister whipped himself into a foaming fury in denouncing what he described as confiscation or expropriation of property, and he asked where this state of affairs was to end if the House were to propose to take property from the local authorities and transfer it to the tenants.  The Minister seemed to forget or to ignore the fact that local authorities are part and parcel of the State, and we have the Minister trying to raise a scare about the State taking property from itself and handing it over to independent citizens.  There is no danger to be feared in a policy which leads to the State owning less property than it owns at present, and that is simply what the Bill proposes.  It proposes that 50,000 or 60,000 acres of land, with the houses, should, instead of being the property of the State, become the property of individual tenants.  Does anyone think that these tenants of labourers' cottages are such powerful magnates that, having secured this concession, they will set out to grasp more and more property?  That is what the Minister seemed to imply by his loud-voiced cries of alarm.</P>
    <P>I am far more enthusiastic about the Bill than those who propose it.  I <Col N="288" /> believe it is a good measure.  It is a sound idea to make the owners of labourers' cottages masters in their own homes.  It will impose no burden on anybody and will confer an immense benefit on the community.  It will confer a social advantage and will strengthen our nation in every possible way.  The more people there are firmly entrenched in possession of property, the more independent our nation will be and the less servile the entire community will be to the State, which is an aim for which we should strive.  I congratulate the Labour Party on bringing forward this Bill.  The Minister claims that the Labour Party is tainted with Communism.  The Labour Party, for all I know, may be red as a ripe tomato, but there is nothing red about this Bill.  It is a sound measure, and I regard it as a healthy sign that the representatives of Labour should bring forward a measure of the kind.</P>

      <P>I should like to see the agricultural labourers becoming the owners of their cottages, but I should like to know if Deputies speak with one voice here and with another at their county council meetings at home.  There are village schemes of cottages for which the people, who are agricultural labourers, are paying 3/2 and 3/6 per week.  Last February, I asked the Wexford County Manager for a reduction in the rents of these houses.  I was strongly opposed by Deputy Corish who now supports this Bill.  Deputy Corish then said that a 50 per cent. reduction on these village scheme houses would put another £1,728 on the rates.  Are these people in these village scheme houses who are only agricultural labourers to get no benefit?  Only the people who have houses for 9d. are included in the Bill. The new houses will be 2/6 per week, while the village scheme houses are 3/6 per week.  Many of the people who occupy these houses are very poor, and, if they got possession of their houses to-morrow, would probably be unable to keep them in repair.  Some may be better off than others, but the majority are poor, and would be unable to keep them in repair if they were handed over to them by the local authority.  It is all very well for Deputies to come <Col N="289" /> here and make speeches about housing and then oppose a motion to reduce rents in their own counties.  I do not believe for one minute that the Labour Party is honest in introducing this Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not believe in people who are not sincere, who make speeches in the Dáil and then go to the meeting of the Wexford County Council and oppose a proposal for the reduction of rents for any section of the people.  I do not regard such people as honest men, and that is why I do not agree with the speeches of these Deputies.  Deputy Cogan is silent on this aspect, too, and it may be for vote-catching purposes in County Wicklow.</P>
      <P>Probably if he had a half-acre and a man was looking for it, the man would have to go into court to get it, just as happens in connection with the additional half-acre.  People on the land are very fond of the land.  According to our county manager, I believe that any cottier at the moment can take possession of his house.  On some of them the annuity is nearly paid &mdash; there are only about eight years to go.  The vast majority of the people, as I say, probably will not take over the houses if this Bill goes through, because they will not be able to keep them in repair.  An agricultural labourer with £1 19s. 6d. per week very often will not be able to pay a tradesman to put on a slate.</P>

      <P>The last time a Labourers Bill was before this House practically every Deputy was anxious that the terms of purchase should be a bit more generous as regards the agricultural labourers.  But the question I am anxious to deal with now is the optional clause in the present Bill, which leaves it optional with the local authority to fix an even smaller reduction than the 25 per cent.  Recently here I had to bring certain matters in connection with non-municipal houses built by the South Cork Board of Health to the attention of this House. The rent of these houses was fixed by people who had at first opposed by every means in their power the building of any houses at all.</P>

      <P>The board fixed the rent at 8/- per week and the matter was then referred to the Local Government Department with a protest from us that the sum fixed was even greater than the economic rent.  The matter was sent back by the Local Government Department and these gentlemen then fixed the rent at 7/9 per week, plus rates.  The people concerned, having no hope of owning their little homes under that scheme, applied for a purchase scheme, and a special scheme was brought in by the board giving those people, not a reduction of 25 per cent. which this House intended should be granted under the Labourers Act for all purchases, but a reduction of 10 per cent.  When speaking on this matter in this House previously I asked the Minister if he would send that purchase scheme back to the board for reconsideration and readjustment. It has not since come back.  As the House is now considering a proposal for a reduction of 50 per cent. in this present Bill, I am anxious that at least the conditions that this House allowed by the former Act should apply to these unfortunate tenants and that they should get the full benefit of the legislation.</P>
      <P>I think this is a favourable opportunity to appeal again to the Minister to arrange, in justice to these unfortunate tenants, that the purchase scheme, fixing their reductions at only 10 per cent. instead of 25 per cent. in the present legislation, be sent back to the local authorities for readjustment, so that those people will get the benefit of the reduction that this House intended for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>They are long <Col N="292" /> enough in the House to remember that when the Government were proposing to introduce the 1936 Act there was a big splash in the <i>Irish Press</i>, the <i>Irish Independent</i> and the <i>Irish Times</i> about making the labourer for the first time the owner of his home, and they set out all they were going to do for him.  Of course, the General Election of 1937 was coming.  But there they stopped.  When the Labour Party were introducing this Bill, I think they should have taken a little leaf from the Government's copybook, and they should have carried out a little propaganda on behalf of this measure.</P>
      <P>I am in favour of the principle of making the labourer the owner of his home.  There is an Act already in existence, and it is argued by the supporters of this Bill that it has prevented that principle being given effect to.  I do not know that if you reduce it to 50 per cent. the labourers will take it either.  If they would, I think the Government should accept it no matter what the cost may be.</P>
      <P>There are two or three points that the promoters of this Bill should have paid some attention to, points that should have been covered by some section. In every county you have a number of cottage rent collectors.  If you reduce the rents by 50 per cent. you automatically reduce the warrants by 50 per cent.  Assume for a moment that every labourer buys out his home. Automatically the rates are taken away from the rents.  At the moment the rents and rates are collected together. If this Bill were to become law you will reduce the warrant by so much.  What are you to do with the rent collectors?  What scheme have you for them?  They have rights just as well as the cottage owners.  Notwithstanding the Government's White Paper, which we have before us, I submit that a case has not been made. We should examine this thing thoroughly, and a plebiscite or referendum should be held, asking the cottage tenants what they want.</P>

      <P>Yes, just as you would do it; if you felt that something should be done, you would not be behindhand in doing that.  Everybody seems to think that he can talk for the cottage tenants.  I know as much about them as any person in this country, but I would not attempt to suggest that I was the sole custodian of their rights &mdash; that I could speak for them.  I do know that it would be a very sound principle if every cottage tenant was the owner of his home, and he is as well entitled to that ownership as a tenant farmer is.  You would give the cottage tenants stability; you give them a sense of private ownership, and that will make for stability.</P>
      <P>Against that you may argue that you are imposing on the tenants an obligation and an onus they are not prepared to undertake.  Reading some of the arguments against the Land Acts, one finds that the very same argument was made at the time that legislation was being considered.  People were told that if they made the Irish farmer the owner of his home they were going to place an obligation on him of doing the drainage on his land and carrying out repairs &mdash; doing all the work that the landlord used to do for him.  They were told that for that reason he should not be permitted to become the owner of his home.  Notwithstanding all those arguments, the Irish tenant farmers insisted on becoming the owners of their farms and I think it would be a sound principle to assist the cottage tenants to become the owners of their homes.</P>
      <P>As regards the 50 per cent. of the existing rents, it may be argued that it is too much to ask the local authorities to carry the burden and, on the other hand, it is argued that it is too much to ask the tenant to carry it.  You cannot have it both ways.  If the tenant is anxious to purchase his holding, my view is that he should be allowed to do so at 50 per cent.  Make him the owner of his home and when you have that done you will have given the labourer the right to property, and dear knows it is time.  For a long time he has been left unconsidered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding the splash made by <Col N="294" /> Fianna Fáil in 1936 about making the labourer the owner of his home, they are now resisting the proposal and appear anxious to leave him without any opportunity of becoming the owner.  What is the view of the Government? Are they going to resist or accept this Bill?  If they are going to resist it, the obligation is on them to show in a very positive way why they are resisting it and why they have run away from the promise they made the labourers in 1936.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a <Col N="295" /> Second Time.  This is an amending Bill, and consequently I cannot deal with what I might call the principles. I can only take it section by section to see what are the amendments which are proposed in this Bill.  The diseases of animals legislation started in 1894, and the Principal Act is referred to in many cases. First of all, Section 5 and 6 of the Principal Act deal with a disease called cattle plague, which has not been known in this country for many years now, and Section 8 and 9 deal with pleuro-pneumonia and foot-and-mouth disease.  Section 2 of this Bill will have the effect of abolishing those sections altogether, and having all the diseases dealt with under Section 10 of the Principal Act. Section 10 is of wider application and it gives the central authority more power than does any of the other sections I mentioned, that is Sections 5, 6, 8 and 9.  It is proposed, therefore, to have all the diseases, cattle plague, pleuro-pneumonia and foot-and-mouth disease, dealt with under Section 10 the same as the other diseases.  That is the effect of Section 2 of this Bill. Sub-section (2) of Section 2 provides that the certificate of a veterinary surgeon that the disease exists is conclusive evidence of the disease.  In other words, it is not necessary that the veterinary surgeon should be examined on the subject if he has presented his certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 of this Bill deals with the matter of compensation.  Under the present legislation, compensation can be paid only where the animal is slaughtered as suffering from the disease, but it sometimes happens that, where an order is given, after examination, to have the cattle slaughtered, some of them die before the slaughter can take place.  Strictly speaking, compensation cannot be paid in such cases, although in fact we did pay compensation in the last outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, even though it was not strictly legal.  Nobody questioned it, of course, I need hardly say.  There are four sub-sections in Section 3, but they all deal with that same point. Sub-section (1) deals with cases of <Col N="296" /> cattle plague.  Sub-section (2) deals with cases of pleuro-pneumonia.  Sub-section (3) deals with foot-and-mouth disease, and sub-section (4) with swine fever, but they all have the same effect, that is to say that, where an animal has been ordered to be slaughtered, and where it dies before there is time to slaughter it, compensation can be paid.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with a penalty, that is the penalty of withholding payments where it is considered that the owner was at fault in any way.  As the law stands, payments can be withheld only in respect of animals slaughtered.  To bring this Bill up to date, as it were, paragraph (a) includes compensation payable under sub-section (3), that is, where the compensation is payable, even though the beast died before there was time to slaughter it, payments can be withheld.  In paragraph (b), where animals are moved, say, to another district, and where they have come out of an infected district and it is thought advisable to slaughter them lest they might spread the disease in the new district, payment may be withheld as a penalty.  Paragraph (c) deals with a case where animals are slaughtered because of the movement of say, hay or straw from an infected district into a clean district, or where, say, the owner of the cattle allows them to stray and it is possible that they may have come into contact with infection.</P>
    <P>The next is Section 5.  Under the present legislation, where animals are slaughtered there is power, of course, to make the necessary graves for the dead animals on the land of the person who owns the cattle, but the Minister has no power to requisition land outside that.  During the last outbreak, although we did not actually come up against this particular difficulty, we were very nearly coming up against it. For instance, take the case of a man who has taken land on the 11 months' system.  When the 11 months are up of course he cannot move diseased cattle because he would not be permitted to move them, but he would have no right to the land, and if the cattle were slaughtered in such circumstances it is doubtful whether, under the law as it stands, the Minister would <Col N="297" /> have power to make the necessary graves for the dead cattle.  That is altogether a necessary power.</P>
    <P>Section 6 gives to the Minister power that the local authorities have already, and that is where diseased cattle are found at a fair or a market or a sale yard or any other public place, an inspector of the Minister can take those cattle away and have them isolated or slaughtered as the case may be.  The local authorities have that power at the moment under the Principal Act but the Minister has not got the power and it is well that he should have it, because those diseases are mostly dealt with now by the central authority rather than by the local authority.</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with the question of penalties.  Under the present law, the penalty must not exceed £20, or £5 per head, whichever is the less.  If there are three cattle, for instance, the penalty cannot be more than £15. That is, of course, the court penalty, apart from the penalty of withholding payment, which the Minister has in his own hands.  The court penalty cannot exceed £20, or £5 per head.  The law is being changed there to a penalty of £100, and the necessary repeals of the original Act are being made.</P>
    <P>Section 8 deals with compensation under Section 5, where land is taken on another person's holding for the burial of animals, or under Section 6, where a yard or buildings are taken to isolate or keep cattle other than those of the owner of the place.  This section provides for the compensation payable to the owner of the land or premises, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with the question of court fines.  As the law now stands, these fines go into the Cattle Diseases Fund.  That was quite fair and just in the Act of 1894, as it was contemplated under that Act that the local authority would deal with these diseases and, therefore, the fines would go into the Cattle Diseases Fund, which goes to the local authorities eventually in dealing with disease.  These diseases, such as the foot-and-mouth disease, swine fever or &mdash; if there ever were an attack &mdash;pleuro-pneumonia, would now be dealt with by the central authority and, therefore, it is only right that any <Col N="298" /> fines or penalties would go into the Central Fund rather than into the Cattle Diseases Fund.</P>
    <P>As I explained under Section 2, Sections 5 and 6, 8, 9 and 12, of the Principal Act are repealed, 5, 6, 8 and 9 being no longer necessary, as the cases will be dealt with under Section 10.</P>
    <P>I know that Deputies have a strong objection to what is known as legislation by reference.  I can see the point in that, as when I was in opposition myself and took an interest in a Bill of this kind, it needed a great deal of research and trouble to go back over all these Acts to find out the references. I would like very much to bring these Acts up to date.  This, certainly, is one of the codes which should be brought up to date by an Act simplifying or codifying all the legislation on the diseases of animals.  I feel, however, that the report to be presented by the Post-war Emergency Committee, dealing with veterinary services and the diseases of animals in general, will make further legislation necessary when it has been fully considered. On that occasion, I hope to introduce a new Act to bring the whole legislation up to date and, at the same time, repeal all the old Acts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no objection to the Bill, and think it is necessary. There are, however, a few details which possibly the Minister might be prepared to adjust in Committee.  The Bill appears to us to be all right. Section 3 is essential, as there were certain omissions regarding cattle dying before they were destroyed and, obviously, this provision has to be put in.  Section 4 empowers the Minister to withhold payment, and I object to that legislation.  If an individual commits an offence and is brought to court and the judge &mdash; in his discretion and training as a judge &mdash; fixes the penalty for the offence, it should end at that.  I do not think this House should permit any Minister to set himself up in the capacity of a judge to bring further judgment on the individual who has committed an offence.  We should leave that function completely to the court.  The Minister may say that it is in the old Act, but surely that is no <Col N="299" /> reason why we should slavishly follow that legislation, if we object to certain principles in it.  We should remember, when we are amending it, that the function of administering justice in this country rightly belongs to the court. There is a tendency creeping into legislation and Ministerial Orders in recent years where Ministers are arrogating to themselves the function of the judge and the administration of justice.  That is a most objectionable phase in our legislation.  The Minister should be reconsider this matter.  I think he cannot defend the reservation to the Minister of the right to hold a further court and sit in judgment on an individual, after the ordinary court proceedings. A very severe penalty has already been inflicted, seeing that we are raising the penalty under Section 7 from £20 to £100.</P>
      <P>On Section 5, dealing with the provision of ground for burial of carcasses of cattle that have been destroyed, I can understand the necessity for taking power under this section; but it is necessary to ensure, at the same time, that that power will not be abused. There may be two farms adjoining and the inspector and his staff dealing with an outbreak may go on to the neighbouring farm and make the graveyard there simply because they find it a little more convenient.  The Minister has cited two cases where it would be quite fair and where it would be absolutely essential, showing that we must make this provision.  We must look at it the other way, too, as power of this sort may be used to provide a burial place anywhere that is most convenient. The Minister should ensure that, if there is a suitable place for the burial of destroyed cattle on the farm where they belong, they should be buried there.  The individuals who have no disease on their farm and who have no stock of their own involved should be protected to that extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister on Section 6, that he ought to have the power originally vested in the local authority. In fact, the local authority does not operate that at all, so far as the inspection of live stock at fairs or markets is concerned.  I think that no <Col N="300" /> provision is made for such inspections at all.  The responsibility would rest entirely with his Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally, they do.  I am not aware of any local authority which carries out inspection of stock at fairs and markets at all.  On the question of compensation for cattle destroyed under Section 6 or land compulsorily acquired under Section 5, Section 8 says that, if the applicant does not accept the offer made by the Minister and there is failure to agree on the compensation, the case may go to arbitration.  The principle of one party to that arbitration having the right to select the arbitrator is absolutely unsound and the Minister should not take the power to appoint him. There are two parties to the dispute, yet it is provided that one party will have power to select the arbitrator. Obviously, that should be done by an independent individual &mdash; the President of the High Court or someone like that, certainly not by the Minister, who is an interested party in the matter at issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the Minister tell us exactly how the Cattle Diseases Fund is to be provided?  Is it by a Vote of this House?  In that case it is really as long as it is short, whether whatever penalties are imposed for offences go into the Exchequer or into the Diseases of Animals Fund.  I really do not see the point in that.  There is just one other point to which I should like to refer. The Minister in the debate on the last outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease informed the House that it was his intention to remove the right of appeal in regard to compensation.  I do not think he has carried out that threat in this Bill.  I am glad he has not, but I want an assurance from the Minister that he has dropped the idea of denying to the individual the right of appeal in the matter of compensation.  I should like to know whether that is so or not. If it is not so, I want to argue the matter, but if it is so, there is no necessity to develop it.  So far as I can see we are not repealing that part <Col N="301" /> of the Act under which the individual has the right of appeal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  I shall deal with the matter further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  I agree with the Minister that it is necessary to codify this legislation and bring it up to date.  It is desirable that we should wait until we find out the sort of legislation that is necessary to deal with the new situation in regard to the provision of veterinary services for our live-stock industry and what we intend to do in regard to post-war planning. I can see the wisdom of waiting to take the whole job together and to codify all the Acts when post-war plans are properly prepared.  I hope the Minister will consider the matters I have mentioned and recognise the desirability, firstly, of having an impartial individual selected as arbitrator; and, secondly, of protecting individuals so far as empowering the veterinary staff to acquire ground anywhere is concerned.  The power given there is a little too wide and there should be some limitation imposed on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill deals mainly with matters of detail and I think the House will be prepared to support it. The necessity for the Bill, apparently, became obvious as a result of the experience of the Minister in dealing with the foot-and-mouth disease epidemic. It is desirable, as the Minister pointed out, to have legislation of this kind codified so that Deputies and, still more important, farmers and veterinary people concerned, would be able to see exactly what their rights and powers are.  The position to which Deputy Hughes has referred under Section 4, paragraph (c), under which the Minister has power to withhold compensation from individuals, requires, I think, some further consideration. The paragraph reads: &ldquo;the powers shall be exercisable (in addition to the cases mentioned in the said sub-section) where the Minister is of opinion that the owner or person in charge of the animal slaughtered or directed to be slaughtered, did not take, in relation to the relevant outbreak of the disease, adequate precautions <Col N="302" /> to prevent the spread of the disease.&rdquo;  It is not a very simple matter to decide whether the owner of the stock has or has not taken adequate precautions.  It is a matter about which there could be a very considerable difference of opinion and, for that reason, it seems to be rather unfair to leave the matter to the Minister to decide.  In this case the Minister must be governed or directed by the opinion of whatever inspector happens to be on the spot.  There does not seem to be adequate protection there for the owner of the stock and I think, having regard to the difficulty which would arise in deciding whether a person was guilty or not, it would be desirable to leave the matter for decision in the courts.</P>
      <P>The penalty provided under this Bill is very much increased as compared with previous legislation.  I think it should be ample and even if the Minister considered it was not ample, it would be better to increase the penalty rather than have a clause of this kind under which a person may be penalised by the direct action of the Minister's Department operating through the Minister's official.  I think the Bill would be very much improved by deleting that section, and I should like to hear what the Minister will have to say in defence of it.  It is gratifying to be informed that the Minister has plans for providing a better veterinary service in future, and I think the House will await with interest an outline of the proposals.  Apart from the section which has been referred to, there is not very much in this Bill to which anyone could take serious exception.  As farmers, some of us may feel that the penalty provided in Section 7 is rather severe, but I think we can expect that the courts of this country will be fair and impartial and that they will not impose the maximum penalty without just reason.  I am very anxious to hear what the Minister has to say in regard to Section 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputies have stated, this is a Bill that could be more suitably discussed on the next stage, when we shall come to deal with it section by section.  There were just one or two <Col N="303" /> points raised on which I should like to say a word.  Deputy Hughes and Deputy Cogan object to the provisions of Section 4, that is, to the arbitrary powers of the Minister to withhold compensation.  I quite expected that, because I think that if I were in opposition I would object to them myself, but, on the other hand, I think that if Deputy Hughes or Deputy Cogan ever come over to this side of the House and have to deal with an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease they will change their minds.  They will come to realise that it is only when a person at the top has very arbitrary remedies or penalties at his disposal that he will be able to prevent certain people acting against the common good.  I do not want to condemn the farmers in general because farmers in general are always very amenable to the law, but there are always certain individuals who will try to save their own stock by moving them or who will perhaps try to conceal the disease. Unless these individuals can be dealt with very drastically, it will be impossible to control an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease.  I should have to resist very strongly any opposition to the provisions of Section 4.  I think that an outbreak could not be dealt with without these drastic provisions, but I do not think that they should be used very often.  They were not used very often in the last outbreak.  The whole sum withheld in compensation by the Minister amounted only to a few thousand pounds, but the withholding of that money had a very salutary effect in some cases.  If Deputy Hughes will read Section 5 carefully, he will see that it provides that, where no suitable ground is available, the Minister can go outside a particular holding for ground in which to bury the animals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>In actual practice, what does that mean?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In practice, he will not go outside the holding.  Why should he, if suitable ground is available there? Animals are slaughtered as near as possible to the spot where they are found, and they are buried in the same <Col N="304" /> place, because the less removal the better.  Section 8 applies to cases in which land is taken for burial purposes, or yards or houses are taken near market-places to isolate animals. The person concerned may not be satisfied with the compensation awarded by the Minister, and he has a right of appeal to an arbitrator. Deputy Hughes says that it is unfair that one party to the dispute should appoint the arbitrator.  I think that there is something in that point, and we can look into it.  However, it is so small a matter that it would be hardly worth while going to the Chief Justice and asking him to appoint an arbitrator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be a question of £10 or £12.  In principle, it is not right that one party to a dispute should have the appointment of the arbitrator, and we shall see if some other way of dealing with the matter can be found. As regards the right of appeal which Deputy Hughes mentioned, we found during the late foot-and-mouth outbreak that it was very foolish to have an appeal, because the animals were slaughtered and buried before that appeal could be determined.  What could an appeal tribunal do in those circumstances?  They were not in a position to question the compensation given by the arbitrator appointed by the Minister.  We had to say, &ldquo;His word is final&rdquo;, having appointed a fair and reasonable person to do the job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but we were only amending an Order; we were not amending an Act.  It is unnecessary to bring that provision into this Bill. If a new Order is being made the Order will make the necessary amendments with regard to appeal.  Deputies will see the force of what I have said &mdash;that there was no great use in having an appeal if the animals could no longer be seen.  Let us try to make the best possible provision for arbitration, <Col N="305" /> so that the owner of the cattle will get fair play or more than fair play.  I think Deputies will admit that the compensation was generous in the case of cattle slaughtered in the last outbreak, and it was right it should be so.  But these matters can be better discussed on Committee Stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Cattle Diseases Fund is made up from two sources.  There is a levy on the rate of each local authority. That levy is not made every year but only when it is necessary to build up the fund.  The rate is ½d. in the £. Then, every year, the Exchequer pays over between £3,000 and £4,000.  I should have to look up the particulars to explain why the amount varies.  It varies slightly from year to year but it is always about £3,000 or £4,000.  The ½d. rate levied over all the counties produces something in the region of £20,000, so far as I remember.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the making of an Order.  Suppose, in the post-war period, you had not power under the Emergency Powers Act to make an Order, could you act by regulation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>An Order was made in 1900 &mdash; I do not think that there was any since &mdash; to implement various sections of the Act.  It was this Order, made in 1900, that provided for the appointment of an arbitrator and for appeal to some form of tribunal.  My recollection is that I was told during the foot-and-mouth outbreak of three or four years ago that nobody did appeal until 1941.  We then brought in an emergency Order.  We could have amended the Order if we had acted in time, but we could not make the provision retrospective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that it was at the back of the minds of the legislators that the putting in of that provision for appeal would ensure that the arbitrator would act properly.  It would be unwise to do away with that.  It is a wise provision, seeing that you are compulsorily destroying property in the interest of the health of the cattle <Col N="306" /> population.  The individual is thereby satisfied that he gets fair compensation. When an arbitrator is working under these provisions, he is conscious of the fact that the individual has a right to go to court and that is helpful.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That it is expedient to authorise such payments out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas as are necessary to give effect to any Act of the present Session to make provision for the drainage and improvement of land by the execution of works of arterial drainage, to provide for the maintenance of those works and make further and better provision for the maintenance of existing drainage works, and to provide for matters incidental to or connected with the matters aforesaid or relating generally to the drainage of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to clear up before we agree to this Resolution.  One is the question of the type of staff that will be employed in connection with this scheme.  Take the type of staff that you have in the Board of Works, for instance.  They are merely engineers who are concerned with drainage proper, the getting rid of surplus water, and so on, and I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that, apart from that, there is a very important aspect of drainage in this country that we cannot afford to overlook, and that is the agricultural <Col N="307" /> aspect.  A drainage engineer is merely concerned with getting rid of surplus water, with lowering the level of the water table; and the question of the fertility of the soil in the area concerned does not interest him.  The lowering of the water table in an area, however, may have a serious result so far as the productive capacity of the soil in that area is concerned, and I should like to have an assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary that, in connection with this scheme, an agricultural expert will be employed to look after the interests of the agriculturists.</P>
      <P>If you take a country like Holland, or a district like the State of Louisiana in the United States of America, where there is extensive flooding periodically, and where it was necessary to ensure the fertility of the soil, the primary consideration in drainage schemes in such cases was the employment of agricultural experts with a view to seeing that the agricultural angle and the agricultural interests would be preserved. Of course, the Parliamentary Secretary will appreciate that although in an agricultural community the land may suffer from too much water, the position can be just as bad through having too little water, and that if you lower the water table too much it may have a disastrous effect on the land. For that reason, I should like to have an assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary that, if the matter has not been already considered, he will have it considered now, and perhaps he may be able to tell us something about it on the later stages of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, I wonder has any consideration been given to, or has any experimental or research work been carried out in connection with, the various soils in this country, such as in Limerick, West Limerick, the Bruree and Newcastlewest areas and the hills of Clare, where colloidal matter has disappeared, where there is no percolation to speak of, and where a process of destruction, so far as soil fertility is concerned, is slowly going on year by year.  That is an important aspect of drainage.  It may be that it is a wider aspect than the Parliamentary <Col N="308" /> Secretary is concerned with at the moment.  It may involve field drainage, but surely this House should be concerned with that problem if we are going to spend, year after year, very substantial sums of money in getting rid of surplus waters of that kind.  The natural corollary of that sort of thing is to complete the job by the provision of field drainage and by dealing with difficult soils &mdash; soils which are completely impeded and will not drain. That may possibly require mechanical treatment or, at least, treatment by experts, in order to find out what is the proper way of tackling the job of getting water to percolate through that soil.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this question is that so far as the Dáil is concerned there is really no provision as to how priority is going to operate in dealing with national drainage.  I do not suggest that there is going to be any political influence as between one county and another &mdash; that one county will have a greater political pull than another county &mdash; but we want to satisfy ourselves that the machinery will function in such a manner as will ensure that we tackle the right areas first, and tackling the right areas first, in my opinion, does not always mean tackling first the areas that have the biggest water problems.  It may happen that we can increase the national income in this country by tackling certain areas that will help to bring into production land that at the moment is in very low production, and I feel that that is the type of scheme that ought to be tackled first.</P>
    <P>Another thing that the Parliamentary Secretary might tell us is how exactly the money is to be provided. Does it mean that when the scheme is prepared and approved of by the Minister, the estimate for that particular work will be presented to this House, or does it mean that this House will vote a bulk sum for drainage yearly without being given any details as to how the money is to be expended?  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to clear up those points before we come to the consideration of the Bill itself.</P>

      <P>I did not anticipate that some of the points mentioned by Deputy Hughes would have been raised at this stage, but in reply to the first point he made I would remind him that we are here discussing, or are about to discuss, amendments put forward by members of the House to the proposals which were brought in here with a view to making the drainage of land possible&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and it seems to me that if it were not for the fact that these lands have been and are subjected to excessive flooding we would not be considering these proposals at all.  It seems to me, further, that if we have land in this country that is, and has been, subjected to considerable flooding, the preparation and designing of a drainage scheme or schemes for the purpose of relieving that land of this excess of water is surely a matter for the engineer.  Now, I must say that I think Deputy Hughes is asking a little too much if he thinks that we are going to get a dual-purpose engineer of the type to which he refers: that we are going to get an engineer who will also be an expert in the matter of soils, soil fertility, soil treatment, the effects of water saturation on land, and the effects of lowering the water table, as Deputy Hughes suggested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As I say, we are considering here these proposals because of the fact that it is recognised by members of all Parties, and by everybody who knows this problem, that we have in this country land &mdash; some of it good land &mdash; that for most of the year is inundated with water.  These proposals are brought in here by the Department with a view to relieving that land of whatever water is preventing the land from being properly worked by those who own the land.  When that job is completed, I think we can then <Col N="310" /> apply ourselves to the problem of how, from an agricultural point of view, that land is to be treated.</P>
      <P>As to the manner in which the moneys are to be provided, I can only say that it is the intention that the Vote for the Office of Public Works will each year contain a provision to meet the cost of whatever works are in progress or are in contemplation. The fact that the Vote will be introduced into the House each year will afford an ample opportunity to Deputies to discuss it and to make whatever accusations they feel justified in making as to the manner in which the drainage authority is discharging the responsibilities that this Bill will impose upon it when it becomes an Act. I do not anticipate that any of these questions will arise.  I believe that the selection of the catchment area, or areas, to be treated, also, is largely a matter to be determined as a result of technical advice.  I think that Deputy Hughes' fears will prove not to have been well founded.</P>

      <P>It will not be a bulk sum.  I ask the Deputy to take the example of the provision that is made each year for schools.  Last year, the Dáil voted £250,000, which is a large sum, for the erection and reconditioning of schools throughout the country. In the year previous we spent almost that amount.  So far as the erection and reconditioning of schools is concerned, we intend to continue that policy until a solution of that particular problem has been found.  If we can provide for that service in that way each year in out Estimate, why should we not provide in a similar fashion for drainage, and thereby enable members of the House to express their views on the progress made and on the programme which this office will have outlined for the future?</P>

      <P>For the reasons that I have given, I cannot see the necessity <Col N="311" /> of having an agricultural expert to tell the Board of Works or any other authority as to what use can be made of land or how it should be treated until the land has, in the first instance, been relieved of the flooding to which it has been exposed during all those years.  Deputy Hughes and members of his Party have put down amendments to the Bill which would seem to suggest that, in the past, they regarded arterial drainage as a failure inasmuch as that those who designed the schemes did not make the necessary provision to lower the water tables as much as they should have been lowered.</P>
      <P>In this matter, as in others, we cannot, I suggest, have it both ways.  Our case is that we cannot relieve the land entirely from flooding: that the best that engineers can do very often is to see to it that their schemes will be so designed as to relieve the land of excessive flooding.  If the Deputy accuses us of failure because, in the past, we have not succeeded in lowering the water tables sufficiently, then it is hardly fair to say now that we may do damage by lowering the water tables too much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is quite fair to say that the water tables have not been lowered sufficiently.  That is why the agricultural expert should be called in to express his view as to whether, in fact, the water table should be preserved.  It is not the function of the engineer to do that. You must have a combination of the two.</P>

      <P>The Deputy must admit that the agricultural expert must see the land.  The land must be in such a condition that he can see it before he can express any opinion as to how it should be treated.  We are now making provision for dealing with land which is covered with water.  The job of relieving that land of water is, in the first instance, an engineering job. When it has been done, you may then call in whatever agricultural experts you may think right and proper.</P>

      <P>I move amendment. No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of line 40, page 3, to insert the following words: &ldquo;No natural watercourse or drain shall be deemed to be part of an embankment.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I cannot for the life of me understand why it is necessary to give the new meaning to the word &ldquo;embankment&rdquo; which is set out in the definition section.  There the word &ldquo;embankment&rdquo; is said to mean &ldquo;an artificial watercourse, drain, or embankment, or other work constructed for the protection of land from flooding, and includes all sluices, sluice gates, pumps, weirs, watercourses, and other works forming part of or essential to the effective operation of any such embankment or work&rdquo;.  Why should a pump be called an embankment? That definition gives a very wide meaning indeed to the word &ldquo;embankment&rdquo;. I have been prompted to put down the amendment because of the power that is being taken in Section 35 in respect of trust funds, to apportion them between other works and the embankment in the event of the embankment being taken over.  If a trust fund has been built up for the maintenance of drains and embankments, it seems to me that the fund will not be apportioned at all because the drainage may be deemed to be part of the embankment, acording to the new meaning given to the word &ldquo;embankment&rdquo;.  I can understand that, where an artificial drain has been made to preserve an embankment, it might reasonably be deemed to be part of the embankment.  Where, however, there was a natural watercourse before the embankment was made, and where there was a trust fund provided for its maintenance, I think we ought to attempt to make a distinction between an artificial drain that is part of an embankment and the old water-course.</P>

      <P>I refer the Parliamentary Secretary to paragraph (c) of Section 35, which states that &ldquo;if such transfer order relates to the whole of such existing embankment and such trust fund relates to such existing embankments and also to other works the said judicial commissioner shall&rdquo; do so and so.  The Parliamentary Secretary is aware of what we are asked to agree to in Section 48, under which you can compel farmers to do certain works.  It is quite possible, in the case of a trust fund, that portion of it was for the purpose of maintaining the embankment and another portion to maintain a drain.  If that drain, which is a natural watercourse, was not constructed as part of the embankment, then, according to this new definition of the word &ldquo;embankment&rdquo; it is deemed to be part of the embankment. In a later section the Parliamentary Secretary may operate Section 48 against an individual occupier, and make him maintain that drain, whereas a trust fund was created for that purpose at the time that the estate was purchased by the Land Commission. It is for the purpose of protecting such an individual that I have put down this amendment.  It is really to try to narrow down, if that is possible, the definition of &ldquo;embankment&rdquo; that the House is asked to accept.  The House is asked to accept the definition that the word &ldquo;embankment&rdquo; means an artificial water-course, drain, embankment, or other work constructed for the protection of land from flooding, and includes all sluices, sluice-gates, pumps, weirs, watercourses and other works forming part of or essential to the effective operation of any such embankment or work.  Surely under that definition anything can be called an embankment and if there is a trust fund created or if a trust fund exists, which was provided years ago, to maintain an <Col N="314" /> embankment and to maintain other works, other drains, as well&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We would not interfere with the trust fund about which the Deputy is speaking unless we were including the stream, river, or embankment in a new scheme, and once we included it in a new scheme how then could the contention which the Deputy is advancing arise that we could compel the farmer through whose land it was passing, to maintain it, under Section 48?</P>

      <P>The embankment, obviously, would be on a main stream. Is not that so?  You might have a small stream running into a main stream which might not be part of the embankment or which would have nothing to do with the embankment, but under the definition of &ldquo;embankment&rdquo; in the Bill it might be possible to argue that that stream was part of the embankment works, and later on you might operate Section 48 against the individual and make him maintain a stream where a trust fund was provided originally for the maintenance of the stream.</P>

      <P>It is conceivable that a natural watercourse or drain could be so reconstructed as now to be regarded as an embankment and, having regard to the loose manner in which embankments have been referred to in the past by, say, the Land Commission, it is quite conceivable that that particular type of case could arise, but the fears which the Deputy has expressed <Col N="315" /> now that, in a case of this kind where trust funds were in existence, hardship could arise under Section 48 are unfounded.  That is a thing that is quite impossible.  If there is a trust fund in existence and if, when the Bill becomes an Act, we propose to include the rivers and streams for which that trust fund was created in a drainage scheme, then, of course, the trust fund will be confiscated by the Exchequer, but from that day forward the works will be reconstructed and the owners of the land through which the stream is passing could not under any stretch of the imagination be made responsible under Section 48 in the manner which Deputy Hughes has described.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that you can have a natural stream that may be so reconstructed as to be regarded as part of an embankment.  I agree that that is so.  The Parliamentary Secretary can appreciate that you may have an embankment on a main stream and you may have a minor stream flowing fairly close to the embankment.  It could be argued that that stream was part of the embankment.  I want an assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary that once the trust fund is appropriated, that stream henceforth will be deemed to be part of the embankment works for all time and that there will be no possibility of Section 48 being operated against an individual.  The Parliamentary Secretary can understand why I was trying to differentiate between an artificial drain that may be constructed as part of embankment works and a natural stream that was there all the time prior to the embankment being constructed.</P>

      <P>It is hardly possible, though, that a stream, flowing into one of those natural channels which as a result of reconstruction could now be regarded as an embankment, would not be included in the drainage district.

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>After line 14, page 4, to add the following words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The expression &lsquo;Arterial Drainage Works&rsquo; means any drainage works the benefits of which are enjoyed by two or more rated occupiers of lands.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 2 contains a number of definitions but I think it is a strange omission that there is no definition of &ldquo;arterial drainage&rdquo;.  In Section 4 it is stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whenever the Commissioners are of opinion that the execution of arterial drainage works is expedient in respect of any catchment area for the purpose of preventing or substantially reducing the periodical flooding of lands in that area or of improving by drainage lands in the said area, it shall be lawful for the Commissioners to prepare a scheme...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to define exactly what the expression &ldquo;arterial drainage&rdquo; means.  This amendment sets out to define arterial drainage works as meaning any drainage works the benefits of which are enjoyed by two or more rated occupiers of lands.  Naturally, it would not be the function of any public Department to deal with the drainage of lands occupied by one individual only.  Where you have a number of holdings affected by a particular waterworks, it does become the function of a public Department to enter into the work of construction thereon.  For that reason, I think, it is desirable that there should be a definition of &ldquo;arterial drainage&rdquo; because we might have the position in which a certain work might require to be done; the owners of the land might feel that the work required to be done; but the Minister or the Office of Public Works might hold that the work was of minor importance, that it was not arterial drainage work and that, therefore, it was not their function to initiate a scheme in regard to it.  That is why I have put down this amendment.</P>

      <P>I admit the difficulty of defining &ldquo;arterial drainage&rdquo;.  This amendment would exclude the possibility of draining a single holding.  A situation might arise where it would be essential to have power to drain one holding.  I do not see why such a holding should be excluded.  There might be a stream running for some miles and not passing through any holding except at the upper reaches of one farm.  If the amendment were agreed to that particular farm could not be drained.  As that would not be desirable I suggest that the Deputy might withdraw the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not accept the amendment for the reason that every effort has been made to define &ldquo;arterial drainage&rdquo;.  There is a passage in the report of the Drainage Commission dealing with the matter. As Deputy Cogan and other Deputies are aware there were on that commission engineers and people with a considerable knowledge of this question. Here is what they say:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We considered the advisability of defining a &lsquo;main drain&rsquo; which should be included in the arterial works.  A satisfactory definition is not easy to settle and we have come to the conclusion that on the whole it would be unwise to lay down a rigid formula.  Discretion will have to be left with the designers of schemes....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Anybody who has given thought to it will agree with the wisdom of that conclusion on the part of the Drainage Commission.  I understand Deputy Cogan's object in putting down the amendment.  All of us would be glad if the commission or any other authority was able to define what is an arterial drain.  Apparently their efforts have not been successful so far.  We are not likely to be successful here and, for that reason, the wisest course would be to leave the matter to the discretion of those who will be in charge of the designs of schemes.</P>

      <P>May I take it from the Parliamentary Secretary's statement that the extent of a scheme is not in <Col N="318" /> question?  While a scheme may be of minor importance, and may, as Deputy Hughes pointed out, affect one individual, that will not weigh with the Department when considering whether it is an arterial drain or not.  Am I to take it that any scheme whether large or small will not be excluded on the ground that it is not an arterial drain?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand what the Deputy is driving at.  I am sure he has read the report of the Drainage Commission, and knows the plan behind the proposals in the Bill, that drainage is to be undertaken on a catchment area basis.  That being so, every drain, every river and every stream of any importance would be considered and be examined in the course of the preparation of a scheme for the catchment area.  A good deal of dissatisfaction arose in the past because of the financial structure of the law under which technical people were operating.  Their style was more or less cramped by the fact that they had to have regard to considerations which will not operate under this Bill. I believe that under this Bill they will have greater freedom, and that the economics of every act, and every stream that they include, will not weigh so heavily for or against as in the past.  Deputies can feel assured that they will be safe in leaving decisions to technical people now that they will have freedom to proceed on a different basis from that contained in the 1925 Act.</P>

      <P>I do not think so.  There is a number of main catchment areas and inside any of these areas you have a large number of smaller catchments. As the Deputy rightly said every little river could be regarded in itself as a catchment for a certain area.  The word &ldquo;catchment&rdquo; has been used quite a lot in relation to drainage.  It was used largely by the Drainage Commission in their report, which recommended that work should in future be done on the basis of main catchments. I do not think it could possibly have any ill-effects.</P>

I want to find out whether such a situation would be covered by this. The original catchment area has already been drained into a lake, which is drained out to the sea by a stream or river.  That river would have the original catchment area, and I do not think the word &ldquo;catchment&rdquo; is necessary.</P>

      <P>The House will understand that, in this piece of legislation, we are doing away completely with the power of any individual, individuals or local authorities to initiate schemes.  We are handing over that power to initiate and provide arterial drainage schemes absolutely and completely to the Board of Works.

    </Speaker>
    <P>No machinery is provided for calling, by way of initiation or otherwise, the attention of the Board of Works or the responsible Minister to the desirability of carrying out a drainage scheme.  As the section stands, there is no duty or responsibility placed on the commissioners.  It merely says that the commisioners can do it if they like.  Whenever they feel like doing it, they can do it, and if they do not feel like doing it, they need not.  If we are to give this power to the commissioners, I want to make it their duty to carry out the work and not merely leave it permissive.  I think that is absolutely essential, because this is the <Col N="322" /> enabling section of the Bill, and I think the House should agree that it is not merely desirable but essential to place full responsibility on the commissioners to carry out drainage.  The words &ldquo;lawful for&rdquo; appear to me to be insufficient in the circumstances. The commissioners may or may not carry out the work.

      <P>If we were to agree to his amendment, we would have a situation in which it would be the duty of the drainage authority to dash around the country preparing schemes for every district, and surely there would be no discretion left with them. The Deputy has complained of the possibility of county influence intervening as a result of the passage of this measure, but if his amendment were accepted, we would have the position that it would be the duty of the commissioners immediately to proceed to prepare a drainage scheme for the whole country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that would be feasible.  I do not think it would be at all possible and it certainly would not be wise to make the attempt.  The Deputy has complained, too, that we are handing over to this authority the power to initiate at will, to do nothing if it likes and to do something if it is in the humour to do it.  We have had experience of the powers which the Deputy apparently would like to retain here.  Under the 1925 Act, it was the responsibility of a number of occupiers of land to petition the local authority, and it was then the responsibility of the local authority to send these petitions to the Board of Works. That procedure was not satisfactory, and it is because it was found unsatisfactory that this provision is included in this Bill.  I think it is a very useful and a very wise provision as it stands, <Col N="323" /> and I should not be prepared to accept any amendment along the lines suggested.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is looking at it purely from the Departmental point of view.  He is, if I may say so with respect, taking the Civil Service view of it.  I want him to look at it from the people's point of view.  We are here providing a national scheme of drainage and we are dealing with the operative section. It is merely a permissive section, permitting the Board of Works to do certain works which, from the people's point of view, may mean that they will be carried out next year or in ten or 20 years' time.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no guarantee that they will be done at all.  Side by side with that, we are taking away the power which existed in the old Acts of the initiation of schemes by local authorities and of drawing the attention of the drainage authority to the desirability and necessity of carrying out certain works.  That is all done away with, and surely when all power to carry out arterial drainage is handed over to a central authority like the commissioners, a permissive section is scarcely enough.  We want to fix greater responsibility.  I admit that my amendment possibly goes a little too far and that it might lead to a position in which individuals could sue the Board of Works for failure to carry out their duty.  I can see the force of that, but if I have erred on one side in being rather too extreme, I think the Bill errs in the other way in being far too mild about it.  Once you hand over to a bureaucratic institution the power that we are asked to hand over in this Bill, I submit that we should put greater responsibility on the Board of Works to do their job&mdash; that the words used are too mild in the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy says is largely correct.  But everything depends on the sort of public opinion <Col N="324" /> you have behind this whole matter of drainage.  The position now, of course, is that, no matter what sort of public opinion you have, we could not implement in the way in which we would like the proposals that are contained here.  I would not like to be the Parliamentary Secretary responsible for the Board of Works, coming in here year after year in normal times and not having included in my Estimate reasonable provision to give effect to these proposals which we are now discussing. I feel that in a matter of this kind, where we clear the ground so as to enable some authority to tackle this problem, it will then largely depend on the sort of public opinion you will get behind this whole matter.  If there is, as I am sure there will be, sufficient agitation both inside and outside this House, I have no doubt that, whether or not the commissioners or the drainage authority wish to, they will be driven by that public opinion &mdash; I hope they will be driven if driving is necessary &mdash; to tackle this problem energetically. I do not think there is any half-way house as between the words here and the substitute words recommended to us by Deputy Hughes.  I think we will have to leave it in the position that we are setting up an authority to carry out certain work. There is a great urge for it in the country.  That urge, in my opinion, will grow and, as long as that urge is there, the authority will not be able to resist the demands which will be advanced.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister is treading on rather dangerous ground when he suggests that the Commissioners of Public Works would be influenced by public opinion.  It could happen that public opinion would be much more vocal in one part of the country than in another and that, in the particular county or counties where public opinion was very vocal, the need for drainage was not as great as in some other district where the people were more patient and meek and inclined to lie down under the difficulties. I think the Commissioners of Public Works, instead of being influenced by public opinion, should be influenced by the case made for each district.  I <Col N="325" /> think that should be the deciding factor.</P>

      <P>That is not the point. I will make the point clear.  Deputy Hughes wants to give the people back their democratic control under Section 4 of this Bill.  We want to give the people back the full democratic control taken away from them by the County Management Act. Deputy Hughes in Carlow and Kildare denounces that Act, but when he gets an opportunity to vote against it here, he will not vote against it to give them back that democratic control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>My contention is that the Deputy would not vote then.  He wants to vote now.  He says he wants to give the local authorities back their democratic rights under Section 4.  I think we have to look at the Bill as a national drainage Bill.  In this Bill there is a proposal to set up a national drainage authority.  If you have a national drainage authority, you must give that authority power to survey the country, to ascertain what areas require to be drained, and give that authority full power, as, for instance, we give the Electricity Supply Board or other national undertakings, to carry out in a comprehensive way the various tasks assigned to them.  The big defect in all previous drainage schemes was that they operated locally; that they depended on the <Col N="326" /> amount of local incentive necessary to implement them.  Very frequently, as anybody with any association with local authorities knows, complaints were made that drainage schemes were too costly.  In one county you might have a progressive county council saying: &ldquo;No matter what the cost is, we must go ahead with the drainage.&rdquo;  In another area you might have a wail over the amount to be put on the rates if the land were drained.  This Bill is designed to deal with the matter comprehensively, to charge the commissioners with the responsibility for draining the land of the country that requires drainage.</P>
      <P>I think that giving the commissioners that type of power to get the job done is the most efficient way of dealing with the matter.  You will still have all the Parliamentary control that is necessary when you have a Minister in charge of the commissioners. At any time, by means of a motion here or on the annual debate on the Estimate for the Department, one can get an opportunity of putting the point of view of the citizens who desire the activities of the commissioners to be accelerated in any particular way.  To suggest giving power back to the local authorities to look at drainage in a local way is, I think, the surest way of creating impediments to an accelerated plan of drainage.  It is better to arm the Drainage Commissioners with this power and tell them that we expect them to do the job and, as the Parliamentary Secretary said, bring all the pressure possible on the commissioners, through agitation inside and outside this House, to get the drainage of undrained lands put under way in the most expeditious manner possible.  As I said, to revert to the preparation and initiation of local schemes would be a fatal flaw and would give us the same unsatisfactory results as we have had up to the present by reliance on purely local schemes initiated by local authorities in a piecemeal way and not as part of any co-ordinated national plan.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton has twitted me about my failure to vote with him on a certain motion that was <Col N="327" /> put down here with reference to the County Management Act.  I should like to remind Deputy Norton that I voted consistently against that measure when it was passing through the House.  I hope I am at least sufficiently democratic to accept a decision of the House and, once the County Management Act was passed, I think it should get a fair time for trial.  That is my attitude to it.  Let us see what the defects are and, if it is necessary to amend it, let it be amended.  There is no use in passing legislation and, a year or so afterwards, trying to patch it up.  Let us try out the working of the measure over a period and see what defects are in it.  That is my answer to Deputy Norton.  Having said that, Deputy Norton is now prepared to swallow wholly and completely this measure by which the power and authority of the people are filched from them and handed over to a bureaucratic institution like the Board of Works.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>We voted for the Second Reading on certain conditions. Possibly we want national drainage more than Deputy Norton because we are more concerned with the people who are suffering from inundation than Deputy Norton is.  I suppose Deputy Norton is not worrying about the people who would put their names to any scheme where provision is made for the initiation of a scheme of arterial drainage, and he is not worried in this case about taking the power from the people.  But he is worried possibly because he thinks he might get votes from some of the people concerned with the operation of the Managerial Act.  Fundamentally it is all the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we are handing over to a bureaucratic institution absolute power and control of national drainage and we are taking from the people themselves any control or authority in the matter or any power to initiate schemes.  That is the objection I have to this particular section.  I think it is undesirable to create that bureaucratic <Col N="328" /> control.  Unfortunately, the whole trend in recent legislation is in that direction.  That trend has been pointed out by the Vocational Organisation Commission and very severely criticised. Here it is cropping up again. Are we to take cognisance of what has been severely commented upon by a very competent commission, set up to examine into fundamental matters in relation to our organisation of government?  I think it is unwise to have this form of control &mdash; handing over power completely to a bureaucratic body.  The Parliamentary Secretary has admitted that that is quite right &mdash; that we are handing over absolute control and taking the authority that rightly rests in the people from the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what people Deputy Hughes has in mind.  I do not know what he means when he talks about this democratic control. Surely he is conscious of the fact that the procedure that was previously followed has been departed from because it was found unsatisfactory. Under the 1925 Act the power to initiate rested with the people concerned and it was mainly because, in the opinion of the Drainage Commission, this power rested with the people concerned that we had this piecemeal, scrappy approach to what is a big problem.  I should like to know from Deputy Hughes, if we were to restore this procedure, who would be the local people to make an approach to the drainage authority, whether through the county council or any other local authority?  Who would be the local people who would petition for the execution of the outfall works, works that would be very expensive, <Col N="329" /> but neverthless very essential?  Those outfall works might not immediately affect any landowner.</P>
      <P>I think, if Deputy Hughes will apply his mind to this matter, he will see immediately that I am quite justified in saying that I do not understand his reference to bureaucratic control.  He invites me not to look at this matter from the point of view of the civil servant.  I am looking, and have been looking at it from a commonsense point of view and am having regard to the practice originally followed and the failure that resulted from following such a practice.  I am looking at it, not as a civil servant, but as a commonsense person who knows something about this matter.  I say that what is proposed here is absolutely indefensible and we could not hope to make any real progress with the drainage problem unless we gave to the authority in question the powers conferred upon it here.</P>

      <P>I do not want to suggest that we should preserve the old type of machinery.  I am not defending that old type of machinery.  But once we get away from the position where the people had the power of initiating schemes we are, I suggest, on dangerous ground.  We ought not to hand power over to a bureaucratic body; we ought to have the authority of the people preserved.  By all means have a central body controlling national drainage, but why should it not be controlled by the people themselves and let that body be serviced by experts and engineers?  Why is it considered necessary to hand over to a Civil Service Department the control in this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why have we not a representative body, taken from the people themselves, exercising control?  If we had, it would be more democratic.  Why have we not attempted to establish a body taken from the people who are interested in national drainage, and why have we not provided them with the power that is set out in this measure?  As I pointed out to the Parliamentary Secretary, the report of the Vocational Organisation Commission, recently published, has vigorously <Col N="330" /> condemned this trend in our legislation &mdash;handing over unlimited control to the Civil Service.  I have no objection to the machinery set up here, beyond that provision relating to the establishment of bureaucratic control.  I think we should provide machinery that will preserve the authority of the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at a loss to know what the Deputy means by the phrase &ldquo;have a body drawn from the people.&rdquo; I resent the suggestion that we are handing over control to this drainage authority.  If I am the Parliamentary Secretary responsible for the Board of Works, I will be answerable to this House.  Whoever is in this office will be answerable to the House for the activities of this body.  What could be more democratic than that?  What sort of control would you have unless control along those lines?  I would be inclined to be sympathetic if I thought there was anything in the Deputy's statement, but I honestly cannot see what other type of organisation you could provide beyond what is provided here, or that would give the freedom that is here.</P>
      <P>It is not correct to say that we are handing over control to that body.  We are handing control over to that body, subject to the authority of this House. My contention is that any individual charged with the responsibility of coming here and, in normal times, defending the activities of that body, will not like to come and will not be anxious to come and have all kinds of charges hurled against the drainage authority, against his own Department and against the Government. Naturally, he will try to get that authority moving as quickly as possible and he will be anxious that the most substantial provision will be made in order to enable that authority to continue.  I think that is the essence of democratic control and it does not merit the description given it by Deputy Hughes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not that constitute the clearest possible evidence that if you leave the initiation of local schemes to the county councils you will get no schemes?  The big difficulty about the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, was that schemes required local initiation and agreement, and because you tried to get local initiation and agreement you got no schemes.  Instead, a situation was created in which the drainage problem was intensified instead of remedied.  This Bill proposes to look on drainage as a national question, to set up a national board and give them the job of getting on with the drainage of the country, and charges the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary with responsibility for the activities of that body.  That seems to me a sensible method, but to goback to the machinery of the 1925 Arterial Drainage Act is simply to fool oneself into the belief that we are going to get an effective scheme of drainage carried out in this country.  You have to get a national body, give them wide powers and tell them to go on with the job of drainage, and you have to be prepared even for their making mistakes, but at all events you will get the drainage done that way.</P>
      <P>If you are to rely on schemes initiated by local authorities, you will get the same befuddled mentality as you got under the 1925 Act, which was the biggest fraud passed through this House.</P>

      <P>Let us discuss it in an abstract way.  Some individual from this House will be in charge of the Office of Public Works and responsible to this Parliament, but in my opinion that does not leave the people <Col N="333" /> with sufficient authority.  Quite a lot of matters may arise down the country, possibly technical matters, matters of detail, with which the Parliamentary Secretary in the future may not be conversant.  For that reason, I feel that a democratic body drawn from the people who are interested in drainage in this country ought to control national drainage, and not a body of civil servants.  That is the point I make, and that is the one big exception I am taking to the sort of machinery which we are providing in this Bill.</P>
      <P>I want to mention a minor detail. Under sub-section (2) of the section,</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 5 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Whenever a county council is of opinion that the execution of arterial drainage works is expedient in respect of any area within the county it shall be the duty of the said county council to request the commissioners to prepare a scheme for the execution of the said works.</P>
      <P>(2)  The commissioners shall examine the proposals contained in such request and if they think proper prepare a scheme in accordance with Section 4 of this Act or reject the proposals and inform the county council of their reasons for such rejection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  An appeal shall lie by any council subject to the provisions of <Col N="334" /> this section from the decision of the commissioners to the appeal board provided for in Section 19 of this Act.</P>
    <P>I am not so sure as to whether the wording of this amendment is correct. The purpose of the last clause is to ensure that an appeal shall lie to an appeal board, but the purpose of the amendment as a whole is to secure that there shall be some power of initiation with the county councils.  We have just been discussing the question of the power of initiation of works being taken completely from the local authorities or from the people directly concerned.  It was suggested that although the power of initiation of works belonged to the people directly concerned in the past under the 1925 Act, and belonged to the county councils also, very little use was made of that power, but I think that was not due to any laxity on the part of the people who wanted their land drained or on the part of the county councils. It was due to the burdensome method of financing the schemes under that particular Act &mdash; the burdens placed upon the people who would be initiating the work.  While not interfering with the discretion of the commissioners to initiate any work which they may think fit, it is sought here that, in addition to anything which the commissioners themselves may undertake, the county councils should also initiate work by submitting a scheme to the commissioners and having it considered. If the commissioners turn it down, there will be an appeal provided for under the section which it is proposed to include in the Bill later.  The whole question which arises in regard to the operation of this Bill is the question of priority, the question of whether the drainage of one particular area might be left in abeyance while another area was being favoured.  The county council under this section which we propose to insert here would have power to draw attention to their particular area, and to have the question considered by an impartial appeal board if necessary.  I move to report progress.</P>

If the results show that at least two-thirds of the students are capable of assimilating instruction through Irish, the instruction should be mainly through that medium.  The remaining students, if any, can be dealt with in the same manner as backward students are dealt with in all classes.  The results of the test examination should be attached to the Attendance Register, in order to enable the chief executive officer or the Department's inspector to check or supplement by direct inquiry the information furnished by the results.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was issued in June last and it was imperative to raise certain questions with regard to it, because of difficulties that have arisen in understanding the circular and in seeing its tendency. I raise this question to-night in order to get certain information and would like to say why I want that information.  I speak as one who is very interested in instruction through the medium of Irish.  In regard to the main primary schools in the city which give education through the medium of Irish, as the Chairman of the Parents' Committee which got this set up, I want educational facilities for giving primary education through the medium of Irish.  In the case of the most outstanding secondary school giving its education through the medium of Irish, <Col N="336" /> I had a big part in seeing that school established.  In many other ways, I think I have given the Minister and the House evidence that I believe the Irish language to be a perfect instrument for the giving of education, in suitable circumstances, and that I have endeavoured to help it in every possible way.</P>
    <P>Those who are interested in the use of Irish as an educational medium and in its general spread are disturbed by certain things.  One of these is the weaknesses shown, even in the reports of the Department of Education, in certain aspects of that work.  The second is the criticism of the work made by those who are the technical experts in the giving of education, either through English or through Irish.  The third difficulty is the rather unhelpful way in which the Minister treats questions that arise by way of criticism.  The fourth &mdash; and it is the important aspect of the question that I wish to deal with to-night &mdash; is a certain growing lack of confidence in the public in the work that is being done for Irish in the schools and, particularly, in the work that is being done when the Irish language is being used as a medium for instruction.</P>
    <P>Some things happen from time to time that suggest that the work of the Department of Education in this matter is somewhat like the work that goes on when a young fellow who is not very careful and, perhaps, not very humane is driving a donkey, jerking him now, beating him again, and twisting him in various ways.  The work seems to be spasmodic, and the spasmodic nature of the work, particularly where there are obvious difficulties which are not remedied, is increasing the public lack of confidence in the matter.</P>
    <P>Here we are dealing with technical school students &mdash; and if there is any body of students in the country which can be regarded as willing, interested and earnest, it is students who attend technical schools, and particularly those who attend at night.  As far as the City of Dublin is concerned, at any rate, those students are faced with certain results, arising out of this circular. In seeing what those results <Col N="337" /> are, in respect of the teachers who are to be regarded as adequately efficient to teach their technical subjects through the medium of Irish, I want to ask the Minister in what way that proficiency is established.</P>
    <P>Are the teachers who are on the staff of the technical schools of the City of Dublin to-day, each marked individually as to whether they are proficient to teach their subjects through the medium of Irish or not, and in what way is that proficiency determined? Secondly, when it is stated that, at the beginning of each session, a written and oral test in Irish should be carried out on the prospective students, to see whether they have such a knowledge of Irish as will enable them to receive their instruction through the medium of Irish, I want to know how that examination is going to be carried out and at what point.  Students come to the technical schools at the opening of the session, to attend for the winter. At what particular point are they asked to undergo an examination and by whom, and by what method is that examination carried out?  Then, having examined a certain number of students applying for instruction in some subject, when it is decided that 60 per cent. are capable of taking their instruction through the medium of Irish, and that the teacher is capable of doing that, what exactly is to happen those students who are signing on at the technical schools for that subject?  The circular says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The remaining students, if any, can be dealt with in the same manner as backward students are dealt with in all classes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know that the technical schools have to complain in any way of backward students.  As I have said, the students who attend the technical schools here are eager, anxious and hardworking, and these things eliminate any danger that the children attending the technical schools are backward.  It would seem to me that the circular implies that, according as the secondary schools &mdash; or the primary schools, particularly &mdash; do their work well in Irish, the danger is being created that children who leave the <Col N="338" /> primary schools without a very satisfactory knowledge of Irish will be denied technical education in the schools here.  The circular goes on to say that the results of the examinations will be kept, so that the chief executive officer or the Department's inspector may check, or supplement by direct inquiry, the information furnished by the results.</P>
    <P>Where examination has decided, say, that only 40 per cent. of the children are capable of following instruction through Irish, is it the intention that a kind of inquisition would be carried out from time to time during the year by the chief executive officer or by the Department's inspector, to press the situation and to try and suggest that classes that have been conducted through English should in future be conducted through Irish?</P>
    <P>The same circular deals with additional facilities or additional inducements to carry on what have been described as Gaelic activities.  So far as the technical schools are concerned, I would like to ask the Minister whether it would not be advisable to see how far the work that is being carried on as Gaelic activities increases the enthusiasm of the students in the technical schools to use Irish and increases their ability to do so.  I should also like to know whether it would not be far more advisable, particularly in the City of Dublin where there are large classes, to see that separate classes, even if they were small, would be established, to give instruction through the medium of Irish in certain technical subjects where there are a sufficient number of pupils available.  Anybody who has experience of technical schools, particularly of night classes, knows that the best and most promising pupils come along in the autumn and attend fairly regularly up to Christmas.  Then the fact that man was not made for night study begins to show itself and after Christmas the classes begin to dwindle.  By Easter the teacher is lucky if he has 8 or 10 per cent. of the original number of students attending the classes.</P>
    <P>If on entering into technical schools students are going to be confronted <Col N="339" /> with the difficulty that they may have to accept instruction through the medium of Irish when they feel that they are not qualified to absorb it, it will have a very serious effect.  The work in night classes is already sufficiently tedious and tiring and if it is going to be made more difficult by instruction through the medium of Irish, when the classes are not really capable of taking it, then not only will damage be done to technical education but the Irish language itself will suffer.  I suggest to the Minister that the result may be to discourage even students who know Irish and to penalise those who do not.  I think that this is very far from being a movement to promote the Irish language.  In fact there is a tendency to retrogression because there is the additional factor that public confidence is being disturbed by what is being attempted in these schools.  There is also, it is suggested, a fear arising out of the circular that teachers teaching in technical schools are going to be subjected to a kind of persecution or inquisition to compel them to undertake the teaching of their subjects through Irish when they are not able to do it.</P>
    <P>I think that there are sufficient points in the matters I have put before the Minister to make it rather urgent that the Minister should clear the atmosphere.  Again I say we must see that every possible suitable use is made of Irish as a language of instruction but, in order to do that, we must not have the revival of the language prejudiced by asking that the language should be used in circumstances that cannot produce good work.  We must not have public confidence in this matter disturbed and I say that public confidence is disturbed, even if it were only by the suggestion contained in this circular that students in Dublin and elsewhere are to be denied technical education through the medium of English, as that is the only way in which many of them will have the time and capacity to seek technical education.  This is a very important question from many aspects and I am raising the matter in order to <Col N="340" /> give the Minister an opportunity of explaining some of the points that arise from this circular.</P>

      <P>This afternoon when I learned that Deputy Mulcahy intended to raise this question I understood that he would probably refer to the position as it affected the country as a whole.

      <P>The position as far as Dublin is concerned is that the vocational education authorities have received this circular.  I do not know whether it is a circular of a general character and whether committees throughout the country also have received it.  Presumably they have, but in the case of Dublin the circular is to be the subject of discussion at a meeting of the City of Dublin Vocational Committee to-morrow night.  I would have thought that a discussion of this kind here would come much better, subsequent to an examination of the position by that particular committee. I do say that important issues are raised in the matters put forward by Deputy Mulcahy.  I am speaking more or less in a personal capacity since, in the first place, I happen to be chairman of the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee.  As I have indicated, the matter is still <i>sub judice</i> as far as that committee is concerned, but since the matter has been raised here to-night, I want to say that the paragraph to which Deputy Mulcahy referred, under which it is proposed that one-third of the pupils in certain circumstances would be treated as backward students, requires an explanation so far as the Minister and his officers are concerned.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I wonder would it be asking too much to invite the <Col N="341" /> Lord Mayor to read out of the circular what he has just said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; it is paragraph 4 of the circular from the Department of Education, Technical Instruction Branch.  The paragraph states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If the results show that at least two-thirds of the students are capable of assimilating instruction through Irish, the instruction should be mainly through that medium. The remaining students, if any, can be dealt with in the same manner as backward students are dealt with in all classes.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I want to put it to the Minister and to the House that, so far as schools conducted by vocational committees are concerned, they are rate-aided institutions in respect of approximately 50 per cent. of their expenditure, and if the children of any ratepayer attend a technical school, they are entitled to equal rights with all other children attending there.</P>
      <P>I protest against and object to any attempt being made to relegate one-third of the students attending technical classes in Dublin to a category known as backward students without any indication as to what is to become of the rights of parents.  As far as backward students in the city are concerned, I can see only one solution for this problem if this scheme is proceeded with, and that is that alternative buildings will have to be provided to give the instruction needed to one-third of the students of the city.  That is an utter impossibility in present conditions and, therefore, if this circular is to stand in its present form, a grave injustice will be inflicted upon one-third of the students attending the City of Dublin vocational classes.  I suggest that some further clarification of that paragraph is called for from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that the Lord Mayor has waxed so eloquently on an entirely hypothetical situation just as I am rather surprised that Deputy Mulcahy should see in this circular, which attempts to lay down certain general principles for the guidance of <Col N="342" /> committees, some scheme through which the Department contemplates a policy of persecution, inquisition of teachers and things of that kind.  As the Deputy himself I think will admit, experience has shown that, in regard to the furtherance of Irish in the schools, the best and most lasting results are obtained where Irish is not merely taught as a school subject but where it is also used as the medium of instruction in other subjects.  Teaching through Irish has made progress in recent years in our primary and secondary schools but the vocational schools were rather slow in coming into line.  The circular letter referred to by the Deputy, together with others which preceded it, purports to set forth the conditions under which teaching through Irish may be undertaken.</P>
      <P>As to the method of determining the proficiency of teachers to give instruction through Irish, all such teachers would have the ceárd-teastas and, from the beginning of this year, a test in capability to teach through Irish has been added to the oral section of the ceárd-teastas examination. For teachers who secured the ceárd-teastas before that test was added, the inspectors would be in a position to pronounce on their proficiency and the regulation in the circular letter prescribing prior notification gives them the opportunity so to pronounce. The students' knowledge of Irish is to be determined by an oral and written examination conducted at the beginning of the session by the teacher, who is to give the instruction through Irish.  The results of this examination are to be recorded so as to give the chief executive officer and the inspector an opportunity of scrutinising and checking them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Undoubtedly, this examination will reveal a weakness in Irish in some of the students and the teacher will, accordingly, be faced with a problem with which teachers have to cope every day, namely, a certain amount of unevenness in the standard reached by the pupils.  Each teacher must in the issue solve the difficulty to a considerable extent in his own way according to the particular circumstances, <Col N="343" /> but, in general, there would be no great objection to giving special help to those weak in Irish.  That is the meaning I take from the phrase &ldquo;the usual treatment which backward students receive.&rdquo;  We know that, when students are not as advanced in some particular subject as their fellow-students in a class, that is no reflection on their general ability.  They may not have received the necessary preparation before entering the class. They may not have had the opportunity to reach the same standard as the remainder of the class and, therefore, they receive special assistance from the teacher.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister tell us what &ldquo;special assistance&rdquo; or &ldquo;special help&rdquo; means?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Special help&rdquo; means that while a class, for example, is doing a particular piece of work, the teacher will endeavour to give personal attention to the individual or group whom he considers to be weak.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>In Irish.  In general, there would be no great objection, so far as I am concerned, to giving, in addition to special help to those requiring it, a five or ten minutes' revision of the lesson in English towards the close of a class period. The necessity for this would disappear in time.  The intention in checking the results of the test examination is to discourage attempts to teach through Irish where the students are not capable of assimilating the instruction and to encourage such teaching where they obviously are so capable.  The checking, as I have said, may be done by the chief executive officer or the inspector, or by both, and the intention is to have it done by direct inspection and examination of the students in the school.  So far as I know, this scheme has not yet been undertaken even in the City of Dublin and, should difficulties arise, they can be settled by means of consultation between the chief executive officer and his staff, on <Col N="344" /> the one hand, and the inspectors of my Department, on the other hand.  When the original circular of August, 1943, was issued it was emphasised in paragraph (2) that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In order that teaching through Irish may be successful the teacher should be capable of giving such instruction and the pupils should be capable of assimilating it.  The large number of teachers who have qualified for the ceárd-teastas Gaedhilge in recent years, and the knowledge of Irish acquired by pupils in the primary schools should by now make teaching through Irish in vocational schools not only possible but a normal feature of their work.  It is suggested, therefore, that some teaching through Irish should be undertaken in future by all teachers who possess the ceárd-teastas Gaedhilge. This could, as a beginning, take the form of a 10-15 minutes' revision in Irish at the end of each class lesson. As some teachers who already hold the ceárd-teastas Gaedhilge may have lost their fluency in Irish, the Department proposes to conduct refresher courses to enable such teachers and others to acquire the necessary terminology and practice in the language for the purpose of carrying out the Department's policy regarding teaching through Irish.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even in the case of the secondary and primary schools, where such admirable work is being done in teaching through Irish, it is well recognised that we are passing through a transitional stage and that it will take a considerable period before all the work in these and that it will take a considerable period before all the work in these schools can be done through Irish.  The position in the vocational schools is that we are only commencing, at this rather late hour of the day, to do what we have been doing in the other schools for 20 years or more and, while it is possible to place a gloss upon the statement in paragraph 4 regarding backward students, the fact that it is made clear that, unless two-thirds of the students are capable of assimilating instruction through Irish, it is not intended that instruction should be mainly through that medium, shows that there is no question of forcing the <Col N="345" /> teachers to do more than lies within their power to do.  As the extracts which I have read from the 1943 circular show, we appreciate just as keenly as those outside that we must proceed carefully in this matter and be quite sure, on the one hand, that our teachers are fully qualified and, on the other hand, that the pupils are able to benefit by instruction through Irish.</P>
    <P>As regards Deputy Mulcahy's point, there is no question of excluding pupils but, if it is clear that pupils cannot benefit by instruction through Irish, I presume they will not be asked to attend classes where such instruction is given.  May I remind the Deputy that we have now day courses in our vocational schools?  At these day courses, in addition to instruction in the ordinary practical subjects, such as carpentry and metalwork, for boys, and domestic economy for girls, we have instruction in the ordinary continuation <Col N="346" /> subjects.  Seeing that children, before they enter the vocational schools, for the day courses in particular, have to pass the primary school-leaving test, I think they ought to have no difficulty in following instruction, at any rate in the literary subjects, through Irish.  I realise that there are difficulties in giving instruction in Irish in technical subjects, particularly so far as students in night classes are concerned, and that is a matter which will have to be very carefully considered. In any event, in no class will instruction through Irish be sanctioned by my Department until the report provided for has been received and considered and until I am satisfied that it is possible and that it will be beneficial to give such instruction.</P>

    <P>In 1926-27 the amount collected was £281,460 of which £123,253 was in respect of loans made out of the Irish Land Purchase Fund and the balance in respect of loans made out of the <Col N="210" /> Local Loans Fund.  The former was paid to the British Government in full; as regards the balance, it is not possible to say what part of it was so paid since, beginning with 1926-27, payments to Britain on foot of loans issued out of the Local Loans Fund were made by means of the annuity of £600,000 under the Financial Agreement of 19th March, 1926.  (c) and (d) All liability in respect of these and other loans was discharged under the financial arrangements made with the British Government in 1938.</P>
