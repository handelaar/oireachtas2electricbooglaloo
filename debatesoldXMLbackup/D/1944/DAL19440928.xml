      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that very considerable areas in the Barrow districts were recently flooded to a very serious extent; and, if so, if he will ascertain whether maintenance work had been carried out in those districts.</P>

      <P>Whilst I have no information as regards recent flooding in the Barrow drainage districts, it is apparent from the readings of the river gauges that flooding in certain low-lying areas must have occurred for a period early in September following abnormal rainfall, which the channels were not designed to accommodate.</P>
      <P>The Barrow Drainage Board, appointed by the County Councils of Kildare, Laoighis and Offaly, is responsible for the maintenance of the Barrow drainage works.  The Commissioners of Public Works are satisfied, from the inspections made annually by them in pursuance of Section 19 of the Barrow Drainage Act, 1927, that the drainage works are well and efficiently maintained.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that over 90 per cent. of the turf cut this season in East and South-East Kerry by private producers is still unsold on account of poor transport facilities.  The provision for turf transport in the area is not as satisfactory as I would like, but all available transport is being utilised to the best general advantage and the matter is receiving constant attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that a fortnight's notice of withdrawal of labour has been served on the shipping companies by the several trade unions on behalf of their members employed by such companies as dockers in the Port of Dublin with the object of securing for their members the benefits of the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1939, to which they hold they are entitled but which have been denied them due to certain administrative difficulties; whether proposals have been submitted to him on behalf of the dockers indicating methods whereby the benefits of the Act might be secured by such workers, subject to the qualifying provisions in the Act; if so, whether consideration has been given to such proposals; if not, if he will have immediate attention given to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that a fortnight's notice of withdrawal of labour has been served on the shipping companies by the several trade unions concerned on behalf of their members employed as dockers in the Port of Dublin by these companies, with the object of securing for their members the holiday rights to which other workers are entitled under the provisions of the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1939.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must point out, however, that the position of these workers in relation to the Act is not due to administrative difficulties as stated in the question. <Col N="2214" /> A court of law has decided, on a test case brought in agreement with the parties, that these dockers because of the conditions of their employment are not covered by the provisions of the Act.</P>
    <P>Proposals have been submitted to me on behalf of these dockers indicating methods whereby the Act might be amended so as to secure similar benefits for dockers and these proposals have since been under examination.  As, however, the trade unions concerned have elected to endeavour to secure an adjustment of the position by industrial action, I cannot make any statement as to the possibility of the Government being willing to consider suggested amendments of the Act and in view of the possibility that the services of my Department may, at some stage, be required for the purpose of mediation in the dispute, I consider that it would be undesirable for me to express, at the moment, any views on the issues involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that the scale of prices fixed by the British Ministry of Food for best quality dressed beef and lamb exported from Eire is inadequate to permit firms engaged in this trade to compete with current prices ruling in fairs and markets; that this has resulted in a substantial decline in the export trade of dressed meat; and if he will state whether it is the present policy of his Department to encourage the dressed meat trade, and, if so, what efforts have been made to secure a more favourable scale of prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the prices fixed by the British Ministry of Food for dressed beef and lamb exported from this country do not offer a sufficient inducement to firms engaged in the trade and that this position has resulted in a substantial decline in dressed meat exports.  It is the policy of my Department to encourage the dressed meat trade, but I consider that, in view of the British Ministry's attitude in regard to fat stock prices, no useful purpose would be served by approaching them for an increase in prices for our dressed meat exports, which are related to the prices fixed for our fat stock.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an impression among people engaged in the export trade that the policy of the Government <Col N="2217" /> with regard to securing a favourable export price is influenced by the cost of living at home.  Will the Minister categorically deny-that?</P>

As regards (d), (e) and (f), details of its finances for the year ended 31st December, 1943, will be found in the commission's annual statement of accounts for that year, which was presented some time ago to both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The commission's sources of revenue and the purposes to which such moneys may be devoted are set out in Part IV of the Pigs and Bacon (Amendment) Act, 1939.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Halliden</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that there is a serious shortage in many counties of good grazing land for dairy cattle, as well as for the surplus &ldquo;stores&rdquo; at present in the country, and if he will, in consequence, consider the desirability of (1) revising the compulsory tillage quota for wheat in the <Col N="2219" /> different areas, and (2) classifying second year's meadowing as a tillage crop for the purposes of the compulsory tillage regulations.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position to state whether the area of grazing lands in different districts of this country is adequate for the number of cattle kept.

    <Speaker pid="WilliamFrancisODonne" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that several merchants who purchased large quantities of oats in former years have refused to buy any of this year's crop; and whether, in view of the inadequate storage facilities on most farms as well as the necessity for certain farmers to dispose of this &ldquo;cash&rdquo; crop to meet urgent demands on them, he will adopt suitable measures to prevent the wastage and loss which are inevitable if the oat crop remains on the farmers' hands for the winter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that in certain areas the demand for oats is slow at present, but it is premature to form an opinion on the matter. Having regard to our total requirements in respect of feeding stuffs for live stock, it is unlikely that there will be any unwanted surplus of oats. As a market is not guaranteed for <Col N="2220" /> oats such as applies in the case of wheat, it is not proposed to take action as suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the fact that farmers have been compelled to till a certain quota of their land, and that the Government, therefore, has imposed an obligation on the farmers, is there not an obligation imposed on the Government to ensure that the tillage produce can be marketed? Is the Minister aware that a number of farmers, in a public-spirited manner, have taken land extensively by conacre and sown oats, but now they cannot find a market for their produce or secure an adequate price? Would he be prepared to consider some scheme by which the glut of oats could be disposed of?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise that it is in fact a very acute problem at the moment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if anybody can suggest an effective scheme. As every Deputy knows, oats is used to the extent of about 90 per cent. for animal feeding.  In fact I should say that the figure is more than 90 per cent. on the present acreage.  It is all right in the case of wheat, which can be used for human food; the same applies to some extent to barley.  But, in the case of oats, where eventually the market is the farmer himself&mdash;the crop is utilised for animal feeding&mdash;I think the matter must be allowed to adjust itself between one farmer and another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamFrancisODonne" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a question of storage as much as anything else.  The farmers have no proper means of storing the crop, and for that reason it is deteriorating.  It is lying in the haggards; they have no proper storage for it.  The Government adopted a kind of housing scheme in regard to wheat, and I think something on those lines would help the farmer out of the present difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter may adjust itself, as the Minister has said, but the difficulty is that there was a surplus carried over from last year.  The <Col N="2221" /> Minister appreciates that.  The farmers are anxious to cash in on their oats at the present time, but it is left on their hands because the merchants are also slow to buy.  It might help matters if the Minister could give an assurance, so far as the merchants are concerned, that eventually they will be able realise on whatever prices are paid now.  The Minister will appreciate that it is necessary to stimulate the purchase of oats.  It is very undesirable, and very severe on the people, particularly on the small farmers who want to cash in on their oats in order to meet their debts, to have large quantities of the crop left on their hands.</P>

      <P>A question has been raised about the refusal of the merchants to buy.  I understand it is rather a question of the refusal of the farmers to sell.  I understand that the merchants are prepared to buy, but that the farmers are not prepared to sell at the price.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a fact, because in parts of the country at the moment oats is bought at as low a price as 1/3 or 1/4 a stone.  The difficulty is that the merchants refuse to take it. I am afraid this matter will not adjust itself at all, because in parts of the country such as Galway what will really happen is that there will be an extra surplus next year.  It is an oats county and, under the tillage Order, it is oats the people will sow.  Unless we can find some scheme for the substitution of another crop, I am afraid there will be a bigger surplus of oats next year.  The Minister ought to consider some scheme whereby potatoes or some other crop would be grown, in order to reduce the surplus of oats.</P>

      <P>I am afraid those supplementaries have covered a very wide range.  I have no doubt that eventually this matter will adjust itself, because there are definite indications, from figures, that the number of pigs in the country is increasing, in spite of the Pigs and Bacon Commission, and also that egg production is increasing.  Of course, anybody could see that that would occur when the feeding was <Col N="2222" /> there, because they disappeared when there was no feeding for them.  There is no doubt at all that the matter will adjust itself eventually.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures if, in view of the present friendly relations existing between this country and all other countries, and having regard to the danger to child life of the overground air-raid shelters in the city, he will take the necessary steps either to remove all such structures or to reduce very considerably their number.</P>

      <P>For some time past the Air-Raid Precautions Branch has been engaged in the preparation of post-war plans in connection with the various types of air-raid shelters.  The temporary street surface shelters will be removed the moment the Government is satisfied that conditions warrant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think there is sufficient likelihood of hostile bombing of this capital to justify maintaining all the overground air-raid shelters, in view of the danger of accidents to children who run out from behind those shelters?  Could he not consider reducing the number of shelters in certain streets where there are a great many children?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said in answer to the Deputy, the shelters <Col N="2223" /> will be maintained only until the moment when the Government is satisfied that they can be removed.  I am glad to say that the air-raid shelters have not been responsible for a very big percentage of the total fatal and serious accidents to children under 16. They have not proved such a grave source of danger as we feared.  Over these last three years about 5 per cent., I think, of the fatal accidents to children under 16 and about 6 per cent. of the serious accidents to children under 16 have been due to air-raid shelters.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he is aware that a private individual took advantage of the curtailment of Land Commission operations to purchase a number of large estates in the County of Leix, including Brockley Park, Stradbally, and to sub-divide and sell such estates at war prices, to the detriment of uneconomic holders and landless men; and if he will state what he proposes to do to deal with this departure from well-established national policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Moylan) Seán Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moylan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Land Commission have no power or intention to prevent private sales of land by the owners.  Such sales do not prevent the possible exercise in future of the powers of acquiring lands for division accorded to the Land Commission under the Land Acts.  At present, the exercise of these powers is necessarily limited by the existing emergency conditions.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the agreed national policy of this country with regard to land division has been violated, through individuals taking advantage of the Emergency Order immobilising the Land Commission? He is asked if he proposes to take any steps in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was not asked that the Land Commission should interfere with sales.  The Land Commission had powers to acquire land for sub-division.  An Emergency Order suspended the acquisition, and immensely wealthy individuals have taken advantage of that Emergency Order to buy up all the large estates in one county, to sub-divide them and sell them at war prices for profit, so that there will be no land left for sub-division. Does the Minister propose to lean back and allow that situation to exist?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputies should be quite sure, when dealing with this particular case, as it has been dealt with before, that they stand on one particular foot and not try to shift from one to the other.  When Deputies drew my attention to this matter first, they were not concerned with the land, but with the preservation of the house for hospital purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is quite clear in regard to the deputation which he met, composed of Deputies Flanagan, Davin and O'Higgins.  They came to see me in regard to the buildings at Brockley Park, which they wished preserved for hospital purposes. I can only say that it would be gravely wrong for the Land Commission to interfer with the ordinary sale and exchange of land.  I am not convinced that there is such a tremendous amount of speculation in land, and I have no proof of it.  There have been certain cases where such speculation has gone on&mdash;perhaps in Offaly&mdash;but, generally, it is a disease that can be remedied only when the emergency situation has passed away and we can return to the ordinary work of the Land Commission.  Anything <Col N="2229" /> done now will not prevent the Land Commission afterwards from taking any action they wish in regard to the sale of land.</P>

      <P>I asked in this question if the Minister was aware that one individual had purchased five large estates in the comparatively small County of Laoighis.  I did not catch the Minister's reply to that.  I do not think he replied to it.  I want to call the Minister's attention to the fact that he was incorrect&mdash;he may have seen more than one Deputy&mdash;in stating that, with the deputation of which I was a member, the concern was the buildings and not the land. The concern was the division of land.</P>

The Minister agreed to give sympathetic consideration to that proposal.  We have not heard the results of the consideration yet.

With regard to the purpose of the deputation which saw me in regard to the matter, I have a letter from Deputy Flanagan, who arranged the deputation, which suggests definitely that they were not concerned with the land <Col N="2230" /> but with the buildings.  With regard to the question as to whether another Emergency Order should be made preventing the purchase and the resale of land, I think if such an Emergency Order were made, the Deputies who are now asking these questions would be asking further questions pointing out the enormity of such an Order.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 50</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking on the Second Reading of the Transport (No. 1) Bill, I think on the 1st May of this year, the Minister, I am glad to say, made it very clear to the House that he was not, at that time at any rate, definitely tied up with the kind of control that is provided for in this section of the Bill. If he looks at the Official Report, he will realise that he indicated his desire that suitable amendments might be drafted and that if such amendments were submitted they would be considered by him on their merits.  This small group gave consideration to that <Col N="2231" /> promise made by the Minister, in connection with this and other matters, and it is for that reason that this amendment is submitted for the consideration of the House.  This kind of control of a huge public undertaking with Government guarantees behind it is a novel one.  In my opinion it is a most undemocratic one and is a very risky experiment.  I am sure the Minister must realise that.  I wonder if Mr. Reynolds, the present chairman, with his experience of the operation of limited control of this kind, is himself satisfied with the experience which he has had since he was appointed or came into office in February, 1942, and if he is satisfied with the nature of the valuable assistance given to him in his difficult task by the four colleagues who were put there as stockholders' directors with the power of office boys?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suspect that Mr. Reynolds is not very satisfied and in fact I should like to know to what extent, if any, these stockholders' directors have been consulted by him on any matter of importance. In his evidence before the Judicial Tribunal he swore that he had not consulted his four colleagues prior to the meeting on the Thursday before this reorganisation scheme was published. Now the stockholders' directors are supposed to safeguard the financial interests of the existing stockholders and here we have the statement of the chairman on oath that he had not consulted them on the reorganisation proposals that are contained in this Bill. What other matter could he possibly have consulted them upon? If they are not worthy of consultation in a matter concerning the shareholders' interests, the interests they are supposed to represent, then I suggest that a considerable saving could be effected in this scheme when it comes into operation by wiping out these costly ornaments. The scheme in this Bill provides for the appointment of a chairman-dictator and, as far as I can gather, for the appointment of six stockholders' directors, these stockholder directors having as little power in future as they had up to the present time.  It is an extraordinary thing that the stockholders' directors under this reorganisation, <Col N="2232" /> who will represent only 20 per cent. of the capital value of the new company, will have 85 per cent. of the representation on the board, whereas the chairman, who represents the interest of the taxpayers to the extent of £16,000,000, will be one out of seven.  It is true, of course, that the chairman, under the powers conferred upon him in this section will be all-powerful.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is still standing for the scheme contained in this section of the Bill&mdash;I hope he is not&mdash;what is the, necessity for having six stockholders' directors out of a total of seven directors?  Apparently the chairman is very anxious to save money.  We had an indication to that effect yesterday evening when the Minister suggested that it was for the purpose of saving money that the information contained in the accounts of the company was cut down and that the accounts have been published for the last year or two in the abridged form in which they have been published.  If he wants to save money here is a clear case where he can do it.  If he still stands for the system of giving the stockholders' directors a majority on the board they can have a majority by having two instead of six, in which case they will be two to one as against six to one.  Prior to the appointment of Mr. Reynolds as chairman of this company, in February, 1942, as far as I can discover from the accounts published by the company, every director cost the shareholders of the company not less than £1,000 a year in fees and expenses and in some years they cost a good deal more than £1,000 a year. The chairman in office previous to the appointment of Mr. Reynolds certainly cost more than £1,000 a year, but the ordinary directors, in fees and expenses, cost at least £1,000 a year. If the Minister still stands for the scheme of control contained in this section of the Bill, he can save at least £4,000 per annum by reducing the number of stockholders' directors from six to two and there will still be a majority of two to one, representing stockholders' directors as against the chairman.</P>
    <P>I want to know from the Minister, <Col N="2233" /> quite candidly, whether any bargain has been made with the directors of the Great Southern Railways Company and the Dublin United Transport Company to put the existing directors into the new scheme and, by doing so, to incur expense which otherwise would not be necessary. They are costly ornaments.  They have the glorified title of directors with no more power than that of an office boy.</P>
    <P>I referred last night to the fact that the Minister, repeatedly in this House, has made the case that it is the existing directors of the Great Southern Railways Company who are mainly responsible for the mismanagement and bankruptcy of that concern and, automatically, for forcing the Government to take the action which they are taking through this measure.  I have listened on many occasions here to that kind of criticism of the old management and I am afraid that the working officials of the company are blamed, wrongly, by many people for whatever mismanagement there has been up to recent times.  The working officials of the Great Southern Railways Company, in the same way as the working officials of the Dublin United Transport Company or any other public carrying company of that kind, carry out the orders of their directors.  I know of cases where if certain suggestions that were made by the officials of the company had been adopted by the directors, a certain serious position would not have arisen between 1939 and the appointment of Mr. Reynolds. I have said here before, and I repeat, that I know that a certain highly-placed official of the Great Southern Railways Company suggested to the directors that they should purchase coal when there were millions of tons of coal available at a very low price, after the evacuation of Dunkirk, and that suggestion was turned down by the directors.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to stress that point.  I only want to make it clear to the members of the House who <Col N="2234" /> are taking an active interest in making this Bill a better Bill that it is the directors and not the executive officials of the company who are responsible for the mismanagement in the past.  I wonder has the Minister or his advisers given any consideration to the kind of control which has been so successfully and efficiently carried out in Great Britain.  There was a fairly serious position in the railway world in Great Britain only a few years ago and a scheme of control in connection with some of the big companies was brought into operation which has worked very satisfactorily and most efficiently.  The board of control, for instance, in the case of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway Company is a board consisting of full-time working officials with a chairman.  The late Lord Stamp was chairman.  Sir William Wood, an Irishman, is at present chairman.  The chairman is a man with considerable financial experience and an expert in accountancy.  As far as I know, Mr. Reynolds is a qualified, if not a certified, accountant.  He has considerable experience in finance and, in the case of the Dublin United Transport Company, has, no doubt, proved that he was able to change the system of management to the advantage of the travelling public and of the workers.  I give him all the credit that the Minister claims for him in that connection. I would prefer that the other active members of the board to whom the Minister may desire to give any power should be drawn from the sections of the officials who have an expert knowledge of the working of the transport industry in this country.  I wonder is it too late for the Minister to give consideration to a scheme of that kind. The head of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway Company is, as I have said, a man of high standing in the financial world and an expert accountant and he has associated with him four or five assistants who are the heads of the revenue earning sections on both the road and rail sides and an expert engineer.  These are full-time working officials in charge of the administration of a company that has 400,000 employees.  I think we could afford to consider the adoption of a <Col N="2235" /> scheme of that kind, of having a board of control rather than one man as dictator who has had no previous knowledge of railway working and having associated with him six duds.  I use the word &ldquo;duds&rdquo; because Deputy Dwyer, who knows the members of the board of the Great Southern Railways Company far better than I do, has described these gentlemen as duds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDwyer" hpid="Mr. Dwyer Mr. Dwyer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dwyer</NameTxt>
      <P>Dummies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the correction. If they are dummies, they are worse than duds.  At any rate, I should like to know from the Minister what are the matters of any importance upon which the present chairman, Mr. Reynolds, has consulted these duds. If they are not worthy of consultation, they are not worthy of being members of the board.  Thousands of pounds can be saved by asking them to retire without compensation and to devote their attention to matters that they may know something more about. If the present stockholders' directors or those of them who will get seats on the board in the future are duds, there is no justification for their expense as directors.  If these directors were satisfied, on the advice of Mr. Reynolds, or any other chairman of the company, that working members of the Great Southern Railways staff were duds or were not doing their work satisfactorily, they would have no qualms of conscience and very little consideration in giving the workers concerned a week's notice to leave their jobs.  If that policy is an acceptable one so far as the working members or employees of the transport industry are concerned, then the same policy should be applied to these &ldquo;dud&rdquo; directors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, one of the directors who will be reappointed, or who can be reappointed, under the terms of this section of the Bill, has been brought under the notice of the Judicial Tribunal.  He has been found guilty of having made improper use of information which came to him in his privileged position, and he made a considerable amount of money at the expense of the shareholders, whose <Col N="2236" /> interests he is supposed to protect. Does the Minister agree that it is desirable to have such a person on the board of the new company?  The reappointment of such a person is provided for under this new scheme of reorganisation. Not alone that, but under this scheme it is made possible for that man to secure two years' compensation on the basis of his existing fees, if he desires to retire.  That is possible under the terms of this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>This section, without doubt, is based on the Minister's belief that Mr. Reynolds is a heaven-sent superman.  May I ask the Minister, without any disrespect to the Minister and, certainly, without any disrespect to Mr. Reynolds, what, if Mr. Reynolds should die or become ill or resign, will become of this organisation after such an event?  After all, Mr. Reynolds is subject to a recall from this earthly world, just in the same way as any of us are subject to a recall&mdash;in the same way as the Minister himself.  There is no lease of life for any man or superman, and for that reason I do not think that any man, and especially one without any experience of railway transport, should be given the powers that are proposed to be given to him under the terms of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I were in the position that Mr. Reynolds holds to-day&mdash;a very important position&mdash;I should prefer to have around me as advisers, three, four or five men with first-hand knowledge and many years of experience of railway undertakings.  I should look for advice from these people, and I should consider anxiously any advice that I could get from men with 30 or 40 years' practical experience in the working of <Col N="2238" /> railway transport.  I think that the Minister is a friend of Mr. Reynolds, and it is for that reason that I am putting this proposition to him, and asking him that he should regard the matter in that light.  The Minister has told us that on the morning of the fateful occasion, when the division was taken in this House, Mr. Reynolds came down to him and pleaded with him to withdraw this Bill.  Now, what was it that actuated Mr. Reynolds to come down to the Minister and ask him to withdraw the Bill on the morning of the fateful day of the division here? Did he get the &ldquo;wind up&rdquo;?  What caused him to plead with the Minister to withdraw the Bill?  Something must have occurred to make him come down and ask his friend, the Minister, to withdraw the Bill.</P>

I do not wish to be irrelevant; I have no desire to be so.  Certainly, I have not the same knowledge of what constitutes irrelevancy as you have, Sir, and I submit to your ruling.  I do not wish to bring in any irrelevant matters, but it was suggested to the Minister during the Second Reading and during the discussion on the Committee Stage, that Mr. Reynolds was being criticised by Deputy Norton, myself, and other Deputies, because it appeared to the Minister&mdash;and I am certain that he is wrong&mdash;that there was some prejudice in our minds against that individual.  I have no prejudice in the wide world against Mr. Reynolds.  I was quite satisfied that the appointment of Mr. Reynolds was better&mdash;and I stated that here in the House&mdash;than to continue on with these &ldquo;dud&rdquo; directors and allow them still to carry on.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dwyer</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir, it was not made jocosely.  However, I withdraw the remark.  The Bill states that the company shall be directed by a board of directors, and then this section goes on to show that the chairman alone shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of the board, although never before, in the history of public companies, has such a board been formed, where the articles of association state clearly that the directors have no power whatever to do anything without the permission of the chairman.  It is an amazing thing that a company, which has now been in existence for 120 or 130 years, has never given an opportunity to any of its staff, so far as I know, to attain the position of directors of the company.  A dictatorship is about to be established under the name of democracy.  There are further possibilities of paying on turnover, which has never been done before, so far as I know.  I never referred to these directors as &ldquo;duds.&rdquo;  I referred to them as &ldquo;dummies,&rdquo; as having been made so by the Minister.  I think it is a disgraceful thing that we should have a company here run by one man with a board of directors which has no power of direction.  I was quite serious when I made that remark the other day.  I think this is a most amazing provision, and I will support, as far as I can, the appointment of three directors as proposed by the amendment. I think that, in appointing these directors, it would be a good thing, in the interests of transport, to appoint directors, if possible, from the staff of the railway itself.  They, surely, for 120 years have not been so completely dud as not to deserve some sort of recognition of their value to the company, and should have some say in it now. There has been a complete re-orientation in Britain as regards boards of directors.  I think that after this war we will find that many representatives of Labour will go on the boards of big companies in England, and I think it is about time that we toed the line here.</P>

      <P>May I intervence at this <Col N="2241" /> stage to try to get the discussion back to the amendment?  I think that Deputy Davin had better make up his mind straight away that there is no half-way house between the proposals in the Bill and Government ownership and control.  No doubt, he would prefer Government ownership and control. He made that fact clear.  But this Bill does not provide for it, and the sections of the Bill which determine the form that this company will take have already been passed through Committee.  We cannot go back on that.  If the alternative, therefore, is not complete Government ownership and complete Government control, which Deputy Davin would prefer, does the suggestion in the amendment offer any improvement on the Bill, having regard to the general scheme of the Bill?  I submit that it does not. It does not effect any such improvement. The suggestion, which is neither one thing nor the other, would confer not the benefits of either system but only the faults of both systems.  It would give the Government full responsibility for the board of the company, while at the same time leaving in the power of others the influencing of its policy.  We can have complete Government responsibility for transport direction, responsibility discharged through a board of directors nominated by it, if we want it.  We think it would be a bad system in the circumstances of this country, and we are not proposing it.  We are going to oppose it.  The Dáil has taken a decision on that, and I submit that the people have taken a decision on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we proceed on the basis of a commercial organisation, with the common stock held by private individuals who, as the owners of that stock, will select directors to represent them, is it desirable that we should limit the representation of these stockholders upon the board of this company to the extent proposed by Deputy Davin?  I suggest that it is not.  What is necessary here is to ensure that, if there is a conflict between the owners of the stock and the public interest, the public interest should predominate.  It is necessary also to ensure that, so <Col N="2242" /> long as the taxpayer of the country is the ultimate guarantor of the interest obligations of this company, the Government, as the representative of the taxpayers, should have the power to intervene at any stage or time necessary to ensure that the financial affairs of the company are well managed.</P>
    <P>It is true that I intimated to the Dáil during the course of the debate on the Second Reading of Transport Bill No. 1 that the proposals in this section were not necessarily regarded as unchangeable.  I intimated that any amendment would be considered on its merits.  Deputy Davin's was considered on its merits and, on its merits, I ask the Dáil to reject it.  I think that it represents a worse proposal than that contained in the Bill. If we were to go as far as Deputy Davin suggests it would be better for us to go the whole distance, and get rid of the common stockholders altogether and have a board entirely nominated by the Government.  I think Deputy Davin is under a complete misconception also in regard to the functions of the board when he refers to the stockholders' directors as having only the power of office boys. The members of the board of this company have many functions to perform, some of them placed on them by statute and others arising out of their day to day administration of the concern. Membership of the board involves a considerable amount of work. When the Great Southern Railways Company was constituted by the Act of 1924 it was considered desirable that the number on the board of the company should not be smaller than 12.  The 1924 Act provided for a board which would not be less than 12 or more than 15.  We considered that a smaller board would be equally effective, and legislated in 1933 to reduce it in size.  But, on many occasions since, it has been represented that the amount of routine work falling to be discharged by the board is such that an increase in its size would not be unacceptable to the other members. We are not proposing to increase its size, but we think it is a complete misunderstanding of the functions of the board for Deputy Davin to suggest <Col N="2243" /> that the members will have nothing to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Because it is intended that the direction of the company will be largely in the hands of the representatives of the stockholders, subject only to the power of the chairman appointed by the Government to ensure that its policy conforms to the Government's intentions, and that its financial administration is such as not to prejudice the interests of the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>Deputy Davin says that the directors of this company were not consulted concerning the proposals in the Bill. That is obviously wrong.  It is quite clear that, during the stage of tentative consideration of these proposals before anything definite emerged, Mr. Reynolds, the chairman of the company, was acting as the Government's adviser and not as the representative of the board.  At the stage when it became possible to consult the board, the board was consulted and the board took a decision to recommend these proposals to the people whom they represented&mdash;the shareholders of the company.</P>

      <P>They were quite free to reject these proposals if they wished. There is, of course, no point whatever in the proposal that we should reduce the board to three directors.  A board of three directors could not possibly discharge all the functions that will fall on this body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also want to say that the suggestion by Deputy Davin, that there was some <Col N="2244" /> bargain between the Government and the directors of the absorbed companies relating to their position in the new organisation, is completely without foundation.  The Deputy is aware of the proposals in the Bill.  We consider that these proposals represent the best method of effecting a transition from the present position into the contemplated position, but they were decided on on their merits, and not as a result of any agreement or arrangement.</P>
    <P>If I am in order, I would like to make a brief reference to a director of the company who is referred to in the tribunal's report.  I considered whether there were any grounds of public policy arising out of the tribunal's report why we should legis late in respect of Mr. Goodbody.  Mr. Goodbody is a director of the company and, under the provisions of the Bill, will become a stockholders' director for a time&mdash;until his re-election arises&mdash;unless he decides in the meantime to retire.  The report of the tribunal is as follows.  I shall read two short paragraphs from it which summarise the whole position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Read the whole lot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I think I will read sufficient.  On page 52 the tribunal's report states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Although Mr. Goodbody's action was in no way unlawful, we are of opinion that the mere giving of the order to purchase the stock before the issue of the circular was an improper use of information concerning the proposals for the reorganisation of the capital of the company within the meaning of our terms of reference.  We are further of opinion that the purchase of the £500 stock was also an improper use of such information.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The other paragraph I shall read is from the findings of the tribunal on page 63&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;There has been no improper use-of information concerning the proposals for the capital reorganisation of the Great Southern Railways except the instances we have specifically mentioned, which we consider-unimportant <Col N="2245" /> and to which no other dealings can be attributed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the report so far as Mr. Goodbody was concerned.  I am of opinion that the report does not require us to take any specific action in relation to that gentleman.  Whether he will regard himself as under any obligation to take action, I cannot say. Whether the shareholders of the company will have regard to that report when the question of his election arises, I cannot say.  If, however, a view is strongly expressed here that the report does require the extraordinary step of legislating in relation to that gentleman, that view can be considered.  However, I urge Deputies, if they are going to express that view, to express it with every desire to be fair, having regard to the terms of the tribunal's report and to the exceptional step that would be involved in the introduction of amending legislation naming that gentleman in relation to the board of this company.  This is not a matter on which I am going to influence the Dáil one way or another. I have given the matter very careful consideration and my judgment, for what it is worth, is that the report does not call for any special action on the part of the Legislature, whatever action it may call for on the part of the individual himself or on the part of the shareholders of the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking any member of the Fianna Fáil Party to justify the constitution of the board in the manner provided by Section 35.  Here we have a board consisting of a chairman and six folk described as <Col N="2247" />&ldquo;directors,&rdquo; who are without the slightest power in the world to direct. They are on a lead.  They are permitted to do just what the chairman wishes them to do.  If the chairman does not wish them to do anything, those six directors, whether as individuals or as a collective group, have no functions or powers whatever.  Did anybody ever hear of a board constituted in this way?  There are seven directors.  Six of them are to provide a little ornamentation for the seventh, who is chairman, and who wields all the power.  Although there is a board of seven, the chairman alone constitutes a quorum at a meeting of the board. The six may be there if they like but, if the chairman is not there, there is no quorum.  Six out of the seven directors may be present but there is no quorum unless the chairman is present.  Is not that a nice conception of democracy?  That is provided for in sub-section (5) which states that no decision shall be arrived at at any meeting without the concurrence of the chairman.  Six of the seven directors may hold a view which is desirable from the national standpoint and from the standpoint of the stockholders so far as railway policy is concerned.  That does not matter.  So long as the seventh man, the Minister's appointee, the nominee of the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked if such an arrangement were ever heard of in legislation before.  The Minister imposed such a system by Emergency Powers Order.  This is part of the Minister's mad-dog policy in regard to control and direction of the railway company.  This amendment seeks to establish a board which will consist of three stockholders' representatives, three directors appointed by the Minister and the chairman.  The object is to ensure that there will be at least a democratic board, which will be able to fix its own quorum, will be able to arrive at decisions by democratic majority rule and, at the same time, provide adequate representation of the public interest on the board, in view of the fact that the taxpayers are going to be liable, in the event of default by the railway company, to pay interest, at least until 1960 on the £16,000,000 of debenture stock which will be issued by this company.  I suggest to the Minister that he ought not to display such a want of faith in persons who may desire to serve on the board of an Irish transport undertaking.  One would imagine that everybody in this country was a public enemy of transport except the person who is appointed chairman by the Minister.  I suggest to the Minister that even though he has abandoned his intentions of yesteryear, to introduce a scheme of national ownership and national control of transport, there is no reason why his abandonment of that policy should be accompanied by the establishment of a dictatorship, such as it contemplated, so far as the directors are concerned, in Section 35.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the section is thoroughly undemocratic, because it gives absolute and despotic power to the chairman, all based on the fact that he has succeeded in mesmerising the Minister.  What would happen if one day the chairman got into a huff with the Minister, or with the Government, or became ill?  It is almost too horrible to contemplate that a transport undertaking with a capital of £20,000,000 cannot be run, according to the Minister, unless this particular person is chairman.  I think this is an attempt to enthrone absolute dictatorship. <Col N="2250" /> I consider that there is no justification for it, and this amendment, together with complementary amendments, Nos. 53 and 57, provide for the establishment of a democratic board, consisting of competent persons capable of managing the transport undertakings, who will arrive at decisions by majority rule and, at the same time, constitute a national safeguard.</P>

      <P>The scheme proposed by Section 35 is that of a board of directors, a chairman and a certain number of stockholders' shareholders. There is the amazing proposal that the board can act whether there is a vacancy or not in membership, that the chairman can hold a meeting any time he likes, because he constitutes a quorum, that no meeting can be held until the chairman is there and, finally, to put the matter beyond possibility of leakage, there is a provision that no decision can be taken by the board unless the chairman concurs.  The Minister continued to say that there is some virtue in having subsidiary members, other than the chairman, and that there was some function for them. I should like to know what it is.  There were &ldquo;tags&rdquo; about responsibility and power and why they had to be conjoint, but the members of the board have no power except maybe in the way of influencing the chairman, or bringing views to bear on him with a view to getting him to sway his decision in a manner other than he proposed.  I hope the framework will be changed, and that at ordinary board meetings majority decisions will be binding. Deputy Dwyer, as a business man, says that he knows of no company in which similar proposals are to be found.  The Minister accepts that view, because the only thing he could say of the proposal was that it was done in a time of emergency. I think he also said that it was done on the promise that he was not going to make any emergency provision for the post-war period.  If we take it that the board is not going to be reconstituted other than as the Minister proposes, then we must accept the position that the chairman will be there, that he is going to take a decision without a board meeting being called, that he can prevent any meeting discussing anything by staying away, and can prevent any decision being taken by refusing to concur in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very hard to consider these <Col N="2252" /> people except as Deputy Norton described them, satellites.  They may have a viewpoint and bring it to bear, but in the background the chairman must be the supreme arbiter and his decision must hold.  Fitted into these circumstances, although I do not think there is much value in the point, it seems to me that it would be better to have a number of people to provide varying viewpoints for the chairman in an effort to get him to come to a proper conclusion.  The Minister said that if there is a conflict between private owners and public interest, the public interest must prevail.  Accepting that for the moment, who is to be the judge of the public interest?  Why should we assume that this chairman alone will be the best judge of the public interest?  Why should he not be provided with other people, at least as conscious of the public interest as he is, who could produce arguments as to what is the best thing to do on particular occasions?  There are very few boards that I know, not even the present Government, in which there is not at least a semblance kept up that there is still some process of reasoning in regard to taking decisions.  We return to this old matter of the clash of mind upon mind, and you try to provide for that by getting people with diverse interests, having before them the particular viewpoints of their Departments, and getting these to agree upon one common policy.  It seems to me that there may be some value to be got by surrounding this man, who in the end is to be the mouthpiece of the public interest, by people who at least will have arguments to put forward founded on experience as to what the public interest in particular circumstances may be.  It was for that reason that I approached this matter from the point of view of the amendment I tabled to the Fourth Schedule.  I had before my mind a particular viewpoint, and I submit that it is not an unreasonable attitude.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

      <P>That is amendment No. 213?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, which will fall with this.  In the case of that amendment, <Col N="2253" /> it was a matter of involved drafting and it could have been done better, but I drafted it in the circumstances of the measure before me.  I had a particular viewpoint before me which Deputy Norton has dealt with to some extent.  There is in the measure a proposal that something in the neighbourhood of £9,000 or £10,000 worth of debentures will be redeemed from time to time and the suggestion is that there is to be a redemption fund built up, that the savings of the company will be put into the fund and redemption secured over a period of years between now and 1960, possibly on some regular instalment basis.</P>
      <P>It is a common view&mdash;I do not think there is any gainsaying the view&mdash;that if the money for the redemption of these debentures is not to be found in the taxpayers' pockets, it will have to come out of charges on transport users. There will be two sets of people who in the end&mdash;one or other, or possibly both by some sharing process&mdash;will provide the money required to redeem the debentures.  These are the transport users and the taxpayers, and I have put down the suggestion that for each £2,000,000, or part of £2,000,000, which in any year is paid off, in so far as it is paid out of transport charges, transport users' directors should be appointed and in so far as it is paid out of State funds, say, by the Minister, out of moneys he raises from the public purse, what I call official directors should be appointed.  It would mean in the end that, if all the money were paid off, there might be a possibility of six extra directors being appointed. Supposing it were done on a half and half basis, from the public purse and from transport charges, there should be three extra directors to represent certain interests and three others to represent other interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not a strictly logical division, but when the Minister, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, came to appoint directors, because of the fact that the public had to subscribe to the paying off of the debentures, he should try to get certain interests&mdash;industrial, commercial and transport&mdash;represented and in so far as transport charges <Col N="2254" /> paid it off, those who used the transport system, such as agriculture and traders of different types, should be brought in and given an interest in the concern.  I think there ought to be some consideration either for the transport users or the taxpayer, if either of these two sources are tapped in order to supply what is required to pay off these debentures.</P>
    <P>I have put forward the additional proposal that right from the start&mdash; and Deputy Dwyer has touched on this and I am thoroughly in agreement with him; in fact, I had already anticipated his view by putting down an amendment&mdash;there should be three people appointed to represent the employees, that is, employees from the meanest type of worker on the system up to the managerial side.  I did all that in the light of the ideas expressed and also because, just about the time I was considering the matter, the report of the Commission on Vocational Organisation had appeared, and it seemed to me that my proposal was very definitely in line with the run of their suggestions, that is, that when founding any of these institutions, an attempt should be made to get all those directly interested, either on the basis of service in the case of employees or the basis of payment in the case of taxpayers and transport users, should be associated in the management of the concern.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt, as Deputy Dwyer said, that this new viewpoint has been steadily accepted and put into practice during the war in all sorts of organisations which were brought into being in order to meet the exigencies of the war situation, and that it has been found a profitable use of men's energies and brains that all these diverse interests should be got around the individual who is to be chairman of a board and should be enabled to play their part.  I suggest that this matter should be given further consideration, and that we should accept some proposal to have this chairman at least provided with better sources of information and with a variety of viewpoints all touching on transport. There may be some way of effecting that, even though we have to fit it <Col N="2255" /> into the framework of this tight, narrow scheme of the Minister.  I object to this tight, narrow scheme. I do not think it is possible, no matter how much admiration one may have for individuals, or what may be said of the work of an individual in peculiar circumstances in a couple of years, safely to rely on the judgment of one person.</P>
    <P>I do not think that one person is fairly put into a position of importance of this type in being told right from the start that it is he who is being relied on and nobody else, and it would aid that man to carry out his responsibilities if he were given this duty, that not merely had he to come to a conclusion about the public interest, but he had to persuade a board, or a majority of its members, whom he had immediately under his control and to whom he could talk privately and persuasively, that what he thought was the public interest was in fact the public interest and should prevail.  So long as we accept the system of argument, of trying to get things done by a process of reasoning, I do not see why we should not still have argument as the decisive matter, even though it may be in the privacy of the boardroom.  I am all for having that system adopted and I suggest it should be adopted here.</P>
    <P>With regard to the matter raised by Deputy Davin, of the individual spoken of in the report of the tribunal, the Minister says he thinks it would be very drastic, on foot of such a report, to legislate against that one individual. It would, of course.  We all accept that view, but the trouble is that the Minister, by administrative action, operated against another person.  I do not propose to go through the details, but one can read the pages after page 50 and compare the cases of the two individuals and see what amount of stock each desired to buy.  The gentleman referred to did not succeed in his full ambitions with regard to purchase, but we can take what the objective of each was in connection with purchases. We must take this into consideration also, that, so far as the civil servant to whom I have referred is concerned, all that the report says is that the tribunal <Col N="2256" /> cannot believe that he could entirely dissociate his purchases, and the mind behind his purchases, from the information he knew or might have come to know inside the Department.  Remember the case of the other man&mdash;a clear confession that he sat at a board meeting and got information and that he was going to use that information.  In the report it is stated that he put the viewpoint that he did not intend to purchase before the flag fell, so to speak, that is, before the publication of the proposals, but clearly in the report, it is indicated that he was going to be first off the mark on the Monday morning.  Clearly, distinctly and confessedly from this report, that was the result of information he got as a member of the board, and, if the two cases are to be judged, the Minister cannot just halt and say it is a drastic thing to legislate against one man, without remembering that he has acted administratively to the very definite detriment of the other man.  There should be some better equalisation of the positions.</P>
    <P>If the Minister goes back into the history of the Railway Tribunal, I think he will find that there was one occasion&mdash;I am not absolutely certain of this&mdash;on which a case was found to be made in respect of what is called undue preference in the matter of rates&mdash;undue preference given to the firm of Ranks, with which this gentleman, of course, is connected&mdash;and that another case was pending in which the same complaint was made and that case was only prevented from coming off because the Minister passed an Order with regard to exceptional rates.  I tag that on to this gentleman's history.  There was, I think, one occasion in which it was alleged that preferential rates were given and, peculiarly enough, they were given in favour of a firm with which this man is connected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite true that one could not find in the articles of association of any company, so far as I know, any arrangement corresponding to that proposed in this Bill.  I can say in relation to this arrangement, however, that it is working smoothly now, that it is working <Col N="2257" /> efficiently.  Deputies must not assume that the situation in the board room of the Great Southern Railways will always be one in which definite antagonisms will arise between the chairman and the other directors and that these powers set out in Section 35 will have to be availed of.  I am certain that, from the time the Emergency Order was made in 1942 until this date, no director of the Great Southern Railways, chairman or anyone else, adverted to the powers given to the chairman in that Order, much less contemplated availing of them.  I imagine that that is how the situation will be in the future.</P>
      <P>It may be that at some stage a conflict of interest will arise between the shareholders' directors and the chairman as the representative of public policy.  If such a situation arises, we must make provision as to who is to come out on top.  It is possible that in the whole history of the company that situation will never occur and these powers will never be exercised.  In so far, however, as, in the framing of legislation, we must endeavour to provide against all contingencies, we must provide against a contingency in which there may be a definite, flat refusal on behalf of the shareholders' directors to co-operate in order to force either a change of policy on the Government or a change of legislation upon the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is true that there is probably no company with articles of association similar to the corresponding section of this Bill, I should say that there are many companies which, despite their articles of association, function as if their constitution was as set out here.  In fact, I should say, without being too definite, that the great majority of companies operate as indicated in the various sections of the Bill.  Certainly in most of the companies in this country, where the chairman or managing director is also the predominant personality on the board and probably the largest shareholder as well, whatever may be in the articles of association, he alone constitutes the quorum and he alone can make decisions.  Some of the Deputies who spoke here in this connection have <Col N="2258" /> probably experience of that type of company.</P>
    <P>Frankly, I cannot understand what Deputy Norton means when he talks about a democratic system.  This is not a board of guardians.  This is a commercial organisation intended to discharge important commercial functions. We are not intending that it should be a democratic institution or that its functioning should be upon lines that are associated with Parliamentary democracy.  We want to get the most efficient system which will produce the best results.  I do not care whether Deputy Norton calls it democratic or dictatorial, the results are what will matter here.  It is democratic if this democratic Legislature decides that it is the best system.</P>
    <P>I am completely opposed to the idea of representative directors.  By that I mean directors who will come on the board to represent some other interest than the company in the management of which they are participating.  I speak, however, not merely upon the basis of theory but upon the basis of experience.  I think that any commercial organisation will be successful if its directors are concerned solely with the interests of that organisation. If they are placed on the board of it as representatives of some other interest, their utility as directors is destroyed and frequently they become obstructions to the effective operation of the concern.  I would oppose in any circumstances the appointment of persons to the board of this company in the acknowledged capacity of representatives of agriculture or industry or labour or finance or any such conception.  I think that the persons appointed by the shareholders of this company to manage its business, or the person nominated by the Government to be chairman of the company, must be concerned solely with the successful operation of the concern and not under any obligation to justify their management in relation to any special interest.</P>
    <P>I am not in any circumstances going to be put in the position of defending Mr. Goodbody.  If Mr. Goodbody has a defence to offer, he himself will put it forward.  I accept fully the observations <Col N="2259" /> of the tribunal and the censures &mdash;I think they did censure him&mdash;which are contained in the report.  I am, however, going to say this: that there was, despite what Deputy McGilligan has said, a fundamental difference between the case of Mr. Goodbody and the officer in my Department who was compulsorily retired.  He was a most efficient officer, one of the most useful officers available to me.  It was a very considerable loss to the Department that his services had to be dispensed with.  I do not believe that he took the action he did with any intention of doing anything wrong.  But the action he did take led to the possibility of a leakage of information. There is no evidence that there was a leakage of information.  But, in the interests of the public service as a whole, it was necessary to put it beyond doubt that, however innocently he may have acted, however harmless his action may have been, it was improper for an official of a Government Department, having information concerning any legislation of this character, to take any steps whatever which might have resulted in a leakage of information concerning it.</P>
    <P>That, I think, justifies the action taken in relation to that officer of the Department.  I took that action with considerable regret and solely because of the general principle involved.  I think that the Department of Industry and Commerce was weakened considerably by the loss of that particular officer.  But I do not want to draw any analogy between that case and any other case referred to by the tribunal. I do not think there is any analogy between it and the case of Mr. Goodbody. Whatever action is taken in relation to Mr. Goodbody should I think be taken by others.  Whatever explanation or defence there is to be offered for him has to be offered by himself.  It will not be offered by me.</P>

But there is another case and, if it were not for the Minister's speech on this matter, I would not mention it.  It is a case where a man has suffered in advance of the findings of this tribunal.  It is the case of an official of the Great Southern Railways who, before the tribunal was set up and long before the findings of the tribunal were announced or made available to Deputies, was prejudged.

He listened to a member of this House telling a wrong story about an official of the Great Southern Railways and, instead of reporting that man to the tribunal, he reported him to the chairman of the company, who pre-judged the case by removing him from a highly-paid position to a junior post. That official was brought before the <Col N="2262" /> tribunal and found not guilty.  I do not want to go into details concerning this matter, but the Minister, who was brought into this case, and who acted on information given to him by a Deputy, should, I suggest, now intervene to see that that man is restored to his former position or status.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall, Sir.  The Minister stated that the scheme is working efficiently since the present chairman came into office.  I dispute that, though I do not want to go into any details to prove my argument.  The Minister, I am sure, has not given any authority or encouragement to the present chairman to interfere with the constitutional rights of members of the staff of the Great Southern Railways as to what union or organisation they will become members of or remain in, or to interfere with the constitutional rights of the members of friendly societies who have been over a long period of years making arrangements for some compensation to be paid to themselves or their dependents in certain eventualities.  The Minister has not given any such encouragement, but the chairman has been acting in that provocative way and, from the point of view of the employees of the company, he has caused a good deal of irritation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to mention the assurance which I was glad the Minister gave on the Second Reading concerning the policy activities of the future chairman, whoever he may be, in regard to matters of that kind.  I rely on the Minister's assurance.  I suggest the successful working of this huge scheme depends upon the goodwill that will prevail on the day it comes into operation.  A friendly understanding, I hope, will be created and will continue to exist between the management and those who have helped to carry on the organisation from day to day and year to year.  If the Minister's assurance in respect of the matters I mentioned is accepted and put into operation by the future chairman, I feel satisfied that, if the necessary <Col N="2263" /> amendments to this Bill are carried, there will be a better scheme of transport provided for the country than has been provided up to the present.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not given any convincing arguments&mdash;and I do not accept his explanation&mdash;why there should be six stockholders' representatives on the board of this company in the future.  I do not know why the Minister has arrived at that figure, unless it is to provide place and power and fees and expenses for directors of the Great Southern Railways and the Dublin Transport Company.  I suggest some of these people have not the necessary time to devote to the problems they will be asked to solve, even in the coming year, and particularly from 1st January, 1945.  One of the men who will be taken over under this scheme of control is a directors of no less than ten companies.  He cannot have much time at his disposal to devote to the big problems the Minister talks about concerning the future working of this company.</P>
    <P>Another member of the board who will come over under this scheme is nearly 80 years of age.  I respect age as much as any person in this House, but I suggest that that man is beyond the age of usefulness.  If that man and his colleagues, some of whom are between 75 and 80 years of age, decide that it is good policy to get rid of railway workers, I suggest that a similar policy should be applied to themselves, if we are to set up a successful transport undertaking.  There should not be one law for directors and another for working men on the railways&mdash;one law for the rich and another for the poor.  I submit that there is a good deal of that type of law contained in this and other sections of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I submit that these directors who are between the ages of 75 and 80 have passed their period of usefulness. They are to get compensated under another section of the Bill without having to prove any case, without having to go before an arbitrator to argue that they are entitled to compensation, while the ordinary railway workers, who have carried on <Col N="2264" /> efficiently, from day to day in past years and who, I hope, will carry on in an equally successful way in the future, have to go, as it were, on their knees before the management in order to prove their claim for compensation; they will have to go before an arbitrator to show they are entitled to compensation.  Why should not the same law with reference to compensation apply to the directors as well as to the workers?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I have an amendment here and, while I agree with a good deal of what the Minister said concerning the company, I think that, although the system which has been in operation during the emergency has worked well, it would be unwise to draw conclusions of a permanent nature from that.  It would be unwise to arrive at a decision that what has worked well for a short period under particular circumstances should be continued indefinitely.  I agree that because it has worked well there might be a desire on the part of the Government to continue that policy, but the present chairman, whom I regard as very efficient and as one of the assets of the company, may not always be there and, in the future, when different directors and a different chairman are carrying on the functions of the board of Córas Iompair Éireann, the circumstances may be entirely changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my opinion that the desire should be to legislate rather for a <Col N="2265" /> system than for individuals; to legislate in order that an efficient system may be set up rather than from the point of view that, because certain individuals have worked efficiently, the system which they have operated should be continued.  The amendment in Deputy Hughes's name and mine, providing that the quorum at a meeting of the board shall be three directors of whom the chairman shall be one, would ensure that the chairman would be present at all meetings.  It would also ensure that the chairman alone could not hold a meeting.  Under the section as it stands at the moment he could hold a meeting irrespective of the wishes or of the attendance of any other director.  Deputy Dwyer mentioned the fact that he had never witnessed similar provisions in the articles of association of any company. In most cases companies are run or directed by one particular individual, who is usually the managing director, but in a large concern of this kind I certainly believe it would be desirable that the chairman should be guided and assisted by at least two other directors, and that no decision could be arrived at without their concurrence or without their attendance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that any sensible person who is appointed chairman of this company will work on that basis.  There are probably standing orders for the board of the Great Southern Railways Company prescribing what constitutes a quorum.  What we are doing here, however, is laying down as law that certain things will operate if the occasion arises upon which they are to be availed of.  I think it is extremely improbable that the circumstances will ever arise in which all the stockholders' directors of the company will refuse to attend a particular meeting, for the purpose of bringing the work of the company to a standstill.  I think everybody will agree that that is extremely improbable, but must we not provide against that possible eventuality arising out of a dispute between the stockholders' directors and the Government?  That is why the section is there.  It is there <Col N="2266" /> so that, if that extremely improbable event should happen, there would nevertheless be a means of carrying on the company.  I do not see that there is any alternative to providing what is in the Bill.  Even if we accepted Deputy Cosgrave's suggestion and provided that two other directors should be there, there is still the possibility that no meeting could be held if all the stockholders' directors refused to attend.</P>
      <P>Again, I repeat that the board probably does, of its own initiative, make arrangements, with which the chairman concurs, as to the minimum attendance necessary to constitute a quorum and to permit of business being conducted, but we have got to provide against extremely improbable events which would, if they came to pass, bring the company to a standstill and make it impossible for the business of the board to be discharged.  We always have this problem in framing legislation&mdash;that we must provide in the legislation against every eventuality we can foresee that may defeat the purpose of that legislation.  Here is one eventuality that we can foresee. Everyone can see that it is possible. We propose to provide against it in the manner suggested here.  If there is any manner of providing against that eventuality other than the method suggested in the Bill it can be considered, but it is not a safeguard to substitute for what is in the Bill some other arrangement which can be equally nullified by the decision of individuals. We must in all circumstances provide that the business of the board can be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment in the name of Deputy Donnellan is somewhat similar to that in the name of Deputy Cosgrave.  It seeks to ensure that directors will have some power, some responsibility, and that absolute decisions cannot be taken by the chairman alone.  As the fundamental object of this section is to set up a board of directors, I think we should seek to give them some authority.  Practically every big company is controlled by a board of directors; each member of that board has power and responsibility, <Col N="2267" /> and, in practically every board of that nature, majority rules.  If the Minister wanted to avoid the danger of all the six stockholders' directors combining to nullify the actions of the chairman, he might have met the difficulty much more effectively by ensuring that representatives of the public interests had a definite majority on the board, and appointing four directors instead of one.  I think that would have been a much more reasonable and a much more workable method, and I think it would make for better representation of the public interests on this board.  Here we are relying upon one individual and one individual alone to uphold the interests of the community on a board which is to consist of seven.  He is vested with such absolute power that he could achieve that object, but it would be far better if the public interests were represented by a majority, because in this, as in every other matter, we must take the human element into consideration.  It is possible that the one director may have a very strong personality; he may be a very clever man and he may be able to hold his own.  There is a danger there that he may, perhaps, go too far.  There is practically no control over his actions except that exercised by the Minister.  On the other hand, it is possible that the one man representing the public interests may be a weak individual, and the representatives of the stockholders may be men of stronger character who would be able to dominate him.  Given a majority of persons representing the public interests on the board, we would be in a much stronger position to ensure that the interests of the entire community would be safeguarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see any point in the Minister's objection to having directors appointed who are representative of special interests.  This is not a small hole-in-the-corner organisation that is being set up.  It is a huge organisation which will control the life of the nation from one end of the State to the other.  To a very large extent, it will control agricultural development, <Col N="2268" /> and for that reason it is desirable that at least one representative of agriculture should be on the board, even though that representative may be nominated by the Minister, and even though the Minister may, as he should, have the discretion of selecting a man who, apart from his knowledge of and interest in agriculture, has a good knowledge of transport administration and is suitable in every other respect. I am not suggesting that a representative of an interest such as agriculture or a representative of the interests of the employees should be appointed simply because he has an understanding of those particular interests, but at least directors should be appointed who have a knowledge of and an interest in the employees, and a knowledge of and interest in agriculture and the other vital concerns in this State.</P>
    <P>It is, in my opinion, desirable that the Minister should consider these amendments.  They may not all fit in together, but I think we should have the opportunity of picking what is best out of them.  I would very strongly press the amendment in the name of Deputy McGilligan to the Fourth Schedule to the Bill, which provides for representative directors.  There will be a very bad system of control if one man only is given absolute power. He will be surrounded by a group of people who have been described as dummies, with no power whatever but acting as a smoke screen behind which the director can act, if he is a remarkably clever man, or be dominated if he is a weak man.  One may not always have the brilliant chairman there is at present and one may not always have a Minister like the present Minister to look after that chairman.  It would be in the best interests of the State to give the public interest a majority on the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that these amendments are being taken as a group allows of some contradiction between them.  If the Minister insists on the board being formed in the way set out in the Bill, with only one representative of the public interest, I would be in favour of the amendment which gives the stockholders' directors power over <Col N="2269" /> the chairman.  I do not see why this House should be anxious, in view of the various remarks that have been made about the stockholders' directors, to give them power over the chairman. I do not agree with the Minister that there should be only one representative of the public interest, but if he insists on that point, then I would agree with him that that representative should have more power than the stockholders' directors.</P>

      <P>Speaking from the farmer's point of view, with regard to the needs of the farmers&mdash;having been 25 years in city life and 25 years farming&mdash;I would say that transport has been lacking very much since the evolution of the motor-car.  I was greatly struck by the work of a well-known road-making company on the main road.  It cost £960 a statute mile between two of the main cities.  I was just an observer and perfectly powerless, but I heard remarks that the roads made by the farmers were stolen from them.</P>

      <P>I am speaking of the necessity for strong agricultural representation on the board, as suggested by Deputy Cogan.  The needs of the agricultural community have been very sadly neglected.  Their roads have been stolen and glaciers made of them.  I would like that there should be strong agricultural representation.  At present the roads are impassable, though they have cost £960 a statute mile.  There is scarcely a yard of them on which there are not accidents.  I have seen men thrown on those roads.  The needs of the agricultural community should be considered very definitely by the Minister in this respect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>Since it has been suggested by Deputy McGilligan to take all these amendments together, the situation has become more clear and Deputies like myself have an opportunity to make their contribution. Coming from a constituency which is served by an undertaking other than <Col N="2270" /> the one in question, naturally I would not have the same interest in its composition as other Deputies, but, as a representative of the people, and in view of the fact that the State is guaranteeing the interest on this debenture stock, I might just say a few words on this particular section. The section, as it appears, seems somewhat illogical and I thought it was so, until I heard the Minister stating he could not visualise any meeting being held by the chairman alone.  It was his opinion&mdash;and I am inclined to agree with him&mdash;that the directors will attend these meetings and that the chairman will take very few decisions without their consent.  It cannot be denied but that is what usually happens. Deputy Davin will agree that the driving force in many trade union branches is the secretary or some one individual who is more lively than the others.  No matter how big the membership of a union or a friendly society may be, the work is done mainly by one or two.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the fact that the main idea, the one thought in the Minister's mind, is to make this company pay and I am sure we all agree with that view.  I think it is in order to ensure that, that the Minister has put in this section, giving this power to the chairman.  I do not know the chairman personally but, by all accounts, he has proved himself a very efficient manager of the undertaking with which he has been associated for the past four or five years.  That is what we want: we want success in undertakings, whether carried on democratically or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also conscious of the fact that the Minister is in a very strong position. This Bill was greatly criticised prior to the last election and he has before his mind's eye the fact that the Fianna Fáil Party went to the country and got an over-all majority of 17.  I can quite realise that those thoughts of the result of that election are behind the Minister's mind whenever he replies to Deputies here&mdash; Deputy Davin, Deputy McGilligan and the rest&mdash;who have put down amendments to this section.  I should also like to remind the Minister that he <Col N="2271" /> if he were in opposition and Deputy McGilligan were in the Minister's place, would be putting down exactly the same amendments.</P>
    <P>I agree that the chairman has made a success so far of the railways and I know perfectly well that some dynamic power was needed to make the railways pay; but I should like to impress on the Minister that we are living in very difficult times, in an emergency, and that people are putting up with inconveniences now and are giving of their best, from patriotic motives.  That state of affairs will not obtain when this war ends&mdash;and we hope the war will end soon.  Notwithstanding the chairman's great efficiency, there must be goodwill and co-operation on the part of the workers and employees.  That is a thing I would always harp on.  We have an unfortunate background of history in regard to that during the past 20 years, since the State was inaugurated.  Whilst we are all out for the benefit of the State, we all seem to disagree absolutely on what is best for the State.  It would be well for the Minister to bear that in mind and to try to meet the ideas expressed here by the Opposition Deputies through the various amendments set down on this Order Paper. I hope he will realise that, if the success of Córas Iompair Éireann is to be assured, it will require the goodwill and co-operation, not alone of the manager and directors, but of the employees.  May I add this advice to the representatives of Labour as well, that it will be to their interest, in fact it will be their duty and the duty of the workers themselves, to see that it is made a success?  After all, this company will be their own in the strict sense of the term.  If it is not a success, they will be the sufferers.</P>
    <P>That is why I think the Minister should adopt one of these several amendments.  If he cannot adopt them in their entirety he should go at least some way to meet the wishes of the Opposition in this matter.  Remember we represent a very important and influential section of the people.  We are in a minority, of course, but I think the Minister will agree that much of his <Col N="2272" /> work will be made easy if he gets the co-operation of the Opposition, not alone in this House but outside it.  I therefore deprecate in the strongest possible manner the flippant way in which the Minister seems to dismiss all these amendments.  Let me express a further wish in another matter referred to by the Minister as affecting the report of the recent inquiry into the dealings in railway shares.  The Minister expressed the hope, a hope with which I agree, that he will not be asked to introduce certain legislation dealing with a particular individual.  May I suggest to the Minister without offence that I think he himself has been responsible for most of the references made to the report by what I might call the game-cock attitude he adopted last week?  He flaunted that report in the face of Opposition Deputies on several occasions.  I was present in the House and I thought he was most unwise in adopting that attitude and in trying to convince members that the report was 100 per cent. sacrosanct.  I do not want to deal with that report now but may I say as a representative of plain John Citizen that I do not attach the same importance to that report as the Minister did because the members of the tribunal came to their decision in accordance with the law and in accordance with the facts as strictly proved.  I think these are the exact words as used in the report.  We all know that that is the law but we also know that there was many a prisoner tried at the bar who got free whom 99 per cent. of the people knew to be guilty.  That is why I say we need not attach much importance to the report.  We need not go any further into the matter.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister ought in all fairness meet the Opposition in the reasoned amendments that have been put down to this section.  I put forward that suggestion in the hope that it will secure co-operation and goodwill between the chairman, directors, the workers and the public in general, because I think that this is a big undertaking and one in which Deputies should take a special interest.  It should not be left to the Minister, members of the Executive or members <Col N="2273" /> of the Fianna Fáil Party alone.  We should all try to make it a success.  For that reason, I trust that the Minister will, if at all possible, try to meet some of the amendments in regard to the <Col N="2274" /> powers of the chairman and the constitution of the directorate.</P>

      <P>I am hoping that these amendments will suffer a better fate than some of the recent ones which have been before the House because they do not cut across the Minister's ideas as to the constitution of the board, and accept the chairman's overruling power.  All that I am seeking in these amendments is what the Minister himself has suggested we ought do, and that is to provide for all contingencies. The section, as it stands, provides for one set of contingencies, but I suggest there is another set on the other side.  The Minister has provided that the stockholders' directors cannot sabotage the board.  I suggest that, in all fairness, we ought to put in something to ensure that neither will the chairman run wild.  The Minister, of course, will say that that would not be the chairman's intention, or his own intention, but good intentions do not always have a happy fate, and if there should grow up a generation which knew not Joseph there might grow up a generation which knew not the present Minister for Industry and Commerce and hence his intentions would not count for anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The worst thing, I think, that the Minister can say about these amendments is that they are unnecessary. Presumably, he will rest his case on the Companies Consolidation Act of 1845.  I suggest to him that the relevant section of that Act does not quite <Col N="2278" /> provide for a board constituted as this board will be.  The section in that Act which has the same implication as these amendments is, I take it, Section 92. It provides that the directors shall hold meetings &ldquo;at such times as they shall appoint for the purpose of&rdquo; so-and-so. What I am seeking to do in this amendment is to provide that at least four meetings of the board shall be held in the year.  Presumably, a greater number would, normally, be held, but I am making that proposal to meet a possible contingency in the future, and because of the fact that this board is peculiarly constituted.  The chairman is the only one who, in the final analysis, can say when the board shall meet.  The other directors cannot outvote him.  If they wish to hold a meeting, and the chairman does not concur, the meeting cannot be held.  My suggestion is that provision should be made to meet a situation of that kind.</P>
    <P>There is another section in the 1845 Act which provides that any two directors may require the secretary to call a meeting of the directors.  I direct the attention of the House to the words in the section &ldquo;to call&rdquo;.  It is further provided in that Act that there shall be present at least the prescribed quorum.  The 1845 Act only provides that a meeting shall be called. Of course, in the normal course of events, with an ordinary board, the calling of a meeting and the holding of a meeting are much the same because of majority rule.  Those who turn up can go on with the meeting. Under this board, however, while the chairman might agree to call a meeting he could remain away himself.  The meeting could not then be held.  By doing so he would be acting against the spirit of the 1845 Act.  There is not very much more to say about these amendments.  I am not suggesting that they are vital, but I consider that if the Minister thinks he must provide for all future contingencies on one side, it is only fair to make similar provision on the other side.</P>

      <P>Unless the Deputy assumes that the chairman, who will be appointed for the purpose of seeing that the business of the company is <Col N="2279" /> done and that the intentions of the board are discharged, is going to do the very reverse of what he has been appointed to do, no provisions other than those contained in the Companies Consolidation Act appear to be necessary. There is in that Act a provision that any two directors may require the secretary of the company to summon a meeting of the board.  The dates upon which the board meetings are to be held, and the notice that must be given to members of the holding of a meeting of the board, are determined by the board.  I think that to insert a special provision of this kind would be to imply that some special reason existed in the case of this company that does not apply in the case of other companies.  Why should we assume that somebody is going to prevent the board from meeting or the business of the board from being done?  In fact, the chairman is being appointed to ensure that meetings of the board are held, and that the business of the board is discharged.  In the case of a company of this size, I should say that weekly board meetings would almost be not sufficient.  Even in the case of the Great Southern Railways Company, although weekly board meetings are held, it has frequently been found necessary to delegate to committees of the board certain duties in order to permit of the full functions of the board being discharged within the week.  There is, therefore, no reason to think that the board will not meet at least weekly.  In so far as that is a matter which, under the Companies Acts, is left to the directors to decide, I think we should leave it to the directors of this company to decide how often they will meet, and, similarly, in so far as the summoning of meetings of the board is concerned, that is a matter, too, which the directors should themselves decide.  The law requires that a board meeting shall be held if any two directors require the secretary to summon it.</P>

I think that normally the chairman should be present, having regard to the constitution of this company and the functions which the chairman has to discharge.  I want to try to get the discussion away from the possibility that the chairman will be there to obstruct a meeting of the board.  The chairman is being put in for the very opposite purpose: to see that, in fact, the business of the company is done, and that the board's functions are fully discharged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening, I was dealing with the burden of the Minister's speech, which had to do with the amount which would be involved by giving effect to this motion.  In his computation, the Minister did not seem to take cognisance of the terms of the resolution.  He did not apparently take account of those of 65 years of age who are gainfully occupied.  It is obvious that a large number of people of 65 years of age would be usefully occupied and would not come within the old age pensions code.  That alteration would disturb the Minister's estimate of £12,000,000.  The main difficulty, according to the Minister, is the question of finance.  His personal sympathy in the matter is undoubted.  All sections of the House are agreed that, in their domestic affairs, old age pensioners are being seriously harassed, and that there is urgent need for amelioration of those conditions.  One would expect, in those circumstances, that the Minister would welcome any approach to a solution of the difficulty of finding the money to meet the cost of implementing the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that respect, I want to advert to an argument which has been brought forward in this House on several occasions. I refer to the position of men, in the urban areas particularly, who are in the enjoyment of small pensions from industrial firms.  The employers are prepared to continue those pensions if they are satisfied that the continuance of the pension will not prejudice the recipient's subsequent position. In other words, they are prepared to continue these pensions of 15/- or 16/- a week if they will be regarded <Col N="2283" /> as supplementary to the old age pension when the recipients reach 70 years.  A large number of people, particularly in Dublin, are in receipt of what are known as &ldquo;voluntary pensions&rdquo;. On a previous occasion, the Minister expressed his sympathy with persons of that class.  They are discharged from employment at 65 years, and they have to fend as best they can between the age of 65 and 70 years.  A solution of that question, though it would be only a partial solution of the greater question, would bring a certain measure of comfort and solace to a large number of our people.  The employers are prepared to continue those voluntary pensions if the recipient's position is not subsequently prejudiced by statutory regulation.  The same remarks apply so far as trade union benefits are concerned.  Out of their restricted resources, a number of trade unions allow members small amounts of superannuation when they reach a certain age.  Here, again, unfortunately, the means test is brought in to offset any advantage that might accrue from long membership of a trade union. These members might be in receipt of about 10/- a week.  If we accept the assumption that this whole question resolves itself into a matter of cost, I suggest that there is an avenue of approach for the Minister without seriously disturbing the finances of the State.  It is an approach which would bring a measure of relief to many of our people.  I urge the Minister seriously to consider these two points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and everybody else know that the increased cost of living over the past five years has considerably altered the aspect of this whole matter of what is, or what is not, a proper weekly allowance for the average old age pensioner. Ten shillings a week was a suitable allowance before the war but, on account of the increased costs since then, I think 10/- is now too meagre. Like the last speaker, I do not want to advocate any scheme which would overburden the taxpayer or endanger the finances of the State, but I think the Minister will agree with me that this is a matter of great urgency.  We, <Col N="2284" /> of the Farmers' Party, would like to see it dealt with at once.  Something should be done, and done quickly, because it is common knowledge that there is a great deal of what I might describe as silent poverty in a number of homes.</P>
      <P>Many people, particularly in rural districts, are proud and dignified and do not care to admit poverty.  They like to keep the best side out.  The Minister professed to be very sympathetic towards pensioners, but he had to regret that he was utterly unable to improve their position until after the emergency.  I want to ask him one question: How could any person be expected to exist on 10/- a week?  I am referring to those who are absolutely destitute, who have no means of livelihood after a long life of toil.  I appeal to him to consider the position of such people, because the increased cost of living has hit those over 70 years of age harder than any section of the community.  The means test has caused heart burning and a revision of it is long overdue.  It is quite within the bounds of possibility that the average investigation officer could be unfair and definitely unjust in many cases if the regulations were carried out strictly.  In many cases those who worked hard all their lives, and made homes in rural areas out of what was perhaps barren rock or reclaimed bog, because they have a few acres of such land when they reach 70 are denied the old age pension.  I consider that to be absolutely unfair and I ask the Minister to consider reviewing that aspect of the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another bogy is that when children of these people go to England and send home some of their earnings that creates a barrier against the granting of pensions.  That should not be so. If a Government here fails to provide means of employment for young people, and they cannot earn a livelihood at home but go to England and send home small amounts to help their parents, it reacts on the claims of the parents when they reach the pensionable age.  There should be a distinction made between cases where children are living and earning at home and those who emigrate.  Children working in England or at home very often give <Col N="2285" /> their earnings to their parents to put in the banks for them.  As that money is definitely the property of the young people, it is unfair that parents should be denied pensions because they have the possession of that money.  A modification of the means test is long overdue. Some steps in that direction should be taken now.  I desire to get from the Minister figures concerning the additional grants of 2/6 that were given to pensioners, and the numbers that took advantage of them.</P>
    <P>I do not know what view is held in other parts of Eire but in my constituency the amount granted is regarded as little better than outdoor relief. If an increased grant is to be given to old age pensioners it should be paid directly to them.  In most cases they have practically to prove that they are paupers before they become entitled to the extra grant.  Some would not accept it because it came through the local authorities.  The next suggestion I have to make is that the Minister should seriously consider granting pensions at 65 years of age. My reason for doing so is that in various walks of life, particularly in the case of higher paid officials and civil servants, people are compelled to retire at 65 and become pensionable. Considering the difference that exists between, say, a civil servant and a person who has lived a long life of toil on the land, the Minister, I daresay, will say when replying that the additional expense involved could not be met. However, I urge him to consider giving some pensions at 65.  Another point in favour of giving pensions at 65, particularly in rural districts, is that it would induce old people to surrender their holdings and give young people a chance of getting married at an earlier age.  Although that might result in a bit of a &ldquo;pull&rdquo; on national finances, it would have beneficial results and there would be an increase in the marriage rate in a short time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not present on previous occasions when this motion was before the House, but I should like to endorse the remarks of Deputy O'Sullivan.  I agree that a more sympathetic Minister could not be found <Col N="2286" /> in the ranks of the Government Party than the present occupant of that very high office, the Minister for Finance. I know that his heart is in the right place but I feel that responsibility often outweighs considerations of heart.  Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned an aspect that affects the prudent and provident citizen.  I refer particularly to the case of the prudent citizen who, by means of a subscription to a trade union, benevolent association or insurance society, contributes from 1/4 to 2/4 weekly.  I feel that that type of citizen is the backbone of this country. He is civic minded.  He believes in being provident and in putting something by for the rainy day.  A man who subscribed 1/4 or 2/4 weekly out of his meagre wages for 40 years, when he is 70, is entitled to a superannuation allowance of 15/- weekly or a pension, but the reward he gets for his prudence and his providence from this and the previous Government is the sum of 1/- per week as an old age pension.</P>
      <P>Contrast that with the treatment accorded the improvident man, the man who disregards most of the laws of the State, the man who is a charge on the local authority, who is in and out of the casual ward, who, if he is strong enough, beats a policeman whenever he gets a chance and frequently finds himself in jail.  That man cannot be regarded as a good citizen and yet when he attains the age of 70 years he gets the full State pension.  I wonder can the Minister point to any law or any provision in this or any other State which brings about such an extraordinary state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pensions paid in Britain and Northern Ireland have been mentioned. I know, and can vouch for the fact, that persons in Northern Ireland and Great Britain in receipt of 15/- a week are getting the full State pension. I heard Lloyd George himself say that he would compel his mother, if she were alive, to apply for and accept the full pension of 10/- per week, because she had contributed over a period of years by way of taxation to the maintenance of good government in the country.  I feel that the Minister will give serious consideration <Col N="2287" /> to the points made by Deputy O'Sullivan and by myself on various occasions when discussing the Local Government Estimates.  This is an anomaly which deserves the serious consideration of the Cabinet, and I am sure that when it is considered by the Cabinet, we shall have the fullest sympathy of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned that many persons in the rural areas are too proud to look for the extra half-crown given through the medium of the poor law authorities.  I consider it very demoralising and demeaning to certain types of citizens who have been described by speakers on the Farmers' Benches as very proud persons.  It is the sort of pride in which I rather delight.  Cases have been brought to my notice of old people with £27 in the bank, which had been put by for burial purposes to ensure that they would not be buried in parish coffins, being debarred from getting the pension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking of people with £27 put by.  The Minister fell into an error when he stated that the full pension was not allowed across-Channel.  I do not suggest that it was intentional on his part, but if he looks up the figures, he will find that if a person has an income of 12/6 per week, he gets the full pension of 10/-, which gives him 22/6 per week. That is the position as I know it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have in Cork City the cases of a number of corporation employees who were discharged before the age of 70.  These men get 16/- per week until they attain the age of 70, when the pension given to them will be only 10/-, the State having to supply the other 6/- Consciously or unconsciously, the <Col N="2288" /> Government is putting a ban on decent employers who would like to give their employees 10/- or 15/- per week for life, because they find that, if they do so, the State will give them only 1/-. There are a number of very decent employers in this country, men full of human sympathy, who feel that where good service has been given by employees, that service is worthy of recognition in some way.  The only way in which it can be of any use to an employee is in the form of a pension or gratuity.  Such institutions as the railway, breweries and distilleries and many other private firms have given their employees pensions varying from 10/- to £1 per week.  The State then says: &ldquo;Thou shalt not get a State pension.&rdquo;  These cases would not involve any undue difficulty for the State. I accept the Minister's figures and while I am wholly in sympathy with the spirit of the motion, I feel that in present circumstances its objects would be unattainable, for the reasons mentioned by the Minister, but these other cases I have referred to, of people who have 15/- a week as a result of saving over a long period, I think, deserve serious consideration by the Government.</P>
    <P>All that can be said on this motion has been said.  I am perfectly certain that if the matter is put before the Cabinet by the Minister, as I am sure it will be, some attempt will be made to meet the position.  I should like to see pensions for everybody at 65 for the reasons already mentioned, such as the inducement to persons to retire, allowing younger people to step into their shoes, but perhaps that is not practicable and not very advisable. There can, however, be no possible excuse for penalising the thrifty and provident citizen in the manner in which he is now penalised. I ask if the Minister can justify withholding the payment of 10/- per week to the provident citizen while he grants it to the man who is in and out of jail, a charge on the local and State authorities, the judiciary, the police, prison warders and others.  One man is an asset to the State and the other a menace to the State.  The man who is a menace to the State is encouraged, <Col N="2289" /> while the provident citizen, the backbone of the State, is discouraged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I always have a certain amount of sympathy with the Minister when he is faced with a motion of this kind.  The motion sets out to give something that everybody in the House, the Minister no less than any of us, would like to give, if it were possible.  I think that is generally accepted, but the Minister is faced with the immediate responsibility of finding the money from the taxpayer for the proposals outlined in the motion. Deputies also have a duty not to divest themselves of a certain responsibility in the matter and I was very struck indeed by the moderation of some of the speeches I heard, especially those of Deputy O'Sullivan, Deputy Anthony and Deputy Blowick.  They were moderate and made an attempt to face up to that responsibility which Deputies have, not always to do merely the vote-catching or the popular thing but to examine what all the repercussions will be.  I suggest that the Minister should give some assurance that the matters dealt with in the speeches I listened to this evening, that is, noninterference with workers who receive small pensions from their employers and that these pensions would not be taken into account in assessing means for the purpose of the Old Age Pensions Acts, will be considered.  He should also look into the other matter mentioned by Deputy Blowick, namely, the contributions from children abroad. At best, these are always irregular. Some years they may send £5 or £10 at Christmas; other years it may be much less, some years it may be more. They may send that £5 or £10 a couple of times.  That is such a very difficult thing to assess properly that frequently the pensions officer takes the easy way by assessing it at a much higher figure than the person gets and lets the person fight it.  If the person has the reputation of getting any sum at all from a child abroad, the customary thing is for the pensions officer to assume that the sum is in the neighbourhood of £20.  In most cases that is ridiculous.  It very rarely reaches the sum of £10.  The remittances are so irregular, in any event, that I think the <Col N="2290" /> Minister should issue some instructions that they should not be a matter for consideration at all in the assessment of means for the purpose of the Old Age Pensions Acts.</P>
      <P>If the Minister would give some assurance that these two matters would be gone into, I should certainly advise the sponsors of the motion to withdraw it, because we must all realise that, on the figures given by the Minister as to the cost of this, it is utterly impracticable at the moment at any rate.  While it is something that we should all like to see done, we know in our hearts that it cannot be done at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion. I am surprised that Deputy Lynch has been taken in by the Minister's figure of £8,500,000.  The Minister mentioned that the social services at present are costing £9,000,000.  If the social services offered by another country were put into operation here with pensions for everybody at 65, I think it would cost £16,000,000.  Deputy Lynch wants to know where the money is to come from.  I am certain that the Minister's Department or some Department of the Government has been considering a scheme similar to that which has <Col N="2291" /> been put forward in Great Britain. The cost of the social services here at present is £9,000,000, and an increased contribution from all those in employment will bring in another £5,000,000 or £6,000,000, so that the cost of £16,000,000 for the social services would not be raised directly out of taxation.  I am certain that the Minister has such a scheme in mind.  While his sympathies are with the old age pensioners at present, I would prefer to hear him announcing that a scheme of social services similar to those proposed for other countries will be brought into operation here with the co-operation of all Parties.  I think something like 5 per cent. of the population are regarded as being in destitution. Therefore, in addition to the £9,000,000 that we raise by taxation for social services, we would have to raise out of taxation or out of rates or by an increased contribution from employers and employees what will pay for the social services of 5 per cent. of the people in Eire who are practically destitute.  That would be better than what is asked for in this motion.  We would be giving social services, free medicine, free doctors, pensions for all sections of the community, and insurance benefits during illness or infirmity or old age.  You would remove the fear of want from people.  I am certain that the Minister has considered that matter.  Although the Minister referred to the huge cost of the pensions at the present time and complained that he had not received any suggestions as to how the extra money could be raised other than by taxation, I am suggesting to him to go the whole hog and to give social services such as are being offered in other countries.</P>

      <P>On the basis of an increased contribution from those in employment.  I am certain that there is no workman or person other than a workman who would begrudge paying an increased contribution to give bigger pensions and more social services <Col N="2292" /> to the people than they are getting at present.  That would be the disposition of the people of the country. If we proceed along these lines, we will secure for every person who is gainfully employed and rendering service to the country that he will be sure of a pension and sure of receiving benefit on the death of one of his family, or his family in the case of his death.  Of course, you will have opposition from insurance companies and other interested parties.  This should not be made a political issue, but considered from the point of the best interests of the country as a whole.  Then we will be able to overcome the difficulties with a little give and take.  In the position in which we will be, postwar, I am certain that we can do something even better than has been offered by the Government on the other side of the Channel.  While we may not have their financial resources, we will not have the problems which they will have to meet, nor the commitments which they will have to meet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to remove the fear that has been created in the minds of Deputies, even such an experienced Deputy as Deputy Lynch, who thinks that there is no hope for old people receiving any greater pension than they are receiving at present. If we have that mentality we will never get anywhere.  We have to realise that this is a very serious problem, that the people mentioned in the motion are in a worse position than any other section of the community.  When we realise that £1 pre-war would purchase what 34/4 will purchase to-day, we can visualise the conditions in the homes of these poor persons who are dependent solely on the old age pension and have no other resources.  I appeal to the Minister to consider this matter from the point of view of granting pensions to all sections of the community, and to bring in social services such as are promised in other countries.  That would allay the fear in the minds of people and give them encouragement. I am certain that if the Minister does not announce it to-night, he will announce it in a short time.  I should like to ask him if the Government has considered the matter, or if it has been <Col N="2293" /> considered by an inter-Departmental Committee.  I am satisfied that they have not left the consideration of the matter until this motion was brought in.  I will go so far as to say the Minister is as familiar with the scheme that will apply to this country to-day as he will be six months hence.  Therefore, I suggest to him that he should realise the anxiety that prevails among the people throughout the country.  I ask him to give us some hope, to enable us to bring some consolation to those people, that they will not be forgotten by the Government.  All Parties are interested in this matter, and they will do everything in their power to relieve the hardships and the grievances that exist.  I appeal to the Minister to make some statement in connection with that matter.</P>

      <P>Most of us who know the Minister are aware where his heart lies in this matter.  I feel confident that the appeals that have been made to him will not be made in vain.  I am convinced that in the very early future he will see the necessity of bringing in some measure to give an increase to the old age pensioners.  Dublin City has a very large number of them.  They are trying to exist on the old age pension. They do not receive an extra shilling from the relieving officer and they have no relations to help them. In view of the increased cost of living, they are in a pitiable position.  I was told by an old age pensioner this morning that the ordinary candle that used to be got for 1d. now costs 7½d.  These poor people cannot continue to live on the amount they are receiving.  They are bearing great hardships and I join in the appeal to the Minister to come to their assistance.  I feel sure that appeal will not be made in vain.</P>

      <P>Last night the Minister for Finance started his speech in a sympathetic manner, so much so, indeed, that we thought he was about to respond in some way to the appeals made through the medium of this motion, put down by the Irish Labour Party.  But as he proceeded we were treated to the usual set of figures and we were asked the question that always comes from occupants of the Government Front Bench: &ldquo;Where is the money to come from?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>About five years ago, when financial statements were being discussed in this House, one never thought for a moment that taxation would reach the high level that it has reached.  The burden of taxation which the country faced in pre-emergency days was considered a staggering load, and from all parts of the House we heard statements that the people were unable to bear any further taxation.  Nevertheless, when extra money was required for unproductive services, that money was found.  I do not know any better means of spending money than by providing for our old people who have given service all their lives in the interests of this country.  We have to-day among the old age pensioners many men who were prepared to offer their lives in order to attain the freedom of this country.  Many of those people are being treated in the same manner as persons who never raised a hand in defence of the country's freedom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sympathy of the Minister is one thing, but to what degree the Minister is prepared to translate that sympathy into practical shape is another thing. The Minister spoke for some time last night in what I considered to be ambiguous terms.  He said that there was no hope of doing anything as long as the emergency lasts.  Are we to infer that if this emergency were over the Government would be prepared to implement, if not all, at least some of the suggestions contained in this <Col N="2295" /> motion?  It is now, when the emergency is with us, that the old age pensioner wants relief.</P>
    <P>Even before the war the 10/- pension was not sufficient to enable the pensioner to cope with the cost of living and the position has become infinitely worse to-day.  In mid-August, 1939, as Deputy Keyes pointed out, the cost-of-living figure stood at 173 points. To-day it stands at 296 points, indicating an increase in the cost of living of 71 per cent.  That means that in order to place the old age pensioner in the same degree of comfort&mdash;or should I say discomfort?&mdash;in which he was in August, 1939, he ought now to have a pension of 17/-.  We have not gone any way towards meeting the increased cost.  Of course, the Minister will tell us that certain vouchers have been given in urban areas and, within recent months, some people have been given an increase of 2/6 per week.  If we take the money given in the form of vouchers all the year round, I think it will be found it would amount to an average of 3/- a week, taking turf, butter, bread and other things into consideration.  There is a difference in the amount old age pensioners have to pay for turf in the summer as compared with the winter.  Even that extra amount does not enable the old age pensioners to live in reasonable comfort.</P>
    <P>There is no use in having a sympathetic Minister unless he is prepared to translate his sympathy into something tangible.  He talks about taxation and the amount of money required in order to meet the suggestions contained in this motion.  He gave as certain figures last night which were quoted in the Press to-day.  He said old age pensions at present cost £3,900,000, and he said that the cost of bringing the age limit down to 65 years would be £1,700,000, making a total for old age pensioners of £5,500,000.  An increase of 1/- in the weekly pension, including the blind pension, would mean an additional £385,000 and a 5/- increase would mean £1,929,400.</P>
    <P>I think I would be right in telling the Minister that there would be no <Col N="2296" /> hesitation on the part of any member of the House, if the whips were taken off in all Parties to vote the taxation that would enable us to give at least 5/- per week extra to these pensioners. I am prepared to admit that the figures quoted by the Minister last night are huge and it might not be an easy job to find the money at the present time.  But I am also convinced that our taxation and finances could be adjusted to such an extent that eventually that could be done.</P>
    <P>The Minister asked the inevitable question: &ldquo;Where is the money to come from?&rdquo;  He talked about the extra £7,000,000 or £8,000,000 being provided for the Army during the emergency. The exact amount we were asked to provide in the Estimate this year was £8,825,284.  There is also another service which we will have only during the period of the war, and that is the Department of Supplies.  That Department is costing this country at the present moment £4,126,124.  If you add those two sums together you get a total of £12,951,408.  I am not saying that all that money is or will be available, because we will have to leave something for the Army.  As far as I remember, before the war the Army was costing us something in the neighbourhood of £1,500,000&mdash;that figure is probably on the high side.  We would have there £11,451,408, and I am perfectly satisfied that there is not a citizen in this State who would hesitate to continue to pay a large amount of that taxation in order to bring comfort to our old men and women who have done their best in the interests of this country all their lives.  If it were an open vote, there is not one man in any Party in this House who would hesitate to vote that extra taxation.</P>
    <P>We did not hear the usual demur about this £50,000,000 that the country is paying at the present time.  People may say that that is because of the existence of danger, that it is because of the emergency.  I do not believe anything of the kind.  At the beginning of a taxation year, when new taxes are imposed, we hear a certain amount of grumbling, but as the year goes on <Col N="2297" /> we find that that ceases and the people go on paying.  The same would happen if the Minister took his courage in his hands and put on something over £1,000,000 in the next Budget.  I hope and believe that, when he is introducing his Budget next year, conditions will be such that he will be able to reduce taxation, and, as I said before, if he retained some of that taxation in order to provide what we are asking for in this motion, I do not believe anybody in the country would demur.</P>

      <P>I have already stated that I think there would be no hesitation about voting the amount necessary to provide at least an extra 5/- per week.  I do not think there is anything unreasonable about that.  My Party and myself understand that it might be unreasonable to expect the whole of this large expenditure to be incurred right away.  As I said before, the Minister is sympathetic, and everybody has been praising him because of his sympathy.  But what is the use of that sympathy to the unfortunate people in the country who are living from hand to mouth?</P>

      <P>It is very little use.  We want that sympathy in a practical form.  The Minister last night told us that the same means test was in operation in England.  I am not suggesting for a moment that the Minister was telling an untruth, but the facts are not as he stated.  There is, to some extent, a means test in Great Britain. Here, if a person has anything over 6/- per week, his pension will be cut. In Britain his pension is not cut unless he has over 10/- a week.  In Britain, since the emergency, a supplementary old age pension has been given.  It came into operation on 3rd August, 1940.  That supplementary pension is paid on proof of need.  There is not the degrading means test that we have in this country, and those supplementary pensions may run as high as 20/- a week.</P>

      <P>Their statements are taken.  Here you have the pensions officer going into the house and, if you have two hens, so much is put down for that; if you have a goat, so much is put down for that.  That is the real position.  Some of the information submitted to pensions committees by pensions officers is absolutely ridiculous. I know that myself, as chairman of a pensions committee.  A good deal has been said about the means test.  I suppose in a service of this kind there is bound to be some kind of a means test, but I suggest that the means test applied in this country is very drastic and very harsh.  I know two cases in my own town, cases of people who are members of Deputy Anthony's association, the Typographical Association. As Deputy Anthony has told us, there is a contribution paid by the members of that association in order that they might get superannuation benefit when they reach a certain age.  One man in my own town gets a superannuation benefit of 11/3 per week, and because of that fact he gets only 3/- old age pension.  I agree with Deputy Anthony when he says: here is a man, a good citizen, who tries to make provision for his old age.  He is not permitted to have an old age pension in excess of 3/- per week.  But the waster, the man who may have been supported by the State in jail, the man who has been running in and out of the county home, gets the full pension allowed by law.  I know another case of a man belonging to the same organisation. He was an old I.R.A. man, and had been a long time looking for his I.R.A. pension.  The moment he got it, his old age pension was taken away from him. Surely the Minister, who has gone through the fight, will admit that that is no treatment for a soldier of Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were certain naval reservists in my constituency who had been in <Col N="2299" /> receipt of a small pension from the British Government.  The British Government increased this pension by 3/- within recent months.  Immediately they got that 3/-, the pensions officer came along and reduced their old age pensions by the same amount.  Surely that is going a little too far?  We know also that up to recently the railway companies paid 16/- a week to their employees until they reached the age of 70.  The moment they came to the age of 70, 10/- was taken off because the men concerned received 10/- old age pension. I should like the Minister now to give some sort of assurance that the Government will show some sympathy in this matter.  Lip sympathy is the cheapest thing in the world, but it is of very little use to the people on whose behalf this motion is tabled.</P>
    <P>Regarding the extra 2/6, in answer <Col N="2300" /> to a Question submitted by Deputy Davin last week, it was stated that only one-sixth of the old age pensioners are getting any advantage from that half-crown.  The reason is that, thank God, we have good, decent, proud, old citizens who refuse to allow themselves to be humiliated, to go through the medium of the relieving officer, in order to get the extra half-crown.  All these people have undergone a rigorous means test to enable them to get the 10/-.  Why should there be a second test, with the relieving officer coming down to the house and examining practically everything in the house?  It must have been obvious to the Minister and the Government that that half-crown was necessary&mdash;and considerably more&mdash;and it should have been given automatically to everyone in receipt of the 10/-.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see that the Minister has justified his attitude on these amendments.  I do not wish to repeat what has been already said, but to quote the Minister's own words we must provide against all future contingencies. I suggest that the Minister is not doing that.  The Minister will insist on the matter of his intentions, but unless he is going to put another schedule to the Bill, and have all his intentions as expressed in the Official Report added to the Bill in the additional schedule, I do not see that his intentions will have any legal weight whatsoever.  I am not suggesting for a moment that the present Minister or the chairman he appoints would set out to do anything which the Minister does not intend to do, but surely the Minister must envisage a future Minister who might not have the same intention?  The Minister has several times on other sections introduced this question of his intentions, but what I am trying to establish is that the Minister's intentions are not legally binding on any future Minister or any future chairman. I cannot see that the sub-sections suggested in these amendments do in fact hinder in any way the satisfactory working of the board.  They are only proposed as a proviso against the same sort of thing as the Minister envisages. It is no more a slight on the chairman to say that he might sabotage the board than it would be a slight on the stockholders' directors to say that they might sabotage the board.  If the one is to be safeguarded against, why not the other?  There is no great question of principle involved, but it seems to me that what is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I considered what I thought might be the only substantial point in the amendment, namely that under the Companies Acts two directors might cause a meeting to be summoned, whereas the Deputy's amendment would require that it should be held.  After all, it seems to me that you could not possibly provide <Col N="2303" /> in legislation that a meeting which has been summoned must be held.  It seems to me that the law can only go so far as to require that the meeting should be summoned if two directors require it.  If you wish further to provide that the meeting must be held, I think you would also have to provide for penalties in the event of its not being held.  Then you would have to safeguard against all possible contingencies that might make it impossible to hold the meeting.  I do not suppose that there is any likelihood of the holding of a meeting being prevented by war, riot or civil commotion, but if you were to provide that the meeting must be held, you must also provide, as I say, for all possible contingencies that might prevent its being held.  I take it that that is the reason why the Companies Act of 1845 limits the requirement to the summoning of the meeting if two members of the board require it.</P>

      <P>There are provisions in the Companies Act for all that sort of thing.  All that would happen would be that the chairman would come along at some time.  It has to be remembered that no decision can be taken at the meeting without the concurrence of the chairman, as provided for in sub-section (5), but if any two directors consider it necessary that a meeting should be held and give a written request to that effect, the chairman should not be allowed to stop these <Col N="2304" /> people having a meeting called and held, by staying away.  If the meeting is properly called, there will be results with regard to the board's business. The amendment would in any event mean that the chairman should not be allowed to sabotage a meeting which two directors think should be held.  It does not interrupt his power in any way.  Without his concurrence decisions cannot be taken.  The Minister says he will go there; then this will be no embarrassment.</P>

      <P>These amendments have to be taken together.  Sub-section (4) allows the chairman to prevent a board meeting being held by staying away but this amendment would not prevent the board meeting being held if the chairman stayed away.

At least the board members are put in the position in which they can say: &ldquo;We can get a meeting summoned and get something discussed.&rdquo;  That will be recorded in the minutes and it will be there.  That really cannot embarrass any chairman, particularly any chairman who is going to carry out the duties of the office in the way in which the Minister thinks he would.  It is only for use against a man who wants to prevent something being disclosed. He can prevent that, under the Minister's scheme, by staying away.

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 59, standing in my name and that of Deputy Hughes:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), line 19, after the word &ldquo;term&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;not exceeding five years&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am moving this amendment so that whatever chairman may be appointed will not be appointed for an indefinite period.  As the Bill stands, there is no limit to the term for which a chairman of the company may be appointed, and we are merely endeavouring to fix five years as a suitable term.  I do not know what the Minister's opinion would be about that particular period of time, but I think that it would be undesirable that a chairman can be appointed for an indefinite period and, as the Bill stands, that would appear to be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that in any circumstances it would be the desire of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, whoever he might be, to make this contract for a short period.  Nobody likes to tie himself up for any protracted period in such a case, but I want Deputies to consider the practical difficulties that may arise in this connection.  In order to be able to appreciate the position, we must have regard, not only to present circumstances, or to the circumstances that may exist when the company first <Col N="2309" /> starts to operate: we must also have regard to the fact that at some stage in the future a Minister for Industry and Commerce will be faced with the task of appointing a chairman.</P>
      <P>Now, let us consider that fact, apart from the circumstances connected with the appointment of the present chairman. In order to get a person with sufficient experience and competence to fill such a position properly, the Minister for Industry and Commerce would have to seek such a chairman amongst persons who would be at the moment engaged in business activities and who, probably, would be so involved in these business activities that they could not just leave their present occupations for the purpose of taking a post of this kind for five years, in the expectation that they could go back again to their own business without experiencing any inconvenience or loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies can easily understand, this difficulty has probably arisen in the past, where the Government, in making appointments of this kind, found it very hard to get a person who would be available for such a position and who was in occupation of a position on which he was not entirely dependent for his livelihood, and whose services could be availed of for a short period.  Take the case of a person engaged in a business that is so profitable that he will not willingly break his business connections or professional engagements in order to accept such a position as this, unless he is assured of reasonable continuity or a long-term position in his new employment. He might be the most eligible man, but he is not willing to break his business or professional connections unless he is assured of continuity in the new employment.  It is for that reason that no period is stated in the Bill.  I think that we can rely on the fact that whatever Government may be in power, just like anybody else in business, will naturally be disposed to make the contract for a short period, because they can mend their hand if the occasion should arise for doing so; but if, in fact, the necessity should arise for the consideration of such a matter, they may have to discuss the terms with the person concerned, and <Col N="2310" /> make arrangements with him as to what his professional engagements are, with a view to enabling him to undertake this position.  For that reason, I think it would be undesirable to put in a period of five years here, because I think it is very unlikely that any future Government would be able to get the best possible person for this position if that limitation were to be imposed in the Statute.</P>

      <P>There is an amendment down in the names of Deputies Norton and Larkin proposing that a copy of the conditions of appointment fixed be placed on the Table of the House.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The term of office will depend on a variety of circumstances: (1), the exact number of years for which the appointment is to be made; (2), what salary is going to be paid; (3), whether there is any condition going to be attached with regard to pension or other matters, and there is of course the suggestion in the measure that if the board do not give the chairman a salary sufficient in the eyes of the Minister, the Minister can get that increased.</P>

You start off then by saying to the board: &ldquo;You can fix any salary you like, but if you do not make it big enough we will make it big enough.&rdquo;  Surely, the Minister has in mind the salary that he thinks would be an attractive one, and the House ought to know it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly it does not exist because, in order to cut down the chairman, supposing there was some trouble, it would mean that the shareholders would have to deprive pretty nearly all the directors of salary. If, say, the shareholders were to fix £5,000 as the salary for all the directors, and if that had to be divided in accordance with the decision of the board, that would mean the decision of the chairman.</P>

If you add together Section 35 and 36 how is the board going to divide it except by some decision which will be the decision of the board, and it cannot be a decision of the board unless the <Col N="2312" /> chairman concurs: Therefore, the chairman can prevent the board giving a decision that is not his own.  He can eventually call a meeting of the board and can appoint himself at whatever sum is the maximum which the shareholders had fixed for all the directors.

      <P>That is all as against the circumstance where the board may decide to cut down salaries because of their dissatisfaction with the chairman.  In such circumstances, the Minister can come in and say that they must give him so much.  That means that the Minister must have some figure in his mind as the salary appropriate for the post.  I am sure that he must be thinking in terms of a particular individual, and of the salary of that individual in relation to a certain term of office and such things as he would describe as ideal conditions governing pension or other rights as well as a variety of other things in connection with that individual.  Is it not a fact that, under another section, a person who may become chairman of this board will be compensated for past activities in connection with transport?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not considered that.  It is not proposed to put on the Government now the obligation of determining the salary of the chairman. It is proposed to leave the remuneration to the board, with the safeguard that I have mentioned, that in the event of the board deciding that the chairman will get nothing, the Minister can intervene to see that he gets what everybody would regard as reasonable remuneration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the issue that arises on the amendment which proposes to put a statutory limitation upon the chairman's term of office, I am suggesting that that limitation should not be there.  I should say that if that limit-action were there, you could quite easily see a situation developing in which the Government would feel itself definitely constrained to appoint, say, a civil servant or some other person who would know that if he had to be got rid of he could revert to other employment at the end of his term of office.  That situation has arisen in connection with other boards.  Members of the Civil Service, when appointed to serve on boards, are nominated by the Government with the knowledge that if a change is to be made they are secure in the sense that they can revert to their original employment.  If, however, you are to get business people, or others who are completely detached from the Civil Service, it may be necessary on occasion to give them the security of a contract for a period of years.  That is why I suggest that this question should be left for settlement <Col N="2314" /> in relation to the circumstances of the time.</P>
    <P>So far as the general question is concerned&mdash;the terms and conditions of appointment and so on&mdash;they cannot be stated in advance because they will very largely depend on the outcome of negotiations with individuals. The existing chairman of the Great Southern Railways Company is remunerated with £2,500 a year.  That salary was fixed by the Government under an Emergency Powers Order. What the position will be next year, or in any future year, will depend entirely upon the situation then existing, on the individual concerned and on the agreement that the Government of the time is prepared to make with any individual. We could not attempt to forecast that now or to provide for it by legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that there are more reasons to be considered than those put forward by the Minister.  As has been pointed out, the restrictions in the amendment could almost be completely overcome by the powers given to the Minister under sub-section (8).  There you could offer a suitable inducement to any person sufficiently competent for the position if he were hesitating to accept so short a term of employment as five years.  There is sufficient liberty provided there to enable a suitable person to be obtained for the position by agreement.  In this whole section, no machinery is set down by which to ensure that the chairman will give effect to public policy as settled by the Minister and the Government from time to time.  In the terms of his appointment, I suppose the Minister will make due provision in regard to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The ultimate power is the right to remove the chairman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I was coming to that As the section stands, the only way the Minister can prevent the chairman from pursuing a policy contrary to public <Col N="2315" /> policy, or to force him to give effect to public policy, is by utilising his power to remove him for stated reasons.  That is like trying to kill a fly with a sledgehammer.  Points of difference might arise which would be of some importance but which would not justify the removal of the chairman. Unless the conditions of employment are amplified, that position may arise.  If we have a chairman appointed for a long period or if his tenure of office is determined by his ability to make a good bargain, we may have a position in which, though not open to removal by the Minister, the chairman is, nevertheless, unsatisfactory. There is the other factor, that in this Bill there are embodied certain political viewpoints which have been categorically stated by the Minister and stood over by the Government Party.  Suppose a man is appointed o the chairmanship for 20 years.  Undoubtedly, he would be appointed because his views would be, at least, so sympathetic to the transport policy of the Government that he would carry out that policy.  A change of Government comes.  Then you have the question of removing that man&mdash;again, by order of the Minister and for stated reasons.  It is not always easy to give &ldquo;stated reasons&rdquo; in the case of a man who is technically competent but whose policy in regard to transport might not harmonise with that of a new Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment in Deputy Cosgrave's name meets many of the objections to this section and, at the same time, it does not bind the Minister in such a way that it would be impossible for him to find a suitable man.  Many of the persons who would be technically competent for a position such as this are mainly interested in either commerce or industry.  They have financial interests in various companies and they are not in the same position as a technical man&mdash;such as an engineer or architect&mdash;who is completely dependent on his professional status.  I do not think that the Minister will experience the difficulty he seems to envisage in obtaining a person with the necessary competency, either technical or from the point of view of experience, to take <Col N="2316" /> up this position, because most of those persons will have such liberty of action that, if they do feel inclined to accept the responsibility, they will not be handicapped by personal loss.</P>

There is nothing to prevent the Minister, if still in office, re-appointing the chairman and, whether the five year limit be in or out, there is nothing to prevent him from removing the chairman.  Deputy Larkin contemplated a difficulty regarding the &ldquo;stated reasons&rdquo;.  The Government of the period may decide that the policy a chairman is carrying out is contrary to their view and. therefore, there should not be any difficulty in securing reasons sufficient to justify them in removing him.</P>

      <P>To delete sub-section (8).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2317" /> The sub-section authorises the Minister to increase the remuneration of the chairman whenever he thinks fit to do so, without reference to this House. The Minister states that the chairman's part-time salary was fixed by the Government, by Emergency Order, at £2,500 a year.  It is understood that the chairman has an income from another part-time job of £2,500 a year. It is desirable that the Minister should say, if he is in a position to do so, whether, if he appoints the present chairman or any other person in his stead, it is proposed to pay him a salary of not less than £5,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention is that the remuneration of the chairman shall be fixed by the board and not by the Minister.  This sub-section is inserted merely as a safeguard against a possible contingency in which the board might refuse to remunerate the chairman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am assuming that the majority of the members of this House would be foolish enough to give these dictatorial powers that are given in Section 35 to the chairman to fix the salary at any figure he likes, subject to the Minister.  That is a nice state of affairs.  It is desirable that we should know what the Minister is going to do in this matter.  It is an extraordinary power to allow the chairman to fix his own salary at whatever figure he likes, subject to the approval of the Minister. I assume, in view of his present position, that he might regard it as reasonable and right that he should demand, possibly for himself, with the consent of the Minister, a figure not less than £5,000 yearly.  Practically every person working under the supervision of this <Col N="2318" /> lucky chairman, if he gets £5,000 yearly or more, will be compelled to go before a tribunal, which was set up by the Minister, or their unions will have to do so, to show that they are entitled to an increase in salary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I know responsible officials of the company working under the chairman; who since he came into office on February 24th, 1942, have not got a brass farthing of an increase, except what came to some of them as a result of the Wages Tribunal.  So far as ordinary increments are concerned, which would normally come to that class of officials, they have been standing still since February 24th, 1942.  The Minister is obliged, apparently only in the case of a new demand, to come back to the House to ask for permission to increase the salary, if he thinks the chairman or the chairman-dictator is not getting a sufficient salary, or is not being treated fairly and properly by the board.  The Minister should give some indication to the House of what he is thinking about the salary proposed to be paid to this lucky person.  As the Minister knows, this group of Deputies is not opposed to the payment of fair salaries to responsible people.  I am not sure if I express the opinion of my colleagues in this matter, but I believe that no person of this type, in a full-time salaried office, should have a higher salary than the head of the Government.</P>

      <P>There is no reference as to whether the chairman is debarred in any way from having a financial interest in companies that might be directly interested in the traffic of the transport company.

      <P>I grant that.  The old Great Southern Railways Company by various devices got round their legal obligations and, I think, in a number of cases broke them.  Prior to the Rates Order of last year there were, I understand, something like 200,000 special rates in existence.  Most of them have since been abolished.

      <P>The point raised by Deputy Larkin is worthy of serious consideration.  I think the Minister should look into the matter and see that the new concern is properly safeguarded from the day of its coming into operation.  The Minister knows perfectly well that after the date of the coming into operation of this organisation, it will be supposed to be, as the Great Southern Railways are now supposed to be, in competition with the Grand Canal Company, and I think that what has helped to bring this whole concern into a state of semi-bankruptcy is the position which the directors have been allowed to occupy in competing companies.  We had directors of the Great Southern Railways directors of the Grand Canal Company, the Dublin United Transport <Col N="2322" /> Company and the Dublin Gas Company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will tell the Minister. At a particular time, the company wanted to modernise, so far as they could, certain railway stations in Dublin.  A proposal was put up to put electric light into all the offices and buildings, but, through the intervention of a director who is a director of the Gas Company, such a scheme has not even yet come into operation, with the result that, at Westland Row and Dun Laoghaire stations, there is tonight gas, electricity and petrol lighting in different parts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

      <P>Agreed, but there are also certain powers in this Bill.  Let us take it that the chairman is a share holder in a concern which contracts to supply materials.  A member of a local body is debarred from having a financial interest in any contract, and is immediately removed, if he has any such interest.  Here is a concern, with possibly a capital of £20,000,000, of which the chairman, apparently, can have a very large financial interest in a firm which contracts to supply materials, such as oil and timber.</P>

It means that there must be reasons which are capable of being stated.  It does not mean anything more than that?  The reason can be anything?  Ordinarily speaking, the constitutional phrase &ldquo;stated reasons&rdquo; means misbehaviour or incapacity, and, in the case of the Electricity Supply Board, if the interests of electrical development require it, but this is wide and open.  It can be on any ground whatever.  The only point is that the Minister must say what the reason is.  He can say the reason is that he does not like him.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 63:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (3).</P>
      <P>We feel that there is a principle embodied in this sub-section which calls for attention and which gives rise to a whole number of queries.  It is proposed in the sub-section that the remuneration of the managing director shall from time to time be fixed by the board, and may be by way of fixed salary or commission on dividends, profits or turnover of the company. The point I see in the sub-section is one which seems to run through many sections, that is, a conflict between the interest the public must undoubtedly have in the company, as citizens, taxpayers and users of the transport facilities and the commercial interests of the body whom we are proposing to make the eventual owners of the concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A question was raised yesterday in regard to the limitation on the dividend on ordinary stock.  Now we have another door opened, namely, that we can have a managing director appointed whose remuneration may be a fixed salary, commission on dividends or share in profits, or a combination of all three.  We are then faced with the position that the main functional individual so far as the running of the company is concerned is a person who has a direct and personal incentive to see that the profits and earnings of the company are as high as possible.  In the case of the chairman, the whole basis of the Minister's argument in favour of the peculiar conditions which <Col N="2326" /> he has introduced into the Bill in relation to the position of chairman has been to guarantee the public interest in the company.  Now we have the opposite facet, namely, the introduction of an individual whose main concern would be the actual day-to-day running of the enterprise and who may be put in the position of having as his main interest, not the welfare of the public but his own personal advancement and aggrandisement, in so far as his total remuneration may be dependent almost completely on how high he can drive the profits and dividends of the company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's amendment is to delete the sub-section.  I take it that his purpose is not to prevent the managing director being paid at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is the other point to which I am coming.  This is the main point.  The other is more peculiar and arises out of the whole constitution of this board.  Here we have a board constituted of the chairman and several directors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For all practical purposes, so far as we feel anyway, the chairman is the board and the directors will not count for very much.  It is actually possible under this scheme that the chairman could also be the managing director.  It could also happen that his remuneration would be made up of a fixed salary or commission on dividends or solely by commission on dividends.  We then have a direct conflict between his interest as chairman, representing the public interest in the company, and his position as managing director with a direct, individual, personal interest in the profit-earning capacity of the company. I submit from that point of view that this sub-section will need redrafting. Nobody is quarrelling with the suggestion that the company will need a managing director in order to carry on the every-day business of the company and that he should be paid. But surely there should be other provisions which will obviate and make impossible the appointment of a man to the position where his duty to the public, to the taxpayer, will be in direct conflict with his own personal <Col N="2327" /> interests in so far as his remuneration is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As to the form of the section, I should explain it is taken word for word from a standard work on company procedure.  My own view is that the managing director, if there is a managing director, should be remunerated by way of fixed salary. If the Deputy's objection is to the addition of the words &ldquo;or commission on dividends&rdquo;, etc., I am quite prepared to delete them.  I cannot contemplate circumstances in which the managing director of the company will be remunerated otherwise than on the basis of a fixed salary.  In order to explain the introduction of the words, I am saying that the Parliamentary draftsman copied them word for word from the form used in a standard work.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This section empowers the company to have a managing director. Now, I think it is extremely improbable that the appointment of that man would be made from amongst the shareholders' directors except in the case of a person in relation to whom a contract had been entered into and who would as part of the contract be made a director of the company, because the contract would be between the individual and the company, as it is the company who appoints the managing director.  At present the constitution of the company is a board and a general manager.  There was a time when they did not even have a general manager, as Deputy Davin will remember, and the whole board used to act as general manager&mdash;a most impossible situation which I had to terminate by threatening various penalties if the board did not appoint a general manager.  They have a general manager now.  Perhaps that arrangement will be regarded as ordinarily suitable. But we do empower the company to have a managing director.  Clearly a managing director is a manager and he is also a director and, therefore, it is a necessary provision that the managing director must be a member of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That does not involve that some person elected as a stockholders' director must be chosen.  It does mean that the person chosen as managing director must be elected a stockholders' <Col N="2329" /> director by the company, if the contract between the company and the individual is to be carried out.  As to the amendment, I am prepared to amend sub-section (3), if the amendment is withdrawn, to provide that the remuneration will be by way of fixed salary.</P>

Why we feel this particular sub-section should be deleted is because it contrasts with provisions which will come up for consideration later in regard to the ordinary staffs of the railway or the transport undertaking.  We see no reason why the directors should be so privileged that not only are they to be compensated in the ordinary form for the loss of their positions, but they will have double compensation because they have been lucky enough to have the double directorship.</P>

      <P>Here we have a very great contrast between what is provided for the director who may resign and the ordinary workers who may not get an opportunity of resigning, but who may be pushed out.  There is the issue involved that these directors may be attached to either company or both companies.  In the case of the railway company the comments that have been passed on the directors by the Minister are a sufficient justification for suggesting that they should be asked to resign even before the new company is set up. It is doubtful if they should receive compensation&mdash;some of them&mdash;for the services they have given to the railway company.  So far as the transport company is concerned, I gather from the Minister that there is only one person to whom any credit is due for the sound position&mdash;as he holds it&mdash;of that company.  It must appear, therefore, that the other directors have not contributed very much beyond their membership of the board of directors.</P>
      <P>Why should we undertake, therefore, to compensate people for the positions they have held and in which, manifestly, in the case of the railway, they have given no great service, while in the case of the transport company they could not give much service because all of it is being attributed to the managing director?  I fail to see the justification of the section.  I think it is very generous that if a director, holding a double directorship, should resign, his compensation should be confined to one directorship.</P>

      <P>I do not suppose it would be possible to get the Dáil to consider a matter of this kind impartially. There are special circumstances affecting the enactment of this Bill that would make it almost impossible for any Deputy to discuss the proposals contained in it without being prejudiced, and most certainly prejudiced against the directors.  One <Col N="2334" /> proposal is that the directors of the existing companies which are being amalgamated will become the first directors in the new company. Deputies have spoken in disparaging terms of the directors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister is proposing is that if they resign before the new company comes into existence we will compensate them.  I think that is a wise provision.  It may be that some of the directors will prefer to resign and take the compensation provided in the Bill.  I am prepared to defend that position on its merits.  In the case of a member of the staff who loses his employment because of the amalgamation, we are proposing compensation by way of a pension.  I am proposing that in the case of a person suffering a direct pecuniary loss by reason of the amalgamation, compensation will be paid.  I do not see why you should preclude the directors from some similar provision.</P>
      <P>We are limiting the compensation here.  Having regard to past precedents, we are not being particularly generous.  The various railway companies in this country were amalgamated in 1924 and, although there was no standard practice in the matter of compensating redundant directors, they were compensated on a more generous basis than is proposed here. In some cases is was four times the annual fees contemplated here.  In other cases the amounts of compensation were not prescribed, but I would say that in all cases the terms were as generous, and even more generous, than what is being provided here.</P>
      <P>I think there is a danger that we could be unfair because of certain prejudices we have in relation to these directors.  We should try to guard against that and it would be wrong for me not to resist these attempts to alter the proposal here.  There will be a pecuniary loss and we propose to meet that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the railway directors previous to the 1924 Act, so far as I am aware, except by decisions of the out-going boards of the companies that were amalgamated, there was no specific provision like this made in the legislation at that particular period&mdash;either in 1924 or in 1933.  At any rate, we are objecting to the very definite way in which the Minister proposes to provide compensation for directors who may retire after the coming into operation of this scheme.  Those directors will not have to go before any body to prove that they are entitled to compensation or that the company has no good reason for declining the payment of compensation. It is possible, as happened in previous cases, that hundreds of railway men can be dismissed, and that, under the peculiar wording of the compensation clauses as they now stand, those men will not be able to prove that they are entitled to compensation. You have here mysterious words like &ldquo;other economic cause.&rdquo;  The company can get the ablest lawyers in the <Col N="2336" /> land and they can go before an arbitrator and make a case, as they have made cases, to prove that certain men who became redundant or lost their employment are not entitled to compensation. You have the famous Kearns test case to prove that.  There is no such proof necessary in the case of retired directors of either the Dublin United Transport Company or the Great Southern Railways Company to entitle them to the payment of generous compensation.  I believe it is true to state that the one director who is lucky enough to be a director of the Great Southern Railways Company and of the Dublin United Transport Company will get double compensation under this particular section, notwithstanding the fact, and the Minister knows it quite well, that that particular director has a directorship of eight other companies&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>He will get no compensation at all unless he resigns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;including the chairmanship of two companies.  Is it seriously suggested that the compensation he is getting here under the terms of this section is not more generous than the compensation that will be paid to the ordinary workers who may have to prove their case?  If a railway worker who is dismissed from his employment as a result of the coming into operation of this scheme has no union or funds behind him to enable him to go before the arbitrator and to employ legal advice, where is he going to be?  We know the famous case that was fought before an arbitrator at a particular period, which lasted ten days and which cost the organisation of which I happen to be a member a very large sum in order to satisfy the arbitrator that this particular man was entitled to compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What would be the position of that man if he were not a member of that organisation and had not the funds of the organisation behind him in order to establish his case?  A director is placed in a different position altogether. He is guaranteed the payment of very generous compensation, whereas you have all those obstacles placed in the way of the payment of <Col N="2337" /> compensation to any workers who are dismissed.  That may happen after this Bill comes into operation in the same way as it happened in previous cases under the 1924 and 1933 Acts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards previous legislation, the position is that the Act did not contain the provisions of the amalgamation scheme; it allowed the preparation of an amalgamation scheme, and included in the Act is a provision that those schemes might provide for the payment of compensation to a director who suffered loss or the abolition of his office by reason of the amalgamation.  In the Great Southern Railways (Absorption) (No. 4) Scheme, 1925, there is provision in relation to a number of railways mentioned there that the compensation of directors shall not exceed four times the average aggregate amount of all fees paid to such director in the three previous years.  I am not quoting that to justify the section but as an indication that, in so far as there is a precedent, the compensation was on more generous lines.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has already said that it is almost impossible to approach those clauses without being prejudiced; a great deal of the prejudice has been caused by the Minister himself.  There are two campaigns: one to discredit the whole railway system from the point of view of the management in order to make a better case for the present chairman; <Col N="2338" /> another is to put forward the case that the condition of the railways was not as bad as it was made out to be at one time.  That was in order to reinstate the railways, and make it appear that we were really buying something profitable for the country.</P>
      <P>On this matter of directors, I have no objection to the directors getting compensation, but I am very glad that the 1924 Act has been referred to, because there was afterwards a good deal of public recrimination as to the amount voted to the retired directors. When the amounts and the numerical strength of the individuals who got the sums of money were put down in contrast to the amount which was going to be saved, as it was called, by economies, I suggest that there was undoubtedly cause for a great deal of public comment of an adverse type on the 1924 Act.  The 1924 Act had this provision, that it allowed schemes to be drawn up, and before those schemes were passed they had to be put before the shareholders and the debenture holders in the various companies. It was thought that that would be a safeguard; that there would be no great, so to speak, slashing out of compensation.  The Minister, in what he has read, has not referred to one proviso which I think we find there, and that is, that in the case of any director who became a standing member of the Railway Tribunal, which was a salaried post, his remuneration as such was taken into consideration when declaring the terms of his compensation. I do not know if that system will operate here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, certainly.  I made a remark concerning the directors of this company which was intended to be jocose.  In fact, I think there are some members of those boards who, apart altogether from personal merit, would, because of their experience, be valuable members of any board that we might appoint to direct the affairs of the new company.  I think experience is an important qualification in matters of that kind.  The point that I really wanted to bring out was this, that no compensation is payable at all except to a director who ceases to be such on 7th April next.  I cannot, <Col N="2339" /> therefore, attempt to estimate what the amount of compensation payable will be, because it will depend upon the extent to which directors may decide to avail of the provisions of the section or alternatively to continue as directors of the new company for the period during which they are eligible so to continue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot even attempt to say that.  Both companies have a principle of remunerating directors out of a fund which is voted by the shareholders and allocated by the directors amongst themselves, sometimes according to the functions which individual directors perform.  Some directors perform more duties than others, and the distribution of the fund amongst them may be influenced by that fact.  I cannot attempt to answer that question without some research.  I could get the figures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount voted by the Great Southern Railways Company for directors' fees, inclusive of the chairman, last year was £5,538. Deducting the chairman from that, the maximum amount payable to the directors of the Great Southern Railways Company last year would have been £3,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  In 1941 the amount was £6,966.  If we go back to the year after the amalgamation, it was £12,206.  The tendency has been downwards all the time.  The compensation is reasonable in the circumstances in which we are compulsorily amalgamating these two companies.  I think we should try to disregard our knowledge of the individuals concerned and the <Col N="2340" /> financial circumstances of those individuals. Whatever we do here may be a precedent in similar cases in future, and we should not establish a wrong precedent.  In determining the terms of compensation in this case, I think we should be blind to our knowledge of the individuals.</P>

      <P>The Minister should accept the amendment, if he intends to keep the balance in the administration. We will deal later with the question of compensation for workers, but we know in advance from previous experience the difficulty men have in proving their rights to compensation. Here the directors are not put under any test whatsoever: they are to get compensation and there is no question of a test.  The Minister is proposing to give compensation in certain instances to workers.  If the directors were put through the hoops to anything like the same extent as the workers, they would not be getting this rate of compensation.  As if that were not good enough, it is proposed to give the directors dual compensation, although they have not been eulogised <Col N="2341" /> to any great extent by the Minister and although they have not contributed very much to the advancement of the transport industry in this country. There is a vast difference between the treatment being meted out to the worker and the treatment of the directors. The Minister would be wise to accept the amendment and to drop the payment of dual compensation.  If there is to be dual compensation, there should be a test of a similar character as that imposed on the workers.</P>

      <P>When referring to compensation provisions, the Minister omitted one factor&mdash;that these directors are already shareholders of the companies to be dissolved.  I do not think the Minister will answer by saying that the provisions under which their interests are going to be transferred to the new company are not generous.  At least, that cannot be said about them.  The Minister has argued very thoroughly as to why they should be generous.  As regards the question of not considering them as individuals, I am not prejudiced against the individuals.  I have a prejudice against directors of all companies, from the point of view of the services they give for the money they receive.  It would be very interesting for the Minister to bring in, in justification of the section, a statement showing the number of hours these directors actually serve or give in the business of the companies during any one period.</P>

      <P>I know the Minister thinks the work of a director is something peculiar and extraordinary.  If a director is to give any service, at least he must attend at the directors' office.  How many of these individuals draw fees and do not attend at all?  If we are going to give this compensation. I take it, first of all, that it is because of the monetary loss they are suffering. That, to a great, extent should be balanced by the terms which they will enjoy as shareholders.  If, on the other hand, the compensation is to be <Col N="2342" /> in recognition of their services or experience in other companies, at least we should have some indication of the services they have given.  The Minister has placed against my attitude, when I referred to his attitude towards the ordinary working staff, the amendments he has put in.  The compensation he suggests in the amendments only refers to the case of a worker transferred to the new company, with the old position still existing in the case of the worker whose position is wiped out as a result of the amalgamation.</P>

      <P>It is different to what is set down below that.  The whole point is that we are dealing with two groups of persons.  One group will continue to be servants, officers or employees of the company only so long as they give continuous service to the company and are subject to a fairly rigid test, as Deputy Keyes pointed out.  This body of workers over a period has made very large financial sacrifices to keep this railway company going.  On the other hand, we have the group of directors who, in the first place, are generously treated in the capacity of shareholders and, secondly, who undoubtedly have been getting a far higher proportionate return for the services they gave to these companies, whatever they may be or over whatever number of hours in the year, than is given in relation to the actual working staff carrying on the railway.  Whatever may be in the Minister's argument about setting a bad precedent, we certainly feel that it is of far greater importance to keep the balance and not have the spirit expressed in this Bill that we are prepared to deal far more generously with <Col N="2343" /> the directors, merely because they are directors, than we are prepared to deal with the ordinary worker.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Leix Land Purchase.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>To-day I addressed a question to the Minister for Lands asking him &ldquo;if he is aware that a private individual took advantage of the curtailment of Land Commission operations to purchase a number of large estates in the County of Leix including Brockley Park, Stradbally, and to sub-divide and sell such estates at war prices to the detriment of uneconomic holders and landless men and if he will state what he proposes to do to deal with this departure from well-established national policy.&rdquo;  There were two questions asked there, (1) was he aware that an individual was <Col N="2345" /> frolicking about in this manner, and (2) what he proposed to do.  The Minister's reply was that &ldquo;the Land Commission have no power or intention to prevent private sales of land by the owners.  Such sales do not prevent the possible exercise in future of the powers to acquire lands for division accorded to the Land Commission under the Land Acts.  At present the exercise of these powers is necessarily limited by the existing emergency conditions.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That answer, I think, in the opinion of everybody was a miserable evasion of the question asked.  The Minister was asked was he aware that a number of very large estates in a certain county had been purchased by one wealthy individual and the second question was what he proposed to do to deal with that situation.  Neither one nor the other has been answered. The fact of the matter is that a fabulously wealthy man who has made enormous sums of money at the expense of the people of this country through the tariff régime, monopolies and quotas, is using these vast sums of money to take bread out of the mouths of poor and humble Irish people. Surely there is a time, the Minister will agree, when such financiers and speculators should be satisfied with the immense fortunes made without utilising these fortunes to do irreparable damage to unfortunate, obscure people down the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says that there is nothing to prevent the Land Commission eventually functioning and rectifying the wanton damage that he is allowing to be done at the moment. That answer must have been given without any serious attention to the situation, as it exists.  These vast ranches are being bought up by an individual while the Land Commission is inactive.  The mansions are torn down and sold to the highest bidder. The timber is cut and sold.  The land is sub-divided into 50-acre holdings and sold by public auction to the highest bidder, to the wealthiest man who wants land, so that the Land Commission, when it wakes from its slumber, will be presented with a situation in which there is not an estate of 500 or 1,000 <Col N="2346" /> acres but in which there are so many farms of 40 acres or 50 acres.  Will anybody consider it reasonable that the Land Commission should weigh in on a 40-acre farm and dispossess the owner with a view to sub-division?  The situation will have been completely changed as a result of the triumphal march of the profiteers up and down the land, and the big estates that would be all legitimate marks for attention by the Land Commission will have been converted into small, compact holdings.</P>
    <P>Cromwell, in his march through this country, took bread out of the mouths of the people, dispossessed them and left the mansions of the land in ruins, either for loot or for vengeance.  The modern fashion is to do the same for profit.  It was suggested to the Minister by a deputation that there was no objection to the ordinary sale of land, that there was no objection to one man selling to another so that the other man might work that land and the original owner get out at a profit.  The objection was to the exploitation of, and speculation in, land; to wealthy men, not even belonging to our race, wading in with their wads and buying land over the heads of the people, not to work, not to hold, not to farm, but to make a further profit and leave black despair behind them amongst those who would be rightfully entitled to a share of this land if it were ever offered for sub-division.  It was suggested to the Minister that he should introduce an Emergency Order, not prohibiting the first sale of land, during the emergency, but prohibiting the subsequent sub-division and re-sale of that land for profit.  I do not believe that there is a Deputy on any side of the House who does not abhor what is going on in every county.</P>
    <P>In my own native county five of the largest estates have been bought up by one man, subdivided and sold at a profit, so that the uneconomic holders and landless men in the neighbourhood have no hope in the future, whatever hope they had in the past, of becoming either economic holders or farmers. The little town I come from, the place specially mentioned in the question&mdash; Stradbally&mdash;is bounded on three sides by demesne land&mdash;entailed land.  There <Col N="2347" /> was opportunity for expansion only in one direction and, in that direction a huge estate was privately bought by the financier in question and is about to be sub-divided and re-sold to the highest bidders.  Do Deputies think that, after five years of war prices and profits, the ordinary, uneconomic holder or landless man can compete in such a market?  Therefore, the only possible avenue for expansion is completely blocked under the benevolent eye of a home Government.  An Adjournment debate is necessarily brief and I want to allow the Minister ten minutes in which to reply, while affording colleagues an opportunity of representing the views of their constituents in this matter.  So I must end with that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that the question which Deputy O'Higgins has raised is one of the very greatest importance. It may be extraordinary but, in Stradbally, you have smallholders and landless man.  The smallholders are well prepared, financed and equipped to work land, but they are not getting an opportunity to obtain that land from the Land Commission. It appears that one financier, Davy Frame, has more influence with the Minister for Lands than all the five Laoighis-Offaly Deputies put together.  It is quite obvious that that is the point.  Four farms in County Laoighis have been grabbed up by this financier and the Land Commission has closed its eyes to the fact.  The Minister for Lands has stood aside, simply because this man is a financier.  Furthermore, I think he is a Scotsman. That Scotsman has come along into the County Laoighis and grabbed four farms, and five in Offaly.  I have placed this matter, time and again, before the Minister and the Land Commission.  The Minister said to-day that, when I was making an appointment for that deputation, I was principally concerned with the question of the dwelling.  I did put the question of the division of the lands up to the Minister and the Land Commission, although I was principally interested in the mansion on that farm.  I did not want to see it demolished, the <Col N="2348" /> slates and timber sold and the stones tumbled down.  I wanted, as well as that, to see that the smallholders in the area would get their portion of that estate to which I consider them entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has made no move good, bad or indifferent, since that deputation went before him, and I am of opinion that the Land Commission at present are useless.  All they are doing is collecting rates and putting up notices of sales of holdings.  They are doing nothing to put the plain people in a decent way of living and they are allowing financiers to grab up land to which the people are entitled.  At a meeting of Laoighis County Council, Councillor Boland proposed a resolution protesting against this action, and it was passed unanimously.  Deputy Gorry, another representative of the constituency, who was not, for some unknown reason, on the deputation, said at Laoighis County Council that he had a private letter from the Minister for Lands.  When challenged to produce the letter and read it to the County Council, he said he would not, that he would have to get the permission of the Minister for Lands to read his confidential letter.  I want to know what was in that letter to Deputy Gorry.  Deputy Gorry has refused five different appeals at Laoighis County Council to disclose the information conveyed to him by the Minister.  The letter Deputy Gorry got was, in my opinion, the same letter which was sent to Deputy O'Higgins, Deputy Davin and myself.  So far as this Deputy and the Minister were concerned and, probably, our Scotch friend, Davy Frame, there was something very strange so far as Brockley Park and other farms in Laoighis-Offaly were concerned.  If the Land Commission do not take steps to wipe out Davy Frame in Laoighis, we will do it.  We will kick him out. We will see that the downtrodden people of Laoighis-Offaly will get their God-given right to the land there, and that the Land Commission will not allow a grabber like this guy, who is living on the fat of the land, who has made thousands and thousands in speculation, with the approval of the Fianna Fáil Government, to deprive them of that right.  On another occasion <Col N="2349" /> I should be in better form for speaking on this subject.  When the Minister is replying, I hope he will indicate what was in that secret, private and confidential letter, the contents of which Deputy Gorry refused to disclose at Laoighis County Council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Local agitation for the acquisition and division of land was going on for a number of years previous to the emergency period, and previous to the suspension of Land Commission activities in connection with matters of that kind.  If the Land Commission had done its work in this case inside a reasonable time, and if it had acquired and divided these lands, the landless men in this particular area, and particularly the workers who are to lose their employment on this estate, would have been provided for long before the emergency period. The blame for the failure to do that, I admit, does not rest with the present Minister for Lands, but I was surprised to hear that the Minister, in reply to a Parliamentary Question to-day, said that the object of this deputation, of which I was a member, was to persuade the Minister to acquire the buildings for the purpose of a hospital, or some purpose of that kind.  That certainly was not the purpose on which I went to see the Minister, along with my colleagues and members of the Laoighis County Council, and representatives of the workers who were threatened with loss of their employment. The purpose of the deputation was to put an end to the activities of this man, which were threatening to put an end to the employment of those people and to go over the rights of the people.  The whole matter was gone into in a friendly way with the Minister on that occasion, and I do not think I am misrepresenting the Minister when I say that our representations were not turned down by him on that occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that there is considerable opposition in Laoighis and in North Tipperary, where the same gentleman is carrying on the same kind of activities, to this kind of thing being allowed to happen.  To put it bluntly, if this man, or the men behind him&mdash; because I think that there is a syndicate <Col N="2350" /> involved here&mdash;are to be allowed to pursue these activities, they are going to cut across the whole policy both of this Government and the previous Government in the matter of the acquisition and division of land.  I am putting it to the Minister that he can make use of his powers under the Emergency Powers Act to prevent this kind of operation being carried on any longer in the midland counties.  It is deeply resented in these areas, and if the Land Commission ever come to deal with the question of the division of these lands, they will find that the activities of this gentleman and of the people behind him have cut across the whole policy of the Land Commission.</P>

      <P>I did not interrupt Deputy Flanagan, and I do not usually interrupt, but he said that I refused to produce a private letter from the Minister.  I had no private letter from the Minister, but because this thing was made a political matter at the Laoighis County Council I had neither the time nor the opportunity to produce <Col N="2351" /> the communication that I did receive.  After the deputation came back, a meeting was held in Stradbally, and Deputy Boland and myself were accused of refusing to attend the meeting. The chairman of the county council would not allow a discussion on that matter, and rightly so, because he was not going to allow the Laoighis County Council to be turned into a platform for propaganda purposes and politics. As far as I am concerned, I am with Deputy O'Higgins in that I do not wish to see the land taken from the people.  I realised, just as every other Deputy concerned in the matter realised, that there was room in the midlands for an agricultural college, and that these lands would be suitable for such a college.  I also realised that the Emergency Powers Order was there, but unfortunately the suggestion that I made could not be availed of.  I do not want to take up time just now.  I am with my colleagues in so far as they seek to prevent these lands being apportioned out in small holdings for the benefit of people who have been buying lands for many years.</P>

As regards Deputy O'Higgins, I believe that he is genuinely interested in this matter, since it concerns his home area, and he knows the people concerned, and I do hope that in the near future it will be possible for the Government to amend the Emergency Powers Act, so as to be able to deal with lands of this kind and save them for the people.</P>

      <P>As long as the Laoighis Deputies want to take one another's scalps, I suppose that my own scalp is fairly safe.  I have a good deal of sympathy with the point of view of the Deputies who have spoken, in wishing for a resumption of the acquisition and division of lands by the Land Commission, and I am hoping that the Land Commission will be in a position shortly to resume activities in that regard; but under the present emergency situation it is not possible for the Land Commission to function in the normal way.  Deputy O'Higgins said that he was anxious to give me ten minutes in which to reply. Now, the case made by Deputies O'Higgins, Flanagan and Davin is really no case at all.  I have nothing to reply to, but I should like to clear up this question of the deputation, because I was not quite clear on the matter when I spoke during the afternoon, but I have a note here, and this is the note:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2353" />&ldquo;I met Deputy Flanagan at Leinster House and I understand that Deputies Davin and O'Higgins were in touch with my office here in regard to my seeing a deputation.  I pointed out to Deputy Flanagan that no useful purpose would be served by my seeing a deputation.  He was desirous, however, he informed me, of putting before me reasons why the house at Brockley Park should be preserved and, while I again pointed out to him the futility of a deputation which intended merely to discuss a matter of this sort, I told him that if the deputation had any points to make in regard to the artistic value or historical interest of the building, I should be prepared to hear them and, while the preservation of the building, even in this case, was not a matter for the Land Commission, I should be glad to make representations to the Government if any proof were adduced of the historic interest or artistic value.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I told him that, with regard to the acquisition of land, there was no use in my seeing a deputation, but he said he was desirous of putting before me reasons why the house at Brockley Park should be preserved.  While I again pointed out the futility of seeing a deputation to discuss a matter of that sort, I said that, if the deputation had any points to make in regard to the artistic value or historic associations of the building, I would be prepared to see them.  Even though that question was not a matter for the Land Commission, I would be glad to make representations to the Government, if any proof could be produced of the historical interest or artistic value of the building.

      <P>The lands were discussed at the meeting.  Now, I am surprised at Deputy O'Higgins.  In spite of Deputy Flanagan's allegation of my friendship with speculators and very rich men, I am not very friendly to speculators and I always distrust very rich men.  But Deputy O'Higgins has made a statement that might be considered cold-bloodedly and calmly by the Dáil: that is, that it is proposed to cut up this particular estate into 50-acre holdings, small compact holdings. I would like to know what the Dáil thinks about that.  Is there anything wrong about it?  If we had farmers in the country inclined to purchase, and capable of purchasing, 50 acres of land to work it as a farm, without aid or interference from the Land Commission, we would be much more sure of effective farm work being done.  Men who intend to stand on their own feet, and who are capable of doing so, are of far more value to the nation than men who have to be helped by any Department of State. If the only charge in regard to this particular matter is that the land is to be cut up into 50-acre holdings, that charge is not a very sound one.</P>

      <P>The Land Commission, if it is to be effective, must work on some definite and defined plan.  It must examine the land situation in any particular county where the need of its operations exists.  It cannot be concerned with the holdings that are sold in any particular county and which are only brought to its attention, immediately the sale is advertised, by any particular Deputy in this House. The Land Commission cannot take up estates simply because they are advertised for sale.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins's Party has time and again made it a criminal charge against the Fianna Fáil Government that they have done this thing, that they have tried to warn off the would-be purchasers of land by <Col N="2356" /> suggesting that the Land Commission should take immediate action by way of acquiring the land.  I think that is grossly unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of correction, I tried to make it very clear to the Minister that we stood for the right of the original holder to sell the land.  It was when the next purchaser proceeded to subdivide it and resell it for a profit, during the emergency, that we took exception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite logical.  A man owned land and had a right to sell it when, how and to whom he likes. The man who purchases is the owner. Surely, if the first man had a right to sell, the second has the right to sell to whom he likes and how he likes.  It seems to me perfectly clear.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that Government policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows very well what Government policy is.  He has criticised it often enough and he has criticised it for doing the very things he now advocates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;against this sale and purchase of land by private individuals to private individuals, I possibly would be able to find an answer, but no case has been made by any Deputy in regard to the matter. Like Deputy Gorry, I do wish we would at some time have a much longer and more prepared debate on the matter so that we might clear our minds definitely as to what the policy of the Land Commission is, and, if Deputies like, what it ought to be.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.45 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Friday, September 29th, 1944.</P>
