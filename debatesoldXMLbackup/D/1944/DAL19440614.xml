      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of my statement introducing the Estimate for the Department last night, I gave a brief review of certain current activities of the Department and intimated that I wished to speak further, although briefly, concerning the post-war planning activities proceeding in the Department.  I should like to make it clear that it is not my intention to discuss the general policy of the Government for the promotion of increased prosperity after the war, but to deal only with the responsibilities falling on the Department of Industry and Commerce in that connection.</P>
      <P>I should like also to emphasise that, in the Government's opinion, the preparation of post-war plans must take second place to the task of coping with current problems.  There is a risk, to which I referred previously, that undue emphasis on the importance of post-war planning, or undue discussion about post-war plans, may give rise amongst the people to the illusion that the war-time dangers have passed.  Any such illusion would be a source of new danger, and, although the Government recognises the importance of devoting the maximum attention to future plans, it wishes to keep before the public mind the fact that the problems and dangers of the present require the full attention of the Government, and that the preparation of plans for the future must be regarded as of secondary importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House is aware, and as, I think, the public are aware, the Government has never attempted to evade or deny its responsibility for the stimulation of employment-giving activities.  Its pre-war policy was framed in relation to that responsibility. Its efforts to prepare post-war plans were designed to enable it to discharge that responsibility in the future.  That declaration on behalf of the Government is not a matter for comment.  I think that members of all Parties in the Dáil and the public <Col N="430" /> generally fully understood the attitude of the Government in that respect.  A similar declaration made recently by the British Government in a paper published on employment policy after the war was described in the British Press as representing a revolutionary change of outlook in official quarters in that country.  I should like to recommend to Deputies that they should read the White Paper on employment policy recently published in Great Britain.  It is true that general conditions in Great Britain are different from ours, but the conditions that will exist in the United Kingdom after the war will not be so fundamentally different from those which we may expect to develop here that the ideas considered practicable in Britain will not be a useful guide to us in dealing with our own conditions.  The British White Paper represents a courageous effort to face the problems involved in the acceptance, as a primary responsibility of Government, of the maintenance of a high and stable level of employment in that country after the war.  It represents an attempt to face those problems free from prejudice in favour of old ideas and methods, and any Deputy who studies it will undoubtedly learn something which will enable him to make a more useful contribution to the solution of our own problems.</P>
    <P>I should like to repeat what I have said on previous occasions that the Government does not believe that employment can be created by Government action alone.  Members of the Labour Party may regard that statement as complete heresy, but it represents the considered view of the Government.  Constant support in the Dáil and from the people&mdash;from all sections of the people, from those who direct the financial affairs of the country, from those who direct the industrial and commercial activities of the nation, and from the leaders of organised labour&mdash;is essential for the success of any economic policy, no matter how sound that policy may be in itself or how vigorously it may be applied.  Government policy has been directed in the past and will be directed in the future to the maintenance of a high level of employment, <Col N="431" /> but our intelligence leads us to the conclusion that in the period immediately following the conclusion of hostilities, and in fact for a considerable number of years after the war has ended, we are likely to experience difficulties of a very unusual character. I think the post-war problem that this country will have to face can be considered in two parts.  Immediately after the termination of hostilities in Europe, we will enter the first stage, in which we will have an exceptional demand for goods and services of all kinds, a demand so strong that it would be capable of absorbing all the unemployed amongst us, but which may be and probably will be rendered ineffective by supply and production difficulties.  In the second stage, the supply and production difficulties will have passed, and the promotion of a high level of employment here will depend, firstly, upon the efficiency of the production methods which we employ; secondly, upon the adequacy and efficiency of our transport and distribution facilities; and, thirdly, upon our capacity to maintain exports in highly competitive markets.</P>
    <P>I think it is clear that we cannot attempt to plan in detail the actual operations which will be resorted to in our efforts to promote and to maintain employment.  It would, in fact, be a foolish policy to do so.  We cannot fully visualise all the circumstances which will exist or the problems with which we will have to contend. The aim of the Government is to endeavour to ensure that plans will be made covering all economic activities, and that those plans will be completed to the last detail, in so far as it is practicable to do it now, and will be utilised as circumstances appear to permit.</P>
    <P>Again, I want to emphasise that it is not the function of the Department of Industry and Commerce to deal with the budgetary and financial problems that will arise in promoting a policy of full employment&mdash;such matters as are dealt with in the British White Paper to which I have referred. The Department of Industry and Commerce is aiming to prepare comprehensive <Col N="432" /> plans for the development of industry&mdash;just as the Department of Agriculture is planning for the development of agriculture&mdash;and plans also for the improvement and extension of our transport facilities, plans for building and construction, and for public amenities of all kinds.  It is, as I have said, endeavouring to push the preparation of those plans to the furthest possible point, including the enactment of any legislation which may be necessary to give effect to them, with the idea of allowing the time and manner of their application to be decided by circumstances.</P>
    <P>I mentioned in opening my remarks that one of the main functions of the Department of Industry and Commerce is to stimulate and to direct industrial development, and naturally in considering the post-war situation we have given primary attention to the arrangements which will facilitate a resumption of our industrial progress.  In order to enable Deputies to understand the importance of an industrial policy in relation to employment, it is no harm to emphasise the experience of this country in recent years.  In the report of the committee which reviews periodically the employment and unemployment situation, and reports thereon to the Government, which reports are published, there is given an index of industrial employment, that is of the number of persons employed in industrial production of transportable goods.  That index is based upon the year 1926, and it shows the expansion of such employment in the years immediately preceding the war. Taking 1926 as a base, and putting the figure of 100 to represent employment of such a character in that year, employment in 1931 reached 108.4.  In the year 1939, it reached its peak, at 174.8. By 1943, due to wartime circumstances, fuel difficulties, and the absence of certain materials, it had fallen to 159.1. That index will emphasise that, even with the difficulties created by the war, industrial employment is still 50 per cent. higher than it was before the Government's industrial policy was put into operation, and is in itself a guide as to the possibilities of promoting still further increased employment in <Col N="433" /> normal circumstances when supply difficulties do not exist, and the fuel problems which are now curtailing industrial output have passed.</P>
    <P>At the present time, the Department of Industry and Commerce is carrying out a review of our industrial prospects. Every firm engaged in industrial production has been sent a questionnaire for the purpose of ascertaining the plans and the prospects of that firm, its immediate needs in respect of machinery, fuel, and power, its requirements of imported raw materials, and the possibility of substituting native raw materials for those that were previously imported.  The aim is to get a comprehensive picture of our industrial position and industrial prospects, with the object of preparing plans now to secure the maximum manufacture in this country of goods which are capable of production here.  Our industrial progress stopped with the outbreak of the war&mdash;at least, it did not stop entirely, and, in fact, the war itself created certain possibilities for industrial advancement in certain directions, and, notably, in connection with the shipbuilding industry, which has begun to develop in this country since the war&mdash;but a number of projects which were under consideration in 1939, some of which had reached the stage at which immediate action appeared to be possible, had to be abandoned on the outbreak of war.  The intention is to resume action on these projects as soon as possible after the war is over, and when the equipment and materials that are necessary can be obtained.</P>
    <P>There is, I am satisfied, substantial scope for further industrial progress here, and the intention of the Government is that efforts to promote that progress should be resumed as early as possible, and as vigorously as possible, when conditions permit.  We also intend to endeavour to promote, to a greater extent than was deemed practicable or prudent before the war, the use of native raw materials.  There are, of course, a number of industrial raw materials which we cannot hope to produce here, but there are others which can be used in substitution for those previously imported, and in some <Col N="434" /> cases with considerable economic advantage.</P>
    <P>The primary object of the whole industrial policy is, of course, to increase employment, but that aim of increasing employment must be linked up with the object of ensuring maximum efficiency in industrial production. The British White Paper, to which I have referred, stressed the view that continued progress in technical efficiency is a dominating factor in the growth of real national income.  I have never been satisfied that the powers possessed by the Government before the war, to insist upon maximum efficiency in industrial organisation and equipment, were adequate.</P>
    <P>There are obvious dangers of inefficiency in such circumstances as exist in this country, where there is only a limited home market and, consequently, conditions in which efficient production in many industrial spheres can only be undertaken by single firms or a limited number of firms.  The absence of effective internal competition, and the curtailment of external competition by means of tariffs and other such restrictions, tend to promote inefficiency unless there are in the possession of the Government powers to insist that technical developments that have taken place in other countries are adopted here and that the managements of the concerns are at all times endeavouring to maintain their productive efficiency at the highest limit, renovating and replacing their machinery and equipment, if they have become obsolescent or ineffective, and adopting new processes of manufacture or distribution as they have developed in other countries.  On that account, I think it will be necessary for us to review the position of the Control of Manufactures Act, which gave certain limited powers to the Government which could be used for that purpose in the past, but which are not likely to be adequate in the circumstances that may exist in the future.  It is interesting to note, in that connection, that the British Government is facing a similar problem and contemplating the acquisition of powers of a somewhat similar character to deal with the circumstances of that country, and particularly <Col N="435" /> to deal with problems created by the undue concentration of industries of the same kind in single localities.</P>
    <P>I have already said that the aim of those planning activities is to ensure that all the preliminary work that can be done should be completed now.  In that connection, I may say that we are receiving the maximum co-operation from the Industrial Credit Company. The Industrial Credit Company was set up by the Government, as Deputies are aware, to facilitate the provision of capital for industrial enterprises.  That company, in co-operation with the Department, is endeavouring to secure that various industrial projects, which are deemed to be practicable, will be brought to the stage of completion in which work can be proceeded with immediately equipment becomes available and to facilitate the companies that are in a position to undertake these enterprises: that, where possible, the location of sites for these enterprises will be determined upon and acquired, and preliminary activities of that kind completed before the war ends and before it will be possible to procure the machinery or other equipment that will be necessary.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It contemplates that the company will act as an industrial promoter, endeavouring to promote <Col N="436" /> companies that are willing and capable of undertaking these industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>But will they, in fact, appoint the directors or managing directors of these firms or industries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.  The Industrial Credit Company is a large shareholder in many existing concerns at the moment and can, no doubt, use its powers to appoint directors, if that is considered to be prudent, but in the past the policy of the company has not been to do so except where the affairs of the firm concerned got into such a condition that the Industrial Credit Company felt that there was an obligation on it to interfere directly in management.  I do not think that the company will want to proceed on different lines in the future from those which they have pursued in the past, but that company will certainly be taking a very active part in the promotion of enterprises which they think are desirable and in the financing of which they are prepared to co-operate.</P>
      <P>There are, as I have pointed out already, a number of industries which can only be carried on here by single companies, and in this review of industrial possibilities, contact was established with these single industries in the first place.  There have been detailed discussions with 130 firms of that character and, as a result of these discussions, 54 reports of detailed development projects have been received. There are other industries which are carried on by a number of firms&mdash;the group industries, as I may call them&mdash; and discussions are proceeding in connection with these industries also. Already, the firms engaged in hosiery manufacture have been contacted, and the completion of plans for the development of that industry is proceeding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be many cases where the production of raw or semi-manufactured materials, previously imported by group industries of that kind, could not be undertaken except by some co-operative effort between the users of these materials, and the aim is, where necessary, to secure now the completion <Col N="437" /> of the arrangements to ensure that that co-operative effort will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>In connection with the rural electrification plans which have been announced, it is intended that, to the maximum degree possible, the manufacture of equipment necessary for the distribution of electricity, or apparatus required in the consumption of electricity, will be undertaken here. In order to ensure that the idea would be given full effect to, it is intended to extend the powers of the Electricity Supply Board, to permit them also to promote the establishment of industries for the production of electrical equipment where no other firm is undertaking it or is contemplating it. That will require legislation, and I do not propose to refer to it further because the necessary Bill to give these powers to the Electricity Supply Board will, I think, be available to the Dáil this year, and the matter can be fully discussed at that stage.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, the Government is considering the advisability of initiating a rural electrification scheme, the aim being to bring the national electricity supply to every farmhouse in the country on a basis which will enable current to be sold at a cost that will be attractive to farmers and rural dwellers generally. The Electricity Supply Board was requested to examine that question fully and to prepare a report as to the financial and other arrangements that would be involved in it.  That report has been prepared and was submitted to the Government. The Government have approved it in principle.  The report is now being printed and will be published shortly.  The legislation designed to empower the Electricity Supply Board to undertake the work and to make the consequential financial arrangements is being drafted and will be ready shortly.  It is a scheme which involves capital expenditure on a large scale.  The estimated cost of constructing the rural network on the basis of pre-war prices is £20,000,000.  Presumably prices will be somewhat higher after the war and the cost will be larger.  It will be necessary to subsidise the scheme to <Col N="438" /> some extent because, on the basis of that capital cost, electricity could not be sold at an economic price which would be attractive to rural dwellers.</P>
    <P>The Government contemplates making a contribution to the capital cost of the scheme.  I should say, however, that the capital expenditure involved will not arise in any few years.  The aim is to complete the construction of the necessary network in ten years. There are many experts in the service of the Electricity Supply Board who do not think it can be done in ten years.  If we were to attempt to complete it in ten years, we would have to construct that network at a rate five times as fast as the existing Shannon network was constructed by Siemens-Schuckert.  That would involve problems of various kinds including the recruitment and training of a number of workers with the necessary skill for the job.  The aim of the Government, however, is to get the work completed in ten years, and to ensure that no unnecessary impediment will arise to the realisation of that aim.  However, the legislation necessary in that connection will be available to the Dáil, and the matter can be fully discussed on that occasion.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have noticed announcements in the Press concerning the establishment in the Department of Industry and Commerce of an organisation charged with the responsibility of supervising plans for post-war building activities.  It is contemplated that because of the cessation of building during the war, the arrears that have to be made up as well as the general circumstances that are likely to exist after the war, there will be a demand for building materials and building labour in excess of what it will be possible to provide.  On that account it was decided to establish this organisation which is preparing a list of all the building projects in contemplation, with the intention of putting these projects in order of priority based upon their urgency and their social, economic and cultural importance.  All the public authorities, Government Departments, industrial firms and private individuals, who had building projects after the war in contemplation <Col N="439" /> were notified that they would not be permitted to proceed with them unless they submitted the details of these projects to this organisation, unless they had in fact approached the stage where they could begin at once immediately materials become available, architects and engineers' plans had been prepared, sites for the buildings had been acquired, and other preliminary work had been completed.</P>
    <P>I mentioned some time ago in public that the capital value of the building projects already listed exceeds £60,000,000.  Some people cast doubt upon that figure and many queries were asked as to where the money was to come from.  These queries indicated a misunderstanding of the position.  That is, in fact, the capital cost of all the building projects already listed, not merely by Government Departments and public authorities, but by private firms and private individuals.  The list includes buildings of all kinds, hospitals, factories, houses, cinemas and similar structures.  It is quite obvious that we could not attempt to carry out building activities on that scale in any reasonable period unless we make very comprehensive plans in advance. To attempt to complete building projects already listed in a period of five years would mean doubling the maximum output ever achieved by the building industry in this country, doubling the consumption of building materials and doubling the employment in the building trade.  Whether that can be done or not is very open to question.</P>
    <P>We have established an Advisory Council with a number of subsidiary advisory committees composed of representatives of all sections of the building trade and the building trade unions.  They are considering the problems that have arisen in that connection&mdash;what can be done to promote the production of building materials, what can be done to expand the skilled building personnel available, what arrangements can be made to ensure that there will be a stepping up of building output to the maximum extent that the personnel will permit, <Col N="440" /> and the continuous expansion of output as the position improves.  That organisation has also been charged with the responsibility of carrying out research into building methods.  It is obvious from the trade journals in Great Britain that improvements in building methods have been devised there which involve considerable economies in the use of scarce materials, that is, materials which are likely to be scarce in this country. The aim is to ensure that all the information that can be procured in other countries as to improved methods of building construction will be made available, that any modification of these methods which our circumstances require will be decided upon, and that the various sections of the building industry will be fully informed concerning them.</P>
    <P>Included in the Vote for the Department of Industry and Commerce is certain provision for the Tourist Board. The Tourist Board is also proceeding with the preparation of comprehensive schemes for tourist resort development and is arranging to carry out portion of the approved schemes as early as possible, such portion of these schemes as can be undertaken without the utilisation of materials which are scarce.  Work has already begun on the development scheme at Tramore and is still in progress.  Schemes have also been approved for Portmarnock, Bundoran, Lisdoonvarna and Youghal. Many other schemes are under examination and it is contemplated that, because of the plans prepared by the Tourist Board, a great volume of useful employment will be made available when the problems arising out of the supply of materials will have eased. During the course of the past year, the board brought into operation the portion of the Tourist Act which relates to the registration of hotels and guest-houses.  Deputies will remember that we suspended the activities of the board in that regard at the outbreak of the war.  In fact, the Act which established the board and gave it the necessary powers became law after the commencement of hostilities and it was considered at that stage that little useful work could be done by the board <Col N="441" /> during the war, apart from the preparation of schemes for post-war activities.  In fact, the experience of the past year showed that our outlook then was too pessimistic.  Hotels, guest-houses and other institutions engaged in holiday traffic have, in fact, had a rather prosperous time during the past couple of years.  In many cases, there was a tendency to overcharge and complaints were received as to the inadequacy of the accommodation and service given for the very high charges imposed.  The introduction of the registration scheme, designed in 1939, ensures supervision over hotels and guest-houses.  Those places will be required to determine their charges for accommodation and to maintain those charges even when business is brisk. It also ensures the maintenance of a reasonable standard of cleanliness and accommodation.  The penalty for departure from these standards is, of course, the withdrawal of the right to use the term &ldquo;hotel&rdquo; or &ldquo;guest-house.&rdquo; The board has full control over these words and no institution can describe itself as a hotel or guest-house unless it conforms with the minimum standards laid down by the Tourist Board.  I may say that that part of the Act was brought into operation in full agreement with the Tourist Association and with the organisation of hotel-keepers.</P>
    <P>In connection with civil aviation, the House is, I think, aware that our aviation service has been temporarily grounded at the request of the authorities in the United Kingdom.  Some months ago, they asked us to suspend the service conducted by our aeroplanes to the United Kingdom.  That service has since remained suspended. I cannot say when it is likely to be resumed.  In so far as aerodrome accommodation is concerned, the position is that the Dublin aerodrome has been completed in accordance with the original plan.  It is, however, now necessary to provide for hard-surface runways.  The increase in the size and speed of aeroplanes has indicated the necessity for hard surface runways in the use of all major aerodromes.  The decision has been taken to construct hard-surface runways at the Dublin <Col N="442" /> airport.  In fact, the Office of Public Works is arranging for the placing of contracts for that work.  That the work can be undertaken and completed will depend entirely on the supply of materials.  I may say that the cost of the hard surfacing of the runways at the Dublin airport will exceed £200,000.  In the course of the year, we decided to undertake certain important works for the improvement of the accommodation at Foynes.  The House is, I think, aware that Foynes is only a temporary airport.  The main Shannon airport is at Rhynanna. Because the Rhynanna airport was not completed when transatlantic air traffic so rapidly developed, we had to avail of the facilities at Foynes. Originally, it was intended to expend only the minimum amount necessary to make Foynes a safe airport but, because of the prolongation of the emergency and the expansion of traffic using the airport, new works have had to be constructed both for the accommodation of staff and the accommodation of persons and planes using the airport. The work at Rhynanna has proceeded much less rapidly than would have been possible in normal times.  Nevertheless, progress is being made and new contracts have recently been placed for extension of the runways and for the construction of portion of the airport buildings.  The air companies have been asked to consider the problems which will arise out of the anticipated development of air transport after the war and surveys are in progress as to possible sites for aerodromes, at Cork and other centres, to be constructed later.</P>
    <P>With regard to mineral development, I do not propose to say much at this stage, because I contemplate bringing to the Dáil a Bill to amalgamate the two companies established by legislation some years ago&mdash;one to undertake the development of the Slievardagh coalfield area and the other to undertake general mineral exploration and development work.  Experience has shown that economy and efficiency will be promoted by amalgamating these two companies.  Measures towards their amalgamation have already been taken.  The same board of directors is <Col N="443" /> at present acting for both companies, and the companies are working from the same office, but formal amalgamation of the companies is contemplated, and legislation to that end is being prepared.  The introduction of that legislation will give Deputies, if they so desire, an opportunity to discuss in greater detail plans for mineral development. The activities of the Minerals Exploration and Development Company have been mainly concentrated upon the production of materials for the manufacture of fertilisers&mdash;phosphate rock in Clare, and pyrites in Wicklow.  The output of phosphate rock was 12,000 tons.  The rock that could be secured by quarrying is now almost exhausted, and the company is now proceeding by mining. The cost of winning phosphate rock by mining is very high, but, high as it is, we can still produce phosphate rock in Clare at a lower cost than it could be procured elsewhere under present circumstances.  The form of pyrites which can be won in Wicklow is not altogether suited to the furnaces at present installed by our fertiliser manufacturers.  However, arrangements are being made which will permit of the utilisation of the pyrites already won in the manufacture of fertilisers next year.  Notwithstanding the production of 12,000 tons of coal at Slievardagh, the undertaking has not reached the profit-earning stage. Certain difficulties have arisen, and although the production of 12,000 tons is not an unimportant contribution to our coal supply, the problem of putting that company on a paying basis has not yet been successfully solved.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other matters that I wish to refer to briefly, because I think Deputies will be interested in them.  The outstanding event of administrative importance in the Department of Industry and Commerce during the past year has been the enactment of the Children's Allowances Act.  That involved the creation of a new, a large and an important section in the Department, which is now fully staffed and functioning smoothly.  As the House is aware, payment of the allowances is due to begin on 1st <Col N="444" /> August.  Applications for allowances were due in the Department prior to the first June and the number received is in or about the number we anticipated.  There will be difficulties of administration, which may cause some trouble between this and August 1st, and many questions of scope and definition will arise to be answered. The Act, however, does establish machinery by which these questions can be determined, and I hope, before the end of the year, it will be possible to say that the children's allowance scheme is working smoothly.</P>
    <P>I can say now, concerning the food voucher scheme, that that was a rather dangerous type of experiment, but fortunately the administrative difficulties we foresaw did not prove so great as we anticipated, and I think I can say that the scheme is working smoothly.  There were some temporary problems occasioned in separate localities during the winter by reason of the inability of persons holding vouchers to get supplies of milk and butter, but such temporary shortages were few, and <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements were made to deal with them.  The present value of the food voucher is slightly over 2/5.  At this time in 1943 it was 2/2; the increase in the value of the voucher arose from the rise in the price of butter mainly, in the interval.  There are 91,000 benefitting under the food voucher scheme. I do not think there is any other matter with which I need deal now. There is a large number of activities for which the Department of Industry and Commerce is responsible, some of which I have not referred to.  If Deputies have any questions to ask concerning these further activities I shall endeavour to give the fullest possible information possible when replying.</P>

      <P>The Minister's statement was concerned mainly with the activities of one of his Departments. There is a line of demarcation between the Department of Supplies and the Department of Industry and Commerce, but it is so slender that it is difficult for Deputies to understand where the functions of one begin and the others end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems difficult to understand why the duties performed by one Department could not be more effectively performed by the other. However, we have the two Departments, and we shall have an opportunity of discussing the Department of Supplies when we come to deal with the Estimate for it.  At the outset, I should like to deal with some matters mentioned by the Minister.  He stated that his Department's activities were confined almost entirely to the allocation of materials obtained by the Department of Supplies and the preparation of post-war industrial plans. He mentioned one thing which is in very restricted supply&mdash;explosives. Because of that restriction, the activities of public bodies are considerably hampered.  I was wondering, in view of the coal restrictions and the fact that collieries and other undertakings using explosives will not be able to use the same quantity for the next six months, or until the position improves, if the Minister would be able to make a better allocation of explosives to local authorities.  I ask him to bear in mind that explosives are needed for land improvement and for reclamation schemes carried out by the Department of Agriculture. I tried unsuccessfully to secure a small quota for a very important reclamation scheme but I failed to convince the officials of the Department of the importance of the work.  The Minister should consider, if at all possible, setting aside a small supply of explosives for reclamation of land because such work is linked up with food production.  In the case in which I was interested the people desired to have a certain amount of land reclaimed in order to carry out tillage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="446" /> I am glad to learn from the Minister that the position with regard to the supply of horseshoes may be eased, owing to supplies of steel bars having been obtained.  I was particularly glad to learn that the price will be substantially reduced.  Hitherto, the price was almost prohibitive.  I am also interested in the Minister's assessment of the paper situation.  The Minister mentioned that about 65,000 tons of paper were normally imported, and roughly, 12,000 tons produced here, and that since the beginning of the war home production had increased by about 12 per cent.  That is, undoubtedly, an appreciable increase and has made a substantial contribution to home requirements.  I wonder if it would be possible to increase home production still further.  There is a serious shortage of certain types of commercial and jobbing paper which are produced in very small quantities here and make very little impression on the general demand. I realise that, on account of the fuel restrictions, it may not be possible immediately to increase the output, but I ask the Minister to bear the matter in mind so that, when circumstances are favourable, those engaged in the production of these papers may endeavour to increase output.  The Minister mentioned that some of the mills are experimenting with the possibility of utilising turf and I sincerely hope that the experiment will succeed.</P>
    <P>Coming to the position as it affects newsprint, I am sorry to say that the Minister's statement was rather pessimistic. He seemed to indicate that there was no likelihood of any newsprint coming in for some time owing to the world situation.  I am sure the Minister appreciates, just as much as I do, the importance of the printing industry, and the necessity of keeping it in normal production. The printing trade gives a large measure of employment, but it has been confronted with serious difficulties since the outbreak of war.  Owing, however, to the assistance and the co-operation given by the Minister's officials, the industry has survived the difficulties which it experienced and is moving along in a reasonable way.  I am sure the Minister knows, from the <Col N="447" /> information at the disposal of the Department of Supplies, that many of the provincial papers, for which I can speak, are living from hand to mouth, inasmuch as their stocks of paper were, at the best of times, small.  When circumstances are favourable, I hope he will do his utmost to get larger supplies of newsprint, so that the industry may be allowed to carry on in a reasonable way.  The Minister, I think, said that it was almost impossible to obtain supplies from Sweden at the present time.  I think I did hear from an agent in Dublin a short time ago that large supplies of newsprint had been imported from Sweden.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Supplies have been obtained from Sweden, but I anticipate that recent developments in the war are likely to make it difficult to secure further supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  My information was to the effect that large supplies of paper had been obtained from Sweden, that they had been shipped to Portugal, and were there awaiting trans-shipment.  I realise perfectly well the limitations on the shipping space available and the war difficulties.  I simply want to impress on the Minister the serious position in which many newspaper owners find themselves and the importance of that industry.  I am sure that the Minister will do his utmost to obtain and make available supplies of paper for the newspapers throughout the country.  I do not know what the position is with regard to the daily newspapers, but in any event they are a very strong organisation and are quite capable of looking after their own interest.  I am sure that that organisation will see to it that the welfare of the daily newspapers is not being neglected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made a brief reference to the suspension of the issue of exit permits.  I realise that, owing to the labour shortage in the country, the utmost vigilance must be exercised in the granting of exit permits.  The Minister is, I am sure, well aware that many cases of hardship have arisen owing to the fact that people have <Col N="448" /> not been able to obtain these permits. That applies to the towns and cities as well as to the country.  In a number of cases, I have made representations to the Minister's Department, and I am sure that, when circumstances are favourable, the Minister will see that the people concerned are granted exit permits.  I should be glad if the Minister would give an indication as to when the issue of these exit permits is likely to be resumed.  I do not know if he is in a position to give the information. External circumstances, probably, make it difficult for him to give any approximate information as to when their issue will be resumed. As the Minister, however, is aware, quite a large number of people are interested in these permits, and, naturally, they will be very anxious to have some indication as to when their issue is likely to be resumed.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to deal with his post-war plans.  I must say that he was delightfully vague in giving the Dáil information about the plans which he has in contemplation.  He did indicate, of course, that in arranging these plans he naturally had to bear in mind the general employment situation in the country, and that whatever plans were made would be designed to give the maximum amount of employment in industry and its allied businesses when the war is over.  The Minister talked lightly about spending millions of pounds on one scheme or another.  I would remind him of the statement made by his colleague, the Minister for Finance, when introducing the Budget in the Dáil this year.  Towards the end of his Budget speech he said that the expenditure on post-war plans would be determined entirely by the amount of money that could be saved on emergency services.  In other words, the Minister for Finance was not in a position to indicate what amount of money could be spent on post-war plans until he knew what savings could be effected on emergency services, particularly the defence services.  In considering post-war plans, we must naturally consider the possible expenditure on the schemes brought forward.  At the moment we do not know when the war will be over.  We do not even know <Col N="449" /> whether it will be possible for us to curtail, to any very great extent, any of these emergency services for a long time after the war is over.  It is, therefore, very hard to examine in any kind of a concrete way any type of post-war plans.  We heard a great deal about plans in the past.  Somehow, when we speak about planning, it has not a very healthy flavour for some of us.  I do sincerely hope that, whatever plans the Minister is preparing in the future, he will see that they are discussed exhaustively with people who, by reason of their experience in business, organisation, and generally by reason of their commercial knowledge, are best qualified to advise on such matters. The Minister should secure the experience of such men in helping him to prepare whatever post-war plans he has in contemplation.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say that, in preparing his post-war plans, he naturally had to take into consideration, first of all, the cheapening of the costs of production, and, secondly, the efficiency with which these businesses are conducted.  There is no doubt that one of the chief considerations which should be in the Minister's mind in this matter is the cheapening of the costs of production.  After all, that is intimately linked up with the efficiency with which a particular business is conducted. There has, admittedly, been a great deal of inefficiency in the conduct of some of the industries started by the Minister himself during the past ten or 12 years.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that our industrialists did not exert themselves sufficiently for the purpose of bringing their businesses up to the standards of, let us say, similar businesses in other countries. I am afraid that they were not impelled by the desire to give the country the best service which it was possible for them to give.  They were solely, and almost entirely, concerned with making the maximum profit out of these businesses, while at the same time giving the minimum amount of employment.  I assume, from the Minister's statement to-day, that we have finished with that particular era, and that, when the war is over, the Minister will see to it that our industrialists will conduct their businesses <Col N="450" /> in a thoroughly efficient way, and will give the country the benefit of that efficiency by reducing the excessively high prices which they are charging for the goods and commodities they are producing at the present time.  It is unfair to expect the people of this country to continue to pay through the nose, as they have been paying for years past, for the industrial position we have achieved.  I can assure the Minister that the country would not stand for that.  We have now arrived at the time when the people will demand, for the future at all events, that there be not alone efficiency but a considerable reduction in the price of the commodities which are produced in our factories.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the White Paper issued by the British Government. I have not seen the White Paper, but I have read references to it in the British Press and, so far as I am aware, that White Paper contained a number of rather intimate details of the plans which the British Government is preparing for the future.  It would be well if the Minister would take the House into his confidence and give us some more details of the post-war plans he has in contemplation.  I think it only right that the members of the Dáil be given an opportunity of discussing these plans as well as the officials of the Minister's own Department.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Two heads are better than one&rdquo; is an old saying and, after all, I am sure many members of this Dáil have considerable experience in business and would be very useful to the Minister in any criticism they would offer of the plans he has in contemplation. I realise that, at this particular stage, it is quite impossible to get down to very precise details, but I think it would be a good thing for the Minister to give the House general particulars of the plans he has in contemplation and allow the House to fill in any of the blanks in those plans.  The Minister will require the co-operation and assistance of the members of the Dáil and of other experienced people throughout the country in bringing the plans to fruition.</P>
    <P>Seemingly, the Industrial Credit Corporation will be asked to take on <Col N="451" /> additional functions in the future. Previously, it was a lending corporation, confined to industrial enterprise and, naturally, as money had been lent to it by the Government, it was its function to see that the interests of the taxpayers were safeguarded as far as it was possible to do so, but it would appear from the Minister's statement that in the future it will be the function of the corporation to establish industries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the Deputy misunderstands slightly.  The Industrial Credit Corporation did not assist in the financing of industry in the past by lending money so much as by the underwriting of public issues of shares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, it will exercise some additional and very important functions in the future.  I assume that it will be necessary for the Minister to bring in fresh legislation, for the purpose of enabling the corporation to exercise those additional functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not aware of that. We will, possibly, have an opportunity of discussing this matter later.  At the moment, I am rather doubtful about conferring these additional functions on the Industrial Credit Corporation. It may be a good thing for industrial development in this country, or it may not.  It depends on whether the right men are in charge, men with business experience and outlook.  However, I am not in a position to criticise the Minister's intentions in that respect at the moment as I must confess I would like some time to consider the matter in all its bearings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to rural electrification schemes and made special reference to the fact that it was proposed to manufacture in this country as much as possible of the equipment <Col N="452" /> required for the scheme.  That is, certainly, a laudable ambition and I sincerely hope it will succeed; but I do ask the Minister, if he does embark on the manufacture of this equipment, to see that the people who participate in the rural electrification scheme get that equipment at a reasonable price&mdash;at a price that bears some relation to competitive prices elsewhere.  The tendency in this country, when we do manufacture an article and sell it afterwards, is to charge an exorbitant price.  At least, that was the experience in the past and I sincerely hope it will not be so in the future.  In fact, I would imagine that the success of the rural electrification scheme will depend to a large extent on the price charged to the beneficiaries for the equipment manufactured for the purpose of the scheme.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a brief reference to the Tourist Board.  Its main function will not be exercised until the war is over, but some of the preliminary functions have been put into operation already.  I wish to compliment the Minister on doing that.  The tourist industry is a very important source of income to this country and, if we were to develop it to a larger extent when the war is over, it would, certainly, be necessary to standardise our hotels and insist that they be maintained in a proper way and provide proper accommodation for visitors.  Some hotel proprietors are very negligent in many ways and I hope that, as a result of the putting into operation of this portion of the Act, there will be a general improvement in the standard of hotel accommodation throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Regarding the phosphatic rock deposits in Clare, I think the Minister stated last year, when introducing a Supplementary Estimate, that he estimated that there was no more than about one year's supply of phosphatic rock in Clare.  I wonder if he had reason recently for changing his opinion?  At that time, boring for rock was taking place; but to-day he mentioned that mining for rock is proceeding. I should be glad if he would make some statement about the possibility of getting in supplies.  He said something last year about the supplies in Clare <Col N="453" /> being almost exhausted.  It is a matter which vitally affects the farmers, as the food production campaign depends to a large extent on the amount of artificial manures which can be procured. I would be very glad to hear that the Minister's statement last year was not correct, and that the Clare phosphates will last longer than he anticipated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy Misunderstands the position.  Normally, we use about 100,000 tons of phosphate rock for the production of fertilisers every year.  Production in Clare last year was 12,000 tons.  When I referred to a year's supply I was referring to a year's supply on the normal basis. Borings which have been made would appear to indicate the presence of approximately 100,000 tons of phosphate rock in Clare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In or about that.  One can never be sure until one is digging it out.  Further exploration work is proceeding, but what the result may be I cannot attempt to forecast.  In so far as production at the present time can be maintained to the maximum of about 12,000 tons a year, there is, of course, more than a year's supply. We have been importing in the past 15,000 to 20,000 tons&mdash;that is, in recent years&mdash;in addition; but the total output of the Clare phosphates could never give us a normal supply of phosphatic rock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>On this Estimate, I suppose it is natural that I would mention the things that occur to me, matters where possibly the shoe has pinched someone.  I do not want the Minister or the House to think that I do not realise the very good work that the Minister and his Department have done.  The Government imposed quotas and duties to help the native manufacturers.  I think that process was only in its infancy, as probably <Col N="454" /> the Minister would be the first to state &mdash;I think he has stated it&mdash;and the war caught us in the middle of a changeover. I suppose the Minister hoped that with the efflux of time and a rise in competition a whole lot of gaps in the industrial programme would have been filled in and some of the inequalities smoothed out.</P>
      <P>If I look back on the immediate past, I hope the Minister will not think I am looking back with the object of finding fault; I am merely trying to see how we can improve our position in the future by putting a label on some of the things that ought not to have happened, or perhaps ought not to have happened to the extent that they did. Undoubtedly, during the emergency period it became evident that the native manufacturers were not sufficiently geared to supply materials in the period before the war.  What I mean by that is that probably any native manufacturer who had established himself would have considered what the normal requirements of the country were and would have arranged, by machinery and labour, to cope with that demand.  What really happened was that there was a short period in which most industrialists could see the storm coming and a rate of production was required from the native manufacturer which ran to five or ten times what his normal production would have been.  He was not able to cope with that.  He would tell you probably that he could not even try to do it.  What was the position?  The position was that the native manufacturer could not hope to produce in accordance with the demands, and the period during which supplies could have been brought in from outside was past, so that I suppose industrially what we gained on the swings we almost lost on the roundabouts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a good deal of criticism thrown at the Irish manufacturer.  He is described as a sort of inefficient, grasping individual who is anxious to screw the last shilling out of the public. Of course, that is not true.  The problem that the Irish manufacturer is up against is a very old one, and I will tell you what it is.  There exists in this country a demand for the same <Col N="455" /> range of materials or goods&mdash;whichever way you like to put it&mdash;just as it exists in England, with this difference, that it is only one-hundredth per cent. of the volume.  The problem that confronts every Irish manufacturer is, is he going to take a very small portion of the range that is manufactured in England, manufactured fairly efficiently, and then be blamed because he does not produce the full range?  What happens in England is that manufacturers get into compartments all along that line. I will merely indicate one, but it varies from trade to trade and industry to industry.  One manufacturer will take the very light stuff, another the medium light, a third the medium and a fourth the heavy.  Those people have special machinery to cope with that narrow range in a volume far greater than the Irish manufacturer can hope to get.</P>
    <P>That is really the problem of manufacturing in this country.  The manufacturers have tried to solve it in various ways.  In order to try to eliminate or reduce the shock of the cost to the public of changing over from goods that were brought in without any tariff and the price charged by a local manufacturer, I think the Prices Commission were called in to help and prices were fixed which practically eliminated the wholesale distributor in many cases.  That looked as if it was a very good scheme, because it meant that the Irish manufacturer had not to give a discount beyond a very small amount and it looked as if that saving was pocketed by the consumers.  What happened, of course, was that the big stockists who found that where they used to purchase a thousand articles from abroad and could only obtain 50 from the local manufacturer, reduced their stocks to 50.  That is one of the reasons why, in this country, we have lost on the swings what we gained on the roundabouts.</P>
    <P>I do not want the Minister to think that I am throwing bricks at his Department, or that his Department is solely to blame for that.  I am perfectly aware of cases where the Department, faced with two absolutely <Col N="456" /> different stories, one from the manufacturer as to what he could produce and the other from the distributor who wanted certain goods, brought them into a conference.  The manufacturer maintained his position and the distributor maintained his, and the Department in a lot of cases took a middle course, where really they would have required to take a very courageous and possibly a very unpopular decision in order to leave this country with a supply of goods adequate to meet the situation.  As an illustration of that, the other evening I mentioned the shortage of small watt electric lamps.  In reply to my bringing that matter to his notice, I think the Minister suggested that this Party and I really should not have the impudence to mention such a matter considering that we had done our best to sabotage the factory.  I do not know whether the Minister ranks me as an industrialist or as a saboteur but I should like to point out to him that I believe the factory never manufactured five and ten watt lamps.  I am not throwing bricks at the factory.  The position probably was that these small and light types of lamp would possibly require machinery that the factory had not got.  That is only an illustration of the difficulties that have to be faced and that have to be solved, no matter who is pleased or what may occur.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned some of the very far-reaching plans that the Government have in view.  I hope he realises that in many cases the country has to stand still until the Government have finished planning.  The Minister will have to take his courage in his hands to state what duties and quotas are to be re-imposed.  I will tell you why he must do that.  All these schemes will require workers and materials.  Some people will tell you that at the cessation of hostilities all the workers in Great Britain will be given a return ticket and will be sent back here.  Other people will tell you that there is a tremendous building programme on the other side in comparison with which our £64,000,000 scheme fades into insignificance, and <Col N="457" /> that workers will be required there in abundance.  No doubt many of the workers who have gone to the other side are skilled building operatives. Many others are at least strong, clever manual workers and can probably take their place in any dilution scheme or any other scheme on the other side. I do not know what the Minister's view is as between those two positions with regard to the workers.</P>
    <P>I am sure we would all be very interested if we could be sure that the course which is going to be taken will be the right one.  Whether we have workers or have not workers, we will require materials.  No importer will make a move until he knows what the position will be when he brings stuff in here.  The Government, to do them justice, have put all the duties and quotas in cold storage&mdash;they are in abeyance.  I think you could go to the Minister's Department and get a permit for anything that had arrived at the Quay, but that is too uncertain a position for someone to face in the post-war period.  He might bring in a whole lot of goods and find, possibly through stupidity or possibly, the Minister might say, through necessity, a permit to import these goods might be refused, and he would not know whether 50 or 75 per cent. of the duty would have to be paid.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the magnitude of these schemes.  I happen to know about a manufacturer who had three schemes prepared which he submitted to the Minister's Department. The Corporation stopped the first scheme under the Town Planning scheme.  In regard to the second scheme they found there would be a law action as to light and air with the neighbours.  The third scheme, presumably, will be carried out.  That may possibly display a pessimistic outlook with regard to schemes, but certainly a very great number of those schemes are, first of all, dependent on many contingencies, and I would suggest to the Minister that none of them, or a very small number of them, will be started until the people can see their way clearly ahead.  The average person who carries out a scheme such as these can usually find out all along <Col N="458" /> the line what material is available and what are the prospects of finishing the work.  Nobody is going to embark on such schemes unless he can see the the materials in sight.</P>
    <P>Possibly, in trying to solve some of the problems that I have indicated, the Minister may get a headache, and, as I have said, he certainly will not please everybody, but at the present time the position is that most of the people who are charged with the job of getting in materials are waiting for the Government to cease planning and to make a pronouncement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in his introductory statement, gave the House a fairly comprehensive outline of the entire industrial position, and of his plans in regard to the post-war period.  As far as the present position is concerned, there is not very much that can be said, because, to a great extent, industrial policy is in abeyance. The Minister touched upon a few questions in regard to the unemployment position.  He expressed satisfaction that unemployment has tended to decrease in the last couple of years, but he almost admitted that that was mainly due to the fact that there has been a very substantial increase in emigration in the last couple of years. The Minister put the number who have emigrated for employment in Great Britain in 1943 at 39,000, which, I suppose, is the lowest figure that can be computed from the statistics available. In my view, 39,000 is a very substantial number of people to be exported from this country for employment abroad, particularly having regard to the fact that these 39,000 are, for the most part, the cream of our workers, young men and women of a high order of intelligence, skill, efficiency and ambition.  Their loss to the nation cannot be over-estimated. Some people express the fear that all those who have gone across to Great Britain will be returned when the war is over, with a very serious impact on our employment conditions here.  That is one serious aspect of the question. There is another which is equally serious, and that is, that many of the best of these workers may be retained <Col N="459" /> abroad and thereby be permanently lost to this State; so that from whatever aspect we view the question, that emigration is to be deplored.</P>
      <P>The Minister dwelt on the difficulty of obtaining explosives for mining and other purposes.  I should like to remind him of one aspect of this question which seriously affects farmers, and that is the almost complete impossibility of securing cartridges for the protection of crops.  It is a strange thing that there appears to be a fairly substantial quantity of cartridges available for sporting purposes, whereas it is absolutely impossible for a farmer to obtain any cartridges in the provincial towns or villages for the protection of his crops.  That is a very serious difficulty with which tillage farmers have to contend.  One of the undesirable results of that position is that in a good many cases farmers have been forced to resort to the destroying of birds and other vermin by the use of poison.  I hope that the Minister will do what he can to ensure that greater quantities of cartridges are made available and that they are distributed to the people who require them most urgently in the national interests, namely, the farmers.</P>
      <P>A somewhat similar position now arises in regard to cement.  Restrictions have been imposed upon its distribution, and small builders and farmers throughout the rural areas may be seriously affected unless their interests are adequately protected.  It is necessary, of course, that people engaged in big building operations, in constructional operations, should receive first consideration but, at the same time, there are throughout the country a large number of small builders, people engaged in the improvement of buildings, who depend for their existence on the distribution of cement in the rural areas.  Farmers also must keep their farm buildings in repair if they are to protect and preserve their livestock and store their cereals and other crops.  For that reason I want to make a special plea that in any distribution of cement special consideration will be given to the people in the rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="460" /> It is satisfactory that a big effort has been made to ensure that horseshoeing iron will be available but, as every Deputy from rural Ireland knows, the supplies which ordinary farriers throughout the country are able to obtain are extremely limited and the price is to a great extent prohibitive.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to his efforts to conserve timber supplies. Here again, in rural areas, a number of people have a very definite grievance. Small sawmills find it impossible to obtain permits to secure the best type of timber.  Such timber is reserved, I suppose, for the bigger firms and manufacturers. But it must be remembered that throughout the rural areas those small sawmills provide timber for very essential national purposes.  They may not require a big quantity, but they require a certain quantity, at any rate of first-class timber, for example, for the construction of farm carts, providing shafting for machinery and such things for which good timber is essential. It is an injustice to refuse permits to those small mills simply because they happen to be carrying on in a small way.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the production of phosphates, and it is gratifying to know that there is a fairly substantial quantity available that can be mined in sufficient quantities.  Both in regard to the mining of phosphates and in regard to pyrites and other essentials in the manufacture of phosphatic manures, I think one of the best achievements of the Department in recent years was the setting up of the Mineral Development Company.  That company is justifying itself and will justify itself amply in future.  It is one of the enterprises which ought to be commended and supported.  Our mineral deposits are undoubtedly limited, but they are, nevertheless, not entirely insignificant.  They have, however, certain features which make them difficult to develop by private enterprise.  Most of our mineral ores are of a compound nature and they must be all minded together and afterwards segregated.  For that reason it is difficult for any privately-owned firm to cope with the <Col N="461" /> situation, and I believe that the mining company which has been set up is setting out on its task on right lines and that it ought to receive wholehearted co-operation.  I do not mention that fact because this company happens to be operating to a fairly substantial extent in my constituency.  I believe there is scope for mineral development in many parts of the country and that a company such as this can achieve very good results and be a very important factor in industrial development in the post-war period.  The more raw materials we can obtain from native sources the more secure will be our native industries.</P>
    <P>On this question of industrial development after the war, I believe that the policy of giving ample support and adequate protection to sound industries must be continued.  A certain line of argument put forward in this House&mdash;it was put forward here as recently as yesterday&mdash;suggests that because our main industry is agriculture, and because agriculture is dependent upon the price levels fixed by exports, it should be the policy of the Government to ensure that the raw materials of agriculture will be admitted freely into this country. That may seem to be a plausible argument to anyone appealing for farmers' support, and, because it sounds plausible, I intend to deal with it here and now, because I am not prepared to accept it entirely.</P>
    <P>If we accept the view that the raw materials of agriculture should be admitted freely, should not be restricted by tariffs, we eventually come to the position wherein practically all protection for home industry must be withdrawn, because almost all manufactured goods are ultimately the raw material of agriculture.  It is only necessary to mention clothing.  If the price of the clothing which the farmer and his worker require increases, the cost of living of the farmer and his worker increases.  That naturally increases the wages which the worker must demand, thereby adding to the farmer's costs, so that the position is that it is not only feeding stuffs, agricultural machinery and so on which are the raw materials of agriculture. <Col N="462" /> Clothing and practically every other commodity produced here must be regarded as raw material for agriculture, and it is not an entirely honest argument to suggest that the raw materials of agriculture should be admitted freely.</P>
    <P>It is an attempt to deceive a number of our people, and particularly farmers and farm workers, into adopting an attitude of hostility to industrial development here.  I do not think the farmers are innocent or foolish enough to allow themselves to be fooled by that type of propaganda.  The farmer is a producer, a very essential and important producer, but he regards the genuine Irish manufacturer as a very important producer also, and he will not be misled or fooled into attacking the genuine and sound industrialist.</P>
    <P>I do not accept, and have never accepted, the view that the prices of agricultural produce and, therefore, the income of the farmer, are governed entirely by the price of our exportable surplus and, because I do not accept that view, I do not accept the conclusion that, in order to bring our cost of production down to whatever level our exportable surplus may reach, we should resist and oppose industrial development here.  I believe it is wrong, criminally wrong, to try to use the horny hand of the farmer to tear down whatever has been achieved in the matter of industrial development and, speaking as a farmer and a member of a Farmers' Party, I am not going to be a party to such an attempt.</P>
    <P>I know that tremendous problems in relation to industrial development will face us after the war.  We have a position in which we are to a large extent badly supplied with industrial raw materials.  We have always been up against that difficulty, but there is, nevertheless, a wide field for manufacturing industry, and, with the progress of science, that field will continue to become wider as time goes on.  I believe that with the production or the invention of various plastic and composite materials and their substitution to a great extent for mineral products, there will be opportunities for the development of industry based on home <Col N="463" /> supplies of vegetable and other raw materials; but the first and most important basis of industrial development is a supply of fuel, and, by fuel, I mean industrial fuel.  Since we have not got coal in this country, our main dependence and reliance must be on white coal, electricity.  Every conceivable source of electrical power should be tapped to the utmost of its capacity.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the programme of rural electrification and to the possibility of providing within this country the raw materials for the manufacture of electrical equipment and supplies, but he did not refer to the possibility and desirability of expanding production of current.  This is a very vital matter when we consider that at the moment our supplies of electric current are so deficient in relation to our needs.  In any plans the Minister may have in regard to post-war development, he must put the development of electrical power first and over all.  It is to the credit of this State that in its early stages we had electrical development on a large scale.  I am sure the Minister will not seek to take anything from the credit which is due to his predecessors in that respect.  There is need for and I think there is room for wide development.  That should be the first and most important consideration in regard to post-war planning for industry.  Industry cannot be efficient or profitable unless there is a cheap, native source of power.</P>
    <P>Another matter mentioned by the Minister is one in which there has been some development during the emergency period, that is the shipbuilding industry.  It ought to be one of the Minister's regrets that he did not embark earlier on the development of that most important industry.  We are an island nation, and we can never hope fully to develop our resources or fully to develop our external trade until we have our own merchant fleet, with an adequate industry for the production and repair of ships.  I would be inclined to put the development of the shipbuilding industry and the development of a mercantile marine <Col N="464" /> second in importance to the development of home-produced electric current.</P>
    <P>The next matter to which the Minister referred, and it is of supreme importance, was the building industry. Here again I hold that we should rely to the maximum extent upon home-produced materials.  As far as it is possible, we should eliminate the use of foreign materials from the construction of houses and from the other constructional works in which we will engage.  The cement industry, one of the industries developed in this country in recent years, has apparently proved to be sound and efficient.  For that reason, it requires to be still further expanded, until we are in a position to supply all our needs in the vast constructional development after the war. Not only in regard to buildings but in regard to streets, roads, bridges, and so on, we ought to have ample supplies of home-produced cement.</P>
    <P>Tourist development is a matter which affects my constituency very deeply.  Here also is an industry which is capable of very wide expansion.  I have heard complaints from those engaged in the hotel business that the powers of the Tourist Board are excessive, and that they are not entirely justifiable inasmuch as the Tourist Board has a judicial function in regard to the manner in which hotels are carried on.  The board has power to put any hotel-keeper out of business, and for that reason it may be regarded as in the same position as a court of justice.  As such, I hold that the Tourist Board should not at the same time compete with the ordinary hotel-keeper. It seems to me that those two functions cannot be reconciled&mdash;the function of deciding whether a hotel keeper is managing his hotel properly and the function of setting up a rival business and competing with that hotel-keeper.  That seems to me to be a departure from every principle of fairplay and justice.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I want to make it very clear that, while we as farmers stand firmly for the preservation of sound Irish industries, and for the protection and promotion of industrial development, we are entirely opposed to everything <Col N="465" /> that might savour of favouritism for any particular industry.  We are also against any exploitation of the general public by any industry.  The Minister referred to the fact that there is a number of what he called single firm industries in this country.  He defined single firm industries as single firms which cater or set out to cater entirely for the supply of a particular commodity. There is always a danger, where a monopoly is placed in the hands of one firm or even of a small group of firms, that injustice may be done to the general public, or that inefficiency may creep into the management of that business.  It will be the duty of this House, and the duty of the Minister, to see that, where protection is afforded to such industries, there is no exploitation of the public as a result of it.</P>
    <P>Last year there came to the notice of Deputies of this House a circular sent out by a manufacturer in which the Minister was charged with having given certain privileges in regard to the import of essential materials in the clothing trade to one particular firm, and the firm in question was charged with exploiting their position by overcharging the other manufacturers engaged in the clothing business.  These are very serious charges, and they got very wide publicity.  I have no doubt that the Minister knows the firm to which I am referring, and I mention the matter in order that he may have an opportunity of replying to those charges.  The charges were that one particular firm was given a monopoly for the importation of certain essential commodities required for the manufacture of women's and children's clothing and that they exploited their position to overcharge, to the detriment of other manufacturers engaged in the same business.  In that connection, I do not see why a monopoly should be given to one particular firm where goods have to be imported.  If certain goods must be imported, then I think that a licence to import should be given to anybody who has been in the habit of importing them.  We had almost the same position in regard to the development of home-grown seeds.  A monopoly was given to two firms, whereas the other <Col N="466" /> firms which had been engaged in the import of seeds were completely cut out.  Now, I do not think that that can be justified.  If goods have to be imported, then I think that the firms engaged in the business concerned should be allowed to continue to import freely.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that whatever developments may be intended for industry after the war, the essential factor is to ensure, first of all, that there is efficiency within those particular industries, and, secondly, that profiteering is eliminated.  Undoubtedly, there has been profiteering in many branches of our industries, and many arguments have been put up to justify that profiteering.  I hold that the State, having intervened, as it must intervene, in order to prevent the free importation of goods from all parts of the world, must bear full responsibility for ensuring that the interests of the home consumer are adequately protected.  There are two definite lines of policy.  One is to adopt a policy of free trade, give the consumer the benefit of the goods and commodities produced in every part of the world, and thereby ensure that prices will be kept at a competitive level.  If you interfere with the ordinary law of supply and demand, if you interfere with the free importation of goods and commodities into the country, then you must follow that interference to its logical conclusion and ensure that the people of the country are protected as they are bound to be protected and should be protected.</P>
    <P>As far as the ordinary farmers of this country are concerned, they will co-operate with sound industrial development.  They are prepared to regard the genuine manufacturer as their brother, their fellow-producer; and the manufacturer in this country who is engaged in the production of goods, whether agricultural machinery, clothing, or any other essential commodity, is second only to the food producer, and he is most essential if we are to maintain a self-reliant and independent nation here, because there is no doubt that we cannot contemplate <Col N="467" /> a decline in our population since that is what must inevitably come about if we do not promote the development of secondary industries here.  Our population must decline if we do not develop these industries.</P>
    <P>In speaking privately to a gentleman who has been very active in advocating free trade, I have learned from him that he believes in free emigration. Well, that is one line of policy, but it is a line of policy which I can never support, and I do not think this House will ever support it.  If we are not to develop secondary industries, then we have to do either of two things.  We have to maintain a large section of our people in complete idleness or, alternatively, emigrate them to some other country.  Now, I do not believe that any section of this House will seriously support either of those alternatives, and, therefore, we are faced with the position that there is no alternative to a policy of intensive development of sound industrial enterprises within this State.  That is the policy which this Party will wholeheartedly support, and no matter what pleas are put forward to the effect that industrial development is detrimental to the farmers' interests, we, as practical farmers, believe that it would be far more detrimental to our interests if we, the agricultural producers, were called upon to support in absolute idleness those who are now engaged in industrial employment in this country, and we believe that it would also be detrimental to the interests of the farmers or the farm workers if we were to permit a situation to develop in which all the people who might possibly find employment in secondary industries should be exported to the ends of the earth.  I do not think that any farmer or farm worker relishes the prospect of exporting his children or his children's children to the ends of the earth in order to seek their means of livelihood.  For that reason I believe it is time that a halt should be called to the type of dishonest propaganda which seeks to claim that the farmers' interests are detrimentally affected by those of the manufacturers, because I have made it clear in this House over <Col N="468" /> a number of years that I do not accept the view that the farmers' means of livelihood are dependent upon the price level of the export of our agricultural surplus.  Because of that, I believe we can build up an economic system here in which the manufacturer and the farmer, both working with the highest degree of efficiency, can increase the volume of output both in industry and agriculture until we reach the position in which we can maintain our entire population without having to resort to either the export of our people or the maintenance of a large section of our people on the dole.</P>

      <P>There is one point which I wish to put to the Minister.  In the case of persons who are eligible for unemployment benefit and whose residence is six or more miles from the nearest branch of the Department of <Col N="469" /> Industry and Commerce, I understand that it is not necessary for such people to register at such a branch and that it is sufficient for them to register at the local Gárda barracks.  What is happening is that evidence of unemployment is taken from the applicant on, I think, the Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of each week.  His entitlement to benefit, apparently, is computed on Friday, and I think he is notified on Friday evening of the amount of benefit due to him, while at the same time the post office for the area is similarly notified of the amount of benefit to be paid in that area and of the names of the persons entitled to benefit.  I understand that these notifications reach the head office in the area on Saturday and the applicant for benefit whose claim has been granted does not get benefit until the week commencing Monday.  Monday on the following week is the earliest day on which he can get benefit.  I want to put it to the Minister that it is customary to shop on Fridays and Saturdays, and the fact that these people have to wait until Monday or perhaps Tuesday for their benefits seriously interferes with their normal domestic arrangements.  There may be administrative difficulties in the way of having the benefit paid on Saturday, but I put it to the Minister that it is not an insurmountable difficulty and that he should examine this question sympathetically with a view to coming to some arrangement whereby these people can be paid on Saturday so that they might be able to do their shopping at the same time as the rest of the community and not be compelled to wait until the following week to purchase necessaries which their more happily circumstanced neighbours can purchase at the week-end.  I do not think there can be any serious difficulty in the way of having these payments made on Saturdays and I am sure, having brought the matter to the Minister's notice, that he will examine the position as sympathetically as he can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made reference to coal production and announced that he intends to amalgamate the Slievardagh Coal Company with the Mineral <Col N="470" /> Development and Exploration Company. Anything that makes for increased coal production in this country has much to commend it and I am not at all satisfied that we are handling our coal development problem in a competent or satisfactory way.  It is perfectly true that since the outbreak of war production has increased from the standpoint of coal mining, but it is equally true that the amount of coal produced in the country is absurdly inadequate for our national requirements. All the evidence clearly indicates that if coal mining is carried on on its present basis, with even the rate of progress recorded during the present year, we are not likely to get a fragment of our requirements.  I have no faith in a scheme of coal mining which relies on a few small companies with very limited capital, hopelessly inadequate technical equipment, and with no sense of vision such as would induce them to plan a scheme of training of miners in the highly important and skilled task of winning coal from the earth.  I see no future for coal mining in this country if we have to rely on small companies whose main incentive is, not to produce coal, but to make profit out of such coal as can be easily got either by mining or quarrying.  Quarrying is really the method followed in many cases.</P>
    <P>It has been stated on high technical authority that there are millions of tons of coal in the Leinster coalfield. The head of the Geological Survey Department reported some years ago that he was satisfied from his technical knowledge and by geological survey of the coalfields that there was an abundance of coal in what is described as the Leinster coalfield.  It may be that a geological survey is not the most reliable method by which you can ascertain the actual extent of coal deposits and that a closer approximation of the actual deposits can be arrived at by boring the coalfields to ascertain the extent and the depths of the deposits.  In that way it is said that a much more reliable record can be made of the coal deposits which are available.  I suggest to the Minister, however, that he must now realise the vital necessity of developing whatever <Col N="471" /> coal deposits we have.  The emergency has taught us the lesson that it is bad national housekeeping to allow coal deposits to remain undeveloped while our industries are wilting because of the difficulty of procuring supplies of imported coal.  I think, therefore, not only from the national point of view but from the point of view of winning a very valuable raw material from our soil, from the point of view of securing regular employment for a substantial section of the male population, we should endeavour to develop these coal deposits to a very much greater extent than is operative at present.</P>
    <P>I believe that the only satisfactory way in which we can develop the coalfields in this country is by the adoption of the same methods as were employed for production of electricity.  Nobody believes that the Shannon scheme would ever have been developed by private enterprise.  It could be developed only by the State.  It was made an outstanding success by the State and brought to a stage where no doubt private speculators would be willing to purchase it because of the income accruing and its dividend-distributing potentialities.  If we are going to develop the coalfields I believe that can be done only by the same methods as made the Shannon scheme a success, by the State recognising that the production of coal is vital to the national life, by creating an organisation, a public utility society, such as the Electricity Supply Board, by developing coal deposits and mineral development generally with the credit resources of the State. I do not put that forward as a kind of economic dogma at all but I think, having examined the position of the production of coal under the small under-capitalized coal mining companies in this country, we are never likely to get a satisfactory scheme of coal development under such a system here.  If we are going to get coal we must abandon reliance on a small group of speculators, small companies, and insist that development must be at the hands of the State which alone has the technical equipment, which alone has the capital and which alone <Col N="472" /> is able to look at the matter in that long term way in which it is not possible for the small investor to look at it.</P>
    <P>One other matter to which I should like to refer briefly is, the unemployment insurance code in this country. The Unemployment Insurance Act was originally passed in 1920.  There have been some modifications of the Act but its main financial structure, as far as this country is concerned, has now stood for 24 years.  I do not think that anybody can pretend to be satisfied either with the early structure of the Act, modified by such amendments as have been made in the meantime, or with the Act as it is administered now. The Act, in my opinion, has one very serious flaw.  I am not unfamiliar with the difficulties of remedying that flaw, once the Act was put into operation on its original basis, but the normal position under the Act, if we eliminate the recent emergency increases which have been granted to meet the increase in the cost of living, is that an unemployed craftsman, having lost employment in which he earned £4 a week, gets a sum of only 15/- per week unemployment benefit. If he is married he gets 5/- for his wife and 1/- for each child.  The result is that a man in these circumstances who is unemployed has got to content himself with a standard of living in the form of unemployment insurance benefit, which bears no relation whatever to his normal earning capacity or his normal income whereas you have a man, who earns a very much lesser wage receiving approximately the same rate of benefit, the rate of benefit in the second case representing a high percentage of the man's wages when employed.</P>
    <P>I know, of course, that it will be said, as against that, that there is a standard rate of contribution and consequently a standard rate of benefit. Personally I would prefer if there were a variation in the amount of contribution and in the amount of benefit because I think in circumstances such as these, when a worker is employed at a high rate of wages because of his particular skill, he would probably prefer to insure during periods of employment for a higher rate of unemployment <Col N="473" /> benefit.  Under the Act there is no means by which he can do that.  No matter what his inclination might be to provide a higher rate of unemployment insurance benefit for himself and his family while unemployed, he is caught in the treadmill and he can only pay the same contribution as everybody else. He has no means of making provision for the adversity which takes the form of unemployment.  I suggest to the Minister that the present is the best opportunity we are likely to get for an examination of the whole unemployment insurance code.  After the war, other problems will demand urgent and unremitting attention and it is unlikely that a matter of this kind will get the detailed examination and sympathetic consideration that will be necessary if we are to adapt the Act so as to meet the circumstances of to-day in this country.  In the post-war period, it will be pleaded against any demand for an amendment of the Act and for its more sympathetic administration that there are many pressing problems to be dealt with and that modification or amendment of the unemployment insurance code is not a matter that can be given precedence over the other and, perhaps, in the circumstances, more pressing problems. I suggest that the present time, when the activities of the Department of Industry and Commerce must be modified to a considerable extent by external causes, should be availed of for the purpose of examining the unemployment insurance code.  I know that trade unions organised through the Trade Union Congress have been anxious to get amendments made in the Unemployment Insurance Act.  I am sure that they would welcome an examination of the whole unemployment insurance code.  I suggest to the Minister that, in a matter of this kind, he should consult at the earliest possible date the Trade Union Congress, which represents organised workers and represents in the main insurable workers, with a view to setting up a committee to examine the whole question of the administration and financial basis of the unemployment <Col N="474" /> insurance code so as to amend it in such a manner as will bring it more into conformity with present needs and import into the code the benefit of the experience gained during the past 24 years in its adminstration here.  The present structure is an outmoded structure.  It probably, suited the circumstances of 20 years ago but experience has revealed many flaws in the Act and in its administration.  I think that the Minister might usefully, especially with an eye to post-war development, have the whole unemployment insurance code examined with a view to making it a better instrument for serving the purpose for which it was originally devised&mdash;providing a reasonable amount of unemployment insurance benefit while persons are involuntarily unemployed.</P>
    <P>The Minister made reference to the unemployment position here.  He expressed the opinion that the unemployment figures were less than they had been, but I think he admitted that that was due to the fact that there had been substantial emigration in recent years.  If those who emigrated during the past three or four years had insisted on remaining in Ireland and had insisted that the Irish Government should provide them with a decent means of livelihood in their own land, we would to-day have an appalling unemployment problem.  Because Britain was at war and the emigrant ship was waiting for large numbers of our people, who were attracted by the prospect of regular employment at high rates of wages, our unemployment problem has been substantially diminished.  As I said, we had no right to expect those people to leave their own country in search of employment. We had no right to export those people to another country which offered them a standard of living which we were too lazy to provide for them here.  We had no right to send those people into British munition factories and into the British Army to seek a livelihood there which they could not get here.  It is only the docility of those people in going to work for a living there that has diminished the intensity of our unemployment problem.  If we have not as serious an unemployment <Col N="475" /> problem to-day as we would otherwise have, it is because sheer want and economic adversity drove large numbers of our people to seek in Britain the employment they could not get here.  They are there at the moment.</P>
    <P>One finds it hard to prophesy with any pretence to accuracy regarding the economic situation which will develop in Britain at the end of the war.  One viewpoint is that there will be a considerable amount of work available after the war in construction schemes. Another viewpoint is that, when the war is over, the military spree which is on at present will have to be paid for and the inevitable effect will be that there will be widespread depression, so that Britain, having regard to her economic set-up and methods of production, will be able to live only by exporting her goods.  The question then arises as to whether other countries will be in a position to purchase goods from Britain.  Our emigrants may find employment for their energies in Britain or they may have to come home in large numbers because of lack of employment there.  There is a third possibility, that a cycle of depression in Britain may force down the standard of wages there and make it impossible for those people to do as they are doing at present&mdash;keeping a home here as well as maintaining themselves in Britain.  If, because of depression in Britain, or because their services are not required there after the war, large numbers of these emigrants come back, I suggest that they will create for us a very serious situation. Normally, we ought to welcome them back.</P>
    <P>Every country in the world with a small population is endeavouring so to direct its social policy as to increase its population.  The Government of New Zealand believes that what it requires to effect an enormous increase in the prosperity of that country is not the sending of New Zealanders to Britain but the multiplication of New Zealanders at home.  We ought to be welcoming back our emigrants after the war.  Many of them would prefer to come back and work here, but the difficulty I see is that, if we have no <Col N="476" /> plans for their absorption in industry or agriculture after the war, a very serious economic and social problem will arise.  These men and women have been used to high rates of wages in Britain&mdash;rates of wages which bought them a passport to excitement, a passport to a regular standard of living, a passport to pleasures they could not purchase on the wages which they had been earning here.  When these folk come back with unemployment cards in their pockets, it will not be easy to tell them to go to the labour exchange to look for £1 a week on which to sustain themselves.  It will not be easy to tell them to go to the home assistance officer to look for outdoor relief.  Those folk will have worked under conditions in which that kind of green and red tape will make very little appeal to them.  They will have lived in a country torn by war, and will put a valuation, a strength of mind, of arm and of character on conditions here much more than they did in the past.  They will come back here and ask for their heritage, the right to a decent life in their own land.</P>
    <P>If it is not provided for them a very serious situation will arise here.  It is because I do not want that situation to arise, because I want to see them rehabilitated with the maximum smoothness into agricultural and industrial activities, that I suggest to the Minister and the Government that they ought to reveal to the nation, in as much detail as is practicable, what their post war plans are.  They ought to indicate what direction these plans will take, and even now might circulate what might be described as a blue print of post-war plans, so as to give the community an opportunity of bringing intelligence to bear on the feasibility of such plans, and give the Dáil a similar opportunity of examining the details, away from that rigidity, from that type of convention and maze of procedure, inseparably associated with the implementation of plans in the form of a Bill going through this House.  I think the Government should take the House into its confidence and reveal, in as much detail as is possible, its post-war plans so that we can create an informed view of their practicability. <Col N="477" /> Everybody will wish the Government well in its efforts in the immediate post-war period to raise the standard of living here and to absorb the maximum number of returned emigrants.  It is for that reason I urge the Minister very strongly, in regard to post-war plans, which are entirely a Government function, that there ought to be national post-war planning, and that they should invite, and endeavour to get, the maximum measure of cooperation in any plans that are devised for the advancement of our economic fabric, and especially for the purpose of re-absorbing into industry large numbers who are now out of this country.  Large numbers of men will be discharged from the Army when the war ends, as well as large numbers who found employment in the auxiliary services.</P>
    <P>Under the circumstances it was not possible for the Minister to review all the activities of the Department, which were commendable, especially having regard to the difficulties surrounding him in respect of industrial activities which are not under our own control, but are conditional, in a large measure, in present circumstances on the international situation, and by the inadequacy of the raw materials necessary to develop secondary industries. A detailed discussion of the Minister's plans now or next year would serve no useful purpose, in view of the circumstances into which we have been precipitated by the international situation, but one can at all events give the Minister broad directions as to the mind of the House on industrial development in the post-war period.  We are a nation of 3,000,000 and it is our duty to plan a way of life in order to provide industries and employment for our people.  At present agriculture represents, and will continue to represent, the real wealth of the country. The productivity of the land represents the greatest source of wealth of our people and it will determine their standard of living.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that it would be wise national policy to develop to the fullest extent secondary industries in the immediate post-war period.  Industries suitable for development here ought to be developed in the most efficient way.  I do not mean by that, that every person who wants to do so should be allowed to put up a factory in a tumbledown shed in a back lane, with three sheets of corrugated iron as a roof, and with every pane of glass in the windows broken.  There ought to be an insistence that such factories should conform to certain minimum standards, and they should be high standards, as to the suitability of these industries for development, and the qualifications of persons claiming the ability to be able to do so, should be carefully scrutinised. Such industries should be adequately capitalised, and there should be evidence of ability to create expansion.  In addition firms ought to be licensed, and their right to continue in industrial activity should be related to the standard of efficiency of each industry and by the standard of wages provided for workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody wants to see industries grow up here that employ only young girls at notoriously inadequate rates of wages.  What we want in the main is to try to develop industries that will provide employment for married men, the bread-winners and their sons, which in the main will give regular employment, where possible to males, believing as we do, that when the heads of families are provided for, in that way you ensure for the family the best protection against the shock of low wages and the poverty that goes with low wages.  I suggest to the Minister that he will find widespread support <Col N="479" /> for the view of protecting substantial industries.  Let us bear in mind that nations which are able to plan gigantic operations in France, as well as the nations that are able to put up a substantial measure of resistance during the course of this war, will have the minds that stimulated the wonderful mechanised and scientific development that has taken place during the war.  We may find such a situation then, in our circumstances, in which we will not be able to export £1 of industrial goods because of competition from elsewhere.  That situation might be met by endeavouring to develop the home market for industrial goods, and that can only be done by protecting our industries against foreign competition.</P>
    <P>As far as the farmers are concerned, I disagree with the view of Deputy Dillon in asking for freedom to allow into the country all types of industrial products that they require.  We could do that, but we would pay a heavy price for it.  If that was to be the policy of economic development here, then farmers would be in the position that they would be endeavouring to produce food and agricultural wealth, but if the workers in the towns and cities could not get employment, then the farmers would have to carry these on their backs.  If farmers are to produce they are faced with the problem of selling in the towns and cities where there is regular employment for workers at decent rates of wages.  The best market for Irish farmers is the Irish market, and it is the only market that can be protected for them.  Being on a parity with sterling, Irish farmers have to take in the British market any price that is going, and have not the slightest influence on price levels of agricultural experts on the British markets.  His best, his safest, and his most stable market is the Irish market. Farmers ought to realise that they can preserve the Irish market for themselves by providing regular employment for town and city workers, by creating in the towns and cities a demand for agricultural goods.  When that has been created by the regular employment of city and town workers, <Col N="480" /> it will sustain the farmer and bring prosperity to agriculture.  When there is prosperity in agriculture, the farmer and his worker will then come into the towns and cities looking for the goods and services which are produced there and in that way you set up a cycle of prosperity from the town to the rural areas and from the rural areas to the towns.  I do not want to delay the House further in view of the general acceptance of the time limit on speeches.  I put it to the Minister that any plan to develop our secondary industries, which is based on efficiency and a decent standard of living for those employed in industry, he will have the warm-hearted support of this Party.</P>

      <P>When I visited the district where the Clare phosphates are being dug out, there was as little excitement there as one would see on a primitive country road.  I was not very much impressed at the output. The output of 12,000 tons there will not go far to meet the demand of 100,000 tons, which is the Minister's estimate of the requirements of the country.  That quantity will be of very little use when we think of the amount of phosphates the land needs as a result of the extra tillage.  It may very well lead to a collapse in food production. The Minister referred to the coal mines at Slievardagh in East Tipperary. He referred to what he described as the pirate coal which farmers are not allowed to dig out of the land.  It is a mineral which is regarded as the property of the nation since the Land Commission bought out the land. Personally, I do not think there would be anything wrong, especially during the emergency period, in allowing those farmers to dig out a little bit of coal here and there.  The Arigna coal mines have been very well developed and there is a tremendous export of coal from them.  Why it was that the Government did not get machinery to develop the Slievardagh mines, I do not know.  It is a mystery to us down in Tipperary.  At present the coal could be dug out, and if that were allowed it would give a good deal of employment to the people.  The geological experts <Col N="481" /> report that the coal deposits there compare favourably in quality with the Arigna coal.</P>
      <P>On the main Dublin to Cork road, between Cahir and Mitchelstown, at a place called Kilcoran, there is some little dispute about a roadway to the Galtees.  There miles from that road there is an inexhaustible supply of the best of turf.  It has been suggested that the road should be reconditioned so that the turf which is there to a depth of 30 or 40 feet might be developed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamFrancisODonne" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>As coal was being discussed, I thought that turf, being a kindred subject, might also be discussed. There is splendid turf there, and it is a pity that it is not being developed.  The Minister spoke about his post-war plans and the employment that will be given.  Recently, a White Paper was laid on the Table of the British House of Commons&mdash;I believe as a result of a suggestion that was made in this House&mdash;in connection with a national water survey.  It got wide publicity from the daily newspapers in England and from agricultural papers circulating in that country. A search in the archives of the British House of Commons revealed that an estimate was made some years ago of the cost of putting water into every rural home in England, Scotland and Wales. The estimate was £24,000,000.  For Scotland alone, it was £6,500,000, and that would be about the cost, I suppose, of a similar scheme here. Our Party intends putting down a motion at a convenient date dealing with this subject.  A scheme of that sort would give a tremendous amount of employment.  Proposals in favour of it have already been adopted by 16 county councils.  The original proposal came from the South Tipperary County Council.  Deputies who come from the rural areas know all the drudgery there is in drawing water to farms. Personally, I think that a water survey has a prior claim over further electricity development, although I must say <Col N="482" /> that I am 100 per cent. pro-electric myself.  I know the needs of our farmers well.  I put water No. 1, and electricity would not come far behind it, from the point of view of the advantage and convenience it would be to farmers.</P>
      <P>About three months ago the newspapers announced that the Government had in mind the promotion of an electric lighting scheme for the country which is estimated to cost £30,000,000.  That would mean the supply of electricity at the expense of waterless farms.  I do not see eye-to-eye with a proposal of that sort. Water, in my opinion, has first claim, though we want electricity as well.  It was suggested in the newspapers some time ago that it was possible to get electricity from the sea.  If we take Athlone as the centre of the country, no area would be more remote from the sea than, say, 40 miles.  It should be possible to develop electricity from the sea and from the rivers of Ireland. The catchment areas from which water is supplied to the rivers could be used for the waterless farms.  The hydro-electrical engineers are a very powerful body, but yet we have nobody to look after our waterless farms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that 39,000 of our people had emigrated to England in recent times.  Percy French said that our principal exports to England were bullocks and emigrants. In the early days of Sinn Féin&mdash;40 years ago&mdash;the late Arthur Griffith and David P. Moran made a special study of this subject.  They estimated that every young boy and girl up to the age of 19 who left the country meant a loss to it of £200 each.  I would put the figure myself at £300.  My estimate is that the country is robbed of £300 in the case of every young boy and girl of 19 or 20 years of age who leaves it.  If we take the figure of £200, the amount which the country loses by the emigration of the number of people the Minister mentioned, is £7,800,000, while if my figure of £300 is accepted, the loss runs up to £11,500,000.  That is a very serious consideration.  Yet we have also £300,000,000 of Irish capital exported from this country, while those electricity and water <Col N="483" /> schemes are needed.  The farmhouse near the mountain to the centre of the plains produced that wealth, which passed into the hands of the merchants and was exported.  I suppose there is about £40,000,000 in Burma at present which, if the war takes a certain turn, will not be worth the paper it is written on.  That money should not have been allowed out of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>You cannot develop very much without money.  The money is needed and I respectfully submit that this has a great bearing on it. The most important problem at the moment is that we cannot get men to work on the farm.  A fellow passed along the road the other day, who was supposed to be unemployed, and there were 20 or 30 people looking after him. Here is the harvest facing us and we cannot get anyone to work, while we are working 14 hours a day ourselves. Much has been said about the unemployment here, but I could place 300 men at the moment if I could get them in Tipperary.  Deputy Norton has been speaking about unemployment, but I do not know what is to happen when the men come back from England, unless we have big schemes and the money is not allowed out of the country, as it was in the past.  In regard to getting hold of the banks, Deputy Flanagan will have to look after that, as I could not deal with Professor O'Rahilly.  Somebody will have to see that work is provided for all.</P>

      <P>With regard to the matter spoken of by Deputy Norton and my colleague, Deputy O'Donnell, it is quite true that it is very difficult to get sufficient labour for farm work at the moment; but Deputy O'Donnell knows as well as I do that there is a reason for that, that it is not the fault of the unemployed. For the last two, three or four years, the farmers were able to employ and pay men but Deputy O'Donnell knows they could not do that in the previous <Col N="484" /> six or eight years.  What employment was available for men on the farm then and what farmer could pay them?  Because they could not get employment and wages on the land, they had to leave the country.  That is the answer, and everyone knows it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell knows quite well the farmers are able to pay men now and are paying them. There is no use in trying to evade the point I made, which he knows perfectly well is true.  He himself has reason to know that it is true, that six or eight years ago they were not able to pay men.  However, I do not wish to develop that point further.</P>
      <P>We have heard the names of the plans which the Government has in mind for post-war work and, in that respect, so far as the type of work is concerned, most of the schemes under examination, we are told, are needed in the country and will be reproductive. But there seems to be a great mystery about them.  Neither in this House nor in the country do we know by whom the schemes are being examined.  We do not know whether any bodies which are formulating, examining or analysing these schemes have amongst their number any men of practical experience or of expert scientific knowledge, or whether those bodies are composed purely of men drawn from the Civil Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whilst the projects are sound and good for the country in themselves&mdash; rural electrification, housing, roads, drainage and so on&mdash;can anyone say that they will be available to do any good immediately after the war? From what I can learn so far, I do not believe that any one of the big schemes mentioned will be started for at least five years after the war.  I want to know what proposals the Government have which can be put into operation immediately the war finishes.  I am afraid of the five-year gap between the end of the war and the coming into operation of the Government's post-war schemes.  The <Col N="485" /> only one scheme we have any knowledge of is that contained in the recent Arterial Drainage Bill.  Long before the Arterial Drainage Bill was prepared, a lot of the material on which it was based had been collected in the country.  Drainage will be one of the most important things in providing employment and assisting the development of agriculture and should be one of the most important schemes; but we are told that it will be five years after the war at least before it is started and that it will be at least 28 years before the draining of the country is finished.  Does anybody think that that so-called progressive mentality will produce for us the schemes which we will want immediately after the war?  The scheme which will require less machinery than any other, which will give more work to unskilled labour than any other, regarding which most of the information is now at the disposal of the Board of Works, is to take five years to get started after the war&mdash;and one knows what happens when the Department says it will take five years.</P>

      <P>That can be found in the Official Reports.  I put it to the House for its consideration that it will be fatal if we go on in this easy sort of way.  We should have plans ready to put our men at work immediately the war is over.  We certainly will not, unless there is a complete and radical change.  We have not got one piece of official information with regard to any scheme outside what we got in connection with the Drainage Bill.</P>
      <P>The British Government have been mentioned.  Notwithstanding the fact that they are fighting for their lives, the British Government have produced and presented White Papers on four or five of the more important aspects of their national life.  There is a paper on fuel and one on employment; another has been produced as a result of conferences between farmers and farm workers; another paper deals with medical and health services and there is a paper concerned with electricity development.  With all their war preoccupations, with the whole of their national resources going into the production of war materials, they have found time to get commissions and committees to consider various aspects of their national problems; they have got expert and practical information from working farmers, medical men and social workers of all descriptions in order to present reports, and they have circulated those reports not only to their Parliament but to their people; these reports are available to any person in Great Britain or in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="487" /> We do not know what our Government are doing.  We are told there are plans in contemplation.  Figures have been mentioned&mdash;anything from £69,000,000 to £138,000,000.  What we have to concern ourselves with is that if the war ended three months from now and if, within another three months, there were 50,000 men sent back from Britain and another 30,000 or 40,000 released from our Army, what would we be able to do with them?  It has been said, and quite truly said, that our main hope for useful permanent employment is agriculture. Is there a farmer in Ireland to-day who has any idea of what his position will be 12 months after this war is over?  Can he estimate what prices he will get for anything he produces? He has not been given any indication in that connection.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that prices will be worsened, or that there will be any revolutionary switch-over 12 months or two years post-war from our present type of farming, but the fact is that no one can estimate what the position will be like.  The farmers have not been given any guarantees and I suggest they should be given some idea of the position of agriculture in the post-war period.  Notwithstanding the fixed maximum prices Orders, there are farmers to-day in this country who, if they want to save the harvest&mdash;the corn which they have grown, some of them because they were compelled to grow it&mdash;are paying as much as £200 for a second-hand reaper and binder. Is a farmer to be expected to pay £200 for a reaper and binder that he does not know will be of any use to him two years from now?  There is too much vagueness and the Government should take the House and the country into their confidence.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton said that, in regard to national affairs, matters affecting the well-being of the State, and in relation in particular to anything that can be done to enable us to face the terribly difficult time immediately post-war, the Minister will have the wholehearted co-operation of every Party. That was, I believe, quite a sincere <Col N="488" /> statement from this side of the House. If we are to be of any use by way of offering constructive criticism or suggestions, we can only be helpful if we know what the Government are aiming at.  The trouble is that they will not tell us.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the question of protection for the farmers or for industries; this is not the time for it. Unlike other members of the House, I am not an expert in financial matters, nor indeed am I an expert in matters relating to tariff reform, or whatever they call it, but I think it is commonsense to say that we know that our industries in the last 20 years expanded and were maintained under tremendous difficulties and they had to get every conceivable form of protection and assistance that the State could give them so that they could be given an opportunity to show the people that we were able to produce goods at least as good as could be got from outside. That assistance was given to an extent that, in a great many cases, was unfair to the consumer.  Does anyone deny that to develop and maintain these industries after the war will be ten times more difficult than in pre-war days?</P>
    <P>Does not everybody know that when the war is over the whole economic and social face of the world will be changed as compared with ten or 15 years ago? Do we not well know that there will be very little consideration for small nations such as ours?  Do we not know that whatever the future will be like, it will be moulded largely, if not altogether, by the big nations, particularly by the nations which will be victorious in this war?  I have heard nothing, even during the general election, from any responsible Government spokesman that would lead me to believe that there are any schemes under consideration that can be put into operation and that will absorb our unemployed immediately the war is over.  Farmers are supposed to be enjoying a great measure of prosperity. Comparatively speaking, they are well off, but it must be remembered the country is carrying a load of taxation to the extent of £50,000,000.</P>

      <P>That is not my conception of slave conditions.  I know farmers are working very hard and for very long hours.  They are producing food and fuel for the nation and they are getting paid for it and I know the vast majority of them are not grumbling. They are not grumbling even under this enormous load of taxation. The point I am anxious to bring out is that, whilst we in this country may be able, because of the prices which have been brought about by the war and not by any particular action taken by the Government, to meet that bill of £50,000,000, I doubt if we will be in a position to meet anything like that amount when we are affected by the depression that will almost inevitably come after the war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no use in talking about what cannot be helped.  I know that the most urgent requirement of the farmer is fertilisers.  But if I could be satisfied that, financially, the farmers of this country would not be any worse off in the next ten years than they are to-day, I would be perfectly satisfied.  There are exceptions.  I am talking about the agricultural community in general, and if I could see every other section of the community, particularly the working-class section, and particularly those who will come out of the Army and those who will return from England, in as good a position financially and as assured of three square meals per day as the agricultural community is, I would be perfectly <Col N="490" /> satisfied and probably would not be raising these fears I have about the development of industry to absorb our unemployed.  When we talk about the development of industry, when we talk about post-war plans and schemes, what we are really asking the Government is, what are they doing to see that the working man is going to get employment which will give him enough wages at the end of the week to get at least three meals per day for himself and his dependants.  That is the difference.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. McCarthy Mr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words on some of the points raised by Deputy Morrissey.  He spoke about progressive mentality, but I think he could have included a little retrospection and a little introspection in regard to the facts that he wished to bring out.  He knows quite well that during the period he referred to when, as he states, farmers were unable to pay their workers, there was an inspired and active campaign to prevent wheat-growing.  If that campaign had succeeded, the mills would be idle to-day&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. McCarthy Mr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;there would be no demand for reapers and binders and there would be no complaints about prices.  It would also have prevented the growing of beet which has helped subsidiary industries.  We all know that three new beet factories were established, that at these factories 30,000 tons of coal are used per campaign and that 18,000 to 20,000 tons of that is Irish coal.  The duff that was piling up on the banks of these collieries for years past is now being utilised and is responsible for better returns which enable the collieries to pay more to the workers engaged in them.  Deputy Morrissey should also know that it is the progressive mentality of the Government that enables £7,000 per week to be paid from each factory to the railways for transport, and that that has been responsible for the continuance in employment of workers who could not have been so continued if the condition of affairs that obtained during the six years to <Col N="491" /> which he referred had been allowed to prevail and if the Government had not insisted on its programme being put into effect.</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly, there are steps that must be taken for the further promotion of agriculture and the maintenance of prices for agricultural produce which will enable those engaged in agriculture to maintain their families in some measure of comfort and to pay their workers.  The Government has shown its earnestness in that regard.  Government policy will preserve an equal balance between agriculture and industry by developing the other industries which the Minister for Industry and Commerce referred to in the course of his remarks to-day and on previous occasions.</P>
      <P>There is one point to which I should like to draw attention in regard to industries which are now being developed. Take, for example, our coal mines.  At the commencement of this emergency these coal mines were not able to supply the railways with their requirements and, in some cases, I believe, they stated that it was all they could do to supply their regular customers.  During the emergency they have succeeded in getting extra production.  The Government should insist, when this emergency is over, that those firms who purchased goods from abroad, when they could have used Irish products, will not again adopt that policy, leaving these mines to go out of production or to fall back to the position in which they were at the commencement of the emergency. A certain amount of protection will be needed.  A certain amount of initiative will be required.  A complaint was made in the course of the debate here that there were not more skilled miners.  The obvious reason is that in normal times these mines provided merely for their steady trade.  It should be the object of the Government to maintain the trade that has since been developed.  When the miners are paid a reasonable rate it will encourage more men to become skilled in this particular activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point which I wish to bring before the Minister and before <Col N="492" /> his Department.  In the universities of this country there are departments of geology and various other departments. Instead of working in a purely academic way, I think it would be wise that in co-operation with Government Departments the students who are being trained in the universities should get a knowledge of the practical side of surveying the industries of the country and possible mineral resources.  For example, not far from Crosshaven there is a point where, in the year 1837, 400 men were employed mining lead.  That mine is still there.  I presume it was the famine that caused the closing down of the mine.  The stream flowing down from that mine has considerable lead content and cannot be used for domestic purposes.  In a great part of that area iron was worked in years gone by and the places where it was worked can still be pointed out.  There are chalybeate springs all over the place which show the presence of iron. In former surveys it was said that there was manganese in the composition of the surface.  There is iron ore there. I admit that some of it is bog ore. That bog ore was exported in years gone by for, I think, the purification of certain gases.  At any rate, in my opinion, there is considerable natural mineral wealth in this country, apart from the collieries, and it would pay the Government to make extensive and exhaustive surveys and to use the universities for that purpose.  The university colleges in Dublin could be used in regard to Leinster; in Galway for the west and in Cork for the southern counties.  There is a great sphere of activity there and no purpose can be served by delaying too long in that matter.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to take up the time of the House in referring to all the matters that have been brought before the Dáil in the Minister's statement, but we all know that there are schemes of national development which have been put before the House in the form of Bills which will be enacted in a very short time and to which, surely, the Government means to give effect. It is for Deputies from all sides to co-operate in making the programme of the Government a success.</P>
    <Col N="493" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>One can sympathise with the Minister in the very difficult position in which he finds himself, due to circumstances over which, in the main, he has no control.  I was glad to hear him state that, so far as the future is concerned, he is confident that sufficient iron will be available for blacksmiths to enable them to carry on their work and also to enable the farmers to repair their agricultural machinery.  The Minister also referred to timber and other things and I only hope that he will be able to remove some of the difficulties that obtain at present.  The Minister also referred to the number of people who have gone across to Great Britain. Everybody knows that from time immemorial there has been emigration from this country.  I think the Minister made a rather significant remark in connection with the issuing of exit permits when he said that the issuing of these permits would be contingent upon a sort of guarantee from the British Government that workers going from here would be in a position to return if they found it necessary to do so for sufficient reasons.  I wonder could the Minister give us any idea as to when the ban will be removed on anybody who wishes to go to Great Britain and who has got the offer of employment there, because I think it is unconstitutional to prevent a man from earning his living elsewhere if he cannot do it in his own country.  Notwithstanding the mouthings of Deputy Corry and other backbenchers about all the employment we are providing in this country, the fact remains that large numbers of workers who have been offered work in Great Britain are prevented from going there because they cannot get an exit permit.  That is not right or proper and the Minister should impress upon the Minister for External Affairs the necessity for restoring the <i>status quo</i> in regard to people going from this country to work in Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of Government plans for the solution of the unemployment problem has been raised.  I wonder when will Deputies get it into their heads that no Government in the <Col N="494" /> world can solve the unemployment problem.  A Government can do much by wise and useful legislation to enable those who are giving employment to continue giving it and, if possible, extend that employment.  So far as the Government solving the unemployment problem is concerned, it would possibly suit me as a member of the Opposition to throw the onus on the Government, but I think it would be thoroughly dishonest and unpatriotic.  I think I would be doing a great disservice to the country if, for the sake of getting a few votes, I promulgated from a platform that it is the Government's duty to solve the unemployment problem.  I say it is not. It requires initiative on the part of the people to do something for themselves. In fact, I deplore the tendency of the people of this country to look to the Government for everything.  It does not show much of that self-reliance which we are supposed to have.</P>
    <P>While giving the Government credit for all they have done in starting new industries and the extra employment they have provided, the fact still remains that there are just as many unemployed to-day as there were ten, 12 or 15 years ago if not more.  The population has not increased.  Therefore there must be some reason other than the inactivity of the Government. It is all right for the Government to undertake big schemes involving large sums, such as the Shannon scheme, the beet factories, the new electrification scheme and the scheme of arterial drainage.  As regards drainage, a good part of that could have been done by the farmers themselves and in many instances drainage has been carried out by farmers.  I am longing to see the day, and I hope it will not be long, after the war is over when there will be as little interference as possible on the part of whatever Government is in power with the ordinary business of the country. When all is said and done, the success of any country depends upon the efforts of the individuals who live in the country, and those who pin their faith on the Government to solve their difficulties will meet with great disappointment. <Col N="495" /> As I said, it might suit me, for political purposes, to criticise the Government on that head, but I do not think they can be criticised. The only thing I would criticise the Government for is that at one time they said they had a plan to solve the unemployment problem.  I said then that it could not be done and that at the end of a certain number of years they would be convinced that the view I took was the correct one.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to what will happen when the war is over.  There is a great deal of what you might call bidding the devil good morrow before you meet him.  No one knows what will happen when the war is over.  We all know that things will be changed. We know that it is very difficult to make plans to-day that will suit the post-war period.  Plans might be made to-day which would be obsolete the following year, just as certain types of aeroplanes made during the war are obsolete to-day.  Nobody can tell what the conditions will be when the war is over.  Therefore, it is no use in indulging in wishful thinking or in asking the Government to assume the rôle of prophets so that they will be in a position to plan for the conditions which will exist after the war.</P>
    <P>We have heard about the setting up of industries, and, again in that respect, one would think, listening to many of the Deputies, that we were dealing with one vast continent.  This is only a small country&mdash;somebody described it at one time as a cabbage garden&mdash;but we speak of setting up industries as if we could set them up all over the place and had millions of people to buy the products of these industries.  In fact, we have a very small population and we cannot put very many more people on the land. We hear talk of &ldquo;back to the land&rdquo; and &ldquo;the land will give more employment&rdquo;, but it will not.  In the northern part of my county, there are thousands of farmers who could do with 20 extra acres, and, in face of that state of affairs, which I expect is applicable to most farmers in most counties, what is the use of this talk about getting back to the land and getting more <Col N="496" /> employment on the land, when the man on the land at the moment in many cases has not half enough land to keep those already there fully employed? That is the position as it exists.</P>
    <P>While I do not want to go in for anything in the nature of doleful prophecy, I think the Government would be wise to hasten slowly in the plans they are preparing for the post-war conditions of affairs.  Mention has been made of housing, and, in that respect again, one cannot tell what the future holds.  It is not a question of money.  If we had £1,000,000,000 here to-morrow, we could not build houses because we have not got the material.  There is no use in Deputy O'Donnell talking nonsense about bringing back money invested in foreign countries, as if we could live here and forget all about the outside world.  It is about time we gave up that class of soft, childish talk about bringing back money from abroad and investing it here.</P>
    <P>The position is that we cannot do certain things because we have not got the materials.  I know something about house-building and even if we had the materials, it must be remembered that that trade does not give continuous employment.  Houses last for 60 or 70 years and there is always bound to be unemployment in that trade.  It is not a means towards a permanent solution of unemployment. It is a trade in which employment goes up and down and sometimes more harm than good is done to it by having boom years followed by lean years. Thousands of men are brought into it, but the moment the work is finished, all are idle, including men who have followed that trade for years.  We cannot do things in that fashion in this little country.</P>
    <P>As I say, we need to resign ourselves to the fact that we will be up against difficult times and to resign ourselves to the fact that what people call a decent standard of living is something which can be got only by hard work. There are, of course, many definitions of the phrase, &ldquo;a decent standard of living,&rdquo; but the fact remains that we cannot have all these things and give employment to all these people. <Col N="497" /> Reference has been made to the farmers being in a position to pay, but there is no use in the farmer being able to do so one year and unable to do so the next year.  These are some of the difficulties which will confront not alone the Government but the people, and it is well that we should face them now.  In facing the difficulties which beset us, we must, above all, realise our limitations and we have limitations due to the size of our country.  Being an island, we cannot extend by the amount of land which would sod a lark. We shall have to recognise these facts and possibly with co-operation and a spirit of give and take on all sides, we may be able to surmount our difficulties.</P>
    <P>The great obstacle will be our inclination to do things in a hurry and our anxiety to get results too quickly. Planning will take time.  We are not masters of the situation, no matter how we may try to hide the fact.  We have to depend, and no one knows it better than the Minister, to a very large extent on outside sources for many of the supplies without which we would find it impossible to carry on, even as we have carried on for the last few years.  I am prepared to do all I possibly can to co-operate with the Department because I know the difficulties lie ahead, and it is only by co-operation and a willingness on the part of everyone to make a certain amount of sacrifice that we shall be able to meet and overcome these difficulties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two details to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention which affect the present position very vitally.  It is extremely difficult to discover what is the real situation in regard to permits to go to Great Britain.  I want to say at once that I cannot discharge myself from some responsibility for my inability to understand the regulations because I have had nothing but courtesy and consideration from the Minister's Department in respect of any inquiries I have addressed to them, but this situation prevails.  You get the impression that all permits are stopped for a period and that nobody is allowed to go to England.  Somebody <Col N="498" /> comes in, and says: &ldquo;I want to get to England.&rdquo;  You say: &ldquo;Come back in six weeks' or a couple of months' time because all permits are stopped and nobody is allowed to go, except on urgent Government business and even then only on condition that the business cannot be postponed&rdquo;&mdash; whereupon that fellow's next door neighbour marches in and starts for England the following Tuesday.</P>
      <P>That has happened several times recently.  Whether it is that persons who have got their permits some weeks ago for a future date are still being allowed to go on the permits they got some time ago, or whether it is that there are some exceptional classes of whom I know nothing who are still being permitted to go, I do not understand, but I think most Deputies will have shared my experience, and it would be of material assistance to us all if the Minister could explicitly state what the present position is with regard to exit permits to Great Britain for labour there, and whether in the near future he expects a new situation to obtain in regard to that matter.</P>
      <P>There is a second matter to which I wish to direct the Minister's attention and perhaps he will be good enough to indicate to me if it more appropriately arises on the Vote for Supplies.  In connection with the scarcities which have arisen, the Minister has indicated that it would be of assistance to him if certain trades organised themselves.  Let us take the wholesale leather trade.  What happens is this; a small group of wholesalers combine and establish contact with the tanneries here in Ireland and apparently present the picture to the Minister that they are the only leather wholesalers in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On that basis, a scheme is worked out for the distribution of available leather supplies, and this small body of wholesalers are designated the channel through which supplies must pass from the tanneries to retailers. When the scheme is published, some leather wholesaler in rural Ireland says: &ldquo;I bought my leather wholesale all my life from tanneries in Great Britain and elsewhere.  Now I am being constrained to purchase my <Col N="499" /> leather from a wholesaler in Dublin who is a competitor of mine in the rural area where I operate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As the Minister will readily understand, the wholesale leather merchant's business in rural Ireland consists largely in supplying bends of leather to individual shoe repairers.  From inquiries it will emerge that the rural merchant is a retailer and a wholesaler. Eventually, after a good deal of huggermugger it becomes clear that unless the tanner will indicate his readiness to recognise the shopkeeper as a wholesaler the Minister is not prepared to require the tanner to supply him on wholesale terms.  The tanners have established an agreement with this small group of wholesalers in Dublin.  It is much more convenient for the tanners to dispose of their entire output through four or five large merchants in Dublin, and leave it to those four or five large merchants to distribute it in smaller quantities throughout the country.  There is a price fixed by the Minister from the tanner to the wholesaler; there is a price fixed by the Minister from the wholesaler to the retailer, and then there is a price fixed from the retailer to the individual who wants to buy a pair of soles for his own shoes.  The difficulty is that the cobbler, the shoe repairer in rural Ireland, who buys his bend of leather is entitled to buy his bend of leather from the wholesale monopoly in Dublin at the same price as that at which the rural supplier who, used to supply it is now entitled to get the leather.  That means the rural supplier is completely cut off from his normal wholesale trade, because there is no margin of profit left for him.</P>
    <P>I recognise the difficulties here, but I do think that some kind of independent body, in the Department or elsewhere, should be set up, before which the person who claims to have done a legitimate wholesale trade in the past can place the evidence of his <i>bona fides.</i>  If that independent body is satisfied that the man did engage in a <i>bona fide</i> wholesale trade, the Minister could then direct the tanner to deem such and such to be a wholesale firm for the purpose of the price Orders, <Col N="500" /> to supply him in accordance with whatever quota was fixed for him, and to charge him the price appropriate to a wholesaler.  I will not pursue that matter through all the trades in which the difficulty habitually arises. The Minister knows as well as I do that I am a country shopkeeper, and I could quote various textiles and pins and needles and numerous different commodities, all of which might impress Deputies in the House with my omniscience but would explain the case no more fully to the Minister than the particulars I have given him in respect of the leather trade.  He will find that occurring in various branches of trade, and the same remedy would be adequate in every branch where that difficulty arises.</P>
    <P>I am not inclined to be unduly critical of the Minister, either in his capacity as Minister for Industry and Commerce or as Minister for Supplies, in the present situation in 1944. There is no use in shedding tears over what happened in 1939, 1940 and 1941. Many of us might have done differently from what he did then, but the situation with which we are confronted now is not the situation in 1939 or 1940 or 1941, but the situation in 1944.  So far as I know, I doubt very much if anybody could do very much more than he is doing at the present time to hold together such industrial activity as there is in the country, and secure supplies from the very exiguous sources that still remain to him, and which I believe would not be a bit more abundant no matter what Minister was in Kildare Street.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I turn to the post-war period.  I have said before and I want again to say emphatically that I regard all this talk of planning with considerable suspicion, because my experience of 20 years in public life is that everybody is always most willing to plan me but nobody wants me to plan him.  Everybody is always anxious to plan his neighbour, but when it comes to being planned himself he proceeds to demonstrate that he is quite an exceptional case.  However, I suppose so long as we have zealous creatures in the world at all they will <Col N="501" /> busy themselves about their neighbours' business.  Provided they are kept within certain limits, I suppose it is a harmless enough kind of occupation.  But it does seem to me that there is one work which every reasonable person would agree will have to be undertaken sooner or later; a work which will give immense quantities of employment to the unskilled labourer, the problem child of the unemployment situation; work which can be undertaken without dependence on very large quantities of foreign materials in the immediate post-war period when there may be an acute scarcity of supplies from abroad; and that is the building of a system of roads adequate to carry the bulk of our internal traffic as the railways go to their inevitable decline.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that any reasonable person who has taken any interest at all in transport will long maintain the thesis that in a country the size of Ireland railways were ever economical or now can long survive. Every conceivable transport argument seems to me to indicate the necessity for getting our transport on to the roads.  Transport by rail involves the labour of loading at the point of departure, of transferring to the railway waggon, of unloading from the railway waggon at the point of arrival, reloading and transferring from the railway station to the consignee's yard. Transport by road obviates the whole business of bringing livestock from the fair to the railway station; the very great abuse which the cattle must get from expeditious loading on to specials about to leave the station according to a pretty strict schedule, and the very long time they remain in the waggons with the serious consequential loss.  Picture the difference between consigning goods to a shop in Ballagaderreen by rail and consigning them by road.  Take a consignment coming to the Sligo docks.  It is taken off the ship and the carters' union demands I think 2/6 a ton for carrying it from the ship's side across the quay and depositing it in the warehouse.  It has then to be unwarehoused into the railway waggon.  It comes to a railway junction where the waggon is broken <Col N="502" /> loose, connected on a side line and brought down to Ballaghaderreen.  It is there unwaggoned again, loaded on to horse carts and brought down to my yard.  Compare that with the same consignment on the roads.  The lorry draws up beside the ship, the consignment is put on the lorry, the lorry leaves the ship's side and can drive straight to my stores and unload the merchandise there.</P>
    <P>Take the case of cattle.  There are many excellent fair centres in this country which have no railway sidings at all and from which cattle must be driven, in many cases, eight or ten miles to the nearest railway siding, but even leaving such fairs out of account, and taking into consideration fair centres where you have railway sidings and other conveniences, the cattle have to be driven from the fair down to the railway station, and very few of these railway stations are provided with elaborate cattle pens, with the result that the cattle are driven here and there and battered about in every way until, eventually, accommodation can be provided for them in the railway waggons.  I do not know if the Minister has ever seen cattle being loaded into these railway waggons, but those of us who have seen that operation taking place are aware of the terrible abuse which the cattle often suffer, tails broken and so on, and I think it is right to say that most experienced men in the trade will agree that a beast travelling from the West of Ireland to the North Wall in Dublin may be reckoned to lose&mdash;well, I cannot remember the exact amount, but certainly a very considerable weight in the actual passage.  I think that it could be reckoned as one cwt. of a loss.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>Almost one cwt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is, in the transport from the West of Ireland to the North Wall.  Personally, I think that that is rather a pessimistic figure, but in the case of a beast of 12 or 14 cwt., I think they might lose three-quarters of a cwt. on that journey.  Now, picture that in comparison with a system of specially designed cattle lorries, or cattle waggons on wheels, which could be driven straight into the fair and have the cattle loaded on to them there.  These <Col N="503" /> waggons would be capable of taking eight cattle, which is the same number that the present railway waggons are capable of taking.  The process of loading the cattle would not be so terrifying as it is at present, and those waggons could be driven to the North Wall within three hours of being loaded if a proper road system were provided.  I cannot see how anybody can argue that in a country of the size of this, where there is not a long haul, no matter where you draw stuff from or whither it is going, the railways ever can be an economic or an efficient means of transport.</P>
      <P>Mind you, I make no apology for directing the Minister's attention to that particular argument, because it is on the conclusion reached in that argument that the post-war policy, when it arises, must in some measure depend.  If the Minister shares my view that ultimately the railways are to vanish, then I suggest to him that we should at once seek to design a system of roads which will carry, not all the traffic now available, but all the traffic that reasonable men might anticipate would be available in 30 years' time.  Let him not fall into the same error that the Post Office has habitually fallen into, and that is that they ascertain what is the volume of telephone traffic available to-day, and when they are informed that it is 15 per cent. more than the present lines will carry they thereupon increase the existing lines by 15 per cent., but by the time the scheme is completed, they review the position again, only to discover that the volume of traffic is now 20 per cent. greater than the development of the telephone system which they undertook in order to meet the original deficit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hold that in a matter of public services of that kind, instead of supplying the services of to-day our object should be to supply equipment which would be far in excess of our present requirements and which would be designed to meet the demand which the special facilities we create to-day will elicit from those gratified by the efficiency of the service they are getting.  Now, I do not want the Minister or anybody <Col N="504" /> in the House to imagine that I am advocating that next year or the year after we should suddenly scrap the railways and throw the whole transport of the country on the roads.  I do not think that is the way to do it at all.  I believe that if we provide an adequate road system, the railways will slowly die, in the same way as the Bianconi coaches of a few generations ago died, because it will be found that the public prefer the facilities of the road.  My view would be that even although we knew that the railways would go and might properly be swept away at the end of five years, it would be preferable in that case to hasten slowly and leave the railways there, slowly withering away, for five or ten years after it became quite manifest that they were going to go, because although it might be more efficient to eliminate them suddenly, all new departures of this kind do better if they are strengthened from their beginning with universal goodwill, and there will be more forbearance with any little hitch or difficulty that may arise, whereas, if you sweep aside the railways suddenly and set at nought the ideas of a number of individuals in this country who have almost a superstitious veneration for the railways you will have a large number of people spending the rest of their lives grumbling and complaining because there is nothing but road transport provided for them and the lovely old railways, etc., have been swept away.</P>
    <P>I say, therefore, to the Minister that he will have my support if he resolutely makes up his mind to build up such a system of roads as, in the opinion of his experts, will carry all traffic in this country in the next 25 years.  Having done that, it will be necessary for the central authority to acquire the necessary land and to prepare what, I think, are called bills of quantity, and these things will have to be put in hands at once.  It will also be necessary to plan the recruitment of the necessary labour force, just as the Electricity Supply Board had to do in 1924.  All these things will have to be set up, and if that is done I think the Minister will find himself with something in hand which will be well calculated to <Col N="505" /> produce something like a shortage of unskilled labour in certain parts of the country post-war.  What greater prospect for the relief of unemployment in this country could conceivably be provided? Some Deputies think that the creating of roads means just the provision of cement, sand, stones, and so on, but I think that it would mean the use of large quantities of steel, and Deputy Cogan is only blathering when he talks about bringing back money from foreign parts.  I think it would be better to leave the money where it is wanted to pay for the steel, which is not to be got in this country, or iron either.</P>
    <P>Now, housing will be an important matter in this country for many years. I think that all sides of the House are agreed as to the desirability of rehousing the people, whether rich or poor, where the houses are insanitary. In this country, however, we have introduced a system of family allowances, and that is an attempt by the community to create a situation in which every man in this country earning a wage is going to be provided with a family wage of a living wage. Now, that is one approach to a very important reform in my opinion, and I hope to see that system of family allowances developed until every Deputy here is satisfied that the community, acting partly through the Exchequer and partly through the employers, are securing for every citizen of this State what is truly a living wage.  That is the popular side of it and, of course, everybody will cheer the proposition of providing everybody with a living wage.  But the unpopular part of it is this: if everybody is to be provided with a living wage, are you going to subsidise their houses, and if you are going to subsidise their houses, when will you start subsidising mine?  If a living wage is provided for a working man, why should the working man's house be subsidised any more than mine is? Therefore, if the Minister is going to follow up the family allowances plan to the point where he and his colleagues can say that this system now ensures a living wage for every citizen <Col N="506" /> in employment, if he can satisfy himself that we have arrived at that position, then I think the whole housing programme will have to be reconsidered with a view to seeing that a system of rents is designed to amortise the entire advance for housing within a reasonable period of time, with interest and so on included.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister, therefore, who, so far as I know, is a radically-minded man, is it seriously intended in the post-war period that this community is going to permit the banks of this country to levy 5 per cent. on the money they lend the community?  Is this community going to suffer having levied upon itself current rates of interest in respect of money spent by the Government in the erection of houses designed to be set at economic rents? That is a rent designed to amortise the entire advance within a reasonable limit of time.  Surely that would be absurd.  I do not believe in inflation; I do not believe in tearing up institutions; I do not believe in printing money or printing presses but there are limits beyond which no reasonable body of men should go in the sacred name of orthodoxy.  It does seem to me fantastic that our people should be paying to small groups of gentlemen whose sanction we do not require, whose intervention we do not require, a heavy annual contribution for poking their noses in where they are not wanted.  If we can find a reasonable, even a conservative solution of that problem of credit for the purpose of housing, and fix economic rents&mdash;that is a rent which will extinguish the cost of the house within a given time&mdash;then I believe the Minister will have, in the house-building schemes post-war, work well calculated to deal with the considerable volume of what otherwise might be painful and oppressive unemployment.</P>
    <P>The last point with which I want to deal&mdash;and when I say the last point I shall not follow the example of Deputy Cogan by dealing with 17 last points&mdash; is the question of whether we are going to fall into the same error post-war as that into which we fell pre-war.  We have an infinite capacity in this country for not perceiving that which we do <Col N="507" /> not care to see.  Newfoundland was an independent State pre-war and her basic industry, bulking in her economy as agriculture does in ours, was fisheries.  An industrial-minded Government came into office in Newfoundland. They had no time for fishing, fisheries or fishermen.  Their whole concern was the establishment of secondary industries in Newfoundland. They pursued that policy so vigorously that the fisheries collapsed and they found then to their astonishment that, despite all the subsidies for the establishment of industries, with the collapse of the fisheries everything else collapsed as well, to such effect that the independent Government which they had had to invite in three British Treasury officials to run that country.  That course was open to Newfoundland as it was a colony. They did not seriously compromise their national honour in reverting to a condition whence they had voluntarily emerged and by calling in the assistance of the mother country. That course is not open to us. If we tear down the economic fabric of this State we have no mother-in-law to invite back to take up the Government of the country.</P>
    <P>I want to put to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that heretofore, in the promotion of the industries he has favoured, he has considered himself free heavily to tax what are in effect the raw materials of the agricultural industry.  He is responsible for recommending a tariff on artificial manures, on feeding stuffs, on agricultural implements, on agricultural machinery and on all the other things that a farmer uses on his land for the production of the finished product which ultimately he has got to sell in the unprotected British market subject to the competition from the four corners of the earth.  I say that industrial development based on such proceedings is economic suicide.  I want to ask the Minister whether he is prepared to consider a compromise without back-pedalling on the general scheme he has initiated for the development of industry through protective tariffs.  Is he prepared to make <Col N="508" /> any concession to the view, firstly, that the raw materials of the agricultural industry should not be taxed, even giving a very closely restricted interpretation to the definition of raw materials of the agricultural industry? Is he prepared to see that these one-firm industries to which he has referred, which are in fact naked monopolies, will be abolished except in so far as they are being operated by the community for the community?</P>
    <P>I suggest to him that the maintenance of one firm monopolies under licence to prey on the consuming public is fantastic and that any attempt effectively to control their prices is perfectly futile for the simple reason that price consists of two elements.  It consists of the money price exacted for the product plus the quality of the product in respect of which the price is charged.  You may, for instance, have a face towel which was selling at 1/-. The monopoly may produce a face towel to sell at 1/- also, but the towel you used to be able to get at 1/- was a thick cotton towel, 1 yard long by 18 inches wide.  The towel which the monopoly now gives you for 1/- is 18 inches long by 9 inches wide.  It may be argued that you are still getting a face towel at 1/- but, in fact, you would be getting much better value if the price of the original towel had been advanced to 1/9.  If you make representations to the Department of Industry and Commerce on a matter of that kind the Minister will say: &ldquo;Look here, I am not a cotton man.  I am not going to say what the weight, quality or size of the towel should be. Suffice it to say that you were getting a face towel for 1/- before and you are getting a face towel for 1/- now.&rdquo;  The case I quote is an extreme case but bring that down to the point of infinitesimal difference between the quality of the home-produced article and the quality of the imported article and you will see at once that control of prices, where you have a monopoly operating, is absolutely impossible.  I ask the Minister to undertake that, in the post-war era, monopolies will be operated only by the community for the community and that no individual will be permitted to rob the public <Col N="509" /> through the instrumentality of such institutions.</P>
    <P>When I hear Deputy Cogan, speaking on behalf of the farmers, calling for greater and greater employment of our domestic resources, to the exclusion of anything from outside, I must ask the Minister if he intends in the post-war world to proceed alone on his doctrine of self-sufficiency. Does he not realise that the answer to his queries about unemployment in every civilised country is that unemployment can be effectively abolished or mitigated only by the co-operation of all nations and the freedom of trade?  Is Ireland to stand out as the one country in the world that rejects the now self-evident economic fact, that unemployment is an evil which can be eliminated in no one country single-handed?  Unemployment must be eliminated or reduced the world over or it cannot be eliminated at all. The only means of effectively attacking that problem in a comprehensive and enduring way is to ensure that, as between one country and another, there will be as free a flow of goods as possible, in the certainty that under that system we will not have exotic industries for the manufacture of lock-knit yarn goods or the manufacture of ladies' underwear which gave rise to the sort of correspondence Deputy Cogan mentioned.  Under that system, however, were created Arthur Guinness, W.R. Jacob, Harland and Wolff, the linen trade, the woollen trade and virtually every valuable industry in the country.  If Deputies reflect for a moment, they will realise that those industries were created, established, developed and consolidated into some of the greatest industrial units in the world under a system of full-blooded, 100 per cent. free trade when there was no question of tariff protection or restriction of any kind.  Under that system, our people were able to establish the greatest brewery of the world in the City of Dublin and a dozen others scattered throughout the country, one of the greatest biscuit factories in the world in the City of Dublin, the greatest shipbuilding yard in the world in the City of Belfast, the greatest linen industry in the world <Col N="510" /> in the North of Ireland, a substantial exporting woollen industry, a substantial boot industry and a variety of other industries.  Those were due not to protection, not to reservation of the home market, not to any attempt by a Government to support them; they were developed despite the not infrequent intervention of Governments that were very inimical to Irish industrial development of any kind and in an arena where the full blast of free trade competition was allowed to operate without let or hindrance.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon spoke about post-war planning.  He said that everybody was prepared to plan him but that nobody was going to allow him to plan anybody else.  He wound up by telling us that the unemployment problem in this country would be solved by the co-operation of all nations.  They are all going to plan for us.  Deputies should place Deputy Dillon's speech of a couple of days ago side by side with his attack on Deputy Cogan's argument to-day.  He wants to give everybody in this country a living wage and he told us on Monday that every profession here was dependent on the farmer and that the price the farmer would get after the war would depend on the price he would obtain for his surplus agricultural exports on the British market. That is to be the basis of the standard of living of our people after the war according to Deputy Dillon.  That standard will be based on the 70/- per cwt. which Britain was prepared to pay us for our butter at the commencement of this war&mdash;a price which would allow of about twopence per gallon for milk at the creameries.  Figure out the standard of living that that would give us.  On the day before yesterday, Deputy Dillon described Irish industry as the Old Man of the Sea laid upon the backs of the unfortunate agricultural community.  He expanded that picture.  I look on our industrial revival from 1932 onwards as a portion of the insurance policy which this Government took out, when the first acre of wheat was planted.  I say without fear of contradiction from anybody that our industrial policy has justified itself just as much as the first acre of wheat we planted justified itself.  Consider the position of the agricultural community who are to be saddled with this &ldquo;Old Man of the <Col N="512" /> Sea.&rdquo;  Consider the agricultural community for the past four years without a shovel, a spade, a slean, a fork, a plough, a harrow, a mowing machine or even a horseshoe.  That is the position the agriculturist would have been in if we had not had Seán Lemass as Minister for Industry and Commerce from 1932 to 1944.</P>

      <P>In order that the greatest possible benefit may be derived from these machines, committees have been informed that, so far as is possible, they should recommend persons or firms who would be prepared to work mainly for hire in their respective districts.</P>
      <P>I am empowered by the Emergency Powers (No. 117) Order, 1941, to issue a direction for sale requiring an owner to sell a machine to another specified person if I am of opinion that satisfactory use is not being made of such machine.</P>

There is a Bill from the Department of Local Government and Public Health dealing with certain infectious diseases and other public health matters, which it is desired to pass.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing with the position of agriculture when progress was reported.  If the present emergency had come upon us in 1932 instead of in 1939, I was making a comparison of the position in which agriculture has been placed by our industrial progress since then.  If the emergency arose in 1932 we would find ourselves without factories for making shovels, spades, forks, ploughs, harrows, mowing machines, and practically everything that was required on the land, yet these are the things that Deputy Dillon stated were like the Old Man of the Sea tied around the necks of the agricultural industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="519" /> I give only one example of an industry which happens to be in my constituency. I refer to Irish Steel.  I wonder what would be the position of the agricultural community to-day if Irish Steel were not there, and we had no means of manufacturing iron for horse-shoes.  I referred to Irish Steel last year, and I am glad to see that we have got more billets.  I cannot agree, however, that the previous directors of that company, during the period 1939 to 1941, did their duty.  I do not know of any reason why the furnaces for that industry could not have been finished between 1939 and 1941.  If they had been, the industry would be in a position to use up all the scrap that we have in the country, and supply all the needs of agriculture and industry.  In my opinion there was negligence in the Department of Industry and Commerce since these directors were not put in jail.  We have now, however, come to the point when we will be able to get shoeing iron. That is something that we can place to the credit of the Minister who had the courage to tackle the job and do it, and to tackle it against the advice of the Deputy Dillons.  I am not saying that the Minister does not make mistakes. The man who will not make mistakes will never make anything.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of shipping.  In that connection, I would direct the attention of the Minister to the present financial position of Cork Harbour.  There is no use in having shipping if there is nowhere to bring it, and if something is not done to deal with the financial position of Cork Harbour that, I fear, is going to be the position, so far as shipping is concerned, for some months.  That is a matter that particularly concerns the Department of Industry and Commerce and should receive the Minister's attention.</P>
    <P>I must congratulate Deputy Cogan and his Party on the definite policy that they have laid down as regards agriculture.  The views that he expressed represent a departure, and to my mind a very good departure, from the sneers that we used to have here from Farmers' Parties which, thank <Col N="520" /> God, have disappeared from this House, and I would say have disappeared for good.  We used to have sneers from them about the rotten Irish shovel, the rotten spades and their bad handles, and the rotten machinery that they said we could not work.  That is what we used to hear from the members of Farmers' Parties that we had here at one time, but, as I have said, they have disappeared.  I am glad to see that we now have a Farmers' Party in the House, the members of which take the view, the correct view, that industry and agriculture must go hand in hand.  To-day the farming community are in the position that they are able to sell 95 per cent. of their agricultural produce on the home market.  We have to thank the policy that makes that possible. If we had not the policy that went out to prevent the import of agricultural produce to this country to compete against what the Irish farmer produced&mdash;a system that went on here for a considerable number of years&mdash;we would not be in the happy position that we are in to-day in which we are able to supply our own people.  There is one thing that I would ask the Minister to tackle, and it is this: that in the fixing of prices for agricultural produce he would use the same basis that he uses when fixing the prices of industrial commodities. If he were to do that, I am satisfied that the agricultural community would be not only far better off, but better satisfied.  There seems to be a cheeseparing in the fixing of prices for agricultural produce that does not exist where industry is concerned.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal in a brief way with the question of unemployment assistance.  I am concerned about some 3,000 families who are living in my constituency and who are not getting the benefits laid down in the Constitution of equal rights for all citizens.  When we have social legislation brought in here for the benefit of the general community, and when we have a large section of the population in a city removed by housing needs outside the boundaries of that city, creating an anomalous position of this kind: that a man with his wife and <Col N="521" /> three or four children living in house No. 9 is entitled to 35/- a week unemployment assistance, while the man with his wife and four children, living in house No. 10, is not entitled to draw a penny unemployment assistance, we have there a position which, to my mind, is absolutely contrary to what is laid down in the Constitution.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce should give his attention to this and have it rectified.  There is no use in saying that it will be rectified next year or the year after, when some of those people will have died of starvation. The position there is daily becoming more serious.  Take any one of the measures dealing with social legislation that have been passed by this House.  Take the case of men who happen to be in employment and went before a Wages Tribunal and got a bonus of 5/ or 6/- a week.  The bonus they received was immediately set upon, and 1/- a week extracted out of it for increased rent.  Take the Children's Allowances Act.  The payments under that Act will come into force on the 1st August next.  The unfortunate people in the district that I speak of are to be treated under the Children's Allowances Act in the same manner as they have been in regard to the bonuses which they received from the Wages Tribunal.</P>

      <P>This is one of the most important Votes which the House has to pass in the year.  On this occasion, it is particularly important, in view of the fact that unemployment is still on the increase and that this time the Minister has not given any indication of plans to meet the unemployment problem.  Coming up to-day from the country, I met at least eight young fellows coming to the City of Dublin, looking for work with farmers. They were farmers' sons and, because of the stress of circumstances in the Midlands, the farmers cannot pay the wages demanded, so there is no employment that they could engage in.  They complained bitterly about the difficulty of getting to Great Britain, they complained of the Government, of the Dáil, of everyone concerned, of the lack of compensation or wages for their work.  I am aware of the circumstances in which many small farmers' sons and labourers' sons and daughters are existing in the country.  The standard rate of wages is totally inadequate to <Col N="524" /> meet the cost of living and to put them on a par with their brothers and sisters who have got away to England.</P>
      <P>I was listening to Deputy Morrissey saying that the farmers of Tipperary were comparatively better off than they have ever been.  I think that is correct: they are a good bit better off to-day than they were in 1932, 1933 or 1935; but that does not at all mean that they are in any way well off or that they have achieved a well-regulated income from their efforts. It is true that the farming community, as such, has money on deposit in the banks, but everybody knows that the farmers who have money on deposit receipt are those with fairly large families, whose families are working for them at no wage but the packet of cigarettes and, perhaps, in some cases the price of the dance or concert or picture at the week-end, if they had a bicycle to take them to it.  This money on deposit receipt represents practically the slave wages of the farming community.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the increased value of the produce of the farm, I assert that the increased cost of living and increased cost of everything the farmer has to buy, means that there is less compensation for the agricultural community than there has been.  As soon as the farmer's sons or daughters see a chance of getting away from the farm, off they go, as otherwise they would be expected to work at home under those slave conditions.  I deliberately say &ldquo;slave conditions&rdquo;, notwithstanding that my colleague, Deputy Morrissey, thinks otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are none of the amenties of life in the country.  No doubt, there has been a slight improvement in the housing of the farmers, but it is not nearly sufficient.  The Minister should have outlined, and must outline, a plan for the employment of the people at home at a living wage, as, if he or some other Minister does not do so, we will still have that hankering to get away, and our youth will join the British Army or go somewhere else. Everybody knows there is any amount of work at home for them, if there were any compensation for it.  We have a Drainage Bill, but it is for a post-war <Col N="525" /> plan that is not to start until years after the emergency is over, and, at best, it is a 28-year plan.  A great many of us will be pushing up daisies by the time that plan is completed.  It is no solution.</P>
    <P>I assert that the finances of the State can be organised in such a way that our young people and our unemployed can be gainfully engaged in the creation of assets that will benefit the country.  If war were to break out in this country to-morrow, it is an astonishing fact that, if we could put up factories to manufacture tanks, aeroplanes or artillery, the money would be immediately available to do that.  We would boast that we were able to manufacture tanks, aeroplanes, artillery and ammunition, and we would not hesitate for one moment to spend hundreds of millions, if we had the factories and the machinery, in the production of instruments of destruction. The remarkable thing is that we cannot produce a ha'penny for the development of agriculture, to spend on the things that would give our people employment at home.  I assert that we will become a broken-down State if our people are not employed at home, and if they are not given ample compensation for the work they do.  They are entitled to receive the same wages as they get in Britain.  Even if we came in any way near to that standard, it would be some advantage, and our people would stay at home.</P>
    <P>Efforts will have to be made to make credit available, and it is the duty of the Department of Industry and Commerce to plan it.  If they are not able to do so, then someone else who will do it must be found.  It is heart-breaking to see our young fellows crossing the Border every day to join the British Army, and to see our girls going to Northern Ireland to engage in domestic and other work when their services are so urgently required at home.  We see the very life-blood of the nation pouring out in that manner every day and we cannot stop it. Fianna Fáil came into office in 1932, and they had a plan to end unemployment. I thought they had, but for some reason or other they did not carry out that plan.  As I said at one <Col N="526" /> time, the only reason I could not support Fianna Fáil then was that I could not believe them.  If you believe them you are bound to support them.</P>
    <P>To-day unemployment is worse than ever, even with large numbers of our people going away.  As Deputy Morrissey pointed out to-day, what will the situation be like when large numbers of our people return and demobilisation from our Army takes place? That is not the time to start planning. The plan should be then in operation, the spearhead of that plan should be working, and we should be ready to receive these people and put them into gainful employment.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy McCarthy talking about the opposition to wheat-growing and beet-growing.  Only a Deputy who is new to the House would make that statement.  It is a well-known fact that the Carlow beet factory was established long before Fianna Fáil came into office, and it is also well known that that beet factory and the Shannon scheme were described by a responsible Minister as white elephants. That was the type of opposition to every plan put forward by the Government of the day.  The members of that Government were belittled.  I admit that the members of this Government realise that in attacking the efforts of that administration they made a mistake.  It is just like a lot of things in this world&mdash;they are sorry when it is late.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry said that if we had not Seán Lemass we would have no farm implements, no agricultural machinery, no iron for horse shoes. How nicely Deputy Corry can forget that we had Messrs.  Pierce of Wexford, the Wexford Engineering Company, O'Gormans and any amount of people capable of manufacturing agricultural implements.  They were manufacturing these implements, which were as good as the best.  The Deputy talked about the manufacture of steel and iron.  I would undertake to manufacture iron at the price at which it is now manufactured.  Iron could be purchased at £6 a ton prior to the emergency and to-day the price ranges from £112 to £124 a ton.  I <Col N="527" /> agree that whatever lead or iron ore may be in that part of the country to which the Deputy referred, it could be dug out with spades and hammered, and that could be done economically. I do not believe that the price of £112 a ton could last, because there is nothing that you could manufacture that could bear such a high initial cost for the raw materials.  It is apparent that the Haulbowline factory cannot produce the metal required, because they must get bricks and other things to complete the furnace.</P>
    <P>I think it is a great idea that we should have factories for producing iron and steel.  It is absolutely essential that we should have them and I have all along subscribed to the view that we should have such industries. At the same time, I am of the opinion that they should produce at a price that will be well within the scope of the people when they come to buy the finished article.  So far as agricultural implements are concerned, the price must not be too high.  Let us suppose that a farmer wants a mowing machine.  There was a time when he could buy one for £18 or £20, but now he has to pay £40 or £43.  That represents over 100 per cent. of an increase. The same applies to other agricultural machinery.  Deputy Morrissey properly pointed out that the cost of even a second-hand reaper and binder or a tractor is unusually high.  If the farmer wants to comply with the demands of the Minister for Agriculture and is anxious to supply the requirements of the people, he is put to considerable expense.</P>
    <P>Many difficulties would be removed if a proper organisation were set up and if credit were made available.  I assert that what Britain can do we can do.  We have equal rights and we are as independent as they are.  If a farmer in Britain wants credit the banks will give it to him without a mortgage on his land.  They will merely take a mortgage on the machinery he buys or on the crops he will produce.  If a farmer here wishes to borrow money to buy machinery he must give a mortgage on his farm.  As a matter of fact, the banker really <Col N="528" /> does not want to see a farmer; he would rather anybody else would come looking for credit.  The country should be organised in such a way that all our essential industries can be developed.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult for the ordinary worker to exist on present-day wages. It is more difficult to exist on unemployment assistance because the cost of living is so high that the unemployment assistance payable by the Minister's Department is insignificant and totally inadequate.  Unemployment insurance is on the same line and is not at all in keeping with the increased cost of living or the responsibilities that the worker may have.  I do not know what plans the Minister has for the survey of these problems. I assert that he should have a survey made, that he should take the House into his confidence, that he should ask for reliable information&mdash;on oath if necessary&mdash;from those in a position to give it, and that there should not be merely wishful thinking about the matter.  In that way I think he would get to a position where he could influence the Government to take the necessary steps to make credit available for industries, housing, afforestation, employment of every type for our people, to keep them in this country where, while they may have temptations of some kind, they are not comparable with those they would have abroad, and where they will be working in the interests of their own country, doing the things that every nation should do for itself.</P>
    <P>On the question of coal, there is no reason in the world why some of the miners who have been in England and Scotland in the past and who are now available throughout the country could not be organised and put to work on these particular mines.  If these people were recruited I think there would be a very great number.  Some of them may be old now but I know that in the midlands hundreds of people who are still there went as miners for years to Scotland and elsewhere.  There is recruitment for the bog and for other things, and I think if there were a special appeal made to people with mining experience to offer their services <Col N="529" /> now, I think you would get a very substantial number of men.  In that way you would increase production of coal which is so essential for the maintenance of industry.</P>
    <P>The rest of the ground has been covered fairly well by other Deputies and I do not intend to delay the House but I do appeal to the Minister to take notice of the situation of our unemployed boys and girls.  Those who are employed receive compensations for their labour which is totally inadequate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish at the outset to direct attention again to the burning question of coal.  I should like to correct an impression I may have created by quoting certain figures on the last occasion.  These figures were taken from the survey of the industrial resources of Ireland of 1921, and they are not as fantastic as the Minister would make out.  At the same time, I want to emphasise that they relate to the reserves of coal which are estimated to be in the Leinster coalfield, and I do not suggest for a moment that all these reserves are workable as a mining or commercial proposition.  In addition to the reserves in the Leinster coal area, there are considerable reserves&mdash;some 30,000,000 tons&mdash;in the Arigna coal area, and there is an estimated reserve of one billion, five hundred odd million tons in the Munster coal area, which has never been worked.  I know as well as the Minister that a number of these areas are unworkable because of faulty rock construction and that sort of thing.  At the same time I want to stress the point that you have in this country these huge reserves of coal and that no effort has ever been made by this Government to tap any of these reserves, with the single exception of Slievardagh, which is, from a geological point of view, a doubtful proposition.  The faults in Slievardagh in rock formation are far more serious, I believe, than they are either in Arigna or in the Kilkenny area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was on this subject I wanted to make it clear that I was not concerned with normal mining development. We all know that to train a <Col N="530" /> miner takes at least two years and that mining law does not allow a miner to work on his own before he has completed a period of two years' training. We all know, also, that there are great difficulties in the way of obtaining machinery and equipment at the present time for normal mining development. What I had in mind in this matter was the possibility of developing outcrop coal, which is all over the place in Kilkenny.  The Minister suggested to me that I should go down to Kilkenny and discuss this matter with the miners and hear their views upon it.  I happen to be in business in Castlecomer.  My people have been there for generations.  We are intimately associated with the mining population of Castlecomer and these men come into me every other day and tell me the position.  I am speaking from first knowledge on this matter.</P>
    <P>This question of outcrop coal, I believe, can be tackled.  There may be one difficulty in it and that is the provision of explosives.  Apart from that I see no difficulty whatever except brawn and the pick and shovel and, goodness knows, we have enough of that in this country.  The Minister has published a review of Irish mineral resources entitled <i>The Geographical Survey of Ireland.  Emergency Period &mdash;Pamphlet No. 1.</i> The author is D.W. Bishopp, Fellow of the Geographical Society.  In that report, which is dated as recently as 1943, he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is perfectly true that anthracite coal has been extracted in past years from a number of the more promising points; and it may indeed be possible for local enterprise to obtain a limited quantity from scattered outcrops to assist in supplying a local demand.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is what I am concerned with.  I am putting it to the Minister that he should enable the land owners and all persons interested who have outcrop coal on their lands to quarry that outcrop coal, first of all, to supply the local demand and, after that, if there is a sufficient quantity available, to supply the needs of the country.</P>
    <P>As I stressed in the debate on the Adjournment, we have a very distinct <Col N="531" /> grievance in this matter.  For generations we maintained the Castlecomer mines when nobody else did.  Very few people outside the fringes of the adjoining counties ever took Castlecomer coal, and we, who for generations burned Castlecomer coal in our grates, are now in the position that we cannot get an ounce of Castlecomer coal, and we have to look at 600 tons a day leaving the village for unknown destinations. We do not know where it goes.  All we know is that it goes to certain wholesale merchants, and after that it is lost to us anyway.  The Minister said that the present output was 180,000, and that that represented an increase of 60 per cent.  I should like to know whether that is a gross figure or not, because, away back in 1919, we were actually in Castlecomer alone producing 93,000 tons gross, and we had then over 400 miners employed.</P>
    <P>I should also like to have from the Minister information as to the steps which he is taking to increase the number of skilled miners in the various mines through out the country.  Deputy MacEoin quite properly referred to the necessity for the recruitment of miners from all over the country.  You will get men in Donegal and in Mayo, as well as in the midlands, and perhaps down south, who have worked in the mines in Scotland, England and Wales, and I believe that if an appeal were made to these men they would work here.  I believe further that if an appeal were made to the ordinary working men and a decent wage was held out to them, a great number of them would undertake to engage in mining, at least in mining of the type I have in mind, which is surface quarrying.  We can get coal in several areas in Castlecomer by merely tunnelling from the banks of streams, and to an extent it is being done surreptitiously at present.</P>
    <P>Since raising this matter of coal, I have received a letter from the St. Francis Abbey Brewery, Kilkenny.  It would appear that, as a result of the cuts that have been made by the Minister in the ration of coal for that brewery, they will be faced with a <Col N="532" /> close-down in the near future; certainly they will have to lay off a number of hands.</P>
    <P>Before the 31st of May their ration was 87 tons of Castlecomer coal per month.  For June and July, which is portion of their busiest period, they get no coal whatever. For August they are cut to 35 tons; for September to 76; for October to 58; and for November to 54.  In addition to that, an embargo has been placed on the import of cross-channel ales, with the result that these people are inundated with demands for their ale and they will be unable to carry on, they tell me, unless something is done to remedy the position for them. So that here you have a firm on the spot which cannot get a reasonable ration of local coal.  I ask the Minister in all seriousness to consider that particular case.</P>
    <P>I would again ask him to reconsider his proposals for the development of electricity from turf.  It will take at least three tons of turf, of the quality at least that we get down in Kilkenny, to equal one ton of Castlecomer anthracite.  If it is seriously suggested that that is an economic proposition, I for one cannot see it.  Furthermore, I would remind the Minister that when an experiment was made in Clonsast it was originally estimated that machine turf from Clonsast could be procured at 10/6 per ton or something like that.  But, when it came to supplying 40,000 odd tons from Clonsast, it cost 50/6 per ton.  We all know that the retail price of turf to-day is 64/- per ton and that that price can only be achieved by means of a subsidy; the cost is probably considerably higher.  You can get a ton of Castlecomer coal wholesale at considerbly less than £4 per ton.  My proposition is that, if this extension of electricity by way of burning stations is developed and steam power is to be adopted, the appropriate method of developing it is to erect the burning stations in the coal areas, if possible at or near the pitheads.  The coal-burning stations could be erected at Castlecomer, Arigna, Slievardagh and perhaps elsewhere in the Munster coalfield.  In that way you will save <Col N="533" /> the cost of transport of the fuel and you will have a very economic proposition.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the case of the Firoda collieries and I want to mention it again.  The people of Castlecomer had correspondence with the Minister as far back as June, 1942.  Like many other matters which reach Government Departments, that was apparently pigeon-holed and no progress has been made so far as the people of Castlecomer are aware.  The Minister has ample powers under the Mines and Minerals Act to enter on land anywhere and carry out experiments with a view to ascertaining the value of the coal beneath the land and the commercial possibilities of development. In addition, he has powers under Section 18 of the Mines and Minerals Act to go on land where the minerals are owned in such small parcels that they cannot be conveniently worked and, if he is satisfied that they may be left permanently unworked, he can grant a licence to any person interested to work those minerals.  I am seriously putting it to him that he should avail of his powers under that section to develop this outcrop coal to which I referred.</P>
    <P>I know there will be a lot of legal difficulties and technicalities in the matter, but I think the situation is so serious that the Minister should give himself an additional Emergency Powers Order to wipe out all these technicalities.  We may be told that there are royalties, franchises, or rights of private property in the way; perhaps there are, but the situation is so serious that, in the interests of the common good, these should go also, at least for the emergency period.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Minister told the House a good deal about post-war plans, particularly for building.  There is one aspect of that matter which strikes me very forcibly. With the destruction which has taken place in Great Britain and upon the Continent of Europe, it is quite on the cards that the Allied Powers, if they have not already done so, take over the steel, iron and timber resources not only of the Continent of Europe, but of the <Col N="534" /> world, and that when we come to develop these grandiose plans, the quota we are likely to get from them will be very small indeed.  So far as we on these benches are concerned, we have no knowledge that the Minister is taking any steps whatever to negotiate with these Powers for a share of the raw materials which will be necessary for this post-war construction.  I can visualise a position, when the war is over, in which we will be left out in the cold if we do not move in the matter very soon.  We have a guarantee under the Atlantic Charter that the raw materials of the world will be pooled, and that every country will get its fair quota.  Are we at the moment doing anything to get our share?</P>
    <P>With regard to the general question of protection, the Austrian economist, Friedrich List, was, I think, the precursor of protection, and in the old days of Sinn Féin we borrowed a good deal from his teachings.  From his national system of economics, there developed in Germany the modern National-Socialist system of economics, and there developed in America the high tariff policy which the Americans have pursued for years, with disastrous results to themselves and to the world. We in this country seem to have learned nothing from the mistakes of the great Powers in this matter.  Since List's time, every country has set out on a race against its neighbour to erect high tariff walls about itself to keep out the outside world, and to develop its internal resources to the almost entire exclusion of its neighbours; with the result that we have had two world wars in our generation fought on this very issue and on no other issue.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that we have reached the saturation point of protection in this country.  Undoubtedly during the emergency period it was the duty of the Government to protect infant industries in every way possible, but the consumer in this country is rapidly coming to the conclusion that he is paying a very high price for his protection, that the home-produced article does not compare in quality with the foreign-made article and that this protection is adding considerably <Col N="535" /> to the cost of living and is likely in the post-war period not to be worth a candle.  I think we have arrived at the time when we ought to take stock of our economic policy and ask ourselves whether certain industries are worth protecting or not.  By all means give the infant industry protection while it is getting its legs and learning to walk, but when it has reached the adult stage, it should stand on its own legs and should not get further protection.</P>

      <P>Some Deputies appear to think it would be possible to give details of plans which have been made, or are in process of being made, for the promotion of activities of one kind or another after the war.  I made it clear, when speaking earlier to-day, that I was dealing only with the projects which are under consideration in the Department of Industry and Commerce. Post-war planning as a whole is a Government responsibility and there is a Cabinet committee which directs it.  Part of the task has been entrusted to the Department of Industry and Commerce, and I referred only to matters which were in train in the Department which directly related to its responsibilities.  In respect of most of the projects to which I made reference, detailed proposals will come to the Dáil when the legislation designed to facilitate them is introduced.</P>
      <P>I explained that the aim of the Government in these matters was to get the preparation of plans advanced to the stage at which action could be taken without delay when the circumstances were favourable, when the materials and equipment required were procurable.  That preparatory work would include the enactment now of the legislation necessary, the giving of the requisite powers to the subordinate bodies, such as the Electricity Supply Board, to enable them to proceed, in the knowledge that they had specific responsibility to get a particular task done and the requisite legal powers, as well as the necessary financial resources, to enable them to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies made reference to the <Col N="536" /> current position in respect of employment and unemployment.  Deputy MacEoin is completely in error in assuming that our unemployment situation is getting worse.  On the contrary, there has been a steady decrease in the number of persons unemployed in the past two or three years.  That decrease was undoubtedly influenced latterly by the emigration of a number of workers to Great Britain, just as it was, at an earlier stage, influenced by the recruitment of many thousands of workers into the Army and other defence services.  I merely refer to it for the purpose of stressing the fact that the number of persons unemployed is substantially less this year than last year, and was substantially less last year than the previous year.  There has, of course, been some diminution in the number of persons employed as well, but it has been very slight.</P>
    <P>I stated yesterday that the average number of persons employed in each week of 1943 was 3,000 less than the number employed in each week of 1942. That statement was inaccurate.  The officers of the statistics branch sent me correct information this morning.  I was quoting from the preliminary draft of a report upon unemployment which is about to be printed, but subsequent examination of the position led to a revision of the figures.  The new figures would indicate that the average number of persons employed in occupations insurable under the Unemployment Insurance Acts in last year was only 1,000 less than in the previous year.  The average number employed in other occupations was also 1,000 less.  It is, I think, a noteworthy feature of the strength of the industrial organisation which we created before the war that it has been able to withstand all the difficulties which resulted from the war, and, at the same time continue to give not very much less employment than was given before the war.  As I pointed out, it is now employing 50 per cent. more workers than were employed in all the industries of the country before the present Government came into office. The fact that those industries created only a short time before the outbreak of the war, created in circumstances of difficulty, were able to withstand at an <Col N="537" /> early stage in their existence the vicissitudes of the war, is, I think, encouragement to us to proceed further with our industrial development policy when circumstances again permit of it.</P>
    <P>During the course of the past year there was a considerable increase in the number of persons employed in agriculture and in turf production.  We have reached a stage now where, in many rural parts, there is a scarcity of labour.  That scarcity of labour is at present having consideration from the Government, because it is obvious that we will have to take some special steps to ensure that the exceptional labour need of agriculture during the harvest period will be met, if possible by encouraging the workers who are surplus to local requirements in the congested districts to transfer temporarily to the areas where tillage operations on a large scale were only begun during the war years, and where the local pool of labour is inadequate to meet local requirements.</P>

      <P>It will be done immediately. Deputy MacEoin referred to workers coming from rural areas to get employment in Dublin. I must admit that that may have happened.  It has probably happened to an undesirable extent, but it is not due to inability to get work in the rural areas.  It is due to a disinclination to take the type of work available in rural areas.  There is, of course, the normal drift of population from the land into the towns. That is a feature of healthy civilisation in any country, and a great deal of nonsense is talked about it from time to time, but there are no circumstances prevailing at the moment which could be fairly described as operating to drive people from the land into the towns.  Deputy Norton talked about our driving people out of the country to get employment in Great Britain. Other Deputies know quite well that the biggest problems associated with war-time emigration with which the Government has to deal arose from the inclination of the people to leave employment here in order to qualify for exist permits to go to Great Britain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that many people who lost employment in this country proceeded to employment in Great Britain because there was not an opportunity of engaging themselves here in their own occupations.  Time and again I pointed out to the Dáil that a carpenter or a plumber, or a painter or a printer, or any other person whose skill &mdash;acquired through years of apprenticeship&mdash;accustomed him to a standard of living higher than that enjoyed by the unskilled worker, could not be compensated for loss of his employment here by an offer of work cutting turf or in any agricultural occupation, and we have never felt it necessary that we should prevent such people from emigrating temporarily to Great Britain, where they could follow their own occupations, maintain their skill, and at the same time secure for themselves and their families the livelihood to which they had been accustomed. We have prohibited the emigration of persons for whom employment was available, the emigration of persons who had experience in agricultural work or turf production, but many of the people who were prohibited from emigrating by reason of the fact that they were in employment have adopted various devices in order to evade that restriction and procure exit permits for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of persons who emigrated last year was substantially less than the number who emigrated in 1942, and, since March last, the issue of new exit permits has been stopped entirely.  The stoppage of the issue of new exit permits was due to the restrictions imposed by the British Government on travel between Great Britain and Ireland.  The Government considered <Col N="539" /> that it was its duty to suspend the issue of new permits until the situation clarified itself, and until there was some reasonable assurance that the persons leaving this country for employment in Great Britain could return here if they wanted to do so, or if circumstances made such a return necessary to them.  That suspension of the issue of exit permits will not be maintained indefinitely, but clearly we have reached a stage in which we cannot contemplate giving to agricultural workers or turf workers facilities to emigrate from districts where there is such a scarcity of workers at the present time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon inquired as to the position concerning those exit permits, and thought there was some discriminatory treatment in force.  I stated that the issue of new exit permits ceased, but anybody who had received from the Department of External Affairs an exit permit previous to the decision of the Government to cease to issue new permits could proceed to Britain on that permit if he got a visa from the British authorities.  The only thing he required was that visa from the British authorities, and when that was given to him he was entitled to travel.  The whole position in that regard is under active examination at the moment.  I might say, in reply to a point raised by some Deputy, that those restrictions did not apply at any time to migratory agricultural workers, that is to persons from the West of Ireland who ordinarily went year after year for seasonal agricultural work in Great Britain, returning to this country when that seasonal work was completed.  They have never been subject to those restrictions and are not subject to those restrictions now.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coogan has spoken on coal production here on two occasions since the assembly of the Dáil.  At one time I had all the illusions that he has now. I was under the impression that this country had vast mineral resources which had not been exploited because of the ill-will of an alien Government, and that it was only a question of putting holes in the ground to discover that those vast resources were there, to <Col N="540" /> be followed by the making of arrangements for their commercial exploitation. When I became Minister for Industry and Commerce I persuaded the Government to give me a very large sum of money to carry out the mineral exploration which I thought had been neglected, and we went particularly after the areas where coal was known to exist.  We employed foreign experts of the highest standing to advise us. The Arigna district was surveyed thoroughly by a French firm of experts, and the Leinster area by a British firm. Arising out of their report, the development of the Slievardagh area was undertaken.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coogan says that was not the best place to commence any new coal development of the Leinster area. I can only reply that the best experts we could employ said it was the best place.  In the Arigna area it was quite obvious that the coal resources available did not permit of commercial development on any scale greater than was in fact being undertaken by private enterprise at the time.  It is true that commercial considerations do not apply now to the extent that they would apply in normal peace times.</P>
    <P>The aim now is to get as much coal as we can out of the ground, almost irrespective of the cost of getting it out, but there are practical problems there which cannot be ignored.  They do not cease to exist merely by asserting that the Government has failed to make a particular effort to cope with them.  These practical problems are known to the persons who are engaged in coal mining operations, whether as managers of coal mining companies or as coal workers.  For instance, we cannot put an unskilled worker underground, mining coal; he could easily kill himself and every other worker there as well.  In order to prevent the employment of unskilled workers or miners underground, laws have been passed both in this Parliament and in the Parliaments of other countries, prescribing the minimum qualifications which must be possessed by any person who is permitted to go underground and engage in mining work.  We have modified the law to some extent during the emergency so <Col N="541" /> as to permit of the employment underground of persons who had not got the requisite amount of experience and skill in mining, but even with that modification there is still a scarcity of those who can be employed underground. Deputy Coogan and Deputy MacEoin said that if we appealed to those people living in this country who have had experience in former years of coal mining in Great Britain, to come forward now and help us, we would get a large number of them.  We did that.  Through the employment exchanges throughout the country, every person in the country who was known to have had coal mining experience was approached and asked to come forward.  There were about 50 such people whose names were listed in the exchanges, and every single one of them was written to and asked to come forward and agree to resume coal mining here during the emergency. Not one of them came forward.  That was done over a year ago, and only a fortnight ago another approach was made through the employment exchanges to persons whose services might be of value in coal production.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered also that the coal seams of this country are narrow. Deputy Norton thinks that we could get much more coal out of the ground in this country if we had nationalised coal production rather than mining development by private enterprise, but no matter who undertakes the job, they cannot alter the size of the seams, and it is the size of the seams that determines the output of coal at any particular point.  As I have said, our coal seams are very narrow.  They vary from 10 to 18 inches, and rarely exceed 24 inches.  That means that the output of the individual miner working on the coal face is limited, and it frequently involves that in order to get the coal out, rock or shale, over and above the coal, is also taken out and, of course, that is an entirely uneconomic proposition, as Deputies will realise.  We cannot hope to have the same methods of working here as in the case of the English coal mines, with seams as wide as three and four feet.  Those large seams permit of methods of working which are impracticable here.  The <Col N="542" /> production of coal depends on the number of miners who can be employed cutting coal at the coal face, and that depends on the size of the seam, and only to a very limited extent by the system of mine development be adopted by mine managements here.</P>
    <P>By every possible device we have been endeavouring to secure increased output of coal, and we have got an increased output, but there are obstacles which are insurmountable. We could, undoubtedly, increase the productive capacity of individual miners in a number of mines if we could get coal-cutting machinery, but we cannot get it, or at least, up to the present, we have not been able to get it.  In some of these mines the management have not been able to get even tracks for the movement of the coal trolleys, and they are driving the trolleys on wooden slats, which, as every Deputy knows, is a most unsatisfactory method of working. Nevertheless, from the Arigna area there has been a very substantial output, a much more substantial output than in the Castlecomer area.  I am not going to discuss the difficulties in connection with the Castlecomer mines, but I would say to Deputy Coogan that we have found, particularly in the case of Castlecomer, where the industry has been long established and where traditions have developed amongst the workers, a considerable reluctance on the part of the workers&mdash;and, may I say, a very natural reluctance&mdash;to encourage the introduction there of a very large number of new unskilled or semi-skilled workers who may desire to remain in that employment when the war is over, whose presence would depreciate the value of the skill which the existing miners have already acquired, and who may at some future stage be the cause of considerable unemployment in the district.</P>
    <P>The Castlecomer miners, in the days of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, had a rather thin time, and it is rather ludicrous of Deputy Coogan to criticise this Government now for not developing our coal reserves.  It is the memory of what they went through in the years when Cumann na nGaedheal was in power which makes <Col N="543" /> these Castlecomer workers determined to make sure that there will be no inflation of workers there to reproduce conditions such as occurred during that period, or that continued unemployment is not again going to be the case after the war. Outcrop coal has been mentioned. Now, outcrop coal is all very well, but I think that for the quantity of coal we would get in that way it would not be worth while expending any great effort in working it.  In some districts it is possible to increase the output to some extent by increasing outcrop working, but it would be wrong to imagine that we can expand our supply considerably by that means.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coogan also criticised the project to construct an electricity station at Clonsast, to be fired by turf. He said that the right place to build a new steam station for the generation of electricity was adjacent to the Castlecomer mines or any other coal mines.  I think that that idea is entirely wrong.  There would be some basis for the suggestion if there was any difficulty in disposing for other purposes of all the coal produced at Castlecomer or at other coal workings, but we have not had any difficulty in securing, in recent years at any rate, a market for all the coal that could be produced, and it seems to me that the aim must be to ensure, not that we divert to electricity production Irish coal which is at present being used in other industries, but that we should endeavour to secure the production of new or other types of fuel which would add to our resources without detracting from the supplies of coal available for other industries.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan referred yesterday to a statement I made during the election campaign, concerning a new steam station in Dublin. What I said was that the Electricity Supply Board was preparing plans for a new steam station in Dublin.  At what stage in the generation programme of the Electricity Supply Board a new steam station in Dublin will be introduced, has not yet been determined upon.  I think that our experience <Col N="544" /> during this war must compel us to endeavour to ensure that the development of electricity generating capacity in the future must, if possible, be independent of imported fuel, that we must concentrate upon the development of our rivers for water power, and supplement the output of the rivers by turf-burning stations.</P>
    <P>There are sound economic reasons for doing so.  It is a fact that a year like the present which is bad for water-power stations being particularly dry, is a good year for turf-production. The reverse is also true.  A year that is bad for turf production will give an abundant supply of water for water-power stations.  That consideration has turned the minds of electrical engineers in other countries to the obvious desirability of linking up hydro-electrical development with the use of turf as fuel for stand-by steam stations. I want to stress, however, that there are other considerations which must be taken into account when determining the future generation programme.  If we were to have regard only to the cost of generating electricity we could, no doubt, leave other considerations aside but it would be folly to leave other considerations aside.  There are even defence considerations which might induce us to decide not to erect any large steam station in Dublin, even though it might be more costly to get the same increase in capacity by the establishment of a number of separate stations in different parts of the country away from large centres of population.  There are, certainly, national economic considerations which will induce us to secure the maximum independence from imported fuel supplies for the production of electricity, on which the maintenance of our essential industries and the health and welfare of our people depend.</P>
    <P>Deputy Roddy referred to the position concerning paper.  I do not think there is much prospect of increasing the output of our own paper mills.  I think our own paper mills have done wonders in increasing output since the beginning of the war.  Before the war, they used imported materials to a large extent, but despite the cessation of supplies of <Col N="545" /> imported materials they have effected an increased output.  Despite fuel difficulties they have adapted themselves to the new conditions and put themselves in a position to carry on.  In fact the Clondalkin Paper Mill, which is the largest in the country was, I think, one of the first industrial concerns to undertake the production of turf for its own purposes by its own efforts and it has been working entirely on turf for a long time past.  I should like to be able to tell Deputy Roddy and other people interested in the publication of newspapers that the supply of newsprint, that is the form of paper used in the production of newspapers, is reasonably secure.</P>
    <P>I have found in the past that newspaper proprietors are fairly optimistic as to the supply position, and are always anxious to get newsprint on a larger scale than I considered prudent. I do not want to encourage any unfounded optimism.  We have been able to keep up the supply to these newspapers in the past by reason of the fact that we could draw, not merely on Canada, but also on Sweden, Swedish newsprint having, as I told the Dáil, to be transported to Lisbon, and shipped from Lisbon in our ships.  There is a supply at Lisbon at the moment which we may be able to import, but it is a reasonable assumption that the course of the war is likely to endanger our getting supplies from that source for some time to come.  The supplies that can be obtained from Canada are, of course, limited by shipping difficulties.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan asked me about shotgun cartridges, and said that farmers found, it impossible to get shotgun cartridges.  I think the Deputy is unaware of the Order which I made recently for the regulation of the distribution of the available supply of shotgun cartridges.  Under that Order, persons holding a 5/- licence&mdash;there are about 60,000 of them, and they are in the main farmers&mdash;can now each get 12 cartridges.  Persons holding a £2 licence, of whom there are about 12,000 can get 22 cartridges each, but the £2 licence holders can get their 22 cartridges only after the 5/- licence holders have got their 12 cartridges. That arrangement does ensure an <Col N="546" /> equitable distribution of the supply of cartridges.  It provides that both classes of licence holders will get reasonable supplies, and it cannot in future be said that a farmer requiring shotgun cartridges for the extermination of vermin cannot get them.  It will be noted that the total quantity available is very limited.  There may be a further distribution later, but the 12 cartridges for each 5/- licence holder and 22 cartridges for each £2 licence holder is as much as the available supply will permit.</P>
    <P>Deputy Roddy urged that I should give a higher allocation of explosives to county councils.  I should like very much to do so, but we can only increase the allocation to county councils by decreasing the allocation to industrial users, and I think it would be bad policy to do so.  The industrial users who are getting an allocation of explosives at the moment are the collieries &mdash;they are getting all the explosives they reasonably require to facilitate the output of coal&mdash;lime burners, cement works, and similar enterprises, all of which are necessary under present circumstances.  I recognise that the contraction of the supply to county councils reduces their ability to organise and carry out relief works and other schemes which are important in their areas, but we could not hope to give them more unless the total supply is increased.  It must not be assumed that the county councils are not getting any explosives.  They are, in fact, getting the largest single allocation of available supplies, but less than their normal requirements.</P>
    <P>I do not think there was any other matter referred to in the course of the debate that I should discuss at this stage.  I think I have answered all points of importance.  There will be other opportunities of discussing general policy, and most of the Deputies who have spoken were concerned with questions of general policy.  It is, I think, not possible to consider post-war plans merely in relation to the activities of one Department.  That question will have to be raised in a general way so that an indication can be given as to how the activities of one Department dovetail into those of another.  It was because of the fact <Col N="547" /> that we were discussing the activities of more than one Department that we had such a speech as that made by Deputy Dillon who referred to problems of road construction and housing which are mainly the concern of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  No doubt they have a direct bearing on the work done by the Department of Industry and Commerce, but I could not undertake to reply to the queries which Deputy Dillon put forward in relation to these matters which he must address to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, who is the Minister directly responsible for these matters.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Minister's reason for giving special preference in permits to migratory workers was because of their economic position?  Is that so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, I think, understands that these migratory workers have an economy of their own.  The whole economy of their farms and their homesteads is based on the assumption that certain members of the family go every year to Scotland, and to certain districts in England for agricultural work.  They do some of their own farm work before they go, and complete it when they come back.  We could not attempt to interrupt that method of living which has gone on for generations in present circumstances without being able to substitute here some similar form of work for the agricultural work in Britain to which these migratory labourers go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesPPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister say that there was no discrimination?  I know many cases of young men particularly, who could get employment in Britain, and who cannot get it here, and who are being compelled to support themselves and their people on unemployment assistance.  Why should they not be permitted to go where they can get work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy understands that the difference between migratory workers and the workers to whom he refers is that the migratory <Col N="548" /> workers go over for two or three months in the year and then come back. The following year they go to the same employer and come back again.  Normally, the class of person to whom the Deputy refers would have been facilitated in applying for exit permits. The suspension of that facility arose solely out of the new restriction imposed by the British authorities in March or April last.  It is possible that, with the clarification of the position, some modification of the suspension will be decided upon in the near future.</P>

      <P>The men to whom I refer were promised jobs in England and approved of for work in England. Then the ban was imposed and they are still idle.  I think that it is a great hardship on these men that they cannot get permits.  They have no knowledge of agriculture.  I could quite understand the Minister's concern in regard to agricultural workers, from the point of view of the shortage of labour on the land, but I cannot see any point in refusing permits to tradesmen and builders' labourers, who cannot get work at home owing to the shortage of materials but who could get work in Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government normally acted in accord with the views just expressed by Deputy Coburn. The situation was, however, that the British Government announced that nobody would be allowed to travel between Great Britain and Ireland, and it was considered that we should suspend the issue of exit permits until we found exactly what that meant for our citizens, because there is an obligation on our Government to protect the interests of our citizens not only in Ireland but abroad.  Attempts have been made to secure a clarification of the position since the announcement was made, and I think I can say that <Col N="549" /> the whole position will be reviewed by the Government at an early date and decisions taken in the light of the information gained in the meantime.</P>

      <P>The question raised by Deputy Corry is a burning question in every part of the country.  These people who are not agricultural workers, but town workers living outside the town boundary, are cut off unemployment assistance at certain periods of the year, with the result that they have to go on home assistance.  It is a great hardship on them because they are town workers who were put into new houses just outside the boundary.  Can nothing be done in the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If we have differentiation between areas, somebody will be found to be on the border, no matter where we draw the line.  The Government undertook to refund to local authorities any assistance they had to give by reason of individual hardship resulting from those Employment Period Orders.  The amount which the Government had to pay in consequence <Col N="550" /> of that guarantee was not very large but, if there is a particular problem, such as exists in Cork, the right way to solve it is by extending the borough boundary.  For some reason, Cork municipal authorities are reluctant to take the necessary steps to extend the boundary of the borough so as to include the completely urbanised area&mdash; an area in which the houses are, in fact, owned by the corporation itself. If they would take the necessary steps to extend their boundary, they would solve a number of problems, including this problem.</P>

      <P>There has been some misunderstanding about the circulation of this Vote for the Order Paper.  I propose to give the House a review of the activities of the Special Employment Schemes' Office for the year that has closed.  The amount made available by the Oireachtas for employment and emergency schemes in the last financial year was £1,250,000, of which a sum of £1,091,623 was expended within the financial year.  To this expenditure should be added the contributions by local authorities amounting to £195,037, making a gross expenditure of £1,286,660. Details of the expenditure to 31st March, 1944, under the Vote are as follows:&mdash;Salaries, Travelling Expenses, etc., £32,970; Public Health Works,&mdash;State Grant, £45,460; Local Contribution, £71,668, Total, £117,128.  Housing Sites Development&mdash;State Grant, £17,430; Local Contribution, £17,430, Total, £34,860. Road Works in Urban Areas&mdash;State <Col N="555" /> Grant, £133,919; Local Contribution, £42,386; Total, £176,305.  Amenity Schemes in Urban Areas&mdash;State Grant, £51,219; Local Contribution, £15,410; Total, £66,629.  Rural Employment Schemes&mdash;Roads&mdash;State Grant, £183,574; Local Contribution, £42,350; Total, £225,924.  Minor Employment Schemes&mdash;State Grant, £135,677, no local contribution.  Bog Development Schemes&mdash;Landholders and Other private producers' bogs&mdash;State Grant, £76,925; no local contribution. Farm Improvements Scheme &mdash;State Grant, £303,824; no local contribution.  Seed Distribution Scheme&mdash;State Grant, £9,517; no local contribution.  Rural Improvements Scheme&mdash;State Grant, £1,330, Local Contribution, £459; Total, £1,789.  Miscellaneous Works&mdash;State Grant, £33,894; Local Contribution, £5,334: Total, £39,228.  The total figures work out as follows&mdash;State Grants: £1,091,623; Local Contributions, £195,037&mdash;£1,286,660.</P>
      <P>In addition to the £1,250,000 made available under the Employment and Emergency Schemes Vote, 1943-44, a sum of £50,000 was provided in the Vote for the Department of Local Government and Public Health for a type of work, namely, the reconditioning or repair of public roads subject to heavy turf transport, which comes within the scope of the Employment and Emergency Schemes Vote, 1944/45. The expenditure on such works in 1943/44 was State, £39,988; Local, £14,050; Total, £54,038; and if this expenditure by the Department of Local Government and Public Health is added to the expenditure from the Employment and Emergency Schemes Vote the aggregate expenditure amounts to: State, £1,131,611; Local, £209,087; Total, £1,340,698.</P>
      <P>Of the expenditure of £1,286,660 from the Employment and Emergency Schemes Vote, including contributions by local authorities, during the financial year 1943/44, approximately £374,000 was expended during the period 1st April to 30th September, and the balance of £912,660 during the winter months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="556" /> The maximum number of workmen employed at any one time during the year was: Farm Improvement Schemes 12,618; other schemes 19,229; total 31,847.  The average number employed on all schemes during the period up to September was 9,002, and from October to March 18,382. Of these, approximately 40 per cent. were workmen who would otherwise have been entitled to unemployment assistance; but if the figures for Farm Improvement and Bog Development Schemes (on which the numbers of unemployment assistance recipients engaged are relatively low) be excluded, the proportion of workmen who would otherwise have been entitled to unemployment assistance would be 77 per cent. approximately.</P>
    <P>The average period of employment given to individual workmen varies with the class of work, and in the different areas, but the total amount of employment afforded in 1943/44, apart from the Farm Improvement Scheme which is of a different order, is equivalent to work for 31,000 men each receiving part-time employment for four or five days per week, for an average of 12 weeks.</P>
    <P>The total number of applications received for Minor Employment Schemes during the year was 3,184 and about 5,100 proposals were investigated and reported on, including proposals already partially carried out.</P>
    <P>During the spring and summer approximately 450 minor drainage schemes were carried out at a cost of £30,800, principally for the development of bogs used by landholders for the supply of their domestic requirements of turf.</P>
    <P>The Rural Improvements Scheme under which grants on a contributory basis are made available for works for the joint benefit of groups of two or more farmers, such as accommodation roads and small drainage schemes was introduced during the past year.  The total number of effective applications received up to 31st March, 1944 was 1,503, of which 372 had at that date been investigated on the ground by inspectors and reported on.  Grants totalling £8,174 were sanctioned in the year under review for 45 schemes estimated <Col N="557" /> to cost £10,992, the balance of £2,818 represents the total of the amounts contributed by the applicants.</P>
    <P>It should be stated, for the information of the Dáil, that this first period, from the introduction of the scheme to the end of the financial year, has been mainly one of preparation, recruitment of staff and the laying down of procedure.  The scheme did not lend itself to immediate application on a wide scale.  It involves in effect the making of a contract with the applicants in each approved case to expend a specified amount, partly provided by the State and partly by the applicants, on some agreed work; and the applicants in view of the fact that they pay part of the cost, naturally take a very keen interest in the execution of the work and in the results achieved.  Consequently, in order to avoid subsequent disputes it was essential that a careful specification and estimate should be made in each case and that the offers of grants should be very clearly set out and that any circumstances peculiar to an individual case should always be noted.  It was also necessary to have a very definite understanding with county surveyors, who have undertaken to carry out the works, to ensure that they would, as our agents, fully discharge our obligation to the applicants.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, in the initial stages stress was laid rather on laying the ground work properly than on issuing offers hastily, in the expectation that any time lost would be amply recovered later in the smooth operation of a carefully planned system; and it may be some measure of our success in this regard that in no case completed to date has any difficulty arisen with the applicants, while in many instances they have expressed satisfaction with the results.  Some delay was also occasioned by the difficulty in recruiting the required technical staff, and also by the travelling difficulties occasioned by the present emergency.</P>
    <P>It may be expected that, with the difficult preliminary stage now safely over, good progress will be made, and that a very considerable number of cases will be dealt with <Col N="558" /> in the current year: but this again depends on the willingness of applicants to pay the contributions required of them.</P>
    <P>From the figures which I gave at the outset it may be seen that the expenditure against State grant was £158,377 less than the sum provided by the Oireachtas.  On the other hand the expenditure against local contribution was £15,037 more than anticipated. The increase under the heading of local contribution was due mainly to a higher proportion than was anticipated of schemes having a comparatively high rate of local contribution being carried out.</P>
    <P>In regard to the under expenditure in respect of voted moneys the position generally is that it is very difficult to achieve within the financial year the expenditure of the precise amount voted.  Each year's programme of relief works consists of a large number of separate schemes of which a very considerable proportion are undertaken by the various local authorities throughout the country, and the period of execution of the schemes is limited as far as possible to the winter months when the need for employment. is relatively greatest.  Every effort is made, by watching the returns of expenditure submitted periodically by the various bodies in charge of the works, to regulate the progress of expenditure but in the circumstances as already explained complete success in this regard is not to be expected.</P>
    <P>Added to these general causes there was also the circumstance that last year there was a further decline in the number of unemployment assistance recipients throughout the country, with the result that in some cases it was difficult to obtain sufficiently large gangs to permit of schemes being carried out at all, while in others the gangs were smaller than expected and the rate of progress correspondingly slower.</P>
    <P>Further causes operating to reduce expenditure were: the difficulties already referred to of getting the Rural Improvements Scheme under way, and the failure of farmers in certain cases under the Farm Improvements Scheme to complete works for <Col N="559" /> which grants would normally have become payable during the year of account, owing mainly to the increased demands made on the available labour force by the emergency food and fuel production programme.</P>
    <P>The estimate of the amount required in the year ending 31st March, 1945, for employment and emergency schemes is £1,250,000, made up as follows:&mdash; continuation of schemes sanctioned prior to 31st March, 1944 (re-vote), £660,000; miscellaneous new schemes, £590,000.  To the amount of the Vote must be added contributions estimated at £206,000 expected from local authorities, and from beneficiaries under the Rural Improvements Scheme. This gives a total sum of £1,456,000, available for expenditure within the financial year 1944-45; and to enable this expenditure to be achieved as far as possible within the time limit, it is proposed to authorise schemes to the extent of £665,000 (State grant) in excess of the amount of the Vote.  This sum together with a proportionate amount for local contributions will be carried forward at the 31st March, 1945, to form part of the ensuing year's programme.</P>
    <P>In this regard it is desirable to remind the Dáil that a large portion of each year's Vote is allocated to local authorities, and the expenditure of the full amount of the provision depends largely on the acceptance of the grants on the terms offered, and on the prompt submission of schemes by the local authorities.</P>
    <P>Subject to the foregoing remarks, the following table sets forth for each class of work the proposed expenditure in the year 1944-45:&mdash;</P>

    <P>Between January, 1943, and January, 1944, the total number of men in receipt of unemployment assistance fell by about 11.7 per cent.  The principal reduction occurred in the rural areas, but even in the urban districts there was a substantial decline in the figures.</P>
    <P>In view of the reduction in the number of unemployed, smaller provision has been made under sub-heads F, G and H for employment schemes in rural and urban areas, and the provision under sub-head O for Miscellaneous Schemes has been reduced.</P>
    <P>As a partial offset to these reductions, it has been found advisable to make increased provision under sub-head L (Seed Distribution Scheme) and sub-head I (Bog Development Schemes); and provision has been made under sub-head J for schemes for the reconditioning or repair of public roads subject to heavy turf traffic which, in the previous year, were provided for in the Vote for the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  Taking the Vote as a whole, <Col N="561" /> there is a reduction of £50,000 as compared with the provision for corresponding services last year.</P>
    <P>Most Deputies are aware of the principles underlying the allocations of grants under the Vote, and it is scarcely necessary for me to refer to them now.  As in previous years, we shall rely mainly on the various local authorities&mdash;county councils, urban councils, etc.&mdash;to provide the works needed to make up the employment schemes programme.  Excepting minor employment schemes, this is the only source from which we can obtain proposals of definite public utility and high unskilled labour content in sufficient number to provide the required amount of employment during the winter months.</P>
    <P>We shall, however, always welcome proposals from any source which seem likely to satisfy the essential requirements of public utility, high unskilled labour content and proximity to the places of residence of unemployed persons.</P>
    <P>The emergency services provided for in the Vote&mdash;sub-heads J, K, L, M, I and N&mdash;are directed towards the facilitating and encouragement of food and turf production, and will be used accordingly.  In addition, the moneys provided under the other sub-heads for purely employment schemes in rural areas will, as far as is consistent with their primary purpose of providing employment in necessitous areas, be used to further the same ends.</P>

      <P>There are two matters I wish to raise.  When we speak of bog development, I am afraid the Government is beginning to be somewhat dazzled by the significance of the larger schemes they have in connection with the winning of turf for the national pool.  There are very large development schemes in connection with the operations of county surveyors but, in addition, a great many bog roads have been constructed during the last few years to accommodate the opening of new bogs for the provision of turbary for local consumers.  My experience is that a great many of these bog roads have had very heavy traffic on them during the past two years and are disappearing into the bogs.  I represented to the county surveyor in Roscommon that, in respect of one bog road there at least, steps should be taken to put it into repair before it went beyond repair; and my recollection was that he said he had no labour wherewith to do the work.  That road is situated in the Aughalustia bog in the Ballaghadereen electoral area. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will find correspondence from me in the Department about it: if not, the county surveyor in Roscommon has it. I would direct attention to the necessity of keeping these roads in repair, if the local people are to get turf supplies as well as the national pool.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that in Monaghan we have a most extraordinary situation?  Coming, as he does, from Cavan, he is probably familiar with the extraordinary scarcity of turf.  The local authority not infrequently closes a road, in order to get to the turf that lies underneath it.  I trust that the officers of his Department are collaborating to the limit of their capacity to facilitate local authorities, or whoever is acting on his behalf in County Monaghan, in getting access to any deposits of turf there may be.  I am very much concerned about the fuel position in County <Col N="563" /> Monaghan, and I am very much afraid that, next winter, with the devastation that has been wrought on the available supplies of timber in that county, whatever turf we can get out of the turf banks in the county may not be sufficient to supply the requirements of the towns in County Monaghan.  I would be doing less than my duty if I did not direct the Parliamentary Secretary's attention to the fuel problem, so that he may not have sprung upon him in the late autumn a very crucial situation, for which he may be called upon to answer by the Minister for Supplies, for having failed to take measures to get the largest available local supplies of fuel during the emergency out of the bogs in that area.</P>
    <P>The other point I would like to mention is that I am amazed, in the times in which we are living, to read of the numbers of unmarried men without family responsibilities who are drawing the dole.  Most persons who have a job to offer at the present time experience a labour shortage.  It is a very healthy and comfortable thing that, if you advertise in the paper for a working man, instead of being inundated with applications from men asking a wretched wage in the hope of getting the position, you may have to go hunting for a man.  Any person having skilled services to offer is in a position to command a good wage now, and any honest workman who is prepared to do an honest week's work finds employers more than willing to give him a liberal week's pay.  Yet we have this extraordinary picture of groups of young men assembling at Civic Guards' barracks all over the country, collecting the dole.</P>
    <P>My political advisers always have told me: &ldquo;Do not touch the subject of the dole, or you get your head in a halter; everyone is getting the dole, and they all will vote against you.&rdquo;  I cannot help that.  If they are going to vote against me for what I am going to say now, that is just too bad.  I cannot see any justification at present for providing doles.  I want to distinguish between unemployment assistance and unemployment insurance. <Col N="564" /> The man who is paying into the Unemployment Insurance Fund is entitled to get his benefit out of that fund, if the risk against which he insured eventuates, and he is under no obligation to anybody.  I am talking about unemployment assistance&mdash;commonly known in rural Ireland as &ldquo;the dole.&rdquo; I cannot see what justification there is for paying the dole to hordes of young fellows who, in my judgment, are no more unemployed than I am.  I believe that it makes a great many of these young people reluctant to do a hand's turn on their parents holding, for fear the fact that they do a bit of work on their parents' holding might disqualify them for receipt of the dole. Am I right in believing that the Parliamentary Secretary made reference to payment of the dole in connection with this Vote?</P>

      <P>I do not wish to be irrelevant. I think that this whole question of providing the dole for young unmarried persons without family responsibilities should be reviewed. I am all in favour of providing relief schemes or anything else that may be necessary to enable a married man with family responsibilities to continue to live at home and keep his family together in the interregnum between one job and another, but I have no sympathy at all, be it politically popular or unpopular, with the expenditure of public money in order to spare an unmarried young man without family responsibilities from the obligation of faring forth throughout the country in search of employment, wherever it may be available.  Such a person has no right to claim the dole, or that eleemosynary employment will be provided for him within walking distance of his home.  If that system is to continue in this country it will demoralise the entire rising generation.</P>

      <P>While I have nothing but commendation for the rural improvements schemes, which are filling a most useful role, I have some fear that there may be a tendency to overdevelop them to the detriment of minor relief schemes.  Although the rural improvements scheme is undoubtedly conferring a benefit, I fear there is a tendency to have that type of scheme attracting too much attention, with the result that there are many boreens and culs-de-sac throughout the country that are equally clamouring for attention left to deteriorate to a very great extent. There are many roads leading to the bogs that should come under the category of minor relief schemes and they are left waiting until such time as they come within the category of a rural improvements scheme.  The minor relief scheme seems to be in a sandwiched position or left out altogether. Prior to the introduction of the rural improvements scheme we found they were being excluded because the money was largely being utilised on the roads improvement scheme, reconstructing and maintaining the main roads.  Certain sums were allocated to the main roads and the boreens had to go without, with the result that a lot of the by-roads and boreens have got into a deplorable condition. The people whose interests are affected are ratepayers and, even if they are poor and even if they are cottiers or small holders, they are entitled to some amenities.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to give this matter his serious consideration. I am not objecting to the rural improvements schemes at all, but I fear there is a tendency that they may overshadow the equally important and perhaps more necessary minor relief schemes, where there cannot be a contribution made.  In certain portions of my constituency the number of minor relief schemes carried out during the past five or six years could be counted on the fingers of one hand. Most of the work has been done on the main roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that the traffic on the main roads is not what it used to be&mdash;the motor traffic has practically disappeared&mdash;perhaps <Col N="566" /> a little more attention could be given to the improvement of the roads to farmers' houses, labourers' cottages and the bogs, whether or not a contribution is available from the particular locality concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>I am of the opinion that the advantages that are derived from the rural improvements schemes are not yet fully appreciated.  I think it would be well if the Parliamentary Secretary would do something to get the people to appreciate the advantages of these schemes better.  In my county such schemes could be put into operation with great advantage.  I know there are many farmers who would derive considerable benefit from the rural improvements schemes.  There is one matter in which I think we have failed and that is in getting the farmers to co-operate.  I have made efforts in vain to get them to realise the benefit that can be derived from these schemes.  I have met with no success whatsoever.  I have even got promises from the Parliamentary Secretary to give grants over and above 75 per cent of the cost and yet I have failed to get any response from the farmers who should be interested in having the roads repaired.</P>
      <P>I think it would be well if some attention were drawn to this matter in the Press, if an appeal were made to the farmers and if it were pointed out that the State cannot wholly be held responsible for the condition of the roads.  It is only reasonable to expect the people to give a contribution towards the maintenance or repair of the roads.  They will then be able to see that it would be unwise for them to expect that the present or a future Government will grant 100 per cent. towards the maintenance or the repair of those roads.  This is really a splendid scheme and the only difficulty is in getting the farmers to realise the advantages they will gain through cooperating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a lot of money being spent on the main roads and I think the bog roads and the smaller agricultural roads or boreens&mdash;whatever you like <Col N="567" /> to call them&mdash;deserve more consideration. The traffic on the main roads has been very much reduced.  On account of the production of turf in County Mayo, the bog roads there are getting the worse for wear and some of them are in a pretty bad condition now.  As a rule those bog roads are narrow and the lorries using them wear out the surfaces very quickly. The man with the horse and cart who is removing turf to his home sometimes finds it difficult to get past the lorries, which take up a lot of space. The sides of the bog roads are not very solid and the consequences of vehicles trying to pass each other are sometimes serious&mdash;perhaps a lorry or a cart may have to be hauled out.  I think it is desirable that the Parliamentary Secretary should give some attention to that matter.</P>
    <P>As regards minor improvement schemes, I understand there has to be a certain number of recipients of unemployment assistance in an area before any grant can be given for the construction or repair of a road.  On another occasion I pointed out that there are in different areas young men who are not desirous of going to the labour exchange and who feel they would be coming down a peg if they have many questions to answer.  They would rather get on without having to go to the exchange.  I think it is wrong that the grants for minor relief schemes should be determined on the number of such recipients in a locality. I think other considerations should be taken into account, such as the population of the locality and the number of young men available between October and March.  That should be the position especially in South and North Mayo, where large numbers of young men come home in October and remain until March or April, or perhaps this time of the year.  They have to depend mostly on the savings they made in England, and I think it is reasonable to suggest that the grant to be given for minor improvement schemes in areas where those young men reside should not be determined purely on the number of assistance recipients.  That should be determined on the number of young men in the <Col N="568" /> particular area and their financial position.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the farm improvement scheme.  Of course, there is no criticism to offer there.  Undoubtedly, it is a very fine scheme.  It has helped to brighten small farms and is a great help to the small farmer.  I believe farmers in general are availing of that scheme and making good use of it. One or two complaints have been brought to my notice in connection with roads leading into houses, or tillage roads.  As the Parliamentary Secretary is aware, in my part of the County Mayo a lot of land is reclaimed land.  In other words, underneath it is bog.  We have only to go down a foot or six inches to find bog.  Some tillage inspectors or supervisors&mdash;I think not deliberately, but perhaps through misunderstanding&mdash;say that they cannot give a grant for a road unless it is built on a gravel or solid foundation. You might have to go down 10 to 20 feet to get a gravel foundation in some places.  If there is a drain put on each side of the road, I think the grant should be given.  I do not think it is right to ask that they should go down 10 or 15 feet to the gravel foundation.</P>
    <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary, in replying, to say if anything could be done as regards determining the grants under the minor employment schemes and in bringing to the notice of the small farmers the importance of the grant under the rural improvement schemes. It should be made plain that they should be grateful to the Government or Department that is willing to give 75 per cent. grants under the rural improvement schemes.  There are many areas in South Mayo where, if they could understand that, they would be prepared to co-operate in making the scheme a success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all I wish to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on his vision and optimism regarding the rural improvement scheme.  I think I owe him an apology because I was one of the few Deputies in this House who criticised the scheme last year, adversely, if you like, not because I found any fault with the <Col N="569" /> scheme, but because I was not so optimistic as the Parliamentary Secretary that the 25 per cent. would be forthcoming from the people.  I felt that the fact that the people had been accustomed so much to getting full grants for everything under minor relief schemes would be a very great barrier.  I am glad to see that barrier is being broken down.  I am also pleased to know that the county I come from is availing of the scheme, and that numerous applications have been made to the Department for rural improvement grants, and that in a number of cases the people are willing to contribute the 25 per cent. required as a local contribution.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary stated that there were 1,503 applications submitted, and that 372 were being sanctioned. I believe a greater number could be sanctioned, but of course the scheme is in the initial stages, and the preliminary work had to be carried out. I believe the number of inspectors, particularly in a big county like Galway, is too few to deal with the numerous applications.  I believe we have only one inspector in County Galway, whereas in order to cope with the applications in an expeditious manner it would take at least three inspectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as schemes of public utility are concerned, where a road is going to benefit a number of people other than those directly living on it, it should be brought home to the local authorities, and particularly to the county surveyors, that there should be much greater co-operation with the Board of Works than there is at the moment.  I know that in our county, for a number of years, we have been voting money for new roads, public utility roads, not <i>culs-de-sac</i>, to the extent of about £10,000 or £12,000 a year.  The rural improvement scheme is a very big advantage, but I fell that the county surveyor is not inclined to co-operate as fully as he might.  He will co-operate to the extent of seeing that the work is carried out well, I am sure, because all works that have been carried out under the supervision of the county surveyor and his staff under the minor employment and other schemes have been carried out very <Col N="570" /> well, but there seems to be a reluctance on the part of our county surveyor&mdash; and I think that applies fairly generally&mdash;to add additional mileage of roads to the mileage already existing for maintenance purposes.  That is the chief reason why they are not cooperating as fully as they might.  That is why I should like it brought home to the Department of Local Government, and through the Department of Local Government down to the county surveyor, that where a grant has been made available for a road which is of public utility, serving the general public, the county surveyor and the local authority should go all out to help to have that work carried out.</P>
    <P>As regards the bog development schemes and the making of roads into bogs, I regret the Estimate on this occasion is reduced by £6,000.  I think, in a time like this, that is false economy.  If anything, it should be increased because the making of good roads into bogs is very important and very useful not merely from the point of view of getting home a supply of fuel for domestic purposes but, where there is a bad road leading into a bog, at the period of the year when the farmers should give attention to their other crops, they have to neglect these crops in order to try to procure their domestic fuel.  I believe that is a strong argument in favour of putting roads leading into bogs in proper condition.</P>
    <P>I believe that if the representatives of all Parties in the House when meeting their constituents told them of the advantages of this rural improvements scheme, what it would mean to them, and that it is as far as this Government are prepared to go and, in fact, as far as members of every Party are prepared to go, it will be an incentive to them to avail of this scheme.  I feel that perhaps some of the criticisms that were made last year, including criticisms by myself, may have prevented some people from availing of the scheme.  When the housing grants were made available in 1932, a number of farmers said that £70 or £80 was not very much good and they did not avail of the grant. But, when their neighbours took it up and showed what £70 or £80 could do <Col N="571" /> in the building of a house, the others followed suit.  I believe, therefore, that there is a good future for the rural improvements scheme, which is a Godsend to the small farmers in the backward areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>While we all agree that the rural improvements scheme is a very good one, unfortunately, we find in many cases that where a scheme would help a number of people living on a road you will always find others objecting to having the work carried out.  In a case I have in mind a person living at the entrance to a particular road objected to interference with his property and the work could not be carried out in that particular case.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that, if possible, compulsory powers should be secured to carry out such work where objections are made to a scheme being carried out, as in that instance, by those living at the entrance to a road. The owner of the land at the entrance to the road objected to having anything done to his private property and there are eight people living on that road.  Unless that person will agree to allow a threshing machine in through his land these people cannot get a threshing machine in.  That is an unfortunate position for these people.  They cannot get the threshing machine in through the entrance as it is too narrow.  Therefore, I suggest that compulsory powers should be sought so that the work can be carried out in such cases.  As to utility or link roads, I think work on these should be carried out as minor relief schemes or by the county surveyor under the supervision of the Office of Works.  In the case of such roads you will get people to agree to contribute a certain amount of money, but others will not agree and therefore the work cannot be done.  The unfortunate people living in the middle have no way out.  Therefore, I suggest that the county surveyor, under the direction of the Office of Works, should carry out such works, because there is no getting away from the fact that such roads are very essential.  Repairs to such roads would be very helpful to the people. <Col N="572" /> I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should give immediate attention to these two points.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was delighted to hear Deputy Beegan praising the rural improvements scheme, because for quite a while he did not feel that way about it, as he admitted himself.  Personally, I had always great hopes for it because, if there is one thing above all others that it will do, it will teach the people to co-operate and that will be a great thing.  In my area the people are taking advantage of that scheme and it certainly is a good one.  As regards the minor employment schemes, I have no grouse so far as they go.  But I do believe that something better could be done, because people are required to sign a form when work on a road is proposed and one individual may refuse to sign because of some jealousy or bitterness against his neighbour and the whole thing goes flop.  In a case like that, where the majority of the people sign and a certain individual through jealousy or spitefulness towards his neighbour attempts to hold up the scheme there should be some power to overrule people of that description. In other Departments that is done.  I fail to see why the Parliamentary Secretary should not get such powers and use them.  I know of one special scheme in my own area which would have accommodated at least 25 people and which was a most necessary work.  I went on three occasions to the Parliamentary Secretary in connection with the matter and I was very pleased when I found that it was sanctioned. Later on it turned out that some individual, for spiteful reasons, managed to prevent the work from being carried out.  If the Parliamentary Secretary has not got such powers, I hope he will obtain them, and that he will not allow individuals of that sort to stand in the way of such schemes.</P>

      <P>I am quite sure the Parliamentary Secretary and his Department are quite capable of drawing the line and that we can safely depend on them to do so.  I think he knows what I mean.  I do not mean that we should compulsorily take over a man's field; I am speaking of the man who will object to the putting back of a fence for a distance of a yard or so. I have seen a man objecting to the cutting of a hedge for reasons of spite and I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary should consider the matter.</P>
      <P>There is another matter which I want to refer to and which made it necessary for me to come to Dublin with the Galway county surveyor last January.  It appears that under the regulations governing minor relief schemes no person but those who are registered unemployed can get work on them.  The schemes have to be finished by 31st March and there are quite a number of people in the area who never register but who require work just as much as the people who make registering a profession. I think the Parliamentary Secretary should not stand in the way of these people getting work if they want to work on these schemes.  In relation to the position in my area, the Parliamentary Secretary more or less gave us our way and these men were allowed to work on the schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to bog development, I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary should turn the attention of his Department to schemes of bog roads and bog drainage.  I am glad to note from what I have seen during the past week that a certain amount of this work is being carried out by his Department. Some of the schemes have come to my area and, I hope, to other Deputies' areas as well.  Now that there is a great need for turf production, we have the opportunity of our lives to build roads into these bogs.  Now is the time to build these roads, the building of <Col N="574" /> which will increase turf production by at least 200 per cent.</P>
    <P>In my own area, there are people who never succeeded in taking out 50 per cent. of the turf they cut, on account of the condition of the roads, and I know places where, if they do not succeed in taking their turf away early in the month of July, they have no hope of getting it out until June of the following year.  We should take the opportunity which presents itself now and get the people to realise that it is not slavery to get turf out of a bog.  In my area, it is not a question of the cutting or the saving of the turf but of getting it out of the bogs.</P>
    <P>I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider these points: the matter of the man who stands in the way, for reasons of jealousy, of the pushing back of a fence a yard or so, the cutting of a hedge or such other work: the matter of roads into bogs and the drainage of bogs, because now is the time to get the people bog-minded and turf-minded; and also the matter of allowing every man who is willing to do a day's work for a day's pay to do that work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHarris" hpid="Mr. Harris Mr. Harris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harris</NameTxt>
      <P>Ten or 12 years ago, before the people realised that we would have to depend almost entirely for our fuel supply on turf, very great improvements in the form of drainage and the making of roads were carried out on the bogs of Kildare.  At that time, before the agricultural policy of the Government was fully developed, there was great unemployment in the rural parts of my constituency. Although many people did not approve of the action of the Government in spending so much money on bog drainage and the making of roads, it has been proved to have been very wise expenditure, now that we are thrown back on turf for fuel.  I want to impress on the Parliamentary Secretary the importance of attending to these roads and to the drainage carried out at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a very considerable production of turf over the past few years by small private turf producers, people who produce small quantities of turf.  There is a large number of <Col N="575" /> these producers in my constituency, and their total production would be very considerable every year.  Traffic over these bog roads has been very heavy, with the result that they have greatly deteriorated.  The development of national turf production and the activities of the Turf Development Board and the county councils, I am afraid, tend to overshadow the importance of the great number of small turf producers, with the result that drainage and roads have deteriorated.</P>
    <P>This deterioration and neglect of the roads is also due to the fact that we have not very many registered unemployed in the county, and I suppose it is not possible to have these works carried out as minor relief schemes, as in the past.  I have made an effort in a few cases to get these small turf producers to avail of the rural employment scheme, but I found that it is almost impossible to apply that scheme to some of the bog areas to which I refer, because considerable areas of the bogs are owned by individuals who lease the banks yearly to the producers. These owners have never shown any interest in the drainage or the making of roads into the bogs. They left that work to be done by the Government.  The man who leases a bank does not see his way to contributing to a rural employment scheme in order to have the work carried out, and I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary should consider this problem.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which I think is a genuine grievance, and, in fact, a disgrace, but I do not know whether it properly arises on this Estimate.  Large areas in my county were nothing more than swamps 12 years ago.  They were of no value whatever, but a considerable expenditure of money was carried out on building roads and making drains, and, when they were made valuable by the expenditure of Government money, the owners immediately raised the bog rents, which at present are exorbitant.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to realise the importance of the small turf producers in Kildare. I do not suppose there are in existence <Col N="576" /> any records of their production, but they are making a large contribution to the fuel requirements of the country at the present time, and something should be done towards maintaining the roads which those small producers are not able to keep in repair.</P>

      <P>Because of the prominence given in the debate to the minor relief schemes I fear there is a possibility that the Department of Public Works may lose sight of the rural improvement schemes which have been put into operation in recent years.  I should not like to see that happen.  I think the rural improvements scheme is one of the best schemes ever introduced here.  I think also that the scheme should not be relegated to secondary place in certain areas. There are, however, some districts in which it cannot operate successfully. I have in mind a few cases in the parishes of Knock and Bekan, County Mayo, where there is very necessary work on the construction of roads into bogs and even accommodation roads into lands, where the people who use those roads live a distance of up to three miles away from the roads in question.  They are the only people interested in the improvements, and if they adopt the rural improvements scheme and contribute one-fourth of the necessary funds they will not be able to take part in the work and earn some of their money back.  It is only the people immediately adjoining the roads who will benefit from the work in the way of wages.  In cases of that kind, where the people who require the work are too far removed from the jobs themselves, I think consideration should be given to the adoption of the minor relief scheme.  The difficulty in that regard is that there are very few registered unemployed in the district, but since the Department had the foresight and wisdom to adopt the rural improvements scheme I think they should also have the foresight and wisdom now to put into operation schemes that are absolutely essential without insisting on the rule that there must be a certain number of registered unemployed in the area. There are sufficient people there to do <Col N="577" /> the job.  At a certain time of the year there will be plenty of people who are not registered unemployed available for the work.  I think the Department should waive that rule in regard to minor relief schemes in certain areas when the rural improvements scheme cannot be put into operation by the people because of the distance which divides them from the particular accommodation roads that they require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to add to the praise which has already been given to the rural improvements scheme.  It is only in time that the people will adopt that scheme generally.  It is only in time that that scheme will replace 90 per cent. of the works that were being done under the minor relief schemes. The best advertisement that the Parliamentary Secretary could employ is to carry out one of those rural improvement schemes in every parish at the earliest possible moment.  Nothing succeeds like success, and when such a scheme is being carried out, and the people who benefit by it take part in it themselves by contributing a small amount to its cost, their neighbours in adjoining districts will be encouraged to adopt such a scheme too.  There is great difficulty in inducing people to sign application forms asking that certain works be carried out under that scheme, and it is only when some jobs are carried out here and there throughout the country that people will realise the benefits of the scheme to the whole community.  In regard to the amount of work done, I think you will get at least 30 per cent. better return from workmen on that scheme than you got formerly from workmen on the minor relief schemes, because they feel that they are doing their own work and have a greater interest in it than the workmen in the other case who felt that they were forced to go on the job because they were in receipt of unemployment assistance.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to speed up the inspection of those schemes in County Mayo, and I think it is only right to suggest that areas which have not hitherto been touched by reason of the fact that <Col N="578" /> there were no registered unemployed there should be given preference.</P>
    <P>In regard to main roads, it has been said that too much money has been spent on them.  I do not agree with that at all.  Unless there is a certain amount continually spent on the upkeep of main roads, in a short time the brunt of the expenditure will fall on the rate-paying public, in addition to what comes out of the Road Fund. If the main roads are allowed to deteriorate to a very great extent an enormous weight of expenditure will fall on the taxpayers in later years. I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to ensure that, when the main roads are being repaired or improved, a track will be left at least on one side, if not on both sides, for horses and cattle.  Up to a few years ago the main roads of this country were in a scandalous condition so far as the farmers were concerned, and steps should be taken to ensure that in future this track for cattle and horses will be a permanent feature of our main roads.</P>
    <P>The Seeds Scheme too is an excellent one, but it has come to my notice that in certain areas in County Mayo a limited number of the Department's officials concentrate on the same recipients of seeds every year.  The Department should have no pets so far as this is concerned.  The Seeds Scheme is an excellent one, and the Department's Inspectors&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If it is not the Parliamentary Secretary's duty to attend to this matter, perhaps he would bring it to the notice of the responsible Minister that the people who ought to be given consideration in this matter are those who are most entitled to get the seeds and who will give the best result for them.  On previous occasions, in other years, I pointed out that I considered money spent in that way to be badly spent because of the fact that certain people have got seeds under that head while <Col N="579" /> others were not allowed to benefit under the scheme.  In conclusion, I should like to say that I think the Department is showing initiative and even anxiety to serve the public, and I trust the Department will continue to serve the public in the coming year as efficiently as they have attempted to serve them during the last few years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>A few weeks ago, one of my colleagues from Dublin, Deputy Alderman Doyle, raised the question of roads on the Dublin hills where some hundreds of Dublin workmen cycle out to the bog to cut turf.  These people complain that the roads are in a very bad condition and that when they get there and start out to cut turf they have to walk a distance that would involve almost nine miles from the bog to the loading base&mdash;nine miles in order to get a ton of turf.  It was explained to me by one of these Dublin workmen, who cut turf on Saturday evenings, that by the time they had got sufficient sacks of turf from the bog to the loading base they had walked nine miles per ton of turf, and that if the Department could put the road in good order, or supply a somewhat smaller by-road, it would be very helpful to them.  I forget what reply was given to my colleague, Deputy Peadar Doyle, when he raised that question, but I understand that the difficulties of these Dublin workmen in getting to their turf are as great to-day as they were at that time.  When we find Dublin workers, who have no great skill in cutting turf, giving up their spare time and cycling, first, a distance of nine or ten miles to the hills, parking their bicycles somewhere, and then having to walk another nine miles to the bog and carry the turf back to where they can load it, I think some encouragement should be given to them.  I think that every Deputy in the House will agree that it is too much to expect from these men that they should have to walk nine miles per ton of turf to the loading base.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The question was raised by Deputy Alderman Doyle, and for the moment I quite forget what reply was given to him, but I understood that something was to have been done to make the lot of these workmen easier and to give them encouragement. Deputy Doyle also raised the question of transport for these people, who were game enough to go out there and work so hard in order to get a ton of turf.  I think they should be encouraged, and if no petrol is available for lorries to help them to get to the bog, I think it should be possible to provide some of the horse-drawn vehicles which at present belong to the Army.  Three or four horse-drawn vehicles belonging to the Army would be very helpful if they were put at the disposal of these men to bring them to the bog.  I had not intended intervening in this debate, but as other Deputies from country districts, who know all about turf and roadways, mentioned these matters I thought I would repeat the question that was raised by Deputy Doyle, and I hope that something will be done to make the lot of these people easier because, in my opinion, it would be a great national work.</P>

      <P>I do not want to delay the House.  This expenditure is very useful expenditure and has been of very great value to the agricultural and rural community, but I must confess that I am not at all satisfied with the distribution of the works or of the moneys expended on minor relief schemes, or with the methods by which moneys are paid under the farm improvements scheme.  It is true to say that no matter how strongly or how well a Deputy may recommend a work in a district, if a reply can be given that there is no unemployment in that district, the work will not be done.  On the other hand, if the local Fianna Fáil Club makes a recommendation, an inspector is sent down immediately and every effort is made to have the work done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I would not be surprised at that, and I would not be surprised even if the Deputy himself did it.  Now, it is true to say that the work that is generally done, even on the recommendation of the Fianna Fáil Club, is of an essential nature, and I have no complaint whatever about that, but in some instances what is known as the one-man pass is being made.  I know that that is not the fault of the Department or, very probably, of the Parliamentary Secretary, because the case might very easily be made that the pass may have been used by a number of people, but I hold that where money is going to be expended in a district, the work that would be most advantageous to the largest number of people should be undertaken first, and that, in particular, where turf is going to be drawn upon, and where the lane or pathway leads to a bog, it should be given priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next point I wish to make is in connection with landholders and private producers.  I do not know what the expenditure this year has been like, as I did not catch the Parliamentary Secretary's figure, but that is a thing which should be developed, and as I said in my remarks a while ago, on the Vote for the Department of Industry and Commerce, the more money expended on that the better. Not only should it be expended on the building of walls around the farmhouse or farm place, but also for out-offices and buildings, because I insist that in a great number of farmers' places the facilities for housing cows, pigs and poultry are not nearly as good as they should be.  In all these cases, where a job is undertaken and where this money is going to be expended on it, it should be seen to that the work is well done and fully completed. In my constituency a number of very essential passways and drains were recommended for work upon them a couple of years ago.  The inspector, in some cases, said that it was too late for that year, but that next year it would be considered, but nothing has been done since.  Am I <Col N="582" /> to take it that an application of that sort has to be made each year?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I am not making a charge against the official concerned.  I believe that he was supplied with incorrect information and I am satisfied that he acted perfectly <i>bona fide.</i>  I raised the matter only in order that such incidents may be avoided in the future.  If a mistake has been made, we cannot help it.  If the work is done and well done, I do not think it matters very much but at the same time it creates a great deal of jealousy in a district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only other point I want to make is that it sometimes happens that when <Col N="583" /> an important work which would accommodate a number of people is about to be carried out, that work is held up because one person refuses to give his consent.  The work then falls through and is not undertaken.  I think at a time like the present, when it is essential that all the food and fuel that can be produced should be made available, the Parliamentary Secretary should have conferred upon him, under an Emergency Powers Order if necessary, power to take over that particular portion of the pass which the owner in fee simple refuses to give. The owner should also be obliged to give an undertaking to assist in the maintenance of that road.  It sometimes happens, even when the local Fianna Fáil club has got going and has succeeded in getting the Minister to send down an inspector, that because of the thick-headedness of one individual it is impossible to proceed with the work.  Whether that individual be a Fianna Fáil supporter or a Fine Gael supporter I think the Parliamentary Secretary should have power when that is reported to him, as the local county surveyor has in the case of bogs, to go in and carry out the necessary work whether or not the owner likes it.  In that way a lot of trouble would be avoided and a great deal of hardship would be overcome.</P>
    <P>I should also like to point out that the delay in making payments of farm improvements grants is much too long. When the work is completed, or when it is in process of being completed, an advance should be made to assist the people concerned because money paid quickly on the nail is worth twice as much as when payment is delayed.  If there is a delay of two or three months in making the payment, and it is perhaps necessary for the local Deputy to make representations, it leads to a good deal of annoyance because contractors are very difficult people to deal with.  If the money were paid quickly, it would create more satisfaction all round.  There is no reason, in my opinion, once the work has been inspected, why the money should not be immediately forthcoming.  Again, in cases where a farmer dies before payment is made, if he dies without <Col N="584" /> making a will or if probate has not been taken out, payment is held up indefinitely. I think that is very unfair. The personal representative of the deceased man should get it and the estate duty and succession duty authorities should be left to look after their own interests later.  They will be able to get everything that is due to them afterwards.  If a cottage is built on the farm, or some money becomes payable to the occupants, the estate duty authorities will see that their claims are satisfied and they will charge a very high rate of interest on any claim that is outstanding.  I suggest that in every case where the person to whom the money would ordinarily be payable dies, payment should be made to the personal representative provided all the members of the family are prepared to sign an undertaking that they will indemnify the estate against any charge made against it.  In that way the money could be paid over quickly and the people who were engaged in the work would be saved a good deal of hardship.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnchadhOBriain" hpid="Donnchadh Ó Briain Donnchadh Ó Briain">
      <NameTxt>Donnchadh Ó Briain</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just two points with which I want to deal. I speak subject to correction, but, as far as I know, no inspections have yet been carried out in regard to applications under the rural improvement scheme in County Limerick.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to have such inspections expedited.  It would be a good thing if one or two of these schemes were carried out in different areas, so as to demonstrate to the people the benefits to be derived from such schemes and the value they confer on the people for whom they are intended.  Secondly, I want to stress the importance of the completion of unfinished minor employment schemes.  There does not seem to be much point in allocating a grant for a minor employment scheme and leaving the work unfinished at the end of the season, unless it is intended to come back the following year to finish the scheme.  The areas for which grants under the minor employment schemes are allocated are usually thickly populated, and there is very little variation in the figures for <Col N="585" /> employment from year to year.  Usually the electoral division that qualifies one year will qualify the next year.  I think it desirable also that the approach to the carrying out of these schemes should be more systematic in the respect I have mentioned.  That is, that a scheme taken in hands in any electoral division should be completed before a new scheme is undertaken. That is not always the practice. I have more than once called attention to it, and I should like again to stress the importance of the completion of old schemes before new schemes are undertaken in any electoral division.</P>
      <P>With regard to minor employment schemes, I have been urging for years on the Board of Works the desirability of grouping electoral divisions in order that necessary works can be carried out under this scheme.  In the case of rural improvement schemes, the necessity for pressure does not arise to the same extent.  At the same time, there may be areas where these minor employment schemes could be started if contiguous electoral divisions were grouped.  I should like to plead for more consideration of the grouping suggestion in future.  The introduction of this type of work by the Board of Works in the last ten or 12 years, and the introduction last year of the rural improvement schemes, has meant the promotion of very valuable amenities for the rural population.  I am glad to be able to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on the good work he and his Department are doing.  I know that in his capable hands the work will continue to make further progress.</P>

      <P>I am glad that all sides of the House are unanimous in expressing the opinion that these schemes represent the most useful expenditure we have from public funds.

Deputy MacEoin, a few moments ago, of course, said that that was done on the recommendation of Fianna Fáil clubs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>A good many.  I think there is one thing that no man should be in a better position to realise than Deputy MacEoin, and that is that the Fianna Fáil organisation is a real live wire, and when members of that organisation come along and put forward a certain work, it does so because there happens to be more members of the organisation living in that area than the members of any other organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>The organisation, as I say, is a live wire and Fianna Fáil clubs put forward these works because members of the organisation are living in every village.  The Deputy may have a bit of a grievance but I can assure him that the Fianna Fáil clubs are not going to leave out any particular road that they think requires attention.  I have been sending forward roads schemes myself for years and years, but as the Parliamentary Secretary said a few moments ago, there are many roads that cannot be made while we are here and that will have to be taken over by the people who come after us.  So far as the ordinary relief schemes are concerned, I think that the system of going on the basis of the number of people who are in receipt of unemployment assistance in a particular area should be ended, because unemployment assistance is now as low as it can possibly be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>Most people on unemployment assistance now are ineligible for any sort of hard work.  In districts all over our county, schemes had to be sent back last year.  They could not be done because workmen were not to be had.  I suggest that we again give preference to works of utility.  I know of cases where farmers could not get in a threshing machine to thresh their corn last year.  Here we are going about day after day urging increased tillage. That is all very fine but it is hard on people if they comply and then cannot <Col N="587" /> get their corn threshed.  Even when they do succeed in getting it threshed, they cannot get it out to the market. Hardship is also involved in this way in the case of children who have to go to school through their neighbours' fields. We should assess the value of those schemes more from the utility point of view than we have been doing up to the present.  When relief schemes are undertaken in the towns in winter, they are generally concerned with footpaths and work of that kind, while useful schemes could be evolved in providing drainage for districts within a mile or two of those towns and in the making of roads.  Such work should be undertaken before footpath work is put in hands.</P>
      <P>So far as the rural improvement schemes are concerned, the idea is excellent but sometimes the result bears heavily on a few persons.  If a scheme is prepared in respect of a road on which five people are living and the estimated cost is £700, £175 will have to be paid by the five persons who are to benefit.  That means £35 a head and it is too much to expect them to pay that amount.  How that is to be remedied, I do not know.  If some sort of annuity scheme could be introduced, it would be better.  I know it is hard to collect annuities in respect of work that is completed.  That would be one of the biggest difficulties the Parliamentary Secretary would be up against. But a charge of £35 per head is too much to impose upon people for work such as I have mentioned.  I am afraid that the people will not avail of those schemes as freely as we should like them to do unless some change is introduced.</P>
      <P>Where an individual or a couple of individuals in any village go out of their way to hold up work which would be of benefit to the local community, the Parliamentary Secretary should immediately seek powers to compel those people to abide by the decision of the majority of their neighbours.  I know of a few very important schemes, including roads over two miles long, which one or two individuals in the centre of the village held up because of some technical point.</P>

I should like power to be taken to get over those difficulties.  Where a number of people are prepared to put their hands in their pockets in respect of a particular scheme, it should not be possible for any individual to hold it up.  That is a disgraceful state of affairs at a time-when we are trying to progress.  Petty grievances should not be brought into play so as to hold up work of local or national importance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardWalsh" hpid="Mr. R. Walsh Mr. R. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to add my voice to that of other Deputies in approval of the rural improvements scheme.  I do that with a little qualification. I found in areas in my county that the working of this scheme had collapsed.  The reason is: in a townland the valuation of which is £100 there may be as many as ten small landholders with a valuation of £10 each. A road may be vital to that area but the amount which would be required to make that road might run into £300 or £400.  To ask these ten small landholders to subscribe 25 per cent. of that amount would be to place a very big burden upon them.  It is a very big demand on a man of £10 valuation to require him to put down £5.  Where the demand is only for £1 or £2, the response will be all right but, once it goes over £2, my experience is that it is difficult to get the scheme adopted. Necessary schemes in my area have collapsed because their cost was so great and the valuation and financial position of the people who would be affected was so poor that 25 per cent. of that cost would be an unfair burden to place upon them.  In a position like that, the Parliamentary Secretary should take power to reduce the contribution below 25 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the minor relief schemes, I find that the area from which I come does not benefit very much from them. Three-fourths of the money coming into County Mayo is spent in other <Col N="589" /> portion of the county owing to their low valuation and dense population. Oftentimes, jobs have been done there two or three times in succession&mdash;small jobs.  I have no suggestion to make as to how that can be got over.  I see the difficulty with which the Parliamentary Secretary is confronted. There may be work with a good labour content to be done in a district in which a large number of people are on the register, and it would be difficult to urge that the money should be spent anywhere else than where these people are living.</P>
    <P>On the whole I agree with what was said about people who hold up work on these schemes, and I have a certain amount of sympathy with the observations of Deputy Dillon about the way to draw the line in that respect. Once you admit the right of a public authority to use private property, or to secure compulsory powers to acquire it, it is very hard to draw the line. Undoubtedly abuses exist at present. In some cases neighbours, for personal reasons, or for spite, deliberately create obstructions.  At the same time, I would be very cautious about going so far as giving compulsory powers to deal with such cases.  Power of that kind should be used cautiously, as very often greater abuses might arise than those it was intended to remove.  As far as I have seen what was done under the rural improvements scheme in County Mayo, it has been most successful in the case of small landholders, and has been an advantage on such farms.  I have seen remarkable instances of the improvements that were made.  That scheme has been an overwhelming success.  In County Mayo I cannot say that there has been what would be called co-operation regarding roads and drainage.  I urge on the Parliamentary Secretary to look into cases where schemes about the drainage of bogs are submitted, and to examine details of the valuation of the applicants, to compare them with the gross amount of expenditure that would be necessary, and to secure an estimate as to the levy on each individual that would be involved. Certainly, if small landholders in County Mayo are expected to put <Col N="590" /> down part of the 25 per cent. of the expenditure involved, and if that amounts to a couple of pounds it will not be done.  I impress the importance of that aspect of the matter on the Parliamentary Secretary.  As regards individual farmers who have taken advantage of the farm improvements scheme and the rural improvements scheme, the success under both headings has been remarkable.</P>

Some Deputies stated that we should be more generous in regard to the latter schemes, that is, in the provision of money for bog development, drainage and the repair of bog roads.  I am not very long at the Board of Works, but understanding as I do this problem as well as most Deputies from rural areas, one of the first things I did was to seek information on the attitude towards bog development schemes of one kind or another, realising as I did their importance from the point of view of private producers, especially in areas in which turf is running out.  Deputy Dillon referred to the position in County Monaghan, which I know fairly well, and what he stated about that county is true of Cavan and of a number of other counties in which the turf supply is on the point of being exhausted. In these places it is vital, in the opinion of people in those areas, that efforts should be made, by the provision of money, to ensure that the <Col N="591" /> fullest possible use should be made of whatever residue of bogs there is in these areas by private producers.  I found that matter was being attended to efficiently and well.  I was interested in the question and it was my first thought to get information as to policy regarding it.  I want to assure the House that that will continue to be the policy of the Office.</P>
      <P>As I am also Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, I may say that his generosity is not to be regarded by his size or his general physique.  He is a very generous man, and I am sure he will not hesitate to make whatever provision is considered necessary for work of this type.  While making that statement, it is only fair to draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Office and the officials responsible for the administration of these schemes have to have some standard to work on.  They have to have regard to the amount of turf available.</P>
      <P>If, say, an application comes from Longford, Cavan, Mayo or Galway, surely it is natural that one of the questions to be asked should be: what is the amount of extra turf likely to be produced by the people making the application.  A second question would be: what would be the cost of the work necessary to drain this bog or make this bog pass.  You must have some standard to go by.  If the extra amount of turf to be produced would not justify the expenditure that would be involved, you cannot go along to drain a bog or make a bog pass simply because some people ask you to do that.  You must have regard to what is in the area, and what is likely to come out of it as a result of the expenditure that you propose to undertake.  Keeping these general reservations in mind, I can assure Deputies that there will be no question of trying to save money in our attempts to make bogs available for development by private individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point mentioned was in relation to minor employment schemes. That question has been threshed out many times in the House.  It is surprising to me that Deputies who have <Col N="592" /> been in the House for a great many years seem to fail to grasp, or refuse to grasp, the whole basis upon which minor employment schemes are selected.  I can say that the money provided in this Vote for minor employment schemes must be expended, and will be allocated, on the basis of the number of people who are in receipt of unemployment assistance in the area in which they live.  There is no use in Deputies saying to me, or to my Office, or in making statements in this House, to the effect that there are people deserving of work who are not on the register, and giving various reasons as to why that is so.  This money is voted by the House to give to people, qualified according to law to receive them, certain sums from the State by way of unemployment assistance.  The money is provided in order to ensure that, over certain periods of the year, they will get a certain amount of employment.  The fact is that these sums are provided by the Government, and voted by the House, for that specific purpose, and for no other.</P>
    <P>The point has been made that a minor employment scheme was undertaken last winter in, say, County Limerick.  The scheme was approved and the sum of £200 sanctioned for a particular work.  That amount was expended, but the job on which it was spent was not completed.  The suggestion has been made by Deputy Ó Briain and other Deputies, not only to-day, but in the past, that this work must and should be completed in the following year.  I agree that it should, provided the unemployed position that justified the making of the grant originally is still the same.  If, however, it is not the same; if, for some reason or other, the position has altered in that particular electoral division, then neither I nor anybody in my place, inside or outside of the House, can give any assurance on that matter.  In fact, it cannot be done.</P>

      <P>The next main point to which a general sort of reference was made had relation to the rural improvement schemes.  When I hear some Deputies agitating in favour, as they say, of the abandonment of the basis on which the minor employment schemes Vote is distributed, I always feel that they are coming along with the thin end of the wedge against the scheme that is based on a local contribution. I think I have enough contacts and enough experience, and that I am sufficiently long in this House, to know the difficulties there are in getting a contribution from farmers, whether large or small.  Deputy R. Walsh talked about the farmers in South Mayo.  I should say that in the main they are small farmers.  Deputy <Col N="594" /> Harris, representing a constituency in which the conditions are entirely different from those in Mayo, also spoke, and made the same sort of protest that Deputy Walsh had made by drawing attention to the difficulties of inducing the beneficiaries to give the required contribution.  I am quite prepared, with the knowledge that I have of these difficulties, to admit that the difficulties are there.  My idea is that we are not helping to overcome them if, in this House or outside of it, we emphasise their existence too much. Deputy Walsh said that it would be a great hardship to ask some of these smallholders to make a contribution of £5.  It may surprise him&mdash;or it may not&mdash;and may surprise other members of the House to learn that we have already secured from farmers whose valuations are round the £10 to £15 mark contributions not of £5 but of £10 and higher.</P>
      <P>What I would like to see, as I said last year on this Vote, is that members on all sides of the House would take an active interest in inducing our people to take advantage of this particular scheme.  Deputy Cafferky said that it is not properly understood by those who could and should benefit under it.  We advertise the scheme in the daily newspapers.  Apart from that, I know of no better means of making the public aware of the scheme and the conditions attached to it than that Deputies in the rural constituencies should meet groups of farmers and discuss it with them.  They should take an interest in the scheme and explain it to the people.  If they find that farmers are not perfectly satisfied that they are going to get value for their money they could advise them to take a chance and see how the scheme works out.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies suggested the advisability of trying to get one of these Rural Improvement Schemes carried out in each parish or electoral division.  I think that is an ideal suggestion.  No people can contribute more towards securing that end than Deputies on all sides of the House.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, <Col N="595" /> to help the publicity campaign, I would be glad if the Parliamentary Secretary would publish the places&mdash;and the names, if possible, of the people&mdash; where he has got contributions of £5 and upwards from small farmers of £10 valuation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>They are aware of it.  I emphasised here last year that there is no one more genuinely interested in this problem than I am myself.  As Deputy MacEoin has pointed out, for years and years I have been contacting the Board of Works, asking them to carry out particular works of public utility, and I was always met&mdash;before I came into the Office of Public Works &mdash;with the same sort of excuse, the same reason and argument, that there was not a sufficient number of unemployment assistance recipients in the area and, therefore, the work, irrespective of its merits, had to be passed over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Parliamentary Secretary has sent out a special form of application to every Deputy with an explanatory note.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is because I represent a constituency in which the number of culs de sac and bog roads is as high in proportion to its area as you would get in any part of the country, that I understand this problem and would like to see this scheme fully developed.  With the co-operation of other people in my constituency, I have endeavoured to get groups of farmers together for the purpose of implementing this scheme. I am glad to say that, once you get them together and get them to understand <Col N="596" /> the position, and once they see one scheme carried out and realise that every man has an interest in seeing that the best value is secured for the money expended, that those who contribute to the scheme are given certain advantages, opportunities and privileges while the work is being carried out, the neighbouring people who have similar works, on which they did not wish to take a chance, immediately become interested, and feel they can now go ahead in perfect safety.</P>
      <P>In giving figures of the number of applications received by the office, I indicated that only a small percentage of those had already been inspected. I want to assure the House now that every effort will be made, during the months that lie ahead, to have estimates prepared in all cases in which we have received applications up to date.  The scheme is largely intended for operation in winter months, but the farmers who make their contribution will be free to do whatever work they might find time to engage upon, and to earn their contributions back. The estimates will be prepared, the amount of contributions that they will be asked to give will be fixed, and the documents lodged with the county surveyor, so that we will be able to go ahead with as many as possible of these works of rural improvement.</P>
      <P>I would like to get out of the minds of Deputies the futility of writing to the office of Public Works with a view to having carried out a minor employment scheme at full cost to the State in an area in which the number of unemployment assistance recipients will not warrant the expenditure of that sum.  If I could do that, we would be making enormous progress in having these schemes taken up.  I know of areas where&mdash;as Deputy Harris has pointed out&mdash;the unemployment figure was much higher than it is now, and where many of those minor employment schemes were thrown in to absorb, even for ten or 12 weeks in the winter months, the people who were in receipt of unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that that had a demoralising <Col N="597" /> effect on the farmers whose boreens and lanes and drains were repaired. They simply said: &ldquo;We had this sort of work done here four or five years ago.&rdquo;  It is time now to get them to accept the new position.  Deputies are only wasting their time and that of the farmers, as well as the time of the Office of Public Works, by writing to request that a particular minor employment scheme be carried out, if they know in advance that there are not, in the electoral division in which it is situated, a sufficient number of people in receipt of unemployment assistance to warrant the giving of the grant.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Dillon who tried to convey to us that he was a very courageous Deputy, in the sense that he was unafraid to say that those single men in receipt of unemployment assistance should not get it at all.  I think there are other Deputies who find it hard to stand up to a group of farmers who are agitating to have a road, a boreen or a bog repaired at full cost to the State.  When farmers challenge them, some Deputies do not like to answer: &ldquo;You cannot get that done, unless you make a contribution your selves.&rdquo;  I think there are some Deputies who do not like to incur displeasure by telling farmers that the work will not be done unless they are prepared to make a contribution.</P>
    <P>We should rid ourselves of that feeling and should tell such groups of farmers, if they come to us: &ldquo;There is a boreen, serving five or six of you; you were responsible for the making of it; and you have been responsible all down the years for repairing it; and if the State is now prepared to contribute £3 for every £1 you put up for its reconditioning, the State must be making a fairly generous offer to you; and the fact that you are prepared to put up £1 for every £3 from the State is indicative of your belief and your faith in the work itself.&rdquo;  We must approach this problem from that point of view.  Whoever is responsible for this Vote next year, I hope there will not be a repetition of the effort to sabotage this scheme, which has been designed to assist in a permanent way to make life more comfortable and <Col N="598" /> more pleasant for those groups of farmers who live in backward areas and who have not the good fortune to have the county roads to their doors.</P>
    <P>The next matter to which I will refer is the taking of powers to ensure that all schemes, whether small drainage schemes or minor employment schemes or rural improvement schemes, will, where it is considered advisable, be carried out.  The suggestion is that powers should be taken by this office to ensure that no farmer will be permitted to hold up a scheme that is thought to be desirable.  I think every one of us has in one way or another given some thought to that problem.  I am prepared to agree with those who have referred to the matter that it is one of the most vexatious things imaginable to find that when people come together and agitate, and the State is prepared to make some provision in response to that agitation, one man, whose holding may be situated at the mouth of a laneway or a boreen, raises an objection and holds up a scheme.  There seems to be a feeling here that that would apply only in relation to minor employment schemes.  Not only does it apply to minor employment schemes, but it can also apply to rural improvement schemes, and while I see no hope that the Government or this office, or indeed any other Department, is likely to take the powers that would be necessary to deal with that position&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Certain points were raised by Deputy Walsh as to the distance you can go&mdash;are you to remove a foot or a yard, are you to have the right to pass through his field, and where are you to draw the line as to the extent of the powers you will take for such a purpose?  Apart from the difficulty of determining how far you should go in the taking of such powers, you have to remember the point to which I have referred&mdash;that if you are making some contribution to some unfortunate neighbour of yours that you are not obliged by law to make, and if that neighbour does not want to take it, the necessity to draft some regulation or to impose some penalty upon him can scarcely be justified.  In this case the State is coming to the rescue of people in need of a proper right of way to their holdings, and it seems to me it would be going very far if, in addition to that, you were to ask the State to compel these people to take something they may not want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was thinking, in so far as the rural improvements schemes are concerned &mdash;and I should like those people who in some cases object to know this&mdash; that supposing you have, as has been cited here, the case of six or seven or ten people using a boreen and they decide to come together and apply for a rural improvements scheme, and the man in the mouth of the boreen, because he is most convenient to the public road, says: &ldquo;I can afford to object to this; the other fellow is away at the back of the hill and let him go to&rdquo;&mdash;some place I will not mention now&mdash;and he refuses to sign, <Col N="600" /> then I think we could, without any question of additional powers, deal with a man like that.  If he did reside at the mouth of the lane we could ignore the portion of the boreen leading to his residence, and, if we could get agreement from those who live alongside the remainder of it, we would be able to overcome the difficulty in that way.</P>
    <P>I will admit it is not a satisfactory solution, but it is as well that people who have a tendency to object to the carrying out of work of that character should know from us that there are many methods by which we can overcome that difficulty.  I do not see any hope&mdash;I do not think there is any chance&mdash;of our taking the type of power that has been recommended to us here.  Deputy MacEoin has mentioned that in some cases of which he is aware a boreen or lane was repaired which accommodated only one man.  I must say I find some difficulty in understanding how that could arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">

What I shall ask the Deputy to do is to give me some particulars of the case, or indeed any other case that he may have in mind, so that we can look it up and see exactly what happened.</P>

      <P>It has been customary to take Votes 9, 10 and 11 together and I suppose there will be no objection to following that procedure.  Vote 9 bears the salaries and expenses of the administrative and technical staffs of the Office of Public Works, which is the office responsible for the administration of Votes 10 and 11.  Vote 10 provides the necessary funds for the erection, maintenance and furnishing of Government offices and other State-owned premises throughout the country, for the erection of major military buildings, for the construction and improvement of national schools, the maintenance of parks and State harbours, for the construction of airports, for arterial drainage and for a number of minor activities.  Vote 11 is only a small vote dealing with the management of Haulbowline in so far as the island remains in civilian control.</P>
      <P>There is an increase in the gross Estimate for Vote 9 of £10,111, due mainly to the necessity of recruiting additional staff and to the payment of additional emergency bonus increases to certain members of the staff.  The net estimate, however, shows a reduction of £6,389 on last year's figure. This is due to the inclusion as an Appropriation-in-Aid of the Vote of the annual amount recoverable as management expenses of the Local Loans Fund.  The amount so recovered was formerly brought to credit as an Exchequer receipt, but, as an accountancy arrangement, it will be treated in future as an Appropriation-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>The additional staff to be recruited are required for work in connection with airports, drainage and other surveys and the compilation of a comprehensive rental of Government properties. They comprise both clerical and technical officers.  Of the officers whose salaries are borne on this Vote, 21 are on loan to other offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Vote 10, the Vote for Public Works and Buildings, at £1,313,905, shows an increase of £308,540 on last year's Estimate.  The main increases occur in sub-head B&mdash;New Works; sub-head C&mdash;Maintenance and Supplies, and in <Col N="602" /> the drainage sub-heads&mdash;J (4), J (5), J (6) and J (7).  Sub-head B is increased by £270,000.  The increase is mainly attributable to the extensive works which it is proposed should be undertaken at the Shannon airport, Rineanna and at Foynes.  The total provision for works at Rineanna and Foynes is £508,000 as against £175,000 in the preceding financial year.</P>
    <P>We are again repeating the figure of £250,000 for grants for building and improving national schools.  Our expenditure on this service last year reached a record figure of £256,000. This was partly due to the fact that a number of large schools in the newly-developed city areas were in hands or in course of completion.  Several large schools will be in course of erection in Dublin and throughout the country in 1944-45 and, though we shall undoubtedly experience difficulties in the matter of supplies, and progress in some cases must inevitably be slow, we are hoping to be able to overcome most of the difficulties and to keep this important service going.  Our programme of new works generally has had to be restricted because of the supply position. Some essential materials are now virtually unprocurable.  The number of token provisions appearing in the detailed Estimate will indicate the extent to which we have been obliged to defer works.</P>
    <P>The new comprehensive Drainage Bill is at present before the House.  No provision is made for expenditure on drainage schemes under the Bill.  After this measure has become law, provision for such expenditure as may likely be incurred during 1944-45 will form the subject of a Supplementary Estimate. Provision is, however, made in the Estimate for the overhaul of our existing drainage machines and for the purchase of new machines and of spare parts, etc., so that machinery and equipment for the execution of drainage works under the Bill may be available.</P>
    <P>The proposals for works in the Fergus drainage district follow on the District of Fergus Drainage Act, 1943, with which the House is, I think, sufficiently conversant.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="603" /> There is a slight increase in the amount provided for maintenance and supplies to meet rising costs of materials and labour.  There is also a slight increase in the rents sub-head necessary to meet additional services. Last year's figure for fuel, light, etc., is being repeated.</P>
    <P>Vote 11, the Vote for Haulbowline Dockyard, is in the usual form.  There is a slight increase on last year's Estimate. There are no features in it on which it is necessary to comment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In presenting this Estimate I should perhaps mention first the important development which has taken place since last year in the administration and organisation of the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  As a result of my experience, <Col N="609" /> since I became responsible for that Department, I was convinced that, if our public health problems were to receive the consideration which modern conditions demand, it was essential that they should receive the whole-time attention of some member of the Administration, and that such member should be vested with the necessary power and authority to take Ministerial decisions in regard to them.  I placed these views before the Government and eventually at my request an Order was made on the 31st March last, under the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act, 1939, delegating to Deputy Dr. Ward, as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, certain of my powers, duties and functions as Minister.  The powers, etc., in question were concerned mainly with the administration of the laws relating to public health, public assistance, national health insurance and the registration of births, deaths and marriages, and were set out in detail in the delegation Order. The first Order having lapsed with the dissolution of the Eleventh Dáil, it is proposed to make a fresh Order on similar lines, and a copy of that Order will be tabled in due course.  Since the making of the original Order, the public health side of my Department has been under the immediate personal supervision&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <i>Notice taken that 20 Deputies were not present; House counted, and 20 Deputies being present,</i>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying that since the making of the original delegation Order the public health side of my Department has been under the immediate personal supervision, direction and guidance of Deputy Dr. Ward, and that position will continue in the future.  A further development has been the appointment of Deputy Erskine Childers as a second Parliamentary Secretary.  I propose, with the consent of the Government, to assign to him the duty of acting as my immediate personal representative in the supervision and direction of certain local government sections of the Department, including the audit <Col N="610" /> section, with the particular duty of following up with the other sections concerned such matters as may arise on auditors' reports.  I am very hopeful that this arrangement will result eventually in a considerable improvement in the standard of our local administration.</P>
      <P>When moving the Vote for the Department for the last financial year I referred at some length to the county management system.  Subsequently I directed a circular letter to be addressed to local authorities embodying a summary of the views I then expressed and also touching upon some aspects of local administration which were raised by Deputies during the debate on the Vote.  Since then I believe that there has been a much better understanding of the position of elected representatives and of their powers and functions, and I am glad to say a much fuller collaboration between elected representatives and the managers.</P>
      <P>In pursuance of the policy of decentralisation of the control of minor offices under local bodies, the Local Government (Minor Officers) Order, 1943, was made.  It came into operation on the 12th January, 1943, and under it the making of appointments to offices listed on the schedule to the Order which were in existence at the date of the Order or were subsequently created with the consent of the Minister is now a matter for county managers.  It was found desirable in the case of a number of the more important of these minor offices to make a general declaration of qualifications under Section 21 of the Local Government Act, 1941.  The offices in question embrace posts of assistance officer, general trained nurse with fever qualifications, midwife, general trained nurse with midwifery qualifications, and nurse rediographer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>General declarations of qualifications were made also in respect of the posts of temporary county surgeons (for holiday duty) and of resident medical officers in county hospitals; so that appointments to the post of resident medical officer may now be made by the manager without reference to the Department provided that the person <Col N="611" /> appointed possesses the qualifications declared by the Minister for the post.</P>
    <P>In connection with the appointment of temporary surgeons it was suggested that local authorities should appoint consultant surgeons who would perform for an inclusive remuneration the duties not only of consultant surgeon but also those of the county surgeon during his period of absence on annual leave.</P>
    <P>Difficulties have been experienced in filling posts of nurse-radiographer due to the inadequate number of persons who are qualified in both nursing and radiography.  Recommendations were made to local authorities in some instances to consider the alternative of appointing as registrar-radiographers officers who would undertake in addition to their radiographical duties the performance of certain clerical duties including correspondence relating to case-history, treatment after discharge and treatment in extern institutions.</P>
    <P>In framing the Estimates for the local services in the present year the local bodies generally have recognised their responsibilities and made satisfactory provision to meet the growing cost of these services.  In the case of Kerry County Council it was necessary for me to postpone the date for the council's estimates meeting until further consideration had been given to the provision to be made for the repair and maintenance of the roads of the county.</P>
    <P>Owing to the fact that over a number of years proper provision had not been made for their maintenance, the Kerry roads had been allowed to deteriorate so seriously that it was necessary to bring in an experienced county surveyor to make an independent investigation and report on their condition.  In considering the amount of the provision to be made, the council had before them the recommendations of the engineer in question. Finally, the council adopted this report and made the necessary increased provision in their rates, so that the maintenance of the Kerry roads, so long neglected, can now proceed on a proper basis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="612" /> A similar situation arose in Roscommon, but, unfortunately, with a less satisfactory outcome.  In that county, the county council decided to provide only a proportion of the amount which the county surveyor recommended for the proper maintenance of the main roads.  Following a formal objection by the manager to the reduction in the estimate, further consideration of the proposal was adjourned to a subsequent meeting of the council.  At that meeting, the council, by a majority of 14 for and 7 against, reduced the estimate by £10,000.</P>
    <P>It is essential, not only for the general service of the community, but in the interests of the public safety and the preservation of the State, that our main roads should be properly maintained.  In every county, this is one of the principal duties of the county council.  To discharge this duty is one of the reasons why the county council exists.  If a council refuses to discharge its obligations to the community or to the State in this or any other regard, there is no justification for its continuance.  In a critical period like the present, this is even truer than in normal times.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, when the county council of Roscommon refused to do its public duty in regard to the main roads for which it was responsible, I directed a public inquiry to be held.  The evidence adduced at that inquiry left no room for doubt that the shortsighted refusal of the county council to provide for the proper maintenance of the main roads of Roscommon would result not only in a very serious deterioration in the condition of these roads, in the first place, but ultimately in a considerable increase in the ratepayers' burden.  In that connection, I think I may refer to the fact that the persistence of the Kerry County Council in a course such as the Roscommon County Council was proposing to embark on, resulted eventually in a serious aggravation of the position from the ratepayers' point of view, for, notwithstanding the special consideration which I extended to the Kerry County Council and the financial assistance I gave it, the rate in the current year had to be increased by no <Col N="613" /> less than 3/8 in the £1 in order to meet the special expenditure occasioned by failure to maintain the Kerry road system properly.</P>
    <P>For the Roscommon County Council, by a majority, to adopt a policy which would have had similar consequences for the Roscommon ratepayers was bad enough, but a study of the evidence in the report of the inquiry gave me, at any rate, a very poor impression of even the business capacity of the members of the council who were responsible for the adoption of this shortsighted policy by the county council. As I have said, they reduced the county surveyor's estimate for main road maintenance by £10,000, and then, with significant ineptitude, they struck a rate in the £ which would have been insufficient to raise even the reduced expenditure of which they had approved. They arrived at this rate by taking credit for an estimated receipt from State grants of 40 per cent., not of the reduced, but of the original estimate.  The fact, of course, is that not only would they not have got a grant of 40 per cent. of their original estimate, but they would not have got a grant at all.  The amount they proposed to provide for main road maintenance would have been insufficient to do any useful work on the roads, and I was not going to throw good money after bad by making a grant in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>Not only, therefore, were the members of the majority group in the Roscommon County Council refusing to discharge one of their main duties, but they would have been responsible for involving the local ratepayers in the loss of Government grants amounting to over £9,000 and workers, farmers, shopkeepers and every other member of the community who would have been involved if the sum of £9,000 were not available to provide employment in Roscommon, in a secondary loss. Clearly, the attitude which had been adopted by the majority in the Roscommon County Council, coupled with its refusal to discharge one of the main duties which the law has imposed on that body, called for action on my part to protect the ratepayers of County Roscommon from the inevitable <Col N="614" /> consequences.  On this ground alone, I should have been justified in dissolving a body which, by a majority, had shown itself not only to be recalcitrant but even incompetent in the management of the council's finances.</P>
    <P>But an even graver issue was raised during the course of the public inquiry which I was compelled to hold and I must advert to it.  Under Articles 60 and 81 of the Emergency Powers Order, 1939, there is a special obligation imposed not only on local authorities but on the Minister for Local Government in regard to the maintenance of public roads. Obviously, the defence of the State and the safety and welfare of the whole community could be gravely prejudiced in an emergency if our main road system were permitted to fall into disrepair.  Accordingly, under the articles I have mentioned, the Minister for Local Government is given special and drastic powers to ensure that local authorities fully discharge their duty in this regard.</P>
    <P>Hoping that, when they embarked on their wrong-headed course of action, the majority of the members of the Roscommon County Council had not adverted to the serious reactions which their conduct might have on our defence problems and on the public safety and the preservation of the State, I directed the inspector who conducted the inquiry to draw the attention of the members of the Roscommon County Council to this important consideration, to refer the members of the council to the provisions of the Emergency Powers Order and to point out to them the very grave view I took of their refusal to provide for the proper maintenance of the main roads of the county.  Notwithstanding all the efforts of the inspector to get the members in question to take a proper patriotic view of their responsibilities as public men and as citizens, they persisted in their stubborn refusal to discharge their responsibilities as road authority, and he had perforce to proceed with the inquiry and, in due course, reported to me.  The inquiry was held on 12th and 13th April last.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="615" /> On 19th May, hoping that in the meantime a wiser and more public-spirited temper would have inspired them, I directed the Secretary of the Department to inform the Roscommon County Council that I had considered the verbatim report of the proceedings of the inquiry and the report of the inspector, and that I was satisfied that the amount provided by the council for main road maintenance was insufficient, a fact which would result in a serious deterioration in the condition of the roads.  The Departmental communication, having pointed out the grave financial and other consequences which this would involve for the ratepayers of Roscommon and the community in general, went on to point out the position of the council under the Emergency Powers Order, and to say that I considered that the expenditure shown in the county manager's estimate was essential for the proper maintenance of the county's main road system in the interests of the public safety and the preservation of the State.  The council, therefore, was asked to meet as soon as possible and to reconsider the position. In this connection, the Secretary to the Department wound up his letter by saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The security of the State and the protection of its citizens must always remain the primary duty of any Government and in fulfilling this duty the Government will expect and must if necessary demand the co-operation of every citizen and every local authority within the State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that statement is unchallengeable, and will not be questioned by any Deputy in this House.  The letter went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister trusts that on reconsideration the county council will realise that it would be a retrograde step to allow the roads to deteriorate, and that any apparent saving at the present time would lead to much heavier expenditure in subsequent years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The county council met on Thursday, May 25th, and, notwithstanding what we had done to arouse the majority of the councillors to a proper appreciation <Col N="616" /> of their obligations to the State and to the community in these critical times, decided to persist in their refusal to provide adequately for the maintenance of their main roads. Accordingly, there was nothing left for me to do, as soon as I became officially aware of the decision which the majority group in the council had taken, but to dissolve the body, which I did on June 2nd.</P>
    <P>I should like to say that, as Minister for Local Government, I can see no justification for keeping in existence any local authority which refuses to discharge the duties imposed on it by statute.  I should say also that in present circumstances I would regard as a very grave matter the refusal of any local authority to provide adequately for the maintenance of its main road system.  Everybody knows that in the last analysis the defence of this country might depend upon the provision of adequate transport and adequate communications, and we cannot allow this question of the upkeep and maintenance of our main roads to become the sport and plaything and pawn in local parish pump politics.  So far as I am concerned, that will not be allowed.  I mentioned the Emergency Powers Order.  I should like to direct the attention of Deputies who are members of local authorities, and who may be inclined to take up the same attitude in regard to this matter of road maintenance as was taken up by the Roscommon County Council, to Articles 69 and 81 of that Order, particularly to Article 81, because that Article gives the Minister for Local Government power to dissolve any county council, without any inquiry whatsoever, which refuses to carry out works which he is satisfied are essential for the public safety and the preservation of the State.  I want to say that, as long as I am Minister for Local Government, if a similar situation should arise again in any other county I am not going to put the ratepayers of that county to the expense of a local inquiry.  I do not think it is necessary, and I am not going to do it.  If any county council refuses to discharge what I regard as its paramount <Col N="617" /> public duty in those circumstances to maintain its roads in a proper condition, then I shall exercise the powers given to me by the Dáil under the Emergency Powers Order, 1939.</P>
    <P>I trust that, having said that and having made my attitude clear, we will have that co-operation with the Department, and particularly with the engineers of the Department, on the part of the local authorities which is necessary if, in those very difficult times, we are going to maintain our roads in the best possible condition we can with the financial and material resources which we have at our disposal.</P>
    <P>In the current year, the provision made by county councils out of their rates for the maintenance of main and county roads approximated to the amount raised in the past year, that is about £1,250,000, to which will be added grants from the Road Fund towards the maintenance of main roads, totalling £250,000.  Of course, this is not the only provision which is made for the maintenance and improvement of roads.  In the past financial year, grants for employment schemes on roads and footpaths were given from the Employment and Emergency Schemes Vote totalling £165,000 odd in urban areas and £207,000 odd in rural areas.  These amounts were supplemented by local contributions amounting to £52,000 odd in urban areas, and £47,000 odd in rural areas.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the general financial position of local bodies has been considerably strengthened by the recovery of arrears of annuities and the consequent repayments from the Guarantee Fund of local taxation grants which had been absorbed in the Fund to meet these arrears.  In March last a further sum of £242,890 was issued in respect of arrears of annuities recovered in 1943.  There was also a further improvement in the collection of revenue by county councils during the last financial year.  The percentage of the rate collected at 31st March last was 89.1 per cent. as compared with 86.8 per cent. at 31st March, 1943.  The proportion collected <Col N="618" /> varied from 98.5 per cent in County Louth to 82.1 per cent in County Cork. In seven counties more than 95 per cent. of the warrants was collected within the year.</P>
    <P>I trust that this improving trend will continue during the current year, and that there will be no county in which the rate collection will fall short of that which has been attained in County Louth.  In present circumstances I can see very little justification for any person who withholds his rates from the local authorities in any county in Ireland.  The money is very urgently required to provide for the upkeep of the local services, and where people wilfully withhold payment of the rates or over-hold them they are doing it at the expense of their neighbours.  I trust that, throughout the country, we shall have a widespread recognition of the fact that any man who is in a position to pay his rates, even at considerable hardship to himself, and who refuses to meet his obligations in that regard is deserving of no public sympathy whatsoever.</P>
    <P>Coming to the public health side of the Department, it is customary to refer to the vital statistics for the preceding year.  Taking first the number of births in 1943, it is noteworthy that the number reached almost the level of the previous year.  The year 1942, as the House will remember, was remarkable for a very large increase in births, the number being 9,337 over the year 1941.  In 1943 the number was 65,702, or only 415 below the number for 1942. The number of marriages in 1943 was 17,350, or 120 less than in the previous year, but, as in the case of births, the year 1942 created a record for the greatest number of marriages registered in the country since 1878.  At that time the marriage rate was 4.5 per thousand, as against the present rate of 5.9 per thousand, so that with a relatively smaller population now the present marriage rate is appreciably higher.  I should say that the statistics for 1943 are as yet only provisional. They have not yet been fully tabulated.  That applies particularly to the mortality statistics, where comparison of the various causes of deaths in 1943 as compared with those in 1942 <Col N="619" /> is not yet possible.  The number of deaths registered in 1943 was 43,426. That rate, of course, is naturally affected by many causes; consequently, it fluctuates within fairly wide limits. For instance, as recently as 1937 the rate of 15.3 per thousand of the population was recorded.  For 1943 the unrevised rate is 14.7 per thousand of the population.</P>
    <P>Taking the year 1942 as a basis, we can say that one-third of the deaths in the country, approximately 15,000, are attributable to diseases of the heart and to senility.  The number of deaths from tuberculosis, in the year 1942, showed a very high advance on the preceding years.  In the last year's Vote I referred to investigations which had been made to try to ascertain the causes of the increase.  No conclusive results could be drawn.  Since then, everything possible is being done to extend facilities for treatment and to provide extra nourishment for sufferers from the disease who are undergoing treatment in their homes, and also to provide proper segregation of such patients from other members of their household.</P>
    <P>Two other diseases which have a very serious effect on our vital statistics are enteritis and diphtheria.  Both have exacted a high death toll among children in the past two years. Enteritis in a most virulent form has been confined mainly to the Dublin area, but diphtheria has been more widespread.  In last year's Estimate I referred to a conference of medical experts which had been summoned by Dr. Ward to consider the problem of diarrhoea and enteritis in Dublin City. The investigations subsequently undertaken were carried out under the auspices of the Medical Research Council.  In the course of the inquiries, which were carefully conducted, evidence was obtained which indicated that there had been a sharp decline in the amount of breast-feeding of infants in Dublin since 1938.  In the case of breast-fed babies the incidence of diarrhoea and enteritis was found to be low in comparison with those artificially fed.  The committee of <Col N="620" /> medical experts, having considered the report of the investigations, recommended that every practical means should be employed to stimulate the breast-feeding of infants, the provision of additional nourishment for nursing mothers through dining centres of the voluntary organisations, and the early medical treatment of infants affected with the disease, and attention is being given to the possibility of doing these things.</P>
    <P>As regards the principal infectious diseases, namely, typhus, typhoid, scarlet fever, diphtheria, and puerperal sepsis, there was an increase in the aggregate incidence in 1943 as compared with 1942.  The total number of cases rose from 6,166 in 1942 to 7,349 in 1943, while the aggregate number of deaths rose from 381 to 414.  This was entirely due to an increase in morbidity and mortality from diphtheria.</P>
    <P>In 1943, the total number of cases of diphtheria was 4,585, or 1,732 more than in 1942, while the number of deaths rose by 42 to 309.  The proportionate increase of cases in the rural areas was much greater than in the county boroughs and urban districts, being 77 per cent., as against 50 and 45 per cent. respectively, in the last mentioned areas.  The case mortality in 1943, however, showed a substantial fall, being only 6.7 per cent. in 1943, as compared with 9.4 per cent. in 1942, and 11.4 per cent. in 1941.</P>
    <P>Last year I referred to a severe outbreak of acute anterior poliomyelitis, generally known as infantile paralysis. The total number of cases notified during the year 1942 was 361, and the number of deaths was 75.  The position for a time seemed extremely grave, but it is gratifying now to be able to state that there was a considerable decline in the disease in the year 1943. The total number of cases reported was 126.  The number of deaths attributed to the disease is not yet available.  In the first quarter of 1944, only four cases were reported.</P>
    <P>Early in the present year, my Department convened a conference of medical superintendent and county medical officers of health.  In opening the conference, Dr. Ward, Parliamentary Secretary, referred to some of the <Col N="621" /> practical problems connected with public health administration, such as the recent outbreak of diarrhoea and enteritis in Dublin, to which I have already referred, the increased incidence of diphtheria and tuberculosis throughout the country, the spread of typhoid by typhoid carriers, and the effect on the health of the community at large of high extraction flour.  In connection with the last-mentioned matter, Dr. Ward suggested that the disturbance of the calcium balance might be a substantial factor in the increase of tuberculosis, and he mentioned that Professor Dillon, of University College, Dublin, who is a recognised authority on calcium in connection with tuberculosis, had been good enough to undertake further investigations. During the conference, which lasted two days, there were two very important papers read and discussed: one by Dr. J.C. Saunders, Medical Superintendent Officer of Health, Cork, on &ldquo;Health Education and Propaganda&rdquo;, and the other by Dr. M. F. Daly, County Medical Officer of Health, Wexford, on &ldquo;The Prevention and Control of Infectious Disease, with special reference to diphtheria, typhoid and typhus.&rdquo;  The subsequent discussions by the members of the conference were valuable, and the conference as a whole was most fruitful.  It was the general wish of the members of the conference that conferences should be held from time to time, and it is accordingly proposed to hold another conference on medical matters next year.</P>
    <P>I now come to building and other constructional works.  The pace has slowed up considerably, but when allowance is made for the difficulties which are met with in securing essential materials, the extent of work carried out by local bodies during the past year is remarkable.  The actual number of houses completed in the year was 1,686.  In Dublin City 911 houses are at present under construction, and plans are being completed for approximately 800 further dwellings.  In addition, there is in progress a scheme for reconditioning and converting existing tenement houses into self-contained flats.  In many respects the accommodation <Col N="622" /> is equal to that provided in new flats.  The experiment, which was begun last year in Gardiner Street, is being extended to other areas.  Up to the present, 78 separate dwellings have been provided in this manner.  Work is at present in progress on 46 houses, and the reconditioning of 56 further dwellings has been decided upon. Reconstruction work of this nature is slow and difficult, as alternative accommodation has to be arranged for the families who are temporarily dispossessed. The problem is being handled as satisfactorily as possible by the corporation, to whom great credit is due for this work and for continuing house building at the rate at which it has been carried on during these difficult years, is due.  In Cork, there are 90 houses in course of construction, and 12 in Waterford.  In Limerick, a scheme of 336 houses has recently been completed.</P>
    <P>Since April, 1943, local authorities have been engaged in carrying out a survey of housing conditions in their respective districts with a view to getting an up-to-date estimate of future needs.  Up to the present about 20 rural areas and 60 urban areas have been surveyed and, on the basis of the returns furnished, it is estimated that about 29,000 houses will be required outside Dublin County Borough, and if the estimate of the Dublin Corporation of 21,000 new dwellings is reckoned, then about 53,000 are required to provide proper housing accommodation through the whole country.  The problem, it will be seen, is a large one, and it is therefore all the more necessary to decide upon a definite rate of construction which will ensure its solution within a reasonable time.</P>
    <P>The surveys which have been made and the steps which are being taken will harmonise with the arrangement recently made by the Government to ensure the execution on a planned basis of all building activities when the emergency is over and until normal conditions are restored.  The planning and co-ordinating of all constructional activities will be undertaken with due regard to the importance of the various <Col N="623" /> projects and to the extent of personnel and materials available.  It will be the duty of the Department of Local Government and Public Health to obtain, as far as is reasonably possible, priority for housing schemes for, say, a period of five years.  In view of the extent of the housing problem in Dublin it is considered that a five-year programme should provide for at least 11,000 new houses.  This is somewhat higher, I grant, than the rate of building contemplated by the Corporation of Dublin but an average of 2,200 houses a year would approximate to the number of houses which were completed by the corporation in the financial year ended 31st March, 1938, namely, 2,336.  The estimate is based on the assumption that adequate building materials will be available in the first year of the programme and that supplies will become, and remain, regular for the remainder of the five-year period.</P>
    <P>As a measure of the rate of progress which may be expected when building is resumed, it may be of interest to set out the progress made by local authorities in the construction of houses from 1933 to 1939, that is, in the years immediately following the increased State aid provided under the (Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932.  For the financial year 1933-34 the number of dwellings provided was 3,743; in 1934-35 the number was 6,803; in 1935-36, 6,246; in 1936-37, 6,094; in 1937-38, 4,890; in 1938-39, 6,931; and in 1939-40, 5,383.  The total number provided in the seven years was 40,090, of which 23,564 were erected in urban areas and 16,526 in rural areas.  It is doubtful if a similar rate of progress can be achieved immediately after the emergency when materials may not be in full supply but, on the other hand, there will be the advantage of having at our disposal fully developed sources of production of native materials which were started subsequent to 1932.  I refer particularly to the cement and cement products industries.  These should afford ample supplies provided coal is obtainable.  Other products which are largely used for house building <Col N="624" /> have also been developed to a considerable extent, such as tiles and slates for roofing, ranges, grates, rainwater goods, etc., but in the case of some of these products their manufacture is dependent upon the import of raw materials.</P>
    <P>Before leaving housing, I should mention that the housing surveys which have been made indicate in many cases that there is a large number of houses which could be reconditioned and brought up to a proper standard of fitness at an economic price.  In the conditions which have prevailed in past years, local bodies have been somewhat reluctant to avail of their powers to acquire houses that are in process of decay to be made fit for habitation.  Grants were provided for this purpose under the Housing and Labourers Act, 1937, but they have been availed of only to a very small extent.  The steps which have been taken by the Dublin Corporation show what can be achieved by reconditioning existing houses when taken over by the local authority, and it is proposed to press upon local authorities to give this aspect of the housing problem much closer attention. It is, perhaps, in this direction during this period of limited production that greatest progress can be made.</P>
    <P>Where housing surveys have been completed the local authorities have been advised to select suitable building sites and to arrange for their acquisition so that when conditions permit an uninterrupted building programme can be carried out until the housing needs of their districts have been fully satisfied.  Where sites have already been acquired local bodies are being encouraged to develop them in advance of building development.</P>
    <P>The planning of schemes to be undertaken after the war also includes water supply schemes and sewerage works.  The difficulties encountered in carrying out these works have been even greater than in house building. Nevertheless, work is at present in progress on 19 schemes, the aggregate cost of which will be £220,000, while 40 further schemes estimated to cost approximately £2,000,000 have been planned.  The position was eased somewhat <Col N="625" /> towards the end of the last year by the import of a limited quantity of asbestos cement pipes for water supplies, together with the necessary cast-iron and rubber joint material.  The continuance, however, of the import of such supplies is very uncertain, while plant such as pumps, mechanical filters, etc., is practically unobtainable.</P>
    <P>The provision of further hospitals has been under examination in connection with the formulation of a five-year programme of public works.  It must be emphasised, however, that the extension of hospitalisation in the post-emergency period will be influenced largely by the ability of the Hospitals Trust Fund to finance the erection of new hospitals.  The present position in that respect is very uncertain as the present capital of the fund is almost entirely earmarked for endowment of the voluntary hospitals whose annual deficits still continue to be in the neighbourhood of £200,000. It will be absolutely impossible to proceed with the provision of all the hospital accommodation which has been envisaged and where the needs are most pressing it will be necessary that projects should get absolute priority. The prospect has somewhat improved in the past year by the increased revenue derived by the fund from the proceeds of sweepstakes.  In 1943 the receipts from sweepstakes amounted to £61,497 while in respect of the two sweepstakes held in the present year the fund benefited to the extent of £60,944.  For that result we are indebted to Hospitals Trust Limited and I would like to express appreciation of their successful effort in continuing to raise further funds for the benefit of the hospitals.</P>
    <P>The planning of future road schemes has also been engaging close attention. Special works are being prepared to provide additional employment in the event of any considerable extension of unemployment taking place and there is also what I may call long-term planning of works to secure that the road system will develop according to approved or modern standards.</P>
    <P>The Department has envisaged the gradual establishment under a com prehensive plan of modern highways <Col N="626" /> capable of carrying the denser and faster motor traffic that is expected to develop after the emergency.  This will involve the widening, realignment and resurfacing, where necessary, of the existing arterial roads, the construction of diversions and so on.  To this end the Department has prepared a plan providing for the classification of all public roads into four classes and has laid down standards of lay-out construction appropriate to each class.</P>
    <P>Class 1 roads would be of the dual carriageway type, having two 24 ft. carriageways, a 14 ft. central strip and two 14 ft. verges flanked by cycle tracks and footpaths on each side. Class 2 roads would have a 24 ft. carriageway, two 14 ft. verges and two cycle tracks and footpaths; class 3 roads, a 20 ft. carriageway, two verges 10 to 12 ft. wide, and one cycle track and footpaths; and class 4 roads, an 18 ft. carriageway and two 6 ft. verges.</P>
    <P>The aim is to secure that the land and rights of way required for the ultimate development of a road to a standard suitable for the traffic conditions which may be expected to develop over, say, the next 50 years, will become known as soon as surveyors have carried out the necessary surveys.  The powers conferred by the Town and Regional Planning Acts can be availed of to safeguard the prospective needs of the road authority. The immediate task of the survey authorities will be to produce road plans in accordance with the standards laid down and which have been communicated to them.  When these plans are in existence, the rate of progress in making the new roads will depend on many factors, such as finance, material, machinery and labour.  Practical difficulties may prevent anything approaching the construction, mile by mile, of a continuous newly-defined road but, even then, the standards will secure that any isolated works which can be readily carried out will form sections which will integrate harmoniously with the whole road when it is ultimately completed.</P>
    <P>The Estimate makes provision on the same basis as the previous year for the supply of fuel for necessitous families. <Col N="627" /> A sum of £170,000 is also included in the Estimate for the making of grants to public assistance authorities for the provision of assistance in kind to certain recipients of home assistance.  The grant is being administered on the same basis as last year.  A new grant has been introduced in the present year, namely, a sum of £230,000, towards the provision of supplemental allowances to certain old age pensioners, to certain blind pensioners and their dependent children, and to certain recipients of disablement benefit under the National Health Insurance Acts and their dependent children. The scheme took effect from the 1st April last.  The public assistance authority will be recouped out of the grant to the extent of 75 per cent. of the expenditure incurred.  In many cases the necessity for supplementary allowances by the public assistance authority should not exist because of the general economic circumstances of the household to which the pensioner or the person in receipt of disablement benefit belongs.  The allowances are to be made on a weekly basis and are not to exceed the following rates:&mdash;Old age pensioners, 2/6 a week; blind pensioners, 2/6 a week; dependent children of blind pensioners, 1/6 a week; recipients of disablement benefit, 2/6 a week; and dependent children of recipients of disablement benefit, 1/6 a week.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary to go into any detail as regards the other grants in the Estimate except the provision made for the treatment of tuberculosis.  As I have already said, every means at our disposal is being used to deal with this problem.  A great handicap in fighting the disease is the present shortage of institutional accommodation.  The full measure of improvements to which I adverted last year have not yet been achieved, as the difficulties in carrying out constructional works have greatly increased, and some further time is likely to elapse before the position can be fully remedied.  Recently, St. Mary's Preventorium, Ballyroan, Rathfarnham, was opened under the auspices of the Anti-Tuberculosis Section of the Red Cross.</P>

      <Col N="630" /> The allowances which may be made are 3½ pints of milk, 1/2 lb. of butter and seven eggs per patient per week.  The allowances in every case are to be regarded as additional to any quantities to which persons are entitled under any State rationing scheme.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the circular issued on the 31st March, 1943, the expenditure on bed and bedding for the purposes of admission to recoupment from the national tuberculosis grant was limited to £4 in any one case, but this figure has recently been revised and the present limitation is £10 in any one case.</P>
    <P>There is one other item in the Estimate to which I will refer and that is the sum of £98,000 for construction and maintenance of roads and drains in connection with bogs acquired by county councils.  The turf production schemes of county councils are the most important contributors to the national pool under the control of Fuel Importers, Ltd., to meet the domestic requirements of the non-turf areas. Since the inception of these schemes in 1941, the councils have produced approximately 1,500,000 tons of turf of which about 1,250,000 tons have been sold up to the 30th April last.  These amounts do not include production in the present year under county council schemes.</P>
    <P>The counties which are producing the largest quantities of turf for the non-turf areas are Galway, Mayo, Roscommon, Clare, Kerry, Laoighis, Offaly, Westmeath, Longford and Donegal.  Between them, these counties supply about six-sevenths of the total quantities sent by county councils to Fuel Importers, Ltd.  Other counties supplying Fuel Importers, Ltd., are Clare, Cork, Meath, Sligo, Tipperary North and Westmeath.  The remainder of the counties may be regarded as producing for their own institutional requirements with, in some cases, surpluses for other purchasers.</P>
    <P>It had been estimated that a total county council production of about 425,000 tons this year would, after supplying the local institutions, meet the requirements for domestic purposes of Fuel Importers, Ltd., in the non-turf areas and leave a balance for sale locally.  On present reckonings, there <Col N="631" /> seems to be little doubt that this quantity would be available but, with the further curtailment of coal supplies for industrial purposes, the fuel position has become very grave and every effort must be made in the next few weeks to raise turf production to a still higher level.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I may remind the House that the Minister for Industry and Commerce indicated during the week that it would be necessary for us to find an additional 200,000 tons of turf for industrial purposes.  That is a quantity which did not enter into our reckoning when we were preparing our estimates and arranging our plan of campaign for the current season. That is an amount which must be produced over and above the amount for which we were budgeting during the present turf campaign.  It represents an approximate increase of 50 per cent. on the figure of 425,000 tons which I have mentioned.  It is essential that every effort should be made by every worker engaged in turf production to reach that figure.  If we do not reach it, there may be some danger that our existing turf ration in urban areas, meagre as it is, will have to be reduced or, alternatively, that there will be a considerable increase in unemployment. The very existence, not to say the comfort and convenience, of a large number of people depends, therefore, on our getting the fullest possible output of turf from every bog in the country during the few weeks of the turf-cutting season that remain.  I, myself, have made personal representations to all the principal officers engaged in this campaign and the Taoiseach has personally written to them impressing upon them the importance of leaving nothing undone to secure the fullest possible output of turf in all our bogs in the few weeks that remain.  I know that those engaged in producing turf will regard their task as one of the utmost importance to the nation and I am certain that they will give 100 per cent. of their capacity to ensure that the additional 200,000 tons of turf which we require for industrial purposes will be forthcoming.</P>

      <P>I think that the treatment of T.B. cases could be speeded up.  I admit that the Minister and his Department have done a great deal of very valuable work.  However, I am not satisfied that ample use is being made of the Hospitals Trust Fund.  I think that more use could be made of it and, as the disease is so infectious and so dangerous, every effort should be made to have early treatment provided for suspected cases, especially as it is not now possible for patients to go to Switzerland or other such places.  It is essential that all the treatment which science has approved as suitable for those patients should be made available to them at the earliest possible moment.  I urge that the Minister should allow no obstacle to be placed in his way in proceeding with the work.  I am sure that the House would be only too glad to give him all the facilities and help he would require in order to achieve that object.</P>
      <P>I listened with pleasure to the Minister's plans for road development. All I shall say is that we must wait and see.  What the Minister has said will not happen right away.  It would be brought about in patches.  It is important that our highways should reach a certain standard.  Since the emergency, deterioration has set in in a large number of counties.  No matter what anybody may say, I think that it is important that the roads should be maintained, because, if they are allowed to get into disrepair, the expenditure will be all the greater at a later stage and we should be penny wise and pound foolish.  I think that I am correct in saying that the allowances to the blind and old age pensioners and under the national health insurance scheme are confined to the urban areas.</P>

      <P>I am glad that they are payable in the rural areas <Col N="633" /> because the cost of living has increased so much that it was very hard for those people to carry on on the amount allowed.  On the question of turf production, in so far as the Minister is responsible for the activities of the county surveyors, I should like him to urge upon them and the other people responsible that, where land is acquired under some order by a county council, compensation should be quickly paid.  There is great difference in the value of the land and bogs which are acquired.  In some districts, it is only high bog, which is not suitable for grazing, which is acquired. In other districts, as in Longford, very valuable grazing land has been taken over&mdash;what is known as clover turf, which was excellent grazing and feeding land.  It is now utilised as a spread-bank for the drying and winning of the turf and it is left in a very bad and unsightly condition.  I regret to say that county council workers are not as careful of the land as they should be.  If an ordinary citizen causes waste, he can be adequately dealt with.  I think the Minister should give a general direction to county surveyors that they must not cause waste, especially where the land before cutting was suitable for grazing and meadowing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know at least five farms that were entered on by the county council much against their owners' wishes.  I admit that there was excellent turf on them, and that the county council was right to go in to get it, but, having acquired this turbary under compulsory powers, I think the compensation that was offered for the damage done was totally inadequate.  It is all very fine to talk about asking the people to make sacrifices and to play their part in this, that and the other.  The position, however, is that neither the county council worker nor the lorry driver will work unless they are adequately paid, and neither will the railway company carry the turf unless it gets ample compensation.  Why, therefore, should the farmer be the only one to lose on turf development?  I put it to the Minister that very grave losses are being sustained by farmers whose lands have been entered upon.  I admit, <Col N="634" /> of course, that owing to the different types of land entered upon it would be hard to make a hard and fast regulation.  In cases where the land is of the clover kind, land of good grazing quality, it must be admitted that its value is far in excess of the land from which turf is ordinarily got.  My submission is that farmers should not be asked to bear all the loss. In some cases there is a good deal of hurried excavation.  It seems to be the plan to cut out all the turf you can, and to leave the bottom in a dangerous condition.  I hold that the cut-away part should be properly levelled and not left in a dangerous condition, full of holes, for cattle and horses.  Since the consumer in the City of Dublin has to pay 64/- per ton for turf, why should not the farmer be adequately compensated for the loss that he has sustained?  I do not want to delay the House further, but I do put it to the Minister that the State should see to it that no wrong is done to farmers who are supplying this particular need.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few matters which concern my constituency which I want to refer to.  On this Estimate we have, so to speak, the Minister in the dock, and this is an opportunity that we have for voicing complaints from our areas.  So far as hospital accommodation is concerned, I do not think that any county has as much cause for complaint as Galway.  I would like to know from the Minister, is there any hope of anything being done to improve the situation there? I hate repeating what I said on this when the Estimate was before the House last year.  But in Galway the position as regards hospital accommodation is becoming worse every day. Since I spoke on the Estimate last year, I was a patient in the hospital myself for some time.  In my opinion it is a disgrace to civilisation to see the conditions under which the patients have to try to exist and the doctors and nurses to do their work. It is something terrible.  I do not think anything like it exists in any other county.  You have from 50 to 60 patients herded in wards which have <Col N="635" /> accommodation only for 25 or 30 beds. You have patients on the floor and nurses lying over them trying to take their temperature and attend to them in other ways.  The doctors when examining a patient have to shove another patient under a bed.  Is there any hope that anything will be done to remedy that position in Galway hospital?</P>
      <P>The position as regards T.B. is also very bad.  I suppose that what applies to Galway applies also to other counties so far as this matter is concerned. I have had scores of letters from patients in the hospital suffering from T.B., asking if there is any hope that they will be transferred to the sanatorium we have at Woodlands or to some other sanatorium.  The county medical officer of health in Galway tells me that there are no beds available. Those patients are in the Central Hospital in Galway amongst other patients.  Deputies know how that tends to spread the disease.  Some of them eventually go home and the disease is spread amongst their brothers and sisters.  That is what is helping to spread the disease in many areas so far as Galway is concerned. I am sure that Deputy Beegan and the other representatives of the county will agree with me that Galway, above any other county, needs looking after in that respect.  Something should be done to relieve the position there.  As it is it is a scandal.  At the present time it may not be possible to do much but I do hope that the Minister will soon be able to do something to relieve the situation in Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter which interests the County Galway very much&mdash;I imagine the same applies all over the country&mdash;and that is the condition of the roads.  There has been so much said about this that I fear it is useless referring to it again.  I am afraid the Minister does not intend to do anything.  In the County Galway the roads are tarred in such a way that it is dangerous for horses to travel on them.  I have spoken about this to our county surveyor who is an excellent man.  Deputies on the Government <Col N="636" /> Benches and myself have asked him again and again to do something.  He tells us that he is doing his best, but then the matter is shoved on to the shoulders of somebody else.  At the meetings of the county council, the members ask those of us who are members of the Dáil why we do not do something about it with the Minister. I am putting it to the Minister now he should do something, that at least there should be a strip provided on the sides of the roads so that horses can travel in safety.  The case made against that is that it is not possible to do it, that it would injure the roads.  Deputies, I am sure, realise that so far as transport is concerned, we are getting back to the position when we have almost as much horse traffic on the roads as we had in the old days.  The roads, however, appear to be made suitable for the use of everybody except the ratepayers who have to bear the cost of their upkeep.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin raised an important point about the cutting of turf.  People in my county have to complain about that, too.  I know of cases in my county where lea land and, to a certain extent, good grazing land, was taken over because there was a certain amount of turf underneath.  The land has been stripped and the turf is being cut.  The amount of compensation paid to the owners of the land, on the estimate of the engineers, is some small thing like 3d. per ton.  I think that is wholly unfair to the people concerned, not that I want to make the point that the land should not be used for getting turf out of it.  No man will try to say that that is what I mean, but I do say that it is wholly unfair to a man who has produced a certain quantity of turf, with his four sons, as private producer, that the council in the area should come in on his bog and use it, with the result that his sons are now working for the council.</P>
    <P>As a member of the Galway County Council, I would say that the private producers and the workers for the private producers produce more turf and work harder than those who are working for the county councils or for any combine of that sort.  At the <Col N="637" /> least, the private producer should not be prohibited from working and the council should not be unfair where the private producer says that he himself is going to cut certain banks of turf. That is one complaint that there is in Galway.  Again, where good grazing land is taken over, the 3d. a ton compensation given is not by any means adequate.  It is not fair to the individual concerned.  There are also complaints about rights of way and people travelling over the land.  It may be strange that I could make that complaint myself, not that I wish to make it a personal matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, as it is a question of county council employees travelling over a man's land, and at the end of the year the council gives him something like £1 compensation. That is definitely a matter for the Minister, though I do not want to make any personal complaint.  The Minister rules the county council in matters like that and when we go to the county council they tell us to go to the Minister.  When we come here, we meet the Minister and it is then we must try to put these cases before him, so I hope that he will give his attention to the points I have raised.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEoin made reference to those who come into the bogs to get turf and do not care about anything else.  So long as they get a year's turf, they do not mind if they leave a big hole in the bog, which fills up with water.  Men who have land adjoining find that their stock ramble in and eventually fall into those holes and are drowned.  The county council say they are not responsible, so I hope the Minister will see that no bog-holes are left to fill with water and be a danger to stock.</P>

      <P>There are two Votes in this House&mdash;those for Lands and Local Government&mdash;which usually evoke speeches from various sides of the House.  I do not wish to deal with the incidence of tuberculosis, nor do I wish to talk about the turf question. <Col N="638" /> I will leave those matters to those who are more conversant with them. I wish to deal briefly with the question of housing, as the Minister has stressed it in his opening speech.  Has he in his plans considered the question of raw materials for future building schemes, particularly in our large cities and towns?  We, in Cork, are faced with a tremendous difficulty.  We have in existence a plan for housing, but there arises the question of the raw materials.  The Minister must be aware of the scarcity of cement, timber and other commodities necessary for building.  We are very concerned about those plans which the Minister may have in the archives of his Department.</P>
      <P>We do not expect wonders from the Government, as it is only a human institution, like all other institutions, and is faced with the same kind of difficulties; but we expect something in the nature of information that, by negotiation with cross-Channel firms or otherwise, any materials that are required will be made available as soon as possible.  Under the Cork Corporation, we have a committee dealing with the position in connection with post-war problems, as they will affect our own situation.  We want to be able to dovetail any schemes we have into the great national plan and I am anxious, therefore, to have some information from the Minister when he is replying.  I do not expect a lot of detail, but I would like to have his assurance that the matter is having the serious consideration of his Department.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to deal with the incidence of tuberculosis, as I suppose 50 or 60 per cent. of the speakers during this debate will do so.  The gentleman's agreement in regard to the time limit for speeches should be observed on this Estimate.  Most of the money we are dealing with has been already spent and we are dealing with what might be called last year's Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one point to which I would like the Minister to give consideration. I raised it here many years ago and intend to keep hammering at it until <Col N="639" /> something is done.  I refer to the old age pensions.  The means test which is imposed discourages decent employers throughout the country from granting even small allowances to those who have been in their employment over a long period of years. Every member of this House is aware that there is a limit fixed, 16/-, as a means test; and if any person, male or female, who has attained the age of 70, has been a prudent and good citizen and has made some little preparation for the rainy day, perhaps by paying something like 1/8 or 1/10 per week to secure superannuation of 15/- or 16/- per week at 70, that person will not receive a State pension of 10/- a week.  That fact cannot be denied.</P>
    <P>The prudent and provident citizen who is the back-bone of the State and prepares for the rainy day by way of a weekly subscription to a trade union, <Col N="640" /> a provident society or some other undertaking, thus ensures for himself or herself on attaining the age of 70&mdash; or sometimes after 40 years' payment &mdash;a superannuation of 15/- a week. Now, on that account, they will not get 1/- in old age pension, although they may have contributed all their lives in taxation, local and national. Let me contrast with that the position of one who has been a nuisance to the local community, who has been a charge on the rates, perhaps a national charge, brought up in the police courts for robbery and other crimes.  When that person attains the age of 70, he or she gets a full State pension of 10/- a week.</P>
    <P>I move to report progress.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; the Committee to sit again on Tuesday, 20th June.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Tuesday, 20th June, 1944.</P>
