      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he is now in a position to state whether the Allied Governments have made representations to this country concerning the possibility of &ldquo;war criminals&rdquo; attempting to seek refuge here; and, if so, what was the nature of the replies given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (The Taoiseach)</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain representations were made and a reply was sent.  I am not at present in a position to give further information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach tell the House why he is not in a position to reply to the question of a Deputy on a matter like this?  Surely a question such as this would merit a simple reply, yes or no.  Could the Taoiseach not answer me on that point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should remember that the question of publicity is not a matter for our Government exclusively.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach say who is to decide who are &ldquo;war criminals&rdquo;?  Is it Deputy Dockrell, or Deputy Dillon, or who is it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the unsatisfactory nature of these replies and the importance of this matter, both from an internal and external point of view, I beg the permission of the Chair <Col N="760" /> to raise this matter on the adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only say, if this matter is raised to-night, that I am not in a position at present to give further information.  I cannot give it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach be good enough to say whether the correspondence in connection with this matter is still in progress or has it been finally disposed of?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot even say that.  I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there are &ldquo;war criminals&rdquo; in this House, Sir.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach say when he will be in a position to reply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot.  These matters of public relations are matters of very grave importance and not matters to be bandied about in the market place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not the market place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree. I do not wish to be unreasonable, but five and a half weeks have elapsed since I first asked the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I suggest that Dáil Eireann can scarcely be appropriately described by the Taoiseach of this State as the market place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I say definitely that it is not right that question of this sort, matters which are sometimes of extreme delicacy, should be discussed. There is a special organ set up by this Parliament to do that, and reasonable time ought to be given to have these things done, and if the Minister responsible gives a reply, telling the Dáil that he is not at the present time in a position to give further information, that ought, for the present, to be sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach consider, when question of this kind which are arousing a certain amount of public interest are raised, when <Col N="761" /> individual Deputies feel it necessary to ask questions and he feels it proper in the public interest either to withhold or to delay information, approaching the leaders of the various Parties and explaining the matter to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have already tried to get the Deputy in question to hold his hand until the appropriate time.  He has not thought well of doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the difficulties in which individual Deputies find themselves with regard to particular matters and in view of the difficulties in which he may feel himself placed by the questions of individual Deputies, will the Taoiseach consider, when difficulties of this kind are likely to arise, discussing those difficulties with the leaders of the various Parties &mdash;I do not ask that he should discuss the complete details &mdash; so that the public may understand that the matter is being responsibly and suitably dealt with?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>So long as there is a Government here, it must be assumed that it is being responsibly dealt with. If we are going to put the Government into commission, that is quite a different matter.  The Government has a very responsible work to do and must get reasonable opportunities for doing it properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the statement made by the Taoiseach, I should like to say that it is five and a half weeks since I first asked this question.  On that occasion, the Taoiseach asked me to be good enough to wait for a week or two.  I waited for over two weeks and asked the question again.  The Tánaiste again asked me to wait and I waited three weeks.  I do not know what the Taoiseach knows in this matter, but I do not think five and a half weeks is an unreasonable time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy remember that there is a world war on and that there are matters which other countries have to attend to apart from questions of this sort?  We do not want to be unduly pestering and asking <Col N="762" /> for replies, etc.  There are sometimes occasions on which it is proper in the national interest, in the State interest, to await a reply when a response has been sent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would Deputy Dockrell tell the House who or what he means by &ldquo;war criminals&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Taoiseach if he appreciates that I intervene in this matter entirely for the purpose of helping him and of safeguarding him against difficulties.  I ask if, when he considers that he has been put in difficult position by any individual Deputy, he will consider the position of the whole of us and have such conversations as he may deem reasonable with the various leaders, so that he may be helped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be prepared to consider that on suitable occasions, but I do not regard myself as being put in any extreme difficulty by the Deputy's question.  We are put here in a responsible position to carry on the external relations of this State and anybody who has the slightest knowledge will know that sometimes a reasonable period of time has to elapse when a question which is not of immediate urgency arises.  This matter has not become, apparently, immediately urgent at all yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Government should consider the Black and Tans, sent here by the British, as war criminals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he will state the reasons why the Government took steps to cancel the reading of a paper by Doctor Jan Masaryk, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Czecho-Slovakia, to the customary private meeting of the Irish Institute for International Affairs on Friday, 3rd November, 1944.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister <Col N="763" /> for External Affairs if he will state whether Dr. Jan Masaryk, Deputy Premier and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Czecho-Slovakia, was by Government intervention prevented from addressing a private meeting of the Irish Institute for International Affairs on Friday, 3rd November, at the Shelbourne Hotel; and, if so, the reason and authority for such intervention; and if he will further state if any and, if so, how many, Press announcements on this matter were censored and suppressed; and the reason for attempting to prevent the publication of this news item.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take questions 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>It is an obvious and well-recognised principle that when a Minister of the Government of one State is invited to address a group of citizens within the territory of another, the Government of the latter State should be informed beforehand and afforded an opportunity of expressing its assent.  The principle applies even in time of peace, not merely as a matter of courtesy, but for the good reason that it makes for the avoidance of possible domestic incidents in which a Minister of another country would naturally wish not to be involved and which might conceivably embarrass the external relations of the State.  In time of war, there are obviously still stronger reasons for the principle being adhered to with scrupulous care.  It could never be said that the delivery of a lecture by a Minister of one State to a group of citizens in the territory of another is so much a matter of indifference to those responsible for the conduct of the foreign relations of the latter State as to make it immaterial whether they are informed or consulted.  It is a question for the Government of the country concerned, acting on behalf of the Parliament and people, to say whether it is wise that such a lecture should be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case referred to in these questions, no notice or request was received from the group of citizens that issued the invitation.  They were a group which could scarcely have been ignorant <Col N="764" /> of the correct procedure, but they proposed to ignore the Government. The position was explained to the Czech Consul, to whom it was officially intimated that, in the circumstances, the Government did not wish the lecture to be given.  The Consul understood the position and took the appropriate action.</P>
    <P>Three Press notices, apparently supplied by the group in question, were received by the Censor from the <i>Irish Times</i> newspaper for insertion in its issues of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th November.  They were deleted by the Censor, because they contained halftruths and other matter calculated to create misunderstanding between this country and a friendly State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it as definite that no prior information was received from Dr. Masaryk himself of his intention to give such a lecture before he arrived here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The point was that the question of Dr. Masaryk's coming to this country was understood and it was known that he was to speak on a certain occasion.  A group which issued another invitation to him took no steps whatever to inform the Government, and it was quite clear from their subsequent action that they wished deliberately to ignore the Government and, to the extent to which they were doing it, actually they  the Government of their own country before foreign countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Taoiseach understood my question. The question I put was whether Dr. Masaryk himself intimated his intention to speak to this group before he arrived in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand that the main exception taken is that the meeting was arranged without the Government's permission being asked?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy McGilligan has given notice to the <Col N="765" /> effect that, with your permission, sir, he would raise this question on the Adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be glad that the country should know a little bit more about the conduct of this group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister for External Affairs if he would wish to avail of this occasion to confirm or dissipate a rumour to the effect that he requested Dr. Masaryk when speaking at Trinity College to abandon his original manuscript and substitute some other matter for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the question for the sake of putting an end to rumour which may have no foundation in fact, and which it would be desirable for the Minister for External Affairs to put an end to forthwith, if it is groundless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact was that Dr. Masaryk, being a man of experience, knew what would be proper in a case like this.  When coming into a neutral State as the representative of a belligerent State, he knew what would be proper, and did not go beyond the bounds of what would be proper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he is aware that the British War Office when notifying relatives of citizens of Eire who are killed in the British armed forces refer to their having died in the defence of their country, and if he will make representations to the British authorities on this point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears strange that the Taoiseach is not aware of the fact that on each occasion a communication is sent to the next-of-kin of persons killed in the present war stating that they have been killed in the service of their country.  If such a case is brought to the Taoiseach's notice, will he promise to make representations with a view to ceasing this practice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not deal with a hypothetical question.  If the Deputy has a copy of any such communication and gives it to me, I will know at least what the terms are.  If they are as suggested by the Deputy, and that State action had to be taken, quite a different line would have to be followed from that suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he will state the reasons for the delay in announcing that the Irish Minister to France has been withdrawn from the former Vichy Government and accredited to the Government of General de Gaulle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no undue delay.  Communications with our Minister to France were interrupted for some weeks before and after Marshal Pétain's Government had ceased to function.  Moreover, it was impossible for the Minister, owing to transport difficulties, to effect the final retransfer of the Legation to Paris until the 27th October.  It was obviously more appropriate to make the announcement at the time of his arrival and resumption of duties there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the <Col N="767" /> Taoiseach will appreciate that the notice as it appeared in the Press did seem to indicate that the transfer had been completed in August, but the Press notice was not issued until October.  It would, therefore, appear that the citizens of this State had been left in the dark if the transfer had been completed on the date given in the Press notice issued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take questions Nos. 9 and 10 together.</P>
      <P>It is not correct that there is an acute shortage of men's boots.  Since January last the boot factories have been subject to control to ensure that reasonable quantities of essential types of footwear including heavy boots for men are produced.  Returns received from the factories indicate that production of the heavier type of men's footwear, to which priority has been given, has been increased to a higher total than in normal times, although supplies are below the demand which has been increased by reason of the shortage of industrial rubber boots.  I have no evidence to suggest that available supplies of heavy footwear are not distributed equitably by manufacturers and wholesalers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to inform the Deputy that, owing to recent measures taken by the Minister for Supplies to get more of this particular type of <Col N="770" /> boot turned out, the quarterly output now is almost double what it was in 1942-43 and, although it is admitted that the supply is not quite equal to the demand, the position should improve in a very short time.</P>

      <P>These instructions provide that a manufacturer must supply to each customer a quota based on that customer's purchases in the year 1940, and that this quota must bear the same relation to the customer's purchases in 1940 as the manufacturer's present production bears to his production in that year.  It is also provided that a manufacturer who has an interest in a retail shop which opened for business subsequent to 31st September, 1940, may not give any supplies whatever to that shop and that, if a manufacturer has an interest in a retail shop which opened before that date, he must supply it on exactly the same basis as that on which he supplies his other customers.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether, in view of the recent statement of the chairman of Irish Shipping, Limited, that it will be necessary to maintain an Irish Mercantile Marine after the war, he will consider entering into discussions <Col N="778" /> with the Government of Northern Ireland with the object of having ships built for Éire in the Belfast shipyards, thus aiding in the provision of employment for Northern Irish workers after the war, and thereby promoting the development of a spirit of goodwill and economic relations between the two parts of Ireland.</P>

      <P>My attention has been drawn to the matters to which the Deputy refers.  The provision of waiting room and shelter accommodation is a matter for the company, but I am informed that arrangements for a central bus depôt are in contemplation. Owing to the supply difficulty a temporary expedient does not appear to be practicable, but inconvenience is minimised in so far as possible in inclement weather by bringing longdistance buses to the terminus an hour before the time of departure.</P>

    <P>There is in existence a joint industrial council for the tanning industry, the principal function of which is to promote harmony in the industry, and the matter in dispute was discussed at two meetings of that body which were held in May and June last, but without result.  The chairman and secretary of this body are officers of my Department. Subsequently, two conciliation conferences, presided over by officers of the Department, were held on the 22nd July and the 2nd October, but the parties failed to agree.  I am not <Col N="780" /> vested with any power of compulsion in this matter but, as the parties are aware, I am willing, at any time, to summon a further conference if requested by either side.

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether representations were made to him regarding the desirability of amending the Conditions of Employment Act so as to bring within its <Col N="781" /> scope caretakers, lamplighters and watchmen employed by the Dublin Corporation; whether having regard to the conditions under which men in these categories are employed and the unwillingness of the corporation, in the absence of mandatory legislation, to adjust their claims, he is prepared to amend the Act so as to limit their hours of work and deal with their employment on Sunday, or, alternatively, whether he contemplates introducing new legislation relating to employment of the character referred to; and whether any such proposed legislation will be introduced at an early date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received no representations of the nature referred to in the question since the passing of the Conditions of Employment Act, 1944, which amended the principal Act.  The Deputy will recollect that the position of these workers was discussed when that Act was before the Dáil and I expressed the view that it would not be appropriate to bring caretakers, lamplighters and watchmen within the scope of an Act which regulates the conditions for industrial employment. The case of these workers, however, has been noted for consideration in connection with any future legislation which may be introduced to regulate the conditions of employment of workers not coming within the scope of existing Acts.  I am not at present in a position to indicate even approximately when such legislation may be introduced.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state what committees have been set up in relation in any way to his Department for the purpose of making recommendations or helping in post-emergency development work intended to increase production and employment; the date the committees were set up; the names and qualifications of their members, and the dates and matters on which any reports or recommendations have been received; and whether and when it is intended to publish these reports or recommendations, and if it is not intended to publish them, the reason for not doing so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The terms of the Deputy's question are so general that it is difficult to frame a precise and comprehensive reply. For instance, when he asks what committees have been set up in relation in any way to my Department for the purpose of making recommendations or helping in post-emergency development work, the question at once arises as to precisely what type of body he intends to designate by the use of the word &ldquo;committee&rdquo; in this connection. Would it, for instance, cover such a body as that which conducted an inquiry into Dublin housing or exclude it?  Would it include the close liaison arrangements which exist between the <Col N="783" /> turf section of my Department and the corresponding section of the Department of Supplies and the Turf Development Board, the officers of which are in such close contact that they might be described as a committee?  There is a very close liaison, and arrangements for permanent consultation and discussion exist between the officers in the special employment schemes office and in the roads and public health sections of my Department.  These discussions relate to grants for works which have as one of their objectives an increase in production by providing better road facilities for the agricultural population and to provide employment. Would it cover these?  A further example is the body which consists of representatives of the special employment schemes office, representatives of my Department and representatives of the Department of Industry and Commerce, which has been considering problems arising out of the present methods of relieving unemployment.</P>
      <P>In connection with our new road programme, there have been consultations between my Department and the individual officers in charge of the county engineering services, and conferences of the county engineers, as a body, have been organised at which the problems arising out of our road development programme have been discussed with the appropriate officers of my Department.  Of course the primary purpose of the new road programme is, by providing better transport facilities, to secure an increase in production and thereby a permanent increase in general employment.  The mere execution of the road programme itself will provide a considerable amount of employment. In this case, it might be said that there were not one, but several committees which might be covered by the Deputy's question.</P>
      <P>The second point of difficulty in dealing with the question arises from the fact that the Deputy wants me to name bodies, committees or commissions, or whatever they may be,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;set up in relation in any way to my Department for the purpose of making recommendations or helping <Col N="784" /> in post-emergency development work&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>To answer this difficulty we have immediately to put to ourselves the question as to whether the Deputy would put any practical limit to this extremely far-reaching range of relationships.</P>
    <P>I mention these matters to show the difficulty of traversing in an oral reply the whole subject matter of the Deputy's question.  To try to do so would involve an undue trespass upon the period allocated for Question Time.  I may, however, refer the Deputy to the information which has been so frequently given to the Dáil by the Taoiseach as to the activities of the economic sub-committee of the Cabinet, and the new branch which has been set up in the Department of Industry and Commerce for the co-ordination of constructional schemes, etc.  The statements made by the Taoiseach on these matters give all the information which might reasonably be required.</P>

      <P>The law gives full discretion to public assistance authorities in granting assistance to persons in necessitous circumstances.  As regard assistance through the National Health Insurance Society, there is no provision in the National Health Insurance Acts for payments to dependents of insured persons except in cases where a sick member is an inmate of an institution (such as a sanatorium).

I would be glad if he would make inquiries from the board of assistance and their officers, as to what allowance they give to a mother and her four children while her husband is in hospital with tuberculosis and, if he finds that it is inadequate &mdash; which it is, totally inadequate, it being a miserable allowance of 14/- or 15/- a week to keep four children and the mother &mdash; will he see that a definite and fixed allowance will be made, so that they will not have to go cap in hand, as it were, to appeal to the officers to see that they get fair treatment?

      <P>It was my intention originally not to publish the interim reports piecemeal but to await the completion of the committee's inquiries.

      <P>I think so, because there was a very slight carry-over at the end of recent months.  In fact, the complaint was made that the carry-over was too small.  In other words, there was a temptation on the part of factories to sell bacon too green.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that one of the aims of the Pigs and Bacon Commission was to secure uniformity in the prices payable to producers for pigs.  The Act was designed to deal with normal conditions in the pig and bacon industries, but conditions in these industries have not been normal for a considerable time past.  In order to cope with the situation created by the emergency, it became necessary to suspend the provisions of the Act relating to appointed prices and to substitute minimum, instead of fixed, prices for pigs.  Under this arrangement there are bound to be variations in prices in different parts of the State consequent on the position with regard to local supply and demand, but a discrepancy as wide as that mentioned by the Deputy would, if it occurred at all, necessarily be of short duration.</P>

If references to living persons are made which are deemed to give rise to reasonable objection the offending matter can be suitably dealt with.  I do not consider it necessary to issue an injunction forbidding authors to introduce living politicians into their works.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the question it is true that in a certain book published under An Gúm there is a passage containing an aspiration of the kind mentioned.  This passage must, I suggest, be taken in relation to the time and the circumstances to which it refers, i.e., those of over 25 years ago when the character in the story was a political prisoner in the hands of the British.  The reference must, therefore, be regarded as being of purely an historical nature and as having no bearing on the circumstances of the present time.</P>

      <P>My attention has been drawn to the statement referred to in the question.  Since then, however, the justice, both publicly and in a letter to the Department, has stated that his intention was not to criticise Government policy but merely to point out, as a relevant factor in determining the penalty to be imposed in the case before him, that the policy of increasing tillage makes it necessary for farmers to have an adequate supply of suitable fertiliser.</P>
      <P>The only action which is open to me in the case of complaints about such statements is to ask the Advisory Committee under Section 49 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1936, to deal with the matter as one of misconduct or misbehaviour in office.

There is no committee set up or sitting at present charged with the making of recommendations in regard to the post-emergency development of the work of my Department, and if the Deputy will remember that my Department consists of the Land Commission, the Forestry Division and the Gaeltacht Services Division, I hope he will agree with my own view that special investigation of the kind suggested is unnecessary.

      <P>Certainly.  I do not know if Deputies had an opportunity of looking up the Bunreacht since yesterday, but, if they had, they would notice that Article 33 deals with the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  Sub-section (2) says &mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Comptroller and Auditor-General shall be appointed by the President on the nomination of Dáil Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Sub-section (5) (1) says: &mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Comptroller and Auditor-General shall not be removed from office except for stated misbehaviour or incapacity, and then only upon resolutions passed by Dáil Éireann and by Seanad Eireann calling for his removal.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Sub-section (6) says: &mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subject to the foregoing, the terms and conditions of the office of <Col N="813" /> the Comptroller and Auditor-General shall be determined by law.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Article 35 is the article which deals with the courts and with the appointment of judges.  Sub-section (2) says: &mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;All judges shall be independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and subject only to this Constitution and the law.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Sub-section (4) (1) says: &mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A judge of the Supreme Court or the High Court shall not be removed from office except for stated misbehaviour or incapacity, and then only upon resolutions passed by Dáil Eireann and by Seanad Eireann calling for his removal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is exactly similar to the sub-section which deals with a similar matter in relation to the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  Sub-section (5) says: &mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The remuneration of a judge shall not be reduced during his continuance in office.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That sub-section, or anything similar to it, is not contained in the article of the Bunreacht, which deals with the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  In the two cases, except for that difference, the tenure of office is the same.  The salary and pension are subject to statute law.  They are not constitutional matters, and can, therefore, be altered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, since the Minister draws me.  To secure a proper status for this officer, we would require a constitutional amendment.  It did occur to me that we might provide this officer of State with an independence of the Executive which would be effective by legislation, but I have since reflected on the matter and have realised that the sovereign rule of every Parliament constituted as ours is is that anything we can enact we can repeal, and therefore you cannot give security by an Act of this Oireachtas to an officer of State as against the Executive.  The only means of doing it is a constitutional amendment which it is not in the power of a Government majority in the House to make. We have given that security to the judges and I believe that if the attention of the House had been directed to that question when we were dealing with the Comptroller and Auditor-General, they would have given similar protection to him.  I invite the Tánaiste to direct the attention of the Taoiseach and of the Government to that matter, because I do not think the Minister for Finance underestimates the importance of the functions of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  So long as things are proceeding along lines of average normality, his duties are more or less routine.  But a situation might arise in which he would be the only channel through which Dáil Éireann would receive notice of grave matters of which the Dáil should take seisin at the earliest possible opportunity and, if the Executive of that day were reluctant to allow the Dáil to get knowledge of these matters, the precedent set up would enable an unscrupulous Executive to bring very heavy pressure to bear upon the Comptroller and Auditor-General to take the Executive's views and to refrain from demurring to some particular activity that they contemplated in his annual report.  Therefore, I believe that, if we are to have a Comptroller and Auditor-General, we should have an effective one and that he should be a person untouchable by the <Col N="815" /> Executive in his emoluments or in his position, in strong analogy with the High Court judge.</P>

A sub-section to this Bill would do it, declaring that the Comptroller and Auditor-General is to be known hereafter as the Comptroller and Auditor-General in accordance with his description in the Bunreacht, where it appears with a hyphen, and thereafter there is a regular procedure for any draftsman referring to that officer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is astonishing to me that the Minister should come before the House and seek to do what this Bill does unless he desires to provide an occasion when the whole of the Oireachtas would adopt this measure as a sort of unanimously agreed gesture of gratitude to the society for the purpose of expressing formally some clear national intention.  I think it is most unbecoming for the Government to march in here and pass a Bill declaring that the President of Ireland shall, by virtue of his office, be President of the Irish Red Cross Society without the Minister's saying that he comes here more or less as the President's messenger to indicate that, having been consulted in this matter, the President has signified his readiness to conform to this proposal and will be glad to accept the office, if it is put upon him.  Can anybody here imagine a statute being introduced into the House of Representatives in Washington purporting to dispose of the President's person without the most careful precautions being taken to indicate clearly that the President of the United States of America desired this thing to be done and would appreciate it if it were done?  Can anyone imagine a Minister of the Crown in Great Britain coming into the House of Commons and proposing in a Bill that the Parliament would dispose of the King's person and make him President of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals? Surely the President of this State is a person who is entitled to as much respect from the Legislature as that of the King in Great Britain or of the President of the United States of America?  That is one ground upon which I deprecate the flat-footed procedure adopted in connection with this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other is, whether it is desirable that, by statute of this Parliament, we <Col N="817" /> should make the President of Eire the president of the Irish Red Cross.  It seems to me very much more desirable that the Red Cross, being a continuing body, should be afforded an opportunity, on the election of each new president, to apply to the President of Eire for his patronage or presidency, so that there would be a renewal of that on the occasion of the election of a new president, on which occasion there would be a kind of public declaration that the administration of the society was of such a high standard that it justified the President in accepting their invitation to become patron.  But observe what we are in danger of.  Under the present administration of the Red Cross, there can be no question of any conceivable impropriety.  We are fortunate in having a body operating the funds and the business of the society which commands the confidence of everyone. But we all know from painful experience over the years that irregularity may very often creep into an organisation of this kind and there may be a scandal and grave matters may have to be attended to and put right.  Would it be desirable in such a situation that the President of Eire should have been by statute made the president of that society?  Would it not be right that every five or six years, when the question arose as to whether the President was prepared to renew his patronage of the society, the Taoiseach's Department or some other suitable Department of State would intervene to satisfy themselves that the society was properly conducted and everything being done as it should be done before the patronage of the President was renewed?</P>
    <P>The more I reflect on the procedure proposed here, the more distasteful it appears to me to be.  First, I think it is disrespectful to the person of the President, and, secondly, I think it is inexpedient from the point of view of the Irish Red Cross Society.  I venture to say that had the Minister taken the elementary precaution of going to the Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the Labour Party and the Leader of Clann na Talmhan to find out what they thought of the proposal <Col N="818" /> a very much better device might have been worked out to achieve a similar purpose to that which, apparently, the Minister is at present trying to serve. I would ask the Minister to drop the Bill altogether and see if some more suitable procedure might be adopted to bring the President and the Society into close relations.</P>
    <P>In the course of the coming year I think there will be an election of the President of Eire.  Possibly the present occupant of that high office will be a candidate and there may be others.  That would be a very suitable occasion, after the election is concluded and the new occupant of the office is declared; for him to make his gesture to the society.  It is really the poorest compliment to the members of the society to say that the President has to be foisted on the society by law and that the society has to be foisted on the President by law, the presumption being that neither would touch the other with a 40-foot pole if we did not make them.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether Deputy Dillon really wants me to reply to his general remarks.  The fact of the matter is that the President, five or six years ago, very kindly consented to allow the Government to nominate him as president of the Irish Red Cross Society.  The Deputy yesterday was as disrespectful as he could be to the office of President in the future. The Government, on this occasion, in respect of the present occupant, took all proper steps in relation to this matter before coming to the Dáil.  The Government, in proposing that for the future the President of the country should automatically become the president of the Irish Red Cross Society, are depriving themselves of certain powers that they had to date; that is, of nominating the president of the Red Cross Society.  It was felt that it would be better, instead of the Government nominating the president on every occasion on which the presidency of the Irish Red Cross Society falls vacant, to follow the procedure here, a procedure that is followed in practically every country, and that is that the head of the State should be the <Col N="819" /> head of the Red Cross Society of the country concerned.</P>

      <P>As a matter of fact, if the Deputy wants to go into the whole thing, the Geneva Convention requires that there should be set up in a legal manner in each country an approved society and all such matters as organisation have to be dealt with by law. In 1938 we introduced a Red Cross Act setting up, in a formal manner, a Red Cross organisation here and, following that, statutory rules and orders were made by the Government and laid before both Houses for their approval or otherwise, setting out in detail the manner in which the organisation would be set up and officered. You have a similar position here to what exists in most other countries, where the head of the State is the head of the Red Cross Society and where he appoints the president or the chairman of the society who carries out the active functions of running the organisation.</P>

      <P>The Minister says the Government took all the proper steps preparatory to introducing this measure.  One of my objections yesterday was that the Government had not taken any steps that I would consider proper.  The Minister indicates that when the President was last made the President of the Red Cross Society he was approached and asked would he undertake the position and that he graciously accepted it.  But the Minister <Col N="820" /> is now introducing legislation that will attach a position to the President that he did not otherwise occupy, and new occupants of the presidency will not be able to say, graciously or otherwise, whether they accept the position. I think that when legislation is being introduced that changes the position in law of the President in relation to any particular body in the country, the Presidency ought to be recognised by the Government for what it is &mdash; that it is completely and absolutely a nonParty position and that before making any change in regard to the occupancy and before legislation is introduced the heads of the other Parties in the Oireachtas ought to be consulted.</P>
      <P>I expressed myself yesterday as opposed to the measure.  I did not divide the House on it.  I do not wish to divide the House on a matter that concerns the Presidency.  I felt that a division on this measure would serve no useful purpose, and I did not wish to offer that particular type of opposition to the Bill.  I still consider the Bill is wrong, that it should not be introduced in the way in which it has been introduced; but however it is introduced, I believe it is wrong.</P>

      <P>In reply to one point raised by Deputy Mulcahy, I may say that the present President will be the President of the Irish Red Cross Society until his term of office ends. The next President will know, when accepting nomination for office, that in addition to all the other functions which the President is either entitled to carry out or must carry out according to the law and the Constitution, he will have this function of being President of the Red Cross Society and of nominating the chairman of the society.  As to the manner of introducing this Bill into the Dáil, I do not know why Deputy Mulcahy wants to get into a huddle with the Government, the Labour Party and the Farmers' Party over everything.  It is quite a natural thing when the Dáil is set up, for Deputies to discuss matters of public concern of all kinds and debate a business such as this in the open.  there is nothing disrespectful being done to the President, and there is nothing disrespectful to the Dáil in asking it to change the law so <Col N="821" /> that instead of the Government having the power of appointing the President of the Society from time to time that the people, when they are appointing the President of the country, should also give him as one of his functions the position of President of the Irish Red Cross Society.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The group of amendments with which we are now dealing refer to the power to take compulsorily trust funds that have been provided for the maintenance of embankments. We are opposed to that, on the grounds that those trust funds have been specially provided for maintenance purposes, and the intention behind this piece of legislation is that improvements, drainage works and embankment works generally were to be a national charge.  The country got that impression and promise, and Dáil Eireann has agreed that that is the proper procedure, if we are to carry out national drainage effectively in the future.  We think it is unfair to local authorities that substantial trust funds created for some counties should be swept into the Exchequer by the Minister <Col N="822" /> for Finance.  We are here empowering him to do that, and the maintenance charge will be thrown back on the ratepayers in that particular county, and it will be a substantial charge in some areas.</P>
      <P>Where you have capital provision of that nature made over a period of years, and a regular yearly income accruing for maintenance purposes, it is bad financial policy, taking the long view, to destroy capital sums of that sort, and it is an injustice to the ratepayers in the counties concerned.  The problem is concentrated in a few counties, where the maintenance charges are substantial.  If we destroy the capital sums, we will let the Land Commission out of a very awkward situation.  The Parliamentary Secretary should appreciate that it has been a problem in the Land Commission for a number of years.  Not merely are we letting them out, but we are going to sweep away all the funds which were accumulating from one source or another over a period of years. When estates were acquired under the different Land Acts in the past, and where maintenance of certain works was the responsibility of the landlords in the past, that responsibility was carried on through trust funds, which were the responsibility of the Land Commission.  Now, it is proposed under this Bill that the drainage authority will take over the responsibility for maintenance and pass on the financial responsibility to the local authority.  That is a most unjust provision, so far as the general ratepayer in a particular county is concerned. If it were general throughout the whole country, it would be a different matter, as it may be argued that they would get substantial benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that certain counties will benefit substantially, but certain other counties &mdash; Waterford, Limerick, and Wexford, counties on the seaboard, where water from inland counties is being discharged, are really corridors from counties situated further inland, which get rid of surplus water by discharging it through those counties near the sea, where the problem arises.  I represent some inland counties and it <Col N="823" /> is not my problem at all, but I would point out to the Parliamentary Secretary, firstly, that it is going to put a substantial charge on the few particular counties concerned.  If the present maintenance capital sums were preserved for maintenance purposes, it would be fairer to the ratepayers situated in those counties.  Secondly, it is bad financial policy to rake in substantial capital sums that are very useful and which have been provided very conveniently, by the vision and foresight of people who went before us, to ensure that an annual income would accrue for work of this sort.  I would like also that the Parliamentary Secretary should inform the House as to the aggregate capital sum that is involved, so far as the Land Commission is concerned, and the yearly income that accrues from the capital sums.</P>

      <P>In very many cases, the money in these trust funds has been retained out of the purchase price of estates, so it could be argued that it really belongs to the original owners of those estates.  In any event, this money was set aside for the maintenance of these embankments.  If my recollection serves me aright, the income from those funds was not nearly adequate to maintain the majority of those embankments in any reasonable state of efficiency.  It is now proposed to hand that money over to the Treasury and deflect it from the purpose for which it was originally intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand this discrimination in respect of embankments.  In the preceding sections of this Bill, it is provided that the funds belonging to trustees and drainage boards are to be handed over to the county councils, to enable them to carry on the maintenance work; but, in this case of embankments, a different procedure altogether is to be followed.  It is proposed that the money that was set aside specifically for the maintenance of these embankments is to be handed over to the Treasury.  The Parliamentary Secretary is to collect whatever the expenses of carrying out the maintenance work will be from the county councils.  Why has the Parliamentary Secretary chosen to adopt this procedure <Col N="824" /> in regard to embankments and quite a different procedure in regard to drainage boards and drainage trustees? Morally, in my opinion at all events, this money should be handed over to the county councils, and should not be diverted from the purpose for which it was originally intended.  The money, as I have said, is really the property of the original owners of the estates.  I hold that the Parliamentary Secretary is acting wrongly and setting a bad precedent by making provision for the handing over of this trust money to the Exchequer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the most extraordinary provisions that we find in this Bill.  Deputy Roddy has referred to the moral property in this money.  He could have gone further and said that it is the legal property of the owners of the estates.  This House will be committing a breach of trust by diverting this money from the purpose for which it was intended.  It was specifically vested in trust for maintenance work.  If this section is passed in its present form will not this House be acting <i>ultra vires</i>?  I hope that some county council will have the courage to test the matter, assuming that the Bill goes through in its present form.  Undoubtedly, this money belongs to the original owner. It was his property.  He left it in trust for the specific purpose of maintaining the embankments that were erected to drain the estate of which he was the owner.  Neither this House nor anybody else has the right to interfere with that trust.  This money was deducted from the purchase money at the time of the sale of the estate for the maintenance of these works in order to relieve local ratepayers of the burden which that maintenance work would put on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night the Parliamentary Secretary told us that the Government were taking all responsibility for the construction of these works.  Of course a Government can do whatever it likes. It can take over whatever responsibility it likes, but there is one thing it cannot do, and that is interfere with trusts.  That is wrong in law.  The Government has neither a legal nor a moral right to this money.  It belonged <Col N="825" /> to the original owners, and was set aside for the purpose of maintenance. The creation of these trusts was a just and natural one.  The Land Commission have retained huge sums of money from landlords when buying out their estates.  Is that money going to be paid back to the landlords?  During the time of the land agitation it used to be said that to shoot a landlord was a popular thing, but, of course, murder is always murder.  We are putting up £7,000,000 in connection with this Bill, but while we are doing that we should not rob anybody.  The amount of money held by the Land Commission for the purpose of maintaining these embankments was deducted from the price paid to the landlords for their land.  I must say that the proposal in the Bill is a startling one.  My opinion is that to enact anything of this kind would be <i>ultra vires</i>, and a breach of trust even though done by this House. This House has no prerogative to do wrong any more than a private individual has.  I know that in recent years it has been quite a development to do these things.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider the matter.  If this House has the right to commit a breach of trust it certainly has not the right to confiscate money that belongs to other people &mdash; money which was specifically set aside for the maintenance of these embankments, and in order to relieve the local ratepayers.</P>

      <P>I also hold in connection with the money held by these trustee bodies that at the time of the passing of the Land Acts the money was set aside by the landlord for the maintenance of embankments.  Deputy McMenamin says it should be handed back to the landlord.  I hold that if anybody should get the money held by these trustee bodies it is the county councils since they will have the responsibility for this maintenance work.  The money should be transferred to their credit.  Recently, I raised a question about a sum of £1,700 or £1,800 which was held by a trustee body on the estate of the Duke of Devonshire.  I have not yet been told by the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="826" /> whether the local county council will be responsible for the maintenance of embankments hitherto maintained by the Land Commission.  Will they come automatically within the scope of this Bill?</P>

      <P>I desire to support the series of amendments dealing with these funds which were set aside for a specific purpose.  The Government did not originally provide them.  Therefore, I hold that they should not be diverted from the purpose for which they were originally created, namely, the maintenance of embankments.  I think eventually it ought to be used for that purpose.  The Parliamentary Secretary argued yesterday that the State will take over the function of maintaining particular embankments in future, at a large cost, but as far as I can see in the Bill the county councils will eventually have to provide for the maintenance of the rivers and the embankments as well.  It will eventually fall on the local rates, and any provision that was made for the maintenance of these embankments should go to the bodies that will be responsible for them.  I am not a lawyer and I do not know what the legal right would be, but I think that is the moral right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be that in some cases where trust funds had been provided for embankments, as a result of the operation of this Bill expenditure of such funds will no longer be required for the particular embankments.  Take, for instance, a tidal river where it has been very essential that embankments should be maintained and where, in years to come, as a result of the drainage of a particular river, maintenance of the embankments is no longer essential.  I can envisage certain rivers where that would happen as a result of a big drainage scheme.  It might happen, however, <Col N="827" /> that as a result of the drainage of that particular river, an increased burden of maintenance would be incurred in connection with a lower river.  That would happen in particular areas, such as Wexford, as a result of the drainage of the Upper Barrow.  It might happen in the Lee area or as a result of the drainage of the Shannon or the Blackwater.  A tremendous flow of water might be let down on to the lower reaches as a result of the drainage of certain levels.  The cost of maintaining embankments on the lower reaches would be increased.</P>
    <P>I see no reason why the amendments should not be accepted by the Parliamentary Secretary or why there should be this mean attitude of encroaching on these small sums.  I do not know how much they amount to, but the smaller they are, the less reason there is to encroach on them.  The Parliamentary Secretary suggested that we made a fuss about very small sums. The smaller they are the less reason there is for encroaching on them.  The smaller they are the less use they would be to the Exchequer.  The Parliamentary Secretary also referred yesterday to the fact that the State was providing drainage for the country. We are all grateful for it.  Every Deputy appreciates the attempt that is being made to drain the country properly, once and for all, and everybody here is desirous of helping the Parliamentary Secretary in that laudable work.  The Government are providing these millions of money and probably, eventually, will have to provide more millions.  It will be money well spent.  It will be expenditure that will redound to the credit of the country and pay one hundred fold in improving the country generally.  It will be money that probably will save the State in respect of certain relief schemes because no work will provide more work per unit of money spent than drainage.  It is idle to cavil about such small sums as are referred to in the amendments.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 100 deals with the setting up of an embankments maintenance fund.  There is no reason why <Col N="828" /> such a fund should not be set up so that it would help in extraordinary cases to meet difficulty.  Deputy Broderick referred yesterday to the possibility of serious happenings in Youghal owing to the condition of embankments there, and he could see no way, and the Parliamentary Secretary did not see any way, of providing for these contingencies.  Deputy Allen referred to the case of New Ross where the drainage of the upper reaches of the Barrow had created such a situation that the local bodies could not see their way to cope with it.  The amendments suggest a way &mdash; the setting up of a fund that might be used to meet cases like this.  I do not think that it needs further elaboration.  I think the amendments are reasonable.  I think it is a very mean action on the part of the Government to encroach on these small funds.  They will not count in meeting the huge cost of this drainage scheme but they would make a great difference in providing for contingencies that none of us can foresee.</P>

      <P>With the main principle of the Bill everybody agrees.  The Parliamentary Secretary appears to be forgetting what he said last night, namely, that his desire was to safeguard the ratepayers as far as possible. As far as I can see, the confiscation of the trustee funds is not a matter of importance but it is the principle underlying the thing that matters &mdash; the principle that all the liabilities are to be transferred to the ratepayers.  I prefer to leave the phrase &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; out of it altogether.  I think the words &ldquo;taxpayer&rdquo; and &ldquo;ratepayer&rdquo; convey more to the public.  The Treasury means the taxpayer.  The local authority means the ratepayer.  In this case the liabilities are to be transferred to the ratepayer and the assets are going to the assistance of the taxpayer. These sums are of little account when one considers the huge sum of £7,000,000.  These moneys were provided for a certain definite course, namely, to keep embankments in repair. That liability is being transferred to the ratepayer.  Are not they the natural inheritors of any trust funds that exist?  They are now by law being made responsible for the work that the trustee funds were created for.  Surely <Col N="829" /> the trustee funds should go to the relief of the ratepayers.</P>
      <P>As I pointed out yesterday, the County Council of Cork advanced a sum to the Awbeg drainage scheme, which is repayable in 35 years.  Now the occupiers are being relieved of that at the expense of the County Cork ratepayers.  Under this Act of Parliament, they are completely relieved of that liability but any trust funds that are there for the purpose of maintaining other embankments are being taken over by the State.  I do not think that is fair.  I think the principle is so wrong, the concession so small, that the Parliamentary Secretary might very easily give way on this particular point.</P>

      <P>I was hoping that, as a result of what I said last night, we would have a clearer understanding of what is involved here, but I find now that either I failed to explain the position or Deputies failed to grasp the explanation. We are not automatically interfering with these trust funds about which all this fuss is being created.  I want Deputies to ask themselves the number of these embankments which are in existence.  They will find them in the report of the Drainage Commission, and, according to that document, the number is 381.  There are trust funds in respect of some of these; there are some in respect of which there are no funds whatever; and there are others that for maintenance purposes are the responsibility of the people whose land they protect. We do not propose to confiscate these trust funds on the passage of this Bill into law or on the fixation of the appointed day.</P>

Surely if those funds were adequate, we would not have to reconstruct them at the State expense.  Deputies speak of the taxpayer's expense, and I am not trying to deny that.  I want to give the taxpayer all the credit due to him and I want to make him fully conscious at all times of the fact that it is he, and nobody such as the Treasury or the Ministry of Finance, who has to meet it.  We are merely providing ourselves here with power, when we reach a point at which we are ready to take over a particular embankment, to take it over, because we feel that, whether there is a trust fund in respect of it or not, it has been neglected, that it is in a bad condition and that it requires repair and is capable of being repaired and put into a proper condition.</P>

      <P>That is my point.  Section 4 empowers the commissioners, when they are of opinion that the execution of arterial drainage works is expedient in any catchment area for preventing or substantially reducing the periodical flooding of lands in that area, to prepare a scheme.  I am speaking in relation to an area where the responsibility rests on somebody&mdash; whether the land owner, the Land Commission, a trustee body or somebody else.  In that area, where there are up to 60 miles of embankments, flooding occurs, and if the commissioners are satisfied that there is flooding, even though the responsibility rests with the Land Commission or with a trustee body, they are empowered to go into that area, whether the county council likes it or not, and carry out a scheme.  That is what the section says.</P>

I do not want to deprive Deputies of the right to interrogate me, but their interruptions do knock me about a little.  I only want to make clear what I thought was in doubt and what I thought should not be in doubt; that is, that we are not, on the passage of this Bill, proposing to interfere with these funds.  We do not propose to interfere with the funds, to the extent that there were funds in existence for the maintenance of these embankments; nor do we propose to interfere with the embankments in respect of which there are no funds at all.  We are merely providing here, that, as we reach an embankment and decide that it is one that can be reconstructed and afterwards be maintained, we will proceed to take over that embankment and reconstruct it at State expense and that whatever sum of money is there in the shape of trust funds will go to the Exchequer.  As I say, I can see no injustice in that, inasmuch as the reconstruction cost of the embankment will in all cases be greater than the amount of the trust funds; because, if that was not the case, then the embankment would not need any reconstruction.  I think there can hardly be any doubt as to whether the State is trying to commit some mean, unpardonable sort of act in so far as this is concerned.</P>

Where there are no trust funds in existence and where an embankment is not the responsibility of any local authority, at some stage or other it is the intention of the commissioners to take over control of the embankment and reconstruct it and maintain it.  You eventually mean to deal with all the embankments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree with that. In the case where there are no trust funds for maintenance, the State is prepared to take over and reconstruct the embankment, maintain it afterwards, and present their bill to the local authority for maintenance.  Where there are no trust funds in existence, we are quite prepared, under the proposals <Col N="835" /> here, to reconstruct at State expense.  But, where trust funds are available, we are going to confiscate them.  That is where the injustice lies. To my mind, you are applying one measure of justice in one case and another in another.</P>

The cases are similar.  As I say, we must approach this with an eye to the taxpayers' rights and interests. If you ask me to undertake a job for you that would cost £20 and there is only a sum of £5 to meet it, I do not think it is reasonable that you should ask me to do the job without at least having the assistance of whatever fund is there, however small it may be.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary argued in reply to what we said that the State will proceed to reconstruct the embankments.  None of us mentioned a word about reconstruction &mdash; I did not anyhow.  I did not even refer to the legal aspect, because, like the Parliamentary Secretary, I have not a legal mind.  What I am trying to discuss as clearly as I can is the question of maintenance.  I never mentioned reconstruction.  The Parliamentary Secretary jumped on me and others because he said we did not understand what reconstruction meant. We know perfectly well what it means. In fact, I made reference to the efficiency of the present embankments when I spoke before.  I said that, in the event of these rivers being taken over and drained and cleaned, some of the existing embankments need not be even as strong as they are.  I can take the Minister to a river that has perfect embankments at present which do not <Col N="836" /> want any reconstruction.  They will not want to be maintained even at the present cost.  Everybody knows that when a sluggish river flows into a tidal river it needs very strong embankments to hold the strength of water if the river is not properly cleaned and drained.  When the tidal river and the river flowing into it are attended to, the embankments do not require the same attention, if they are in good repair at present.  The cost of maintenance in future will not be as great as if the river were never attended to. In some cases, landlords built very good embankments, and a sum is provided for their maintenance.  I know some that will last for a very long time.  The purpose of Deputy Hughes's amendment is to save this money for the purpose for which it was originally intended.  There may be a legal way of getting out of it.  It may be possible, by a quibble of the law, to evade the original intention in the setting up of these funds.  The Parliamentary Secretary may know nothing about the law, but some of those concerned with the drafting of this Bill know something about it, because they took a way of changing the ultimate destination of the funds.  I know nothing about law, but I know that, if things are left as they are and this money is devoted to the purpose for which it was originally provided, everybody will be better served.</P>

      <P>The point that Deputy Bennett raised has given me a new idea.  Suppose you have a situation where you were taking over at some date an embankment in a good state of repair.  This legislation envisages a situation in which the commissioners will take over all embankments.  Suppose that at a future date they take over the embankments that the Deputy described, which were built by landlords, which are in a perfect state of repair, and merely require a certain amount of maintenance, and there is a fund provided for that maintenance. The commissioners in that case take over that bank, confiscate the funds and do the maintenance work.  There is no reconstruction now.  They take over responsibility for maintenance <Col N="837" /> and do it and present the bill to the local authority.  Is that justice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In a national scheme you cannot pick out a few hundred perches of a sound embankment; you have to look at 381 embankments and ask yourselves what condition are they in, and what fund is there to maintain them. You ask yourselves has the fund been adequate to do the job.  It may be that a couple of hundred perches of a bank are perfectly sound and the fund provided may have been intended only to be spent on them.  But this is not a small matter; this is a bigger matter. You have this number of embankments in the whole country, and a certain number of them, as we come to them, will be included in the comprehensive drainage district.  A certain number of them will have to be approached as a separate matter, as embankments pure and simple.</P>
      <P>What I want the House to realise is that, to the extent that there are funds there, we are not confiscating them until we proceed to reconstruct and recondition, and in undertaking that work I can assure the House the taxpayer is entering into a very substantial liability indeed as compared with the trivial amount available in the way of a trust fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McMenamin talked about these funds in perpetuity.  There is no such thing.  In many cases where these trust funds are in existence, the capital has been spent in an effort to keep the works in proper condition, and he who professes to give the House the benefit of his legal mind apparently <Col N="838" /> does not seem to understand that what he is saying is entirely inaccurate.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary ought to remember that it may look a very small matter to him, looking down from the office that is going to spend £7,000,000; but from the point of view of people in a small way down the country it might appear to be a very big matter.</P>

      <P>I was in doubt about it.  In County Waterford there is a number of embankments in connection with which the Land Commission have failed to carry out their obligation to keep them in repair.  I do not understand the position very clearly and I am merely trying to protect the interests of the ratepayers.  I want to see that the embankments are in a proper state of repair when they are handed over to the county council. That is the point I want to make clear. I mentioned, yesterday, a case occurring in the Nier Valley, where, in 1933, the Land Commission built a sod embankment. The following is an extract from a letter I have received in connection with it:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In 1933 the Land Commission built a sod embankment on my side of the river and a good limestone embankment on the other side.  In 1937/1938 my side began to go and I informed the Land Commission. They took no notice, and at that time very little would do.  So, in 1940, the whole thing was swept away, which has rendered about 10 acres useless.  I am continually writing to the Land Commission.  I may get a reply that they are looking into the matter, but, so far, nothing has been done.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Even if it was not their responsibility in that case, there are other cases, in the Tar area and the Lismore area, where the Land Commission is responsible.  The point is that in connection with the section in the Bill under which compensation would arise, if the embankments were in a bad state of repair and, as in the case I have mentioned, ten acres of land were rendered useless, that particular individual could look for compensation from the responsible authority, namely, the county council.  All I ask in the amendment is that where the responsibility rested with the Land Commission, the Parliamentary Secretary, when he takes over under this Drainage Bill, will place the embankments in a solid state of repair before the county council will be asked to accept the responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The county council has no responsibility for embankments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>This is what the Drainage Commission had to say on this matter of embankments:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In all these cases, however, the tenant purchasers continue to look to the Land Commission for assistance. They persist in regarding the Land Commission as the legal successor of the former landlords, with all the obligations of the latter. They fail to realise that a tenant purchaser whose holding is vested in him has become an owner in feesimple and has acquired the interest of the former landlord with all its obligations as well as its rights.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tenant, although his lands are now vested in him and although, with that vesting, has gone the responsibility to him that was formerly discharged by the Land Commission, still regards the Land Commission as the legal successor of the landlord and he will look to the Land Commission as an institution that should carry out this work for him, while, in fact, the Land Commission has no legal responsibility whatever.  That is why I put the question to the Deputy.  I was not trying, as Deputy Hughes suggested, <Col N="847" /> to evade a straight question.  I was trying merely to get the trend of thought of the Deputy.  There can be nothing more clear than this.  It is quite simple and quite easy to follow. I told the Deputy the number of embankments that were in existence.  I told him that there were funds in existence in respect of some of them.  There are some embankments in respect of which there is no fund and I told him that these embankments would remain as they are until such time as we decide to take them over as we reach them.  Whether they are embankments in connection with which funds exist or not, if the drainage authority felt that it was in the public interest to take over any portion of these embankments, then we would take them over, reconstruct them and maintain them afterwards &mdash; of course, at the expense of the local authority. That is simple, I think, and easily followed.</P>

      <P>I hold that where land will benefit by a drainage scheme some charge should be put on the land so benefited.  This is a very big scheme and if land is going to benefit by the scheme it should bear a part of the cost and the ordinary county ratepayer should not be asked to bear part of the burden.  In a particular area where lands are drained, provided they are brought up to a good state for cultivation, or even for grazing, surely they are worth more money to the owner than before they were drained. If not, why drain them at all?  I have in mind areas in which this scheme might be operated.  It is good land, and I see no reason why the man on the mountainside should be asked to pay a penny, twopence, threepence or sixpence in the pound for the drainage of that land.  I hold that land which will benefit should bear a share of the cost of maintenance, apart from the county-at-large rate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The old principle was that a man should pay portion of the improvement value&mdash;not the full value, because if he were charged the full value, it would be no benefit to him at all &mdash; and it is on that basis that Deputy Heskin is arguing.  There is something to be said for it.  Nevertheless, we think that, taking the broad view, the principle of making it a county-at-large charge is sound.  It so happens that some people are in the rather unfortunate geographical position of living in wet, low-lying districts while others live along a trunk road. The latter gets all the advantages of a trunk road service and the man on the hillside has to pay for those services, although he gets very little advantage from them.  We do not attempt to strike a special charge for the man with the advantages of trunk road service, and, in respect of all these social services, I think there is a lot to be said for spreading the charge generally. However, if we agree here that some portion of the charge should be paid and that the charge should be apportioned as between the riparian owners and the county-at-large &mdash; I do not know if this aspect has been examined, but it struck me as being rather useful &mdash;we might decide that where you increase a man's valuation because of the improved value resulting from drainage, he is indirectly contributing to the local authority because his rates will be slightly increased.  What I mean is not to have a separate charge for drainage works, but to permit the increase in the valuation to operate which would help the local authority, to a small extent at any rate.</P>

      <P>I must say that I agree with Deputy Heskin.  I think the owners of benefited lands should be <Col N="851" /> asked to shoulder some additional charge.  I am not quite clear as to how this will operate.  The final award will show the increased value of the benefited land.  It may be confined to a townland or a number of townlands, but I take it that subsequently it will be a matter for the Valuation Office to step in and increase the valuation in proportion to the increased value of the land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>We assume that the scheme is confined to one county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case, the bulk improvement will be made known in the final award to the county concerned, but it will have no importance, except as a record of information showing the improvement effected in the lands drained.  But where there is more than one county concerned, an apportionment as between counties will be made for the purpose of enabling an apportionment of the drainage maintenance charges afterwards, but it will have no further significance.  It cannot be added on in the manner suggested by Deputy Heskin, or divided amongst the valuations, because that could not be done without new legislation.  That being so, it has no purpose except the purpose I have described.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can only say that I agree with the argument that there is nothing unsound in asking a man to pay for benefits which he receives, and the Drainage Commission held that he should be made responsible for the payment of 70 per cent. of the estimated improvement to his land.  We departed from that, not because we disagreed with the principle or with the recommendation, and not because we felt there was anything wrong or unjust about it, but because we found from our experience that it was a source of delay and a source of trouble not only in the preparation <Col N="852" /> of a scheme and the segregation of the estimated improvements amongst the different holdings affected, but of continued trouble in respect of these holdings afterwards. Taking it all in all, while we agree with the principle of asking a man to pay, we thought that, because of the smallness of the amount involved in many cases, and the delay which would be occasioned by the process, it was better to ask the State to bear the whole initial cost, and to ask the local ratepayer, who is the nearest approach to the individual, to meet the cost of maintenance.  That is the line of reasoning which was applied to our deciding on this proposal.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1) (b) to delete all words after the words &ldquo;drainage works&rdquo; in line 22 to the end of the paragraph and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;the judge before whom such proceedings are being heard may, after hearing the evidence of the <Col N="853" /> plaintiff and defendants appoint a member of the panel of arbitrators who is a qualified engineer to make an inspection of the said existing drainage works and to furnish a report of his inspection to the court.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think this a shocking paragraph. There was a similar paragraph in an earlier part of the Bill where it stated that the commissioner's certificate was final and binding so far as the maintenance by a local authority was concerned. That was not so bad.  This paragraph states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(b) in any proceedings against the commissioners for damages or for relief in the nature of mandamus on account of the alleged inadequate maintenance by the commissioners of any such existing drainage works, a certificate sealed with the seal of the commissioners and stating that the commissioners have caused the said existing drainage works to be inspected and are satisfied that the said existing drainage works are, at the date of such certificate, in a condition and state of repair at least as good as on the date of the relevant maintenance transfer order shall be conclusive and irrebuttable evidence that the said existing drainage works are in a condition and state of repair at the date of such certificate at least as good as on the date of the said order.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Surely that is an extraordinary principle, that if there is litigation, one party to the legal proceedings can certify that their own work has been properly and efficiently carried out, and that cannot be questioned.  A fundamental principle of justice in this country, so far as protecting the liberty and the freedom of the individual is concerned, is that, if the individual feels he has a grievance against a fellow-citizen or against the State, he can bring his case into court and get a strictly impartial decision.  How can justice be administered if we legislate in this manner to protect an authority that, I hope, will be very active?  It may be that the drainage authority requires exceptional powers <Col N="854" /> to carry out national drainage work. I agree that it wants exceptional powers.  But the moment you give an authority like this exceptional power in dealing with any individual, I suggest that you should ensure, if you are to legislate properly, that you give that individual all the essential safeguards so that the authority will not abuse the extraordinary powers you are giving to them.  We are providing the essential powers which I admit are necessary to carry out drainage work.  They can go in on land and take sods and everything necessary to build embankments. They can compulsorily acquire land for the purpose of carrying out a drainage scheme.  All these powers are being conceded.  Nobody has questioned the wisdom of doing that.  But, once we provide these exceptional powers, surely it is only reasonable that we should provide the necessary safeguards on the other side, and see that the liberty and freedom of the individual are not infringed in any way, and that if he has a grievance he has the right to take that into court and get an independent decision.</P>
    <P>The proposals put up to this House in that respect are shocking, if you approach them in a strictly impartial way.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary should reconsider the whole matter.  I do not think that we should leave ourselves open to being charged with contempt of court.  We are very nearly doing it in more than one instance. If we expect that citizens will have respect for the law, surely we should set a good example ourselves by having respect for the law.  You are accepting the fact that a matter can be made the subject of legal proceedings, but you throw in a provision of this sort, that there is to be a certificate from the people involved in the legal proceedings, that they are to be the judges of their own conduct, and that no one dare question their work. That is a preposterous suggestion to which we could not possibly agree.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary should reconsider the matter, and at all events have respect for the individual's rights, the right to question a decision even of the State, take it into court and get an impartial decision on <Col N="855" /> it within the laws made by this Parliament. You are infringing his rights and liberties if you do anything else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy was amongst those who admitted our right to protect county councils to whom we are transferring districts on the appointed day.  Most of the Deputies, I think, recognised the necessity for inserting a provision, as we did, in Section 23 for the protection of these bodies.  If the House recognises the importance of the insertion of that protection for local authorities, I do not think that they can reasonably deny to the drainage authority a similar protection.  I must confess that, when you look at this at first, it seems a bit high-handed that when you have a drainage authority charged with the maintenance of a district and somebody decides to take an action against that authority, it is the certificate of that authority which will be called upon to determine whether or not there is anything in the complaint.  But what other way can you have it?  I cannot see our having very many of these districts on our hands.  The only occasion on which we are likely to have a district of this type on our hands for maintenance purposes will be when we take over an old district for reconstruction, and will not be ready to start on it for some time, and will have to maintain it in the interval; or where we will construct a drainage district, and because of our having to set up one maintenance organisation, we might take in some districts lying close by for maintenance purposes.  But I cannot see the drainage authority handling very many of these, because we will naturally wait until they are being taken over for the purpose of reconstruction, and after reconstruction they will pass into our maintenance organisation for maintenance purposes. After that, the individual will have all the freedom that Deputy Hughes wants him to have in the way of taking whatever proceedings he may think fit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This only refers to the old existing districts.  It does not cover any wider <Col N="856" /> ground than that.  It only refers to those if and when we take over any of them for the purpose of reconstruction and may not be able to proceed with the reconstruction right off; or because we have in a catchment area carried out some new works in respect of which we would be responsible for maintenance, and, because of being responsible for maintenance, we would take in a number of those other old districts and say that we would maintain them as a unit with this organisation we have set up.  It is scarcely likely that any difficulty of the kind that Deputy Hughes anticipates will arise; but, anyhow, if there is anything in the argument that he has advanced, we are the people who now are charged with the inspection of these districts for the purpose of putting on record their condition prior to the fixation of the appointed day. Who, then, will be in a position to give a certificate except ourselves?  There will be no other authority that will have any record of the condition of the district.</P>

If, in a year or two years, we decide to take one of them over for any of the reasons I have given, and if the situation visualised by Deputy Hughes were to arise, my point is that if even a private person wanted to get into court, and if the court wanted to get a certificate, as it would, with reference to the condition of the district on the appointed day, there would be no authority in a position to give that information to the court unless ourselves, <Col N="857" /> and, that being so, and while it may seem to the Deputy somewhat extravagant, I do not think there is any reason for anxiety about it, because we will have committed ourselves to recording the condition in which it was, and that is the important thing.  We are the only people having that record, the only people who will be able to say what the condition was then and is now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is trying to draw an analogy between what occurs after the transfer order and what occurs on the appointed day.  To get the whole thing properly focussed and clear in the Parliamentary Secretary's mind, let us follow the trend of events.  I agree that you want to protect the local authority, because it is not envisaged in this legislation that the local authority should reconstruct; they merely should do the necessary maintenance until our people would finally step in and do any reconstruction necessary.  It is only envisaged that the local authority should maintain at a standard not greater than the standard on the appointed day.  For that reason it is necessary to have people like the commissioners stepping in and examining the degree of maintenance that is there, so that they will be able to certify that the local authority is doing its duty and is maintaining it at a standard equal to the standard prior to the transfer order.</P>
      <P>The people who certify are certifying the work of another body.  At a later stage the transfer order operates and it comes to the commissioners.  In the event of litigation, not merely by an individual, but possibly by a local authority having some ground for questioning the commissioners after the transfer order operates and when it becomes the responsibility of the local authority, the certificate by the commissioners will be final and binding. The commissioners are to be the judges of their own work and no one dare question them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are we to agree to legislation of that sort?  Are we to build up a fortification around the commissioners and put them in such an impregnable position, so far as their work is concerned?  No <Col N="858" /> one would dare to question the efficiency of their work, and the judge's hand would be tied.  The evidence of a technician or an engineer on the matter, no matter how strong regarding inefficiency, would not be enough. The commissioners could not be assailed or questioned in any way because of the provisions we are asked to subscribe to in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has not convinced me, and I do not think he could possibly convince the House, as to the desirability or wisdom of putting such a provision in here.  There is no analogy whatever in this instance. You are brought in as an impartial body in the one case to certify the work of the local authority in the carrying out of maintenance.  Here it is a totally different matter.  You are claiming the privilege of certifying your own work.  That sort of provision cannot be defended and I could not possibly agree to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision does not seem to be altogether clear to me.  I understand from what the Parliamentary Secretary has said that the amount of work affected by clause (b) of Section 37 is not very great.  If it is not very great I think the Parliamentary Secretary might consider the desirability of taking the risk of having a case decided against him in the court.  What I also fail to understand is this: suppose the drainage work is undertaken by the commissioners and completed, the maintenance of such work will then be the function of the commissioners.  Why is it a clause is not inserted to protect the commissioners, in reference to such work, a clause such as we have here in the case of work already existing?  Why is a distinction drawn between existing work taken over and new work completed by the commissioners?  If there is no need for the protection of the commissioners in the case of new work which they are liable to maintain, why should they need this special protection in the case of existing works taken over?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that I should answer that right off.  Surely the Deputy is aware that the districts that are being transferred on the appointed <Col N="859" /> day are districts that have been neglected, in some cases for 30 years? Some of these districts are districts in which no work has been done in the memory of man, and surely it is unreasonable to suggest that we alone are not entitled to protection and that the county council, who are being asked to take them on the appointed day, are to have protection against people taking action against them for insufficient maintenance?</P>

      <P>We are not expected to improve them until we reconstruct them. When we reconstruct them the normal law will apply to them.  We will have a chance then of designing a proper scheme and carrying out proper works. We do not seek any special protection. If you give us a district on which no work has been done for 30 or 40 years and you say to the county council: &ldquo;We are merely asking you to maintain this up to the standard in which you find it&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary himself applied the words &ldquo;extravagant&rdquo; and &ldquo;high-handed&rdquo; to this particular clause.  I think a more appropriate word would be &ldquo;outrageous&rdquo;. I do not believe there was such a clause in any legislation ever passed by this House or in any other legislation taken over from the British authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>The drainage authority concerns itself with all sorts of safeguards, but there is no safeguard for the individual or the unfortunate local authority affected by these drainage schemes.  A clause of this kind is calculated to cause inefficiency amongst the officials of the commissioners themselves, as they know perfectly well that, no matter how indifferently <Col N="860" /> or carelessly they may carry out the work, they are safeguarded against any action taken against them. They issue a sealed certificate, which will be irrefutable evidence that the work was done in the fashion specified, and no one has the right to question it.  I wonder what would happen if someone should take action and what the comment of one of our present High Court judges would be in regard to this type of legislation, if someone presented a certificate of that kind.  It is indeed an amazing clause.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary did say that this clause was only intended to apply to old existing drainage districts. From my opinion of the country, I would say it is because of the fact that it does apply to those old existing drainage districts that trouble is likely to arise and that certain people may be inclined to take proceedings against the commissioners on account of the negligent manner in which the work was being carried out.  No matter what grievances these people may have, no matter what damage they may suffer, no matter how their livelihood may be affected, they are to have no rights whatever.  The drainage officials are at liberty to carry out the scheme in any manner they wish, as indifferently as they wish and without any regard for the people.  The officials know perfectly well they are secure under this particular clause and the commissioners also are secure against any claim these unfortunate people may be inclined to make.  I would almost say that this clause is unconstitutional; at any rate, it is utterly unjust and I do not think such a clause was ever included in previous legislation.</P>

      <P>I want to be strictly fair to the Parliamentary Secretary. The section starts off by saying:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whenever a certificate of completion has been issued and also whenever a maintenance transfer order has been made, the following provisions shall apply....&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary's contention is right that this paragraph (b) of sub-section (1) applies only in the case of existing drainage works that <Col N="861" /> have been transferred before a certificate of completion has been issued and is intended to safeguard the commissioners from litigation pending the completion of the reconstruction works, I think that it is very badly drafted to cover that point.  If he would read it again, he might not be so satisfied that that is properly covered, as the two things are coupled.</P>

In (a) he is really trying to cover the commissioners, &ldquo;who shall maintain the said drainage works or existing drainage works in proper repair and effective condition but, in the case of any such existing drainage works....&rdquo;  What he means there is &ldquo;prior to reconstruction.&rdquo;  If the Parliamentary Secretary wants to get that in, it is very necessary to clarify it by saying &ldquo;prior to reconstruction,&rdquo; as he starts off the section by coupling the two and operating it under both completion and transfer order.  In any case, I feel that the paragraph is highly objectionable.</P>

      <P>The main purpose of the section, as I understand it, is to provide that the burden of the cost of maintenance of all drainage works shall rest on the local authority.  I was hoping that I might be able to draft some kind of amendment that would place that burden on the national Exchequer instead, but I am afraid I could not devise any such amendment.  Since the burden is to be borne by the county councils and it might occur that one or two county councils might be victimised inasmuch as the burden would be excessively heavy on one particular county or two, I consider it would be better if the cost were distributed equally over all counties.  That may seem to be going too far, but when we consider that one of the principles of this Bill is to take the burden of maintenance off the individual landowners affected and to make it a county-at-large charge so that the ratepayers in even the largest counties must bear the cost of maintenance of perhaps a comparatively small work in a particular county, I do not see anything wrong in distributing the burden equally over all counties.  There can be nothing objectionable in it.  It would avoid friction and dissatisfaction between one county and another.</P>

      <P>It has, but there was nothing wrong with it in principle.  It was dropped, and the county-at-large charge was substituted for the reason that the county is a unit.  It is the nearest that you can get to the individual in this particular case.  The county is responsible for many of its own services. If the principle in the Deputy's amendment were to be accepted, we would have a great deal of agitation and not the harmony which he suggests. I believe it would have the <Col N="866" /> very opposite effect in counties in which there are not very serious drainage problems if the people there were to be called upon to pay into a pool on a flat rate from which they would get very little benefit.  You would have a great deal of agitation conducted by local authorities as to the injustice of that state of affairs.  For these and for other reasons that it is not necessary to go into, it was found, on giving these amendments consideration, that the course suggested in them would not be a wise one to take.</P>

      <P>If an ordinary contractor were doing a job and if you drew up the terms of his contract in that way, it would be a rather poor contract. That is a shocking piece of legislation.  It may have been taken from other Drainage Acts; I do not know.  It gives power to &ldquo;take from any land all sods and other material required for the purposes of such maintenance&rdquo;. You could go ten miles away and take sods and other material. We talk about the value of soil in this country.  We are going to dig up the surface of the earth and make embankments out of it.  Paragraph (d) empowers the commissioners &ldquo;to utilise for the purpose of such maintenance all or any soil, gravel, stone, rock or other material removed in the course of such maintenance&rdquo;.  Then in sub-section (2) we give power to &ldquo;execute such improvements to such drainage works or existing drainage works as appear to them to be minor matters&rdquo;.  The drafting is so wide it simply means that the commissioners can do what they like.  That right is preserved through the whole Bill and they have very wide powers when they enter on a piece of land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing I take exception to is that when you have taken the wide powers you are not prepared to put in the safeguards.  The Parliamentary Secretary is absolutely stubborn about that.  I am afraid that in a very short time he has developed the Departmental mind.  The Civil Service has had an overpowering effect on him.  He should preserve the mentality of the ordinary citizen, of a democrat, who believes in making the Department do its job and imposing <Col N="869" /> the necessary check on it, and if it does not do its job then the citizen has a right to bring the Department to court and test the matter there.  I think that between this and Report Stage the Parliamentary Secretary would be well advised to reconsider the whole matter of putting in safeguards. It changes the mentality of an official if he feels that the individual has certain safeguards and can test him in court.  The moment he walks in with full arbitrary powers, he is quite a different individual to deal with.  Are we going to legislate in this House to give powers of that sort to individual engineers?  They may be very decent men if they know that you can take them to court and test their right and authority to do certain things.  If the citizen has not that power, some of them may still behave as decent men, but all of them will not behave as decent men.  That section attacks the fundamental liberty of the individual. It is shocking legislation and, as I pointed out to the Parliamentary Secretary, it has been vigorously condemned in the Report of the Vocational Organisation published a few days ago. Why do we set up such commissions if we do not take cognisance of their recommendations?</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary suggested that I wanted to prevent national drainage in this country.  I am as anxious as the Parliamentary Secretary is that there should be national drainage, but I say that giving a drainage authority exceptional powers which are necessary requires the necessary safeguards so far as the individual and the local authority are concerned.  We have given all the exceptional powers that are necessary to the drainage authority that we are setting up and the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government Department generally are refusing to put in any of the essential safeguards.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This aims at making the appointment permanent.  Under the original legislation, the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919, the decision was that the officials appointed <Col N="872" /> held permanent office.  I think there was some good reason for making that decision.  In the first place, they would be more independent.  The Parliamentary Secretary has given way on the proposals here by which the reference committee would pick a panel of arbitrators, and whenever the Minister wanted an arbitrator, he would simply take one from the panel.  I was inclined to argue that the Minister would pick a man who would suit him, as he would.  If he did not like him, he would get another.  The same thing would apply where a man holds a temporary office.  If his awards are too generous, from the commissioners' point of view, they may get some other man, but if a man held a permanent office, he would be independent and not afraid of losing his job.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect, that is, that a man might be a member of a firm or associated with a firm which might be interested.  It might be a milling interest in a stream in relation to a water right which might be in question and temporary appointments for that reason are undesirable, especially in the case of an arbitrator.  When the British, who passed this Act originally, insisted on a permanent appointment, there was a very good and valid reason for putting men in strictly impartial and independent positions and above any influence by the State or anyone else.  They got reasonable remuneration for their work, and were completely independent.  If you want to get the strictly impartial decisions which are necessary, if the arbitrator is to do his work properly, it would be more desirable to have a man in a permanent position than in a temporary position.  If a man holding a temporary appointment for three years makes awards which are too favourable to the individual, from the commissioners' point of view, or from the point of view of the Minister for Finance, who has to pay the compensation, he will get the &ldquo;sack.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It happens that there is no ulterior motive in this.  The Drainage Commission had something to say about this matter, and we are following <Col N="873" /> closely the lines they recommended to us.  They visualised a large number of cases arising in which the services of arbitrators with varied qualifications would be necessary.  It is not the same as the acquisition of land for housing.  The question of mill rights, fisheries, land, and so on, will arise, and they apparently came to the conclusion that it would be better if the reference committee had power to select a man, even though he might be engaged in private practice.  We saw that the recommendation was sensible, and we made this alteration.  There is no danger or harm in it, and I think it very necessary.</P>

      <P>To add at the end a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  Whenever under this section the commissioners in lieu of executing any specified work themselves contract with some other person for the execution of the whole or any part of such works it shall be mandatory on the commissioners to insert in the contract made with such other person a provision requiring such other person to pay rates of wages and observe conditions of employment not less favourable to the persons employed under the contract than the wages paid and conditions of employment prescribed under <Col N="875" /> trade union agreements applicable to work of a similar kind or in the absence of such trade union agreements the wages paid and the conditions of employment observed by good employers in the district in which the work is carried out.</P>
    <P>We propose that where the commissioners give out any works for which they are responsible for execution by contract, a clause shall be inserted requiring the contractor to observe trade union conditions, or, where there is no trade union agreement, to observe the wages and conditions observed by employers in the district.</P>
    <P>This is in conformity with Government policy and the generally recognised policy of local authorities throughout the country that contractors should not be permitted to carry out a contract under wages and conditions less favourable than the local authority or the Government Department itself would observe.  In so far as we include the alternatives, that either the trade union clause, which is the clause included in many tenders of local authorities, or the terms of the fair wages clause, which the Board of Works itself observes, I think the Parliamentary Secretary should meet us in the matter.</P>

      <P>In this section, power is asked for, in the event of the local authority not paying up when the bill is presented, to secure that any moneys coming from any Department of State may be withheld for the purpose of discharging the liabilities to the commissioners. Supposing there is a dispute between the local authority and the commissioners regarding the amount involved or the efficiency of the work or anything else; surely that sort of procedure is wrong, that we should authorise any Department or any Minister to deduct money for the purpose of discharging the liability of the commissioners.  In the event of any dispute between a local authority and the commissioners regarding the efficiency of the work, the magnitude of the bill, or any point that might be the subject of litigation in such circumstances, we should not agree to this provision that money should be deducted from other sources.  Such money might be for the purpose of dealing with tuberculosis or some other purpose altogether.  I am certainly opposed to this section.</P>

      <P>I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will see his way to delete this section on the Report Stage.  Local authorities under this Bill, when it becomes an Act, will be called upon to act in a very responsible manner, and I think this penal section is all wrong. This is the only Bill, other than Land Bills, which came before the House in which this section is included.  At <Col N="877" /> present, local authorities remit to certain Government Departments huge sums of money each year, for instance, in repayment of loans out of the Local Loans Fund, and not a single one of them has ever defaulted to the extent of 1/-.  They raise the rates faithfully each year, and remit every 1/- they owe to the Local Loans Fund without any penal clause compelling them to do so.  I cannot understand why this section was lifted bodily out of the Land Act and put into this Bill. Several Bills have been passed providing that local authorities should raise certain funds and remit them to the central authority.  In no case was a penal clause such as this inserted.  To my mind, it is degrading to the local authorities to say that responsible bodies will not pay their just debts to the State, that they will not raise sufficient funds to pay what is a statutory obligation.  It is made a statutory obligation in this Bill for a local authority to raise a certain county-at-large rate to the extent of the certificate of the drainage commissioners, and the suggestion here is that local authorities will hang on to this money and will not remit it to the drainage authority.  The drainage commissioners have plenty of powers, other than this section, to get the money. They can go into court at any time and mandamus the local authority or sue them, if any local authority were so foolish as to withhold the money. They are bound each year to raise the money.  The county manager will have no option but to raise the money.  The members of the council will not have the right to decide not to raise the money.  It is mandatory on them to raise the money each year.  To say that a county council will have power to withhold the money is all nonsense. It is an executive function.  The council will have no control over any of the funds other than to provide them.  This would seem to contemplate that the county manager would withhold these moneys from the commissioners. I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will see his way to have the section deleted on the Report Stage. It is a penal clause which is bringing the county councils into absolute contempt. The people who put in that <Col N="878" /> section had nothing but contempt for local authorities.  That is my opinion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Allen that this section appears to be unnecessary.  I was not quite sure whether this was an executive function or a reserved function.  Deputy Allen says it is an executive function.  If it is, it is a function of the county manager, who is the direct servant of the Government, and he is not likely to default in the payment of the money due.  If Deputy Allen is wrong and it is a reserved function, we all know that county councils are subject to very rigid control by the Local Government Department.  County councils have been abolished for smaller offences than not providing moneys such as these which are statutorily due. Therefore, there seems to be absolutely no justification for putting in this penal section.  It is not desirable that the commissioners should have power to collect this money from some other funds due to the county councils.</P>
      <P>By making that deduction from some other fund that is payable to the county council they may upset the finances of the county council unduly. I cannot conceive any delay occurring in the payment of these amounts unless where there is a very serious difference of opinion as to whether the amount is actually due.  In a case like that I do not think it would be desirable that the commissioners should have such drastic powers.  I think the fact that local authorities are under such rigid control should be sufficient guarantee that the money will be paid.</P>

      <P>Whatever case there might be for the inclusion of such a section in other legislation, I certainly do not think there is any need for it in this Bill.  It is true, as Deputy Allen pointed out, that a similar section was included in some of the Land Acts.  I do not know whether the section in the Land Acts was as drastic as this particular section.  It is most unlikely that any county council would default in regard to whatever payments may be due to the Board of Works.  I think sub-sections (2) and (3) could safely be deleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Section 44 is read in conjunction with Section 45, it would appear that <Col N="879" /> the Drainage Commissioners will be performing another function as well; that is, a sort of debt-collecting agency, because in Section 45 it would seem as if they are going to collect all the money due to other Departments of State as well as what is due to the Board of Works.  I think Section 45 is an insult to local authorities.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Allen that it is most unlikely that a county manager will refuse to make payments.  I do not know whether it has happened in the past, but we are all aware that county managers are appointees of the Minister for Local Government and I cannot understand how they would refuse to meet claims made upon them by the Drainage Commissioners in respect of any moneys due.  I consider this section entirely unnecessary.</P>

      <P>I agree with the point of view expressed by Deputy Allen.  I do not see any reason why this section should be included in the Bill.  I have a good deal of experience of local authorities and I have never known one of them to withhold a payment of this kind.  It is a penal clause against local authorities and there is no necessity for it.  I do not know what right the Parliamentary Secretary has to assume that any local authority will withhold such payments.  Local authorities all over the country have been appealing for proper drainage laws so that drainage may be carried out in their districts and they will be only too happy to pay whatever is due under this measure.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to withdraw the section. It shows a complete distrust of local authorities.  There has been enough interference with local authorities in recent years without a section of this kind being brought in.  To <Col N="880" /> my mind this is extraneous matter altogether.  I will definitely call for a division on this section.</P>

If they do not pay, the section merely gives the commissioners power to make a deduction from any moneys due to the council.  I do not think there is any harm in having that safeguard there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>This section has its origin in the first Land Act that was passed by the British Parliament.  It was also embodied in Land Acts passed by this House, but to my knowledge it was embodied in no other legislation. Under the 1925 Drainage Act moneys had to be remitted to the central authority and under other Drainage Acts moneys had to be remitted.  To my knowledge, no local authority has ever defaulted to the extent of 1/-. The Parliamentary Secretary has not answered that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The insertion of this section in the Bill is no injury to local authorities, but it shows an utter contempt for them and it indicates that here are some kind of wild men, halfsavages, who will not pay these debts. That is how it appears to me and for that reason I object to the section. Local authorities have a pride in their business, just the same as this Parliament has a pride in doing its duty and paying its debts.  The Drainage Commissioners <Col N="881" /> and the Board of Works have statutory powers to collect any money that is due.  They have the same authority to collect as other Departments of State.  If the Minister for Agriculture is owed money by a county committee he has power to go to court to collect it.  So, too, the Office of Public Works has power to collect debts, and I do not think it can claim that any local authority withheld money that was due.  If the Parliamentary Secretary can give me one instance of where they withheld money, I shall withdraw my opposition.</P>

      <P>With other Deputies, I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to withdraw this section.  I think he might reasonably give way to us on this occasion.  As Deputy Allen so well argued, it does not matter very much whether it is in or not, but it does cast a slur on very respectable bodies. We have been arguing about the commissioners, and when we suggested they should be compelled to do certain things the Parliamentary Secretary would not give us any hearing&mdash;it was almost calumny to suggest the commissioners would act as we suggested. How, he asked, could any reasonable man assume that the commissioners would do what was suggested?  It was unthought of.  Here it is a case of a county council doing something which a county council was never known to do and yet the Parliamentary Secretary thinks it necessary to put in this section.  I think he is unreasonable in not meeting Deputies on this matter.</P>

      <P>The sensitiveness is so highly developed that it is beyond me <Col N="882" /> to understand it.  This is a section which merely says that, if money is due, power will be given to those to whom it is due to take the amount from money which they might have to pay.  There could be a case in which we would take over a district and be responsible for maintaining it, while the local authority would be responsible for paying for that maintenance.  If they refused to pay us promptly, or were squabbling about it, we want to be able to take the amount from those sums due to them.  I know what local authorities are, I have some experience of them and I cannot see that there is anything in this section in any way offensive, if they do their job.</P>

He has not been able to cite one instance where a local authority broke its word, in so far as payment for lawful debts is concerned.  I cannot see why it is necessary to have such a section.

      <P>The principle enshrined in this section is a most objectionable one.  It was established in the first Land Acts, when the moneys due to this country at that time from the Imperial Exchequer were impounded and made liable for any defalcation under the Land Acts.  That is a principle we strongly resented even then, through our representatives, and that resentment still remains. It is repugnant to us now that the very same principle should be adopted by our own Department of State, and that moneys due to the county council could, if there were any neglect or dispute, be held liable for that payment.  It is an unnecessarily <Col N="883" /> provocative section, continuing a principle that everyone in this State repudiated when it was first introduced against us.  It is very bad policy that we should now adopt the ways and means formerly adopted against us when we had legitimate claims to fight.  The principle is now being brought against the local authorities, a section of our own people.  I regret to have to speak in that way and to impeach it on those lines, but when has a local authority refused to face its liabilities?  I am not aware of it and I have had very close and intimate association with local authorities for a very considerable time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is entirely unnecessary that we should take over this method, which was repudiated by us previously, with emphasis, when it was first introduced, as a dictatorial and arbitrary method of recovering annuities in this country. It is a particularly bad principle and, on those grounds alone, I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to withdraw the section.  It is not in the least effective and is entirely unnecessary, as it has never been known that a local <Col N="884" /> authority refused to face its liabilities. Why should this section be introduced, in a Bill which is unquestionably of great advantage to the country?  Why put the House to the pain of dividing on this point and compel members of the Government Party to vote for it, although they see the effectiveness of this section against local authorities and see in this a very close adherence to the procedure adopted against our people by the people of another country.</P>

      <P>Surely the Parliamentary Secretary does not consider it necessary to take such power, in view of the fact that other departments over which Ministers are the heads, for example, the Revenue Commissioners and the Land Commission, have machinery of their own for collecting debts?  Why should the Parliamentary Secretary and the Drainage Commissioners assume the responsibility of a debt-collecting agency for these different State departments?  Even assuming that such a section is in one of the earlier Acts, that is no justification for introducing it into this Bill at this stage of our history.</P>

      <P>I think the section is very objectionable.  We should not be prepared to grant privileges of that sort.  The Revenue Commissioners invariably decide that the money is owed.  In this case, once they decide that the money is due, there is an end to it.  There is some justification for the amendment suggested by Deputy Norton on foot of a decree, but in any case I think the section is highly objectionable. Opportunity should not be taken in this Bill to take one year's income-tax or an annuity that he owes from a person because for once in his life he is entitled to compensation since you have taken some rights from him, acquired land or something like that.</P>

He might be an individual from whom it would be impossible to recover.  Is it suggested that in the event of another State Department having to pay money to that individual we should not take the right here to deduct the sums that were due to him&mdash;that we should in fact pay money to him although when, we had paid, the other Department would not be able to recover the amount that was due to it?</P>

With all the work the commissioners are going to have under this Bill&mdash;and goodness knows they will have a whole-time job if they are to do the draining of the country in any reasonable time&mdash;we are giving them the job of debt collector. I think it is monstrous.  I cannot find any other word for it.  The Parliamentary Secretary says he cannot conceive of any Department asking money that is not due to it.  He cannot conceive of any Department asking money that is not due to it.  He cannot conceive even the Revenue Commissioners demanding money that is not due to them.  I can conceive it.  In fact, I have had painful experience of even the Revenue Commissioners demanding <Col N="888" /> money from me that I did not owe. I remember taking the Revenue Commissioners to court and beating them. The Parliamentary Secretary tells me, with a face of clay, that he cannot imagine a Department of State, particularly the Revenue Commissioners, demanding money that was not due. If I had the same case to-morrow as I had some years ago against the Revenue Commissioners, all they need do would be to refer to the Drainage Act and say: &ldquo;Collect the money; he owes it to us.&rdquo;  I would have no redress.  The Drainage Commissioners are not only to be debt collectors for the Revenue Commissioners but for the Land Commission and any other Department of State. They are going to have a fine job.  I cannot argue the section without losing my temper.  I am going to vote against it if nobody else challenges a division.</P>

Assuming that as a result of arbitration it was decided that this man should get compensation to the extent of £50, £100 or £200, is it seriously suggested that the State Department should hand that money to that man without having regard to whether or not his annuities had been paid?

As far as I am concerned, I would agree to it in so far as arrears of annuities in respect of land are concerned, but I would not agree to give power to collect in behalf of other Ministries in connection with transactions that have nothing, good, bad or indifferent, to do with the particular thing you aim to do here.</P>

      <P>Is the section so unusual?  I remember a case that came to my notice some years ago where an applicant was awarded compensation under the Damage to Property Act, 1934.  That person owed money to the National Health Insurance for stamps that he had failed to put on his employee's card.  The amount was deducted from the compensation he was awarded by the Department of Local Government.  Evidently this procedure has been followed in other legislation.</P>

      <P>Supposing it is due to the Land Commission, we are not objecting to that, even if the Parliamentary Secretary accepts the amendment, but in the case of money due to the Revenue Commissioners, the Revenue Commissioners are going to decide whether the debt is due or not, and no one else.  That is the position. The individual might be disputing the amount but, whether he disputes it or not, the Revenue Commissioners can inform the Drainage Commissioners that the amount is due, and the Drainage Commissioners deduct it.</P>

We are anxious to ensure that the individual's rights are safeguarded and they are not safeguarded under this section.  It is not an unreasonable attitude.  In the case of money due to the Land Commission it is not unreasonable to deduct the debt from any compensation that is payable because the amount could scarcely be disputed, but, obviously, it could be disputed in the case of money due to the Revenue Commissioners and if the matter had been lying there it is more than likely it is in dispute.  In this section, the Revenue Commissioners can simply inform the Drainage Commissioners that the amount should be deducted.</P>

      <P>I am in entire agreement with the Parliamentary Secretary in the case he put where work might be done on a particular land in respect of which land annuities were due, which ought to be collected or deducted from any compensation grant.  I think Deputy Hughes is of the same opinion.  That is definitely just one transaction, but we all know that from time to time there are disputes between the Revenue Commissioners and various individuals, or groups of individuals, and such a dispute might be in course of negotiation. Is it suggested that if compensation were payable to such an individual, the Board of Works should become the collector for the Revenue Commissioners? The Parliamentary Secretary would be well advised to accept the amendment. It gives him ample powers and the ultimate result would be that he would get his money.</P>

I challenged the Parliamentary Secretary on the last section to tell me one Act, apart from the Land Act, in which that section appeared, but in this case I know that every Act of the Dáil&mdash;Agricultural Acts, Compensation for Criminal Injury Acts and so on&mdash;had this section in it.  In every case where the State pays compensation, there is a similar provision and this section is lifted exactly out of every Act under which the State pays any compensation for the acquisition of land, damage to property or in any other respect.  All the agricultural Acts contain this section and I think the Opposition are unreasonable in suggesting that it should not be embodied here.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not satisfied with the section inasmuch as there was a possibility that injustice could be done to a landholder and, as a result of discussions that took place, these amendments were designed to meet that case. The House may feel that the effort has not been successful, but I think these amendments will give us the power that we want and, at the same time, give it to us in such a way as to ensure that substantial injustice could not be done to any individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that it was my intention before the Parliamentary Secretary put down this group of amendments to oppose Section 48.  At the same time, I realised the necessity of getting after people who might be obstructing drainage being carried out. You might have some people who were anxious to carry out drainage works and an individual, who was not prepared to do anything about it, might intervene between that group of individuals and the outfall.  Therefore, it was necessary to take power to do something about it.  I agree that the amendments provide a pretty fair safeguard. This is the first time in two or three days that the Parliamentary Secretary has mentioned the word &ldquo;safeguard&rdquo; in its application to the individual.  He mentioned it now for the first time.  It is rather belated, but it is better late than never.  The only thing is that in amendment No. 135, paragraph (d), you leave it to the commissioners to decide the time, if an objection is disallowed.  The paragraph states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Whenever the commissioners disallow an objection, they shall amend the notice to which such objection relates by extending, for such period as they think proper, the period <Col N="896" /> specified in such notice for compliance therewith.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, to an arbitrator &mdash; I understand that.  What I am worried about is that you may possibly compel an individual to carry out work that should properly be carried out by the commissioners.  That is the only danger I see in the operation of the section.  I am all for compelling an individual to carry out work that should be carried out by him, but there is the danger that this section may be operated against an individual in relation to work that should be carried out by the commissioners.  That is what I do not like about it.  However, the amendment otherwise fairly meets the objection and it goes some way to protect the individual.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>When I saw the original section, it rather confused me and I was inclined to move its rejection. I am still more or less of the same opinion.  I felt the section was unnecessary and it might have made it incumbent on a small farmer to do work which would be difficult for him to do, work which should be included in the drainage scheme.  The Parliamentary Secretary has made some attempt to meet that; he has put it in a less objectionable way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another reason why I objected to the section.  I thought that the powers it contained were unnecessary <Col N="898" /> and that there was already machinery available for one landholder to make another do certain things. The Parliamentary Secretary and I were throwing bouquets at each other about our lack of knowledge of the law.  I confess I lack a knowledge of the law, but it is within my memory where a tenant farmer proceeded under the ordinary law against another tenant farmer for neglecting to clean his drain, thereby impeding the water supply.  He won in ordinary law and compelled the man to clean his drain. For that reason I thought the section was unnecessary.  I felt that if it was a big thing it should be included in the drainage scheme, and if it was a small thing the existing law was there to give a landowner power to compel others to clean the drains.</P>
    <P>I would have let it pass except for sub-section (2), paragraph (c), which says that if the objector is willing to give a written undertaking that he will allow at all reasonable times any occupier to come and clean his drains, he will be let off.  That might somewhat endanger a man's right under the ordinary law.  If the ordinary law is as I think it is, and as was ruled in the case I mentioned, I have the power of compelling a man who impedes the flow of water on my land by not draining his to remedy the position.  The Parliamentary Secretary puts in a sub-section which gives that man the right, if he gives an undertaking in writing to the commissioners that he will give me permission to do it myself, to be absolved.  If I have the right to compel him to do it, why should he get the right, by giving a written guarantee to the commissioners to permit me to do it, to be absolved?  You may be taking away a right one person has against another by that particular sub-section.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to look into the matter before the Report Stage.  I should not like to see any landholder debarred from the right he has under the existing law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Parliamentary Secretary's amendment has watered down the section too much.  I fear that under the section as it will read now, as Deputy Bennett pointed <Col N="899" /> out, in the case of a man who will not clean up his watercourse there is power given here to let the man upstream come along and clean it.  It is unfair to allow that to happen.  It would be better to leave the section as it was.  I saw no danger in the section as it was.  You have individuals in the country who will not do their part in cleaning up the watercourses, and, as a result, lands are damaged.  We all know of such cases.  Every one of us has a dozen such cases in mind.  We have similar individuals under the rural improvement scheme.  They will not allow the scheme to be carried out on a certain boreen or lane.  We will have similar people under this drainage legislation.  They are in existence already.  I am afraid that the section has been watered down to such an extent that it will not be effective. It will not have the effect desired.  As regards the individual's rights, no individual will be affected, except the crank who will not do his duty by his neighbour.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy is wrong there.  Paragraph (e) of this new sub-section contained in amendment No. 135, deals with a particular type of case&mdash;that of a man who has land on a hillside where there happens to be a stream at the foot of his land, along the lower end of his farm.  He may not be affected by that drain at all, as it is merely conveying the water from farms higher up.  It would <Col N="900" /> be unreasonable to expect that man to pay a lot of attention to that particular stream.  This amendment is to permit farmers higher up to go in on that man's land and clean up the stream which is merely passing along the lower end of his farm.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is why we must be careful with legislation of this kind.  The Parliamentary Secretary has said, for the first time in the last two or three days, that he is anxious to protect the individual's rights.  I am glad to see that he is alive to that necessity, and I am rather pleased that he saw fit to amend the section.  I think it fairly covers the point.  I hope he will accept the amendment further on, to the effect that the individual will not be held responsible for a drain that is an arterial drain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to look into that case, as I am not satisfied with it.  If a tenant has a right already to compel another tenant to do a certain thing, I do not think we should take that right away from him.  Deputy Allen and Deputy Hughes know what I mean.  In the case of the stream running through three or four farms, if one farmer fails to drain, the work of the others will be destroyed.  I am familiar with a case which went to court under the common law.  A man refused to clean his drain and the farmer further up, whose land was waterlogged and whose work was useless because the other man would not drain, took him into court and made him do it.  I am not a lawyer and cannot say whether the justice who decided the case was right or wrong in law; but, apparently, he had the right to compel the other man to do what he should have done willingly. Sub-section (2) gives that unreasonable man the right to say that, if he writes to the commissioners and gives an undertaking in writing to let the objector do it himself, they will absolve him.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I could ease the Deputy's mind by saying that, to the <Col N="901" /> extent the law gives the power he desires, those powers will still remain when this Bill becomes an Act.  He is right in saying that, in certain cases, the power existed for one farmer to compel another to do certain things; but the unfortunate point is, was, and will be in the future, I suppose, that many farmers do not want to incur displeasure by taking their neighbours into court to establish these rights. That fact is borne out by the Report of the Commission when, in dealing with this problem, it recommended that action should be taken.  We are following that recommendation and those of us who know the problem in our own way see the necessity for it.</P>
      <P>I disagree with Deputy Allen.  It is all right to go just far enough and, when you go far enough to meet a certain difficulty, there is no use in going further.  A cranky man has to live, too, and I would not like to go to the extent of heaping injustice upon him, just because he is a cranky man. All we are trying to provide is that his crankiness will not prevent his neighbours getting the relief to which they are entitled.  I can see, under the section as it existed&mdash;and I did see it, in fact, on the Second Reading&mdash;that there was a possibility that he could be called upon, in certain circumstances, to do a job of work which would be altogether unreasonable and which would confer no benefits at all upon himself, while it would bring substantial benefits to his neighbours.  I do not want to go that far, but I want to ensure that the neighbours will not be obstructed by him in going in upon his land, or, in the case of the county council or Special Employment Schemes Office, that they will not be prohibited from going in on his land, in order to relieve the obstruction that was causing hardship to the neighbours upstream.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bennett may rest assured that, even after we have done this, the law as it stood and to which he referred will be unchanged and the case cited will still be possible, if the necessity arises; and if any farmer is courageous enough to take his neighbour into court, he can still do so without let or hindrance.</P>

    <P>Notwithstanding anything contained <Col N="905" /> in the next preceding section of this Act it shall not be the responsibility of an occupier of land to restore, open up or generally put into effective condition or maintain an arterial drain and nothing contained in the said section shall relieve the commissioners or the county council, as the case may be, of such responsibility where a drainage scheme is in course of construction or maintenance under this Act.</P>
    <P>This amendment relates to Section 48.

      <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary will go back to the discussion on Section 4, or some of the earlier sections, he will find that it is provided that the commissioners can carry out a scheme of arterial drainage. That puts the responsibility on the commissioners to do that.  I am merely saying in this amendment that it is not the responsibility of an individual to do arterial drainage.  I am not concerned as to who defines this.  Why was not a definition given in the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Because it cannot be done.  There is no need to have any argument about it now.  This question was debated very fully earlier on the Committee Stage.  I then referred the House to the paragraph in the report of the Drainage Commission which dealt with this matter.  The Drainage Commission pointed out that much thought had been given to the matter by engineers and others who were interested, in an effort to define what an arterial drain was.  All of them threw up their hands and said that a definition of it was impossible.  In their report, the Drainage Commission recommended that the determination of drainage to be included in any scheme would have to be left to the engineers who were charged with the responsibility of designing a scheme.  I cannot improve on what was their best effort, nor can I improve on the best efforts of those who, even prior to the setting up of that commission, made similar efforts to solve the same problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>We are setting up a special drainage authority to carry out arterial drainage.  In Section 48 we are giving special powers to that drainage authority to compel an individual, in certain circumstances, to clean up drains.  I feel that the individual must be safeguarded, especially <Col N="907" /> when you are giving the use of the instrument that we find developed in Section 48.  I want to ensure that the individual will not be compelled to do work that belongs either to the local authority or to the commissioners.  I do not think it is necessary to define what an arterial drain is.  If the matter is disputed at any time the court will decide it, whether the particular drain in question is the responsibility of the local authority, the commissioners, or the individual, as the case may be.  The commissioners will have the duty and the responsibility of carrying out arterial drainage.</P>

      <P>On the Second Reading of the Bill I argued, in the case of a drainage scheme which was being carried out, that it could conceivably happen that a drain or a watercourse which needed repairs had been omitted from the scheme, and that it would be almost impossible for a small farmer to carry out that work if the responsibility were placed on him.  The object of the amendment is to prevent such a thing happening.  On the other hand, we do not want to go too far and say that if a little drain is left out of the scheme that the farmer concerned should not complete it.  But where a watercourse or a drain had been left out, the completion of which would involve heavy expense, it would be unreasonable to ask a farmer to do it.</P>

One can imagine all the controversy that would be aroused through the country if this amendment were inserted in the Bill.  There would be a controversy going on all the time as to what was an arterial drain, what was a watercourse, and so on.

    <P>(4)  The commissioners shall consider every observation sent to them by an objecting party within the time limited in that behalf by the next preceding sub-section of this section and may, if they so think proper in respect of any particular observation, cause an inspection to be made by one of their officers of the land owned or occupied by the objecting party who sent such observation and of the land specified in the originating representation to which such observation relates and of the existing <Col N="911" /> watercourse or the site of the proposed new watercourse (as the case may be) mentioned in such representation.</P>
    <P>(5)  If none of the objecting parties named in an originating representation sends to the commissioners, within the time limited in that behalf by such representation, any observation in regard to the claims made by such representation or if the commissioners, after considering all such observations sent to them within the said time and considering the report of their officer making such (if any) inspection as aforesaid in respect of such observations or any of them are satisfied that the work mentioned in such representation (with such additions, omissions, and variations (if any) as the commissioners may deem necessary or expedient) are essential for the improvement by drainage of the land specified in such representation, and that the money required to meet the cost of such work (with such additions, omissions, and variations as aforesaid) has been provided, and that no substantial injury or damage will be caused to any objecting party by the execution of such work (with such additions, omissions, and variations as aforesaid), it shall be lawful for the commissioners to make an order (in this section referred to as a compulsory drainage order) authorising the execution of the work mentioned in such representation by or on behalf of the Minister or the council (as the case may be) by whom such representation was made.</P>
    <P>(6)  As soon as may be after making a compulsory drainage order the commissioners shall&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  notify the Minister or the council (as the case may be) who made the originating representation pursuant to which such order was made of the making of such order, and</P>
    <P>(b)  serve personally or by post on every objecting party named in such originating representation a copy of such order sealed with the seal of the commissioners.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="912" /> (7)  A compulsory drainage order shall operate to empower the Minister or the council (as the case may be) who made the originating representation pursuant to which such order was made to enter by himself or themselves or his or their officers, servants, or agents upon the land specified in such representation (including land owned or occupied by objecting parties named in such representation) and there do by himself or themselves or his or their officers, servants, or agents all such things as may be necessary for the execution of the work mentioned in such order.</P>
    <P>(8)  No action or other proceeding for damages, compensation, or otherwise shall lie against a Minister of State or the council of a county or any of his or their officers, servants, or agents for or in respect of anything done by him or them or any of them in the execution of work authorised by or the exercise of a power conferred by a compulsory drainage order save only if and so far as it may be shown that such work was not executed or such power was not exercised in a reasonable and workmanlike manner.</P>
    <P>(9)  Every person who&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  wilfully obstructs a Minister of State or the council of a county or any of his or their officers, servants, or agents in the execution of work authorised by or the exercise of a power conferred by a compulsory drainage order, or</P>
    <P>(b)  pulls down, removes, or injures any work or any part of any work executed or in course of execution under a compulsory drainage order, or</P>
    <P>(c)  obstructs in any way the flow of water to, through, or from any work executed under a compulsory drainage order,</P>
    <P>shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding £50 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to both such fine and such imprisonment, <Col N="913" /> and shall also be liable, in the case of a continuing offence, to a fine not exceeding £5 for every day during which the offence is continued.</P>
    <P>Section 48 is somewhat limiting inasmuch as it only refers to drains and streams within a drainage district or entering a drainage district.  One can conceive many cases in which the obstruction might exist in a drain that was not in a district or immediately emptying into a district, and it is for the purpose of giving a local authority or a Department of State power to deal with an obstructor in that particular type of case that we propose this new section.</P>

The Deputy will realise that there could be small streams that would not contact a drainage district at all and Section 48 would not give us the power in such a case.  Therefore, this new Section 49 is necessary and it gives us more or less the same power to proceed against an individual or individuals who would be obstructing any work that might be found necessary.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (5) to delete paragraph (a), lines 42-44.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="915" /> I did not move amendment No. 143 although there is an objectionable feature in the section in regard to local authorities, but I consider it not unreasonable that they should have consultation with the commissioners and have plans approved.  I move amendment No. 144 because we find in the section&mdash;paragraph (a) of sub-section (5)&mdash;&ldquo;if such person is a local authority, such claim shall be referred to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, whose decision thereon shall be final.&rdquo;  Why on earth should the commissioners refuse to public authorities the right to arbitration? Why should the public authority expect to have a dispute between themselves and the commissioners referred to the Minister for Local Government from whom there shall be no appeal?</P>
    <P>I think the local authorities are having so much responsibility passed on to them that they should not be deprived of some of the functions of responsibility.  If they feel it necessary to construct any such bridge, having done so in consultation with the commissioners and having accepted plans approved by the commissioners, and if eventually there is any alleged default, the claim can only be referred to the Minister for Local Government. Why should local authorities be pilloried in this measure?  If that is a criterion of what will happen in future, I think it is a very poor look-out.  I see no justification for that clause, and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to delete paragraph (a) of sub-section (5) as being perfectly unjustifiable. I do not see any sound grounds for having it in the Bill at all.  I move to report progress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a question on the Order Paper to-day asking the Minister for External Affairs whether Dr. Masaryk, who is Deputy-Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs in Czecho-Slovakia, had been, on Government intervention, prevented from addressing a private meeting of the Irish Institute of International Affairs on Friday last at the Shelbourne Hotel, and if he would state the reason and the authority for such intervention. I added to that a question as to whether Press notices of the voidance of this meeting&mdash;to use a neutral term&mdash;had been suppressed by the Censor, and, if so, what was the reason for it.  Deputy James Larkin (Junior) had a question down in much <Col N="918" /> the same terms.  They were both answered at the same time.</P>
      <P>It was well known to the public here that this reputable statesman from a foreign country had come to this country and that he had spoken at Trinity College, Dublin, where the Taoiseach was on the same platform and that he had the felicity, not often accorded foreigners, of receiving from the Taoiseach the completely neutral remark&mdash;I am sure it was meant in a neutral spirit &mdash; that his country had suffered so cruelly in the war and that he, the Taoiseach, hoped that that country's agonies would soon be at an end.  It was quite right that the Taoiseach should make that statement to this very distinguished representative of a country which had suffered so cruelly, even though it came from a platform in Trinity College.</P>
      <P>The answer I got to my question as to why this gentleman who arrived here and spoke at Trinity College was not allowed to speak at a private meeting, at which no Press representative would be present, of citizens of this country, gathered under the auspices of the Irish Institute of International Affairs was in these terms:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is an obvious and well-recognised principle that when a Minister of the Government of one State is invited to address a group of citizens within the territory of another, the latter State's Government should be informed beforehand and afforded an opportunity of expressing its assent.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am told that that principle applies even in times of peace, but much more so in times of war.  I want to challenge that as a principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the question was put and replied to, I have searched my own library&mdash;I must admit that it contains mainly books on international law and this is a matter of international courtesy&mdash;and I took the opportunity of consulting a colleague who is particularly well versed in these matters, and who has what I regard as a better library on diplomatic procedure.  I find nowhere a statement of this as a principle.  The books I consulted are <Col N="919" /> the well-known books of Hall, Lawrence, Oppenheim, Wheaton and Brierly and the French book by Fauchille.  The book I had looked up by a colleague of mine was Satow on <i>Diplomatic Procedure.</i>  If there is a principle, I should like the Taoiseach, before this matter ends, to give us a reference to some standard work or document, and I should be very glad if he would add on to his reference, if he has any, to a standard work some statement of an example known to him of where this, which may possibly be a dry principle of diplomatic etiquette and courtesy, has been operated in similar circumstances.</P>
    <P>I am told that this principle applies in times of peace because it makes for the avoidance of possible domestic incidents, and then there follows a statement that it could never be said that the delivery of a lecture by a Minister of one State to a group of citizens in the territory of another was so much a matter of indifference to those responsible for the conduct of the latter State's foreign relations as to make it immaterial whether they were informed or consulted.  I am told that this matter was a question for the Government of the country concerned, acting on behalf of the Parliament and people, to say whether it was wise that such a lecture should be given.  Supplementaries indicated that the lecture was not cancelled on any decision as to whether the particular subject chosen was wise or unwise, but simply because the Government was not informed. A supplementary was put by Deputy Mulcahy to the Taoiseach:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Do I understand that the main exception taken is that the meeting was arranged without the Government's permission being asked?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and the reply was &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  The question of the wisdom or unwisdom of the lecture did not arise, at least as a foremost point.</P>
    <P>One would have thought that if, when a distinguished man of the type of Dr. Masaryk came here and a meeting had been arranged, there was any punctilio with regard to whether the Government were informed or not, it might have been waived for the <Col N="920" /> occasion and the institute told that it had happened this time, but they would be glad if another procedure were adopted in future; but notwithstanding that the lecture was arranged and the Minister was here and that he is a Minister of the type mentioned by the Taoiseach to-day, the meeting was cancelled. The particular way in which that Minister was described to-day was as a man of experience who would know what would be proper in a case like this, who, coming into a neutral State as the representative of a belligerent State, would know what would be proper.  It was said that he did not go beyond the bounds of what would be proper; but if he was a man of experience who would know what would be proper, one would imagine that his discretion might have been trusted in addressing less than 100 citizens in a private room in the Shelbourne Hotel with no Press present.  However, I am told that it is a matter of principle well recognised, and I should like to get a reference to this principle and some examples of where it was put into operation.</P>
    <P>I am told that this group which issued the invitation could scarcely have been ignorant of the correct procedure. May I give the House some indication of what that group does know as a result of its experience with the Department of External Affairs? A very well-known Pole, Count Balinski, did in fact lecture to the institute on two occasions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy now propose to bring in other matters?  If the Deputy wants to raise a question on each one of these, let him do it as a separate question.  Do not try to side-track this business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am bringing it in with a view to seeing whether the group could have been ignorant of the correct procedure; in other words, whether they were ever informed of the correct procedure.  Count Balinski lectured here twice and no objection was taken.  He lectured to the institute on two occasions and no objection was taken.  He intended to lecture here on a third occasion.  A member informed the secretary of the institute <Col N="921" /> that he expected to be in Dublin in January, 1943, and he was asked if he would lecture on a certain subject.  He then wrote that, when the Polish Embassy applied on his behalf to the High Commissioner's Office for permission to come here, they were requested not to make the application, as it could not be granted for the time being.</P>
      <P>Monsignor Kuchar, the representative of the Royal Yugo-Slav Government, agreed to lecture to the institute in the spring of 1942.  He had to abandon the lecture.  He later found a date fixed, and on the 19th January, 1943, he wired:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Cancel lecture; journey not considered necessary.  Letter follows.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>A letter did follow to the effect that</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A few days after I had wired asking you to cancel the lecture, I was informed by the competent place that everything was in order and I was free to go.  This permission stands now for the future and I have been promised every assistance.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The lecture was rearranged, and on May 25th, Monsignor Kuchar wired:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Lecture, June 10th, cancelled owing to obstacles independent of my good will.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>These are two instances.  The institute never asked people to come over here without a visa.  If there is a recognised principle in the background, surely it might have been stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A third case arose which gave a special opportunity for a statement of principle, if principle governs this matter.  That was when one of the best known Spaniards, Senor de Madariaga was invited to lecture here and agreed.  The meeting was fixed provisionally for June, 1943.  He applied to the High Commissioner's Office in London for a visa on March 20th, and he was told that the letter would be placed before Mr. Dulanty on his return.  On 15th April, no further response having come from the High Commissioner's Office, he wrote to the institute here and the institute, after some preliminaries, trying to find out what happened in London, eventually <Col N="922" /> on 30th May wrote to the Department of External Affairs in this country and the terms of the letter are worth noting:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The council of the institute have therefore instructed me to inquire of you whether or not there is an official objection to Senor de Madariaga's addressing the institute on this subject and at this time, and whether he is likely to have any difficulty in obtaining the necessary permit to visit this country.  I should be glad if you would inform me as soon as convenient, so that I may make the necessary arrangements with Señor de Madariaga.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Remember the dates.  On March 20th there was an application to the High Commissioner's Office and there was a reply that it would be put before Mr. Dulanty on his return.  No response having come, favourable or unfavourable, he applies to the institute here and on the 30th May they apply in respect of a lecture to be delivered on the 18th June about which information had been given to one branch of the Department of External Affairs in London on March 20th, and a letter comes three days before the lecture is to be delivered which says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I regret the delay in replying to your letter of the 30th May.  It was due to my absence from the office for some weeks.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I thought we were paying an assistant secretary in that Department.  If there is a principle well recognised and established, one would imagine that the assistant secretary could have written to say so instead of letting the secretary's absence from the office delay even this type of reply until three days before the lecture was to be delivered.  The letter went on:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There are difficulties about bringing foreigners into this country for the purpose of giving lectures, and it would perhaps be better to consult the Department before issuing invitations in future.  That is the normal usage in all countries in time of emergency, and, no doubt, it is solidly based on experience.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As I said, that came three days before <Col N="923" /> the lecture was to be delivered.  In the meantime the lecture had been called off.  No other communication on that matter was ever received from the Department of External Affairs.  I want that matter considered again. The lecture was arranged for the 18th June.  The institute knowing that the gentleman in order to come here had to get a visa, he applies to the High Commissioner's Office on March 20th. By April 15th he has got no reply.  I presume the matter was sent here and that the Department here were advised at some time between March 20th and 15th April.  In May a letter is addressed to the secretary and a variety of positive questions were put.</P>

      <P>I understand the usual division of the time allotted is 20 minutes and ten minutes.  The Taoiseach will get his full ten minutes and, if he wants to get any more, I have no objection to the House sitting a bit later.  Here is the point.  Notice is given on 20th March and the finish is that on the 15th June the institute are told there is a difficulty about bringing foreigners into this country for the purpose of giving lectures, and then we are told that it is the normal usage to approach the Department in time of emergency.  The questions that were put were not replied to: Is there any official objection to this gentleman's addressing the institute on this subject and at this time, and is he likely to have any difficulty in obtaining the necessary permit to visit this country?  The result of the institute's experience in respect of Monsignor Kuchar is that we are told that, for reasons he does not know anything about, he is asked not to come.  Then <Col N="924" /> he is told he can come, and then he is told he cannot come.  Count Balinski addresses the institute twice, but when he wants to come a third time, he is told: &ldquo;We do not think we will be able to let you come.&rdquo;  The situation as regards Señor de Madariaga is what I have mentioned.</P>

      <P>This question was raised in relation to the visit of Dr. Masaryk.  There are quite a number of details in connection with these others and if the Deputy wants to raise anything about any one of these&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I only want to raise one point.  I am raising, against interruptions, that are for an obvious purpose, one point: Were the group ignorant of the proper procedure?  Had they touch with the Department of External Affairs on such a number of occasions that they might have been told of it?  Have they been told of it? Further, I want to know is there a well-established principle, where it is laid down and where are the examples with regard to it?  I say that that correspondence indicates, so far as the institute were able to arrive at any conclusion, two things.  One, that if it is intended to bring in a foreigner from outside to address the country, naturally the Department must know of it because a visa must be requested, and on that the whole matter can be raised.  But I say that it is a reasonable interpretation of that letter from the Department of External Affairs that, once a person has got a visa for a special purpose, then there is no reason why the institute should approach the Department to know whether a further meeting could be arranged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any event, the situation is peculiar. Dr. Masaryk is allowed into this country.  He is allowed to visit Trinity College and to address a public meeting. He is allowed to speak on what may be regarded as a controversial topic, the small nations.  But, when the same gentleman on the occasion of that visit is asked to address a meeting where, by rule, the members of the Press are not to be present, where there is no publicity given, where he is to lecture on &ldquo;Czecho-Slovakia During and After the War&rdquo;, and <Col N="925" /> where the guests are limited to members of the institute or their friends, and admission is by ticket, only then apparently a matter of punctilio arises; if the Department are not consulted, then, whether the lecture is wise or unwise, the Department says: &ldquo;You must withdraw&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have listened in recent months to different people speaking about the post-war world.  In England there is an association called The Sword of the Spirit, which was established by the late Cardinal Hinsley, making for better world relations. At one of the recent conferences it was stated that the only way in which we can get better world relations is by getting to know each other and having frequent international conferences.  In October this year, President Roosevelt addressed the Foreign Policy Association, a private organisation of American citizens, and stated that the kind of world order which we, the peaceloving nations, must achieve must depend essentially on friendly human relations, acquaintance, and tolerance. We try to get more acquaintance, some appreciation of the problems of other countries.  Then, as a matter of punctilio, a bar is put on it.</P>
    <P>There is one small matter with regard to a private experience.  I must confess frankly my ignorance of this principle.  It never was operated against me, nor did I ever request its operation in connection with any matter on which I was invited to address people.  I have spoken in Ottawa and in New York.  I spoke frequently in England.  Some of these meetings were so obviously of an extempore kind that no permission could have been sought, and I never heard that any question was raised about it.  I have consulted colleagues who have experience in these matters, and some of whom have represented the State abroad.  I know that when they were our Ministers abroad they addressed many meetings and on no occasion did they know that this principle was either sought to be applied or in fact enforced with regard to any of them. I am anxious to find out where the principle comes from.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="926" /> The last matter is the censorship. Censorship is like the Cheshire cat. The Cheshire cat left a grin and the censorship leaves a bad odour.  Might I refer the Taoiseach to his remarks in September, 1939, when the censorship was being introduced?  What was to be censored was news and not views.  We have wandered a great deal from that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was informed to-day that the Government's attitude towards the address to be delivered to this Irish Institute was to be raised. Deputy McGilligan takes very good care to bring in a number of points, on which I have a very big file here giving details about each one&mdash;but I got no intimation that details of these other cases were to be raised.  If I did, perhaps there would be quite a different feeling, when I explained the circumstances, from that which Deputy McGilligan would like to prevail.</P>
      <P>I am not sorry that this matter has been raised.  It is well that the position of this body calling itself the Irish Institute of International Affairs, and the character of its activities, should be generally known.</P>
      <P>I am informed that this body was first set up in 1936, following a visit to this country of the Secretary of the Royal Institute of International Affairs in Britain.  The British Institute of International Affairs is, of course, well known.  It is a body which commands considerable respect and authority in Britain and other countries. It is a body founded by royal charter and the terms of its charter provide just those safeguards as regards the non-party political nature of its activity, and the objective character of its work and publications, which have given the British Institute the authority which it enjoys in the eyes of serious students of international affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No one, for example, could conceive of the British Institute participating in the politics of the day, or conducting propaganda against the foreign policy of the British Government in power.  Much less can one imagine the British Institute, without the knowledge of the British Government or the <Col N="927" /> Foreign Office, inviting members and officials of foreign Governments to come to London to attend meetings at which matters affecting the British foreign policy of the day would be discussed and speeches hostile to, or critical of that policy would be made.  If the British Institute did that sort of thing, it would soon lose the position which it holds to-day.  It would be regarded, and quite rightly so, as a focus of propaganda and as a body whose activities were harmful to British relations with other countries and to British interests generally.</P>
    <P>But, of course, the British Institute does not do anything of the kind.  In time of peace, its studies and publications are objective and authoritative as to statements of fact, carefully avoiding, in accordance with the charter, expressions of opinion on current international affairs.  In time of war, as is the position at present, the British Institute works in close association with, and indeed in certain respects under the actual control of the British Foreign Office.</P>
    <P>Now, let us turn to the so-called Irish Institute of International Affairs. I make the contrast between the two bodies for two reasons &mdash; firstly, because, as I say, the Irish Institute was set up following a visit of the Secretary of the British Institute in 1936, and, secondly, because owing to the circumstances and the similarity of the titles of the two bodies, people, and particularly foreigners, are apt to draw the conclusion&mdash;and in actual cases have drawn the conclusion&mdash;that the Irish Institute is a body of the same character and standing as its British counterpart&mdash;that it is a regularly constituted institute with objects similar to those of the Royal Institute of International Affairs; that official safeguards have been provided for the non-party political and objective character of its work similar to the safeguards provided in the royal charter in England; that if it does not work in actual association with the Department of External Affairs here as the British Institute works with the Foreign Office in London, at least that it is careful <Col N="928" /> not to place itself in a position of conflict with its own Government, and that, therefore, when it issues an invitation to a member of a foreign Government or foreign diplomat to address one of its meetings, the invitation can be accepted in the assurance that, when the person invited arrived in this country, he would find that his visit was known beforehand to the Irish Government and welcomed by it.</P>
    <P>It is well, as I have said, that the facts about this so-called Irish Institute of International Affairs should be known.  First of all, it is not a chartered body.  It has no kind of official recognition or approval.  Indeed, it has no legal existence whatever, and the title &ldquo;Irish Institute of International Affairs&rdquo; is simply self-assumed. Having no legal existence, it is subject to none of the legal safeguards with regard to the character of its activities which are provided in the case of the British Institute in its charter.  The charter and by-laws of the British Institute are published documents available to anyone who asks for them.</P>
    <P>The rules of the Irish Institute have not been published, if, indeed, it has any rules at all.  If the Irish Institute has imposed upon itself in its rules any restrictions as regards the objective character of its work and the non-political character of its proceedings, it has not abided by them.  I am satisfied beyond all doubt, from the information at my disposal, including complaints which I have received from members of the organisation itself, that, far from making the slightest effort to preserve the character which a body of this kind should have if it is to be of any public service, the Irish Institute has become a focus of propaganda devoted entirely to furthering and encouraging a particular point of view in relation to the present war.</P>
    <P>One would think that, however they might feel individually, those holding office in the institute would refrain, out of simple patriotism and regard for the democratically expressed wishes of our own people, from attacking this country's position in relation to the war in the presence of <Col N="929" /> foreigners.  There is enough misrepresentation of the policy of the Irish people in relation to the present conflict without vice-presidents of a body masquerading under a title which suggests that it is concerned with the objective and fact-finding study of international affairs, getting up in front of foreigners and providing ammunition for people abroad who wish to say that neutrality is a policy forced by the Irish Government on an unwilling people.</P>
    <P>If you have a body genuinely concerned with the study of international affairs, it is natural that from time to time it will wish to invite foreigners&mdash; members of foreign governments and foreign diplomats&mdash;to speak at its meetings.  Now, I am not arguing that an institute of that kind&mdash;provided always, of course, that it was properly organised&mdash;should be actually associated with the Foreign Office in the conduct of its work in peace time.  The arrangement in England at the moment is a temporary one and will hardly continue after the war.</P>
    <P>But it is quite a different question to have, in a war situation, a body using a title which gives a wholly misleading idea as to its status and the nature of its activities, going over the head of its own Government in a time of danger and without their knowledge or without any prior notification to them, issuing invitations to members of foreign governments and foreign officials asking them to come to this country and attend meetings at which speeches attacking the Government of this country and the policy adopted by the Irish people as a whole are made.</P>
    <P>That is precisely what this institute has made a practice of doing, and it is a practice which no Government worthy of the name would tolerate. Does any member of the House imagine for a moment that any reputable institute in, say, Britain or the United States or any other country would dream of doing such a thing, leaving their own Government to learn of the intended visits of distinguished foreigners to the country from report, or hearsay, and putting the visitors themselves in the position of arriving in this country only to find that the <Col N="930" /> Government had no knowledge or notice whatever of their coming.</P>
    <P>I am not talking of courtesy, I am talking about a well-regulated principle of public conduct.  The Deputy has asked me if I could give references.  It is not necessary to give references in regard to ordinary common decencies and ordinary common sense.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

      <P>The fact is&mdash;and the Deputy knows it and he was not fit to be in charge of the Department of External Affairs if he did not know it &mdash;that one must inform the Government of the country concerned.  So much is it so that, in order to make certain that that position would be made clear, there is a decree of the most democratic country in the world, namely, Switzerland, governing that. However, if the Deputy and the members of this so-called institute are not able to see the principle, I do not think that there is any use in my talking about it.</P>

      <P>If there is time, I will read the Swiss Decree which puts the position in a very clear way as far as that country is concerned.  I am talking about the well-recognised principle of public conduct.  No Government of any decently organised <Col N="931" /> State would tolerate being put in a position of being dependent on hearsay and report for knowledge of the intended visits of distinguished visitors to its shores and their public activities while in the country.</P>
      <P>The action of the institute in this regard has meant a succession of difficulties and embarrassment, positively harmful to our relations with other Governments and to the impression of this country which we would wish them to have.  Some of the cases which have arisen have been very regrettable indeed.  I do not intend to worry the House with details, but if an illustration is required it would be difficult to find a better example than the conduct of the institute in connection with the meeting which it held last week.</P>
      <P>To that meeting it invited a number of the foreign representatives here in Dublin.  The organisers of the meeting knew, of course, in advance that speeches were to be made criticising the decision of the Government out of which the present discussion has arisen, but, to my knowledge, the invitation to the foreign representatives stated the purpose of the meeting to be the discussion of the future of the institute.  Instead of that the foreign representatives who went there found themselves attending an organised protest against the action of the Government.</P>
      <P>Not only that, but the representatives of the Press not having been invited to the meeting, a report of the proceedings was supplied to the newspapers by the institute itself.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;having reported the speeches criticising the Government's decision, went on to say that the meeting was largely attended by the Diplomatic Corps, thereby, no doubt, intending to convey that the foreign representatives went there with foreknowledge of what was to take place and in sympathy with the object of the meeting.  No better example could be found of this body's sense of the public proprieties or of the mischievous effect of its activities on our external relations.  The professed object of this group is the study of external affairs.  Is there any decent citizen who thinks that our relations with other countries are improved by manoeuvres of that kind?</P>
      <P>Recently Senator Douglas who, with Mr. Donal O'Sullivan, Mr. Auchmuty and Mr. J. T. O'Farrell, is one of the leading lights of this organisation, said something about the refusal of the Government to recognise the right of anyone to study international affairs except themselves.  That is a statement false in every particular.  The more interest people take in external affairs the better we like it.  What we object to is the misuse of an organisation and a name to endeavour to bring the Government of its own country into contempt and to create embarrassment for it in external relations.</P>
      <P>If any Deputy in the House will read in the British Press, for example, what is being said about this meeting they will understand what type of mischief can be done.  The aim of this group was to present the Government with a <i>fait accompli</i> and put the Government in the position that they had either to submit to them and allow what they wished to take place or put themselves in the position in which they could be accused of discourtesy to a distinguished visitor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am charged with the responsibility for the conduct of the foreign relations of this State.  I find a body of this kind carrying on propaganda against the declared policy of the country in a time like this by using a self-assumed title, suggesting that it has a status which it does not possess at all, inviting members of foreign Governments and foreign diplomats over here without <Col N="933" /> the slightest reference to their own Government, thereby creating difficulties and most regrettable incidents between ourselves and other countries &mdash;it becomes my duty in such circumstances to make as plain as I possibly can the standing and character of this institute and the views which the Government here has formed of its activities.</P>
    <P>That is precisely what was done when the Institute's invitation to Dr. Masaryk was made known to me some days before the proposed meeting. The Deputy has tried to institute a contrast with Trinity College meeting. There is a contrast, that all the proper formalities were taken in the case of Trinity College.  These four or five gentlemen want to put themselves above the Government.  They think that they are the Government, notwithstanding the decision of the people.  As far as we are concerned, that is not a situation that is going to be calmly submitted to.  We made clear our official view of this organisation and expressed the wish that Dr. Masaryk should not accept the invitation to address it.  Dr. Masaryk adopted the course which I or any other member of the Irish Government would naturally have adopted if the positions had been interchanged and we were visiting Czechoslovakia.</P>
    <P>I need hardly say that we have the greatest possible respect for Dr. <Col N="934" /> Masaryk in this country.  It was a great pleasure to us to welcome him here, and I regret exceedingly that his visit should have been marred by this matter, which, but for the unfortunate course of conduct which the group controlling this institute have persistently chosen to pursue, need never have arisen at all.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the decree in Switzerland and, if the Chair will permit, I should like to read it.</P>
