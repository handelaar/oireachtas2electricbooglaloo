      <P>It is proposed to take item 3 on the Order Paper&mdash;Transport (No. 2) Bill, 1944, in Committee.  With regard to Private Deputies' motions, it will be in the recollection of the House that some time ago Deputy Norton asked for time for the Labourers Bill which has been on the Order Paper for a long time.  Would it be convenient for the House to agree to take the First and Second Reading of the Labourers Bill this evening?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite so.  I merely want to know if the decision on amendment No. 65 governs it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir; I move amendment No. 66:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (4), line 6, to delete the words &ldquo;two years&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;three months&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, when dealing with previous amendments moved by this Party, appeared to think that some of us on this side of the House are prejudiced against the directors and he appealed to those who might be so prejudiced to approach the consideration of the proposal contained in this section in a spirit of fairness.  It is in response to that kind of suggestion that we propose this amendment, limiting the expression &ldquo;the appointed period&rdquo; contained in the section to three months instead of two years.  It is with a certain amount of reluctance that I am putting forward this amendment but it is, at any rate, in response to the Minister's wish.  If I were certain, or if the Minister were to make it certain by the wording of Section 41 that it would be as easy for a worker who <Col N="2361" /> was dismissed from his employment or who was declared to be redundant as a result of the operation of this Act to secure compensation as it is for the directors, under this section, I would not say much more in opposition to the Minister's attitude.  It is being made exceptionally easy, by a clearly-worded section of this Bill, for directors who have been found guilty of incompetence to get compensation based on the fees they received during the previous two years and, in the case of one or two who are fortunate enough to be members of the board of directors of both companies, to get double compensation.</P>
    <P>Is there anything in Section 41 or any other section of the Bill affecting those who have been working an eight-hour day in the railways as against the directors, who might not work eight hours in a month, to show that a worker who would be declared redundant would get compensation in the same exceptionally easy manner?  If there is to be a spirit of fair play and justice I think it can be based only upon the willingness of the Minister to treat the workers, who have been in the service of the railway over a long period of years and who may lose their jobs, in the same fair and just manner as he proposes to treat the directors.  I think that is a fair argument.</P>
    <P>The persons for whom this generous measure of compensation is being provided have been found guilty of negligence. The proof of that is that on the 24th February, 1942, the directors were so incompetent that the Minister cancelled whatever powers they had previously held in connection with the administration of the railway service in this country, and put in their place one man having dictatorial powers. The men for whom this generous measure of compensation is being provided were found guilty of not acting in the public interest, were found guilty, I suppose, of not acting in the interests of the shareholders, and were certainly found guilty, in my opinion, of having by their incompetence endangered the means of livelihood of the thousands of men under their control in the Great Southern rail <Col N="2362" /> and road services.  It was due to their neglect, to put it mildly, that the railways were almost closed down in the early part of 1942, because, although there was powerful influence behind them, and although they carried bank guarantees in their pockets&mdash;three of the four were bank director&mdash;a reasonable supply of coal was not purchased at that period when, no matter what anyone may say to the contrary, it was possible for these directors, if they were doing their work, if they were safeguarding the public interest, to have purchased 1,000,000 tons of coal at £1 per ton.</P>
    <P>I am sure that is one of the reasons why this body of incompetent people were superseded by Mr. Reynolds on the 24th February, 1942.  It is not their fault that thousands of railwaymen are not walking about now idle. I daresay it was due to their encouragement that, at a particular period in the beginning of this year, the present chairman of the company threatened to suspend all existing agreements between the company and its employees and to put the workers on four days per week.  It is possibly due to their encouragement that many changes in the conditions of service have been brought about, to the disadvantage of the staff.  Up to a few months ago certain employees who were suffering from T.B. or nervous breakdown were given generous treatment. At any rate, they were given leave of absence under fairly decent conditions to enable them to recover so as to resume their duties.  Now, any employee who is certified to be suffering from T.B. or nervous breakdown gets a limited period of absence &mdash;six months&mdash;and is then fired out, thrown on the scrap heap.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment, bluntly, is that instead of getting two years' compensation for their proved incompetence, they should get three months' salary in lieu of notice, and that is more than they have given to the <Col N="2363" /> many hundreds of railwaymen who have lost their employment in the service of the railway company since 1924.</P>

      <P>I am surprised to learn that this amendment is seriously intended.  As it is, I can only say that I would prefer to delete the section altogether than to accept it.  I think the analogy between the proposals in this section relating to directors and the later proposals concerning other employees of the company is somewhat forced.  In the case of the other employees, we are proposing to provide, as a matter of law, that if they lose their employment they will be compensated by way of pension.  Any suggestions the Deputy has to make as to how that intention may be made more effective will be fully considered.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 67:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (1) and substitute the following two subsections:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) a person was, on the 1st day of July, 1944, an officer or servant of either dissolved company, and</P>
      <P>(b) that person has not, before the establishment date, become a pensioner or annuitant by reason of his service in that company, or voluntarily retired or been removed from the service of that company by reason of misconduct or incapacity, and</P>
      <P>(c) that person's office or situation is abolished directly and solely in anticipation of or as the result of the amalgamation effected by this Part, and</P>
      <P>(d) the abolition of the said office or situation is not shown by the company to have been caused by decrease of traffic, reduction of renewal or maintenance work, introduction of improved methods of working (other than methods which would not have been feasible for either dissolved company), closing of railway lines or other economic cause,</P>
      <P>he shall be paid by the company compensation calculated in the manner set out in the Fifth Schedule to this Act.</P>
      <P>(2) Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) a person was, on the 1st day of July, 1944, an officer or servant of either dissolved company, and</P>
      <P>(b) that person, by reason of the amalgamation effected by this Part, is transferred to the service of the Company, and</P>
      <P>(c) either&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i) by reason of such transfer and without his consent, that person suffers any direct pecuniary loss, or is in any worse position in respect of the conditions of his service as a whole (including tenure of office, remuneration, <Col N="2365" /> gratuities, superannuation, sick fund or any benefits or allowances of that dissolved company, whether obtaining legally or by customary practice and whether applicable to himself or his widow or children or other dependents) as compared with the conditions of service formerly obtaining with respect to him,</P>
    <P>or</P>
    <P>(ii) that person is required by the company to perform duties which are not analogous to or are an unreasonable addition to those which, as officer or servant of that dissolved company, he was liable to perform,</P>
    <P>he shall be entitled to be paid by the company compensation consisting of a lump sum of such amount as is reasonable.</P>
    <P>The proposal to alter the provisions of Section 41 arose partly out of the discussion on Second Reading, and partly out of consideration of various amendments submitted by Deputies since the Second Reading.  I am proposing to go a considerable way to meet the point of view put forward by Deputies, although I cannot undertake to meet all points contained in the amendments.  The changes proposed are: in the first place, the date in the original section to which objection was taken on Second Reading, beyond which the pay of compensation would not be operative, is being deleted.  No date is being substituted for it, so that any officer whose situation is abolished directly or solely as a result of the amalgamation at any time will be entitled to compensation calculated in the manner provided in the Fifth Schedule.  We are proposing to extend protection from the establishment date to the 1st July of the present year, and this ensures that compensation will be also payable to an officer whose employment is abolished in anticipation of the amalgamation to be effected by this measure.  We are putting on the company the obligation to show that the abolition of a person's employment was caused by any of the developments which would exempt the company <Col N="2366" /> from the obligation to pay compensation. It is proposed, if the company can show that abolition was caused by decrease of traffic, reduction of renewal or maintenance work, introduction of improved methods of working, other than methods which would not have been feasible except for the amalgamation or for other economic cause, that they will not be obliged to pay compensation.</P>
    <P>The words &ldquo;closing of branch lines&rdquo; are included in the amendment because, as I explained previously, the Act of 1933 provides compensation on similar terms for workers disemployed by reason of the closing of branch lines.  We are proposing also that any employee whose conditions of employment are altered, so as to involve him in direct pecuniary loss, or in some deterioration in his conditions of service as a whole, or any person who is required to perform duties which are not analogous to or are an unreasonable addition to those previously implied, will also be entitled to be paid compensation by way of a lump sum. In the event of disemployment arising from amalgamation the compensation will be paid by way of pension, and in the event of worsening of conditions, pecuniary loss or an unreasonable addition of duties, the compensation will be paid by way of a lump sum.</P>
    <P>I should say that the main difference between the proposals contained in the other amendments and that contained in the one I am moving, is that in some of the others it is contemplated that employees of the company will be entitled to compensation by way of pension if they lose their employment in any circumstances in the future other than for misconduct.  I am going to resist that.  That is an obligation which no other employer in the State has to meet.  It would give to employees of this transport organisation a security of tenure in their employment which no others, not even members of the Civil Service, have.  It would be unreasonable to impose on this organisation such an obligation.  I ask Deputies to bear in mind that we have a transport problem to solve.  It is not yet demonstrated that that problem <Col N="2367" /> can be solved.  We are setting up this organisation with what we believe to be adequate powers and adequate resources to solve that problem, if it can be done.  We must not proceed now as if all difficulties have been surmounted, and an organisation in existence which could provide public transport services adequate for the requirements of the country and profitable to itself, and so proceed as if we could saddle it with burdens which no other commercial enterprise in the country has to bear.  I would resist this obligation that absolute security of employment which employees have not got now, never had before, that no other employees have, and which would place an exceptional burden on the company which it undoubtedly would be unable to carry in circumstances in which a decline of traffic or economic causes would make impracticable to maintain the full employment which we hope successful working will enable it to afford.  I think I can say in respect of that one matter that I have by this amendment made every effort to meet the important points raised in any of the amendments.</P>

      <P>Section 41, which deals with the compensation of certain officers in the railway service, was one of the most objectionable issues in the Bill as first introduced.  These points are referred to in the amendments which I tabled.  I am glad to say that at least three of them&mdash;in amendments Nos. 70, 71 and 72&mdash;have been met by the Minister.  I should point out that, while appreciating how far the Minister has met the objections dealt with in the amendment he has tabled, I think he could very well go a little further, particularly in reference to &ldquo;other economic cause&rdquo;.  He has sufficient knowledge of the position to realise that numerous objections could be raised to these words.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the matter.</P>

      <P>As indicated by the Minister, there is a considerable measure of agreement between Deputies who put down a series of amendments and his amendment, but some of us have regard to a number <Col N="2368" /> of omissions that are of importance to the people we represent.  In the first place it is a little surprising to find that the Minister has not taken any steps formally to transfer employees of the company as was the case in the 1924 Act.</P>

      <P>There is another omission, those who find themselves in a worsened position.  The Minister makes provision for compensation of officers.  Is it quite clear that an individual is allowed to retire if not given a position analogous to the one he held in the company?  That was a concession conceded in an earlier Act, that a man was allowed to retire if he desired to do so.  The main burden of our complaints concerns the closing of branch lines and the words which are almost as vicious, &ldquo;other economic cause&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is aware that, even since last April, about 11 branch lines have been closed down and there is no great hope that a number of them will be reopened.  He is also aware that a very considerable mileage of road is involved and, as a result, a fairly heavy complement of staff.  It may be argued that the individual concerned is covered by Section 9 of the Railways Act 1933, so far as compensation arising out of closing of branch lines is concerned, but that is not so, because under the 1933 Act the company had to go before the Minister to get the necessary sanction for closing <Col N="2369" /> a line.  That is not so in this case, and branch lines to the number of about 11 have been closed, as I say, since April.</P>
    <P>The Minister's intention was stated on the Second Reading of the original Bill at column 2458 of the Official Debates, when he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The intention is that every worker who loses his employment through redundancy will get compensation and I can assure the House that there will be no attempt made on behalf of the board to evade that and if there is I assure the House I will remedy it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suggest that, so long as this clause stands, it would be impossible for the Minister to implement the undertaking he gave on that occasion.  There is then the matter of the other phrase, &ldquo;other economic cause&rdquo;.  That phrase found its way into the 1926 amending Act and gave rise to endless confusion in the courts, and disappointment to applicants for compensation who had to make their claims at that time.  In fact, as the Minister knows, one particular case, the famous Peat case, lasted ten days, the ten days being occupied by learned counsel in trying to get a definition of the phrase.  It was finally stated by the President of the High Court and Judge Davitt that the phrase defied classification.</P>
    <P>The Minister will, I think, agree with me when I say that the company will be amply covered so far as a decrease in tráffic is concerned.  If there is some economic cause, it will obviously reflect itself in a decrease in traffic, with consequent reactions in the matter of renewals and maintenance. That should be sufficient to obviate the necessity for introducing a mysterious phrase of this character which may mean nothing, but which will definitely cause confusion, as was the case on a previous occasion, and lead to considerable expense to applicants who have to go before the courts.  We appeal very strongly to the Minister in regard to these two points which represent the only fundamental difference between his amendments and ours.  We ask that he <Col N="2370" /> should give way on them and afford a measure of satisfaction to those on this side and to those whom we represent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he would resist any effort to secure compensation or pension for certain people who might eventually lose their employment, which loss of employment was not due to the working of the Act, because he said it would be giving to these workers rights which workers in private employment had not got. Suppose there is a diversion of traffic, as happened in days gone by, and men find, after a number of months or a few years, that employment on a particular line is reduced.  That diversion of traffic may be caused by people sending goods a different way.  Will it be possible for the directors to say that it is no fault of theirs and that the working of the line had become uneconomic because people with merchandise or cattle to send are sending them by another route?</P>
      <P>One must look on this great effort to deal with transport as the planting of a seed from which a great tree will grow.  If, in the course of time, one of its branches touches the type of person I refer to, will the Minister see to it that such people will not lose their employment without adequate compensation or pension, or that alternative employment will be provided on busier lines?  I suggest that the Minister should make a general statement that the Bill will not in any way worsen, now or at any time, the position of workers engaged in railway, canal or tram transport, without adequate compensation for their period of service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">

      <P>My purpose in putting down my amendment was to secure that any worker who was dismissed would be entitled to compensation, because, under the Bill as it stands, the directors will take advantage of the section on the plea that the disemployment arises from reasons other than amalgamation.  On the basis of the assurance which the Minister gave to the House that he would see that no worker was victimised, I suggest that my amendment would give protection <Col N="2371" /> to a worker against any attempt by the directors to take advantage of the section.  I also sought to secure that workers employed by companies which were absorbed by the new company would be entitled to pensions.  I think that is quite a reasonable suggestion. The directors may put forward the excuse that for other reasons, such as the improvement of a line or a change in the transport system, they have to disemploy large numbers of men, and the men will not be in a position to prove that their disemployment is the result of amalgamation and will not be entitled to compensation.  I feel that the Minister should implement the promise he made that no man will be victimised in any way by reason of the passing of this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support the appeal made by my colleague, Deputy M. O'Sullivan, with special reference to the menace to railway workers employed on branch lines.  I speak on behalf of the workers of a constituency where at least one branch line has recently been closed down and where rumours are rife at the moment as to the possibility of a number of branch lines being closed in the immediate future.  A proposal of this kind which will enable the company to escape liability for the disemployment of the people concerned would be an economic death sentence for these workers, a number of whom are becoming advanced in years.  I remember the aftermath of railway legislation in the past when tremendous confusion, disappointment and failure attended the efforts of railway workers to establish their claims because of loopholes which then existed.  I regret to find the Minister carrying over a very large number of these opportunities, judging by the proposals before us, to enable this powerful corporation to escape liability for disemployment in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that there is no alternative to the proposal that railway workers should be positively secured in their employment and that everybody in employment, other than those dismissed for misconduct, should have their rights protected and enshrined <Col N="2372" /> in this measure.  I urge the Minister, who has a very distinct recollection of, and who has expressed his views very strongly in the past in regard to, the aftermath of previous railway legislation to make special provision in this measure, and to do it in an ungrudging manner, so as to make sure that there will not be a new string of victims of disemployment to follow as a result of the operation of this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Everett quoted me as having said that it is our aim to ensure that no worker will lose as a result of the passing of this Bill.  That is precisely what our aim is.  But we must not try to extend that assurance beyond its obvious meaning.  Deputy O'Sullivan quoted an observation of mine concerning redundancy.  Clearly our obligation here is to ensure that nobody will lose as a result of the action we take here.  Here we are proposing to legislate for the amalgamation of two companies, and we have to ensure that nobody will lose as a result of that action.  But I suggest that that does not mean that we must guarantee to those who are in the employment of either company that no circumstance whatever will jeopardise their employment. That is a far wider assurance than I gave and a far wider assurance than I think we could give and would secure for these workers permanency of employment in all circumstances which no other class of worker has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Doyle referred to this phrase &ldquo;economic cause&rdquo; and Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned the difficulty which the court had in interpreting it.  If there is any difficulty in determining what constitutes an economic cause, it will react against the company.  The position is that we are placing on the company the obligation to pay compensation. In the ordinary case, the company will pay that compensation in accordance with the provisions of the Schedule, and it is only where there is a dispute between the company and the employee as to the applicability of the Act in the employee's case or in other circumstances that the question will come to arbitration.  Therefore, according to the phraseology of the amendment, the onus of proof is on <Col N="2373" /> the company and if there is, as I said, any difficulty in the matter of showing that there is an economic cause which resulted in the disemployment of the worker and not some other cause directly attributable to the Act, the difficulty will be the company's.  The worker does not have to prove the contrary; the burden of proof is upon the company.</P>
    <P>I could mention straight away two or three economic causes which would seem to me to be obvious.  Suppose that at some stage after the constitution of the company imports of petrol stopped or imports of coal stopped.  That would create an appalling situation for the company.  It might suspend their services altogether and create a situation in which they would have no revenue, and while I do not expect that that situation will arise and I hope it will not, it is clear that, if we are to face that situation with an obligation to pay compensation by way of pension calculated in accordance with the Schedule to the workers whose services could not be maintained, we would be just adding to the difficulties which the company would have to bear in such conditions.  If somebody invented a substitute for cement which would be cheaper and better than cement, the workers employed in the manufacture of cement would find their employment in jeopardy, if not terminated altogether.  That would be an economic cause affecting them.  However much we would like to do it, no one would seriously suggest that the very company which was employing these workers and whose business had been destroyed by that new invention should be put under a legal obligation to provide for all these employees by way of pension for the rest of their lives. That is why I think we must be reasonable in this matter and reason requires that we should ensure that, to the extent to which we take any action here which has a reaction on the employment or livelihoods of individuals, we will compensate them.  But if other economic causes outside our control, or circumstances such as those described in the amendment, operate to affect the employment of these workers, then that is a situation which <Col N="2374" /> will have to be dealt with by this company as other commercial enterprises deal with corresponding situations.</P>
    <P>I was not going to refer to this question of the right to retire because I felt it would arise more properly on amendment No. 74, an amendment which I have in my own mind described as an &ldquo;Article 10&rdquo;, because the proposal is to give transport workers rights more or less corresponding to those given to civil servants under Article 10 of the Treaty. I do not think we should attempt to do that.  There is nothing in the history of the operation of Article 10 of the Treaty which would recommend its application to the circumstances of this company.  Deputy O'Sullivan is wrong in assuming that the 1924 Act did give that right to the employees of the railway companies that were then amalgamated. The Act of 1924 gave the right to compensation to employees who voluntarily retired prior to the amalgamation, not subsequent to the amalgamation.  In order to appreciate why there is no similar provision here, it is necessary to bear in mind the different circumstances of the amalgamation that was effected then and that which is proposed here.  We are proposing to amalgamate two companies and each of these companies operates a transport service which is self-contained. It is only to a very limited extent that there is any overlapping of those services.  In 1924, 24 railway companies were amalgamated.  These companies operated overlapping and competing services and it was obvious that the amalgamation would create a large number of redundant officials because, in so far as there were five or six people at that time doing jobs for separate undertakings all of which would be amalgamated in one after the amalgamation, it was clear that there would be a great deal of redundancy and the obvious desire of those framing the legislation was to encourage as many as possible to retire before the amalgamation was effected so as to reduce the redundancy problem with which the new company would have to operate.</P>
    <P>That is not the position in which the <Col N="2375" /> new company will find itself.  On the contrary, we think it is undesirable that officers of the existing companies should be induced to retire.  There is no longer any such problem as existed in 1924 and the proposal which is contained in this later amendment to encourage the officers of the existing companies to retire on pension and then take other employment elsewhere is one which should be resisted because, in so lar as the services of these skilled workers or experienced workers may be required for the new company, they should be available to the new company. If they do not want to serve the new company, they are not entitled to be compensated by it because they prefer to cease work altogether or to take some other kind of employment that may be available to them.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan is also incorrect concerning the closing of branch lines. He must not comuse the closing on branch lines with the suspension of services on branch lines during the emergency and for reasons arising out of the emergency.  A branch line cannot be closed except in accordance with the provisions of the 1933 Act and, it closed under the provisions of that Act, the compensation sections of that Act come into operation.  By reason of a scarcity of coal, scheduled services were suspended on certain branch lines last year.  No employee of the company lost his employment on that account. The suspension of the scheduled services does not mean that the branch lines were closed, or that authority has been given to the company to keep them closed.  In fact, they are not closed, as special trains still operate on them for the transportation of cattle, grain or beet.  In any event, no authority has been given to the company to close these branch lines.  I that should happen, then the workers who may be disemployed by reason of the closing will be entitled to compensation in accordance with the provisions of the 1933 Act.</P>

      <P>The trouble is that, when members of the staff would be forced to apply for compensation, as the law will stand when this measure is in operation, they will have to refer to the Transport Act of 1944 and the Railways Acts of 1924 and 1933. We suggest the time has arrived for a codification of the compensation clauses, and I suggest they should be clearly set out in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is overlooking one important point.  This Bill will determine the law in relation to Córas Iompair Éireann.  The Railways Act of 1933 applied to all railways and, if we were to take that particular section out of the 1933 Act and put it into this Bill, the effect would be to give these rights only to the employees of Córas Iompair Éireann and deprive the employees of the Great Northern or the Donegal Railways of those rights.  The 1933 Act applies to all railway undertakings and it is necessary to keep the provision in that Act rather than put it into this measure.  The Deputy need have no doubt that the scope of the provision is ample.  He can forget about the 1924 Act&mdash;that ceases to be operative. The statutes to which the representatives of the railway workers will have to refer are this measure and the 1933 Act.  There is also the Road Transport Act, which affects road transport mainly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be there is some misunderstanding concerning the question of redundancy.  During the course of the year, when I had occasion to travel through the country, I met a large number of railway workers who formed deputations in different districts, and this question of their future security was one that they frequently raised; in fact, it was one they invariably raised, because it was obviously a matter which was worrying them greatly.  As put to me, it was in this form: &ldquo;As railway employees, we fear that railways may be of limited life; that, despite the faith which you may have in the possibility of making railways a profitable proposition, capable of maintaining the employment of railway workers, we cannot ignore the possibility that railways may disappear <Col N="2377" /> and that all the transport of the country will be carried on the roads.  We are anxious to secure, in such event, that the increased employment that will be given on road services will be availed of for the benefit of the railway workers whose employment may be terminated or diminished.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is not a matter we could provide for in legislation.  There might be, and clearly are, obvious difficulties in ensuring that railway workers, in the event of such a diminution of railway traffic as they fear, would be transferred automatically to road services, and clearly it is a question which would necessitate not merely very deep consideration, but I think, consultation with the representatives of the workers, because there are varying conditions of employment in the road and rail services, and it might be the cause of very considerable difficulty to determine the terms and circumstances under which a railway worker no longer needed for railway work would be transferred to road work in the employment of the same company.</P>
    <P>It is the desire of the Government and, I am sure, will be the desire of the company's management, to ensure that any variation in the forms of transport in use will result in the least possible dislocation of employment.  That was the argument advanced in favour of the 1933 Act, and that argument still holds good and is applicable to this measure.  The intention is to ensure that in a time in which transport developments are taking place, in which technical changes are almost bound to occur, that, by having all forms of public transport under the management of one company, we can ensure that such changes, if they develop, will have the least possible effect in the dislocation of the employment of individuals.  The intention is there to ensure that technical changes If they develop, will not necessarily result in the disemployment of workers on discarded methods.  The implementation of that intention will, I think require consultation between the company's management and the representatives of the railway workers and <Col N="2378" /> road workers, because there will be difficulties which will have to be resolved. I think those are the main points that have been mentioned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne referred to the possibility of a diversion of traffic.  I presume he had in mind the same idea as that to which I have referred&mdash;the possibility of one form of transport being less frequently utilised and another form being more frequently utilised. If that is so, the remarks I have made apply.  If the Deputy has in mind, however, that the economic development of one part of the country may be more rapid than that of another part, that towns where there are factories now may become less important industrially and other towns may become more important industrially, and that the flow of traffic over the company's system may become heavier for one area and lighter for another, there will be no difficulty in ensuring that the company will adjust the employment of its workers so as to minimise any disemployment that may result from that, and certainly to avoid a situation in which workers will become disemployed in one part of the system while new recruits are being taken on in another part.  I think the agreements which exist provide some safeguards against that possibility.</P>
    <P>I have gone as far in this amendment as it is desirable to go to meet all the points put forward and I think it would be unwise to go to the fuller extent suggested in a very wholehearted manner by Deputy Everett, whose proposals are that we should compensate every worker who loses employment, getting rid of arbitration and everything else, no matter what the case may be.  We should not go that far, and it would be unreasonable to expect that.  The only circumstance in which that situation could arise is one in which the ability of the company to pay compensation or provide better conditions for its workers would be at its minimum.</P>

      <P>When I was speaking on Transport Bill (No. 1) and arguing against the inclusion of the date, 1st July, 1945, as the date after which no compensation could be paid to persons <Col N="2379" /> who were retired and dismissed, the Minister answered me by saying that the redundancy, to whatever extent it would arise, would arise only amongst the ranks of the executive officers.  Is not that so?  The Minister, by arguing here to-day as he did at the commencement of his speech, puts up all those imaginary conditions which may create such a serious state of affairs for the company that, in certain circumstances cited by him, the company may not be able to pay compensation because they would not have any revenue.  Why did not the Minister put up that kind of argument as a justification for refusing to pay compensation to the directors?  The majority of the members of this House, by their votes on Section 40, have passed a section which, when it becomes law, will enable those directors who decide to retire to get a lump sum compensation amounting to thousands of pounds out of the pockets of the shareholders of the company, whether or not there is any petrol or coal available.</P>

      <P>At any rate, the Minister now quite clearly&mdash;I do not want to misrepresent him&mdash;gives the impression that in certain circumstances he could not agree to the compensation for the reasons quoted.  If we want to approach consideration of this matter on the basis of justice and fair play, there should not be one law for those who have enough of the world's goods and a different law for those who may lose their employment and be thrown on the scrap heap, people who&mdash;as, unfortunately, happened in the case of some of those who lost their employment <Col N="2380" /> before&mdash;may have to go to the labour exchange after having been refused compensation arising out of the words mentioned by the Minister.  The insistence of the Minister on maintaining those mysterious words in the present Bill is a thing which I cannot understand, and he has not explained it.  Two different cases, test cases if you like, were submitted on different dates to two distinguished members of the Bar who were then arbitrators under previous Railway Acts, and who are now distinguished members of judiciary.  On the same kind of argument put to the two different persons they gave two different decisions.  One test case was decided against the particular man, and, as a result, over 100 men who agreed that this test case applied to themselves lost the decision, and got no compensation.  On the meaning of the phrase &ldquo;other economic cause&rdquo; one judge, a judge of to-day, took one view, and another still more distinguished judge took another view.  Deputy the Lord Mayor referred to the Peat case, which was brought before a very high member of the judiciary in 1929, five years after the 1924 Act was passed.  It took ten days to have that case argued by the most distinguished lawyers in the land at the time.  Why should an ordinary railway worker who loses his employment and who is deprived of compensation by a decision of the board of directors be obliged to employ senior counsel to take part in an argument lasting for ten days?  Many of the men who lost their employment in the past, and men who may lose their employment in the future as a result of this section, may not be members of any union, and if they are not they will have to put up with the decision of the board of directors or the management and suffer the consequences.  I think we should make provision for persons of that kind.</P>

      <P>What does the Deputy suggest?  I am anxious to get this clear.  We say: This is the law, that if a person loses his employment as a result of the amalgamation he shall be paid by the company compensation calculated in accordance with this section.  That is the law&mdash;if a person loses his employment he shall be paid compensation.  That could not be more definite.  Could it?  We have, however, to deal with the possibility of a dispute arising.  The company may say to the individual: &ldquo;You did not lose your employment because of the amalgamation.  You lost your employment because you were inefficient, negligent, or neglectful of your duty, or for some other good cause we dismissed you.&rdquo;  The individual says: &ldquo;That is not true, and I want to dispute the case.&rdquo;  We provide, therefore, that if he wants to dispute the case he can go to an arbitrator. The arbitrator decides on the merits of the case.  If he decides that the company was wrong in refusing compensation, he can award costs against the company.  Could we go further than that?  Has the Deputy any proposal to make to improve that machinery?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the Minister know perfectly well from his personal knowledge of cases affecting constituents of his own, and arising out of the arguments before the arbitrator <Col N="2383" /> under the 1924 Act, that there are many men in his own constituency who have not the backing of the funds of a trade union organisation to bring a case before the arbitrator?  In any such case, will he undertake to insert provisions in this Bill which will enable a man who has no such funds at his disposal to have his case brought before the arbitrator, and to pay the costs?  Of course, he will not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If we offered to pay the costs in every case&mdash;and that is what the Deputy suggests&mdash;it would mean that, for the next 50 years, every man who, for any reason, was dismissed from the employment of this company would take his case before an arbitrator.  Why would he not?  It would cost him nothing.</P>

Why cannot the Minister, with the assistance of his able advisers, carry out that simple and reasonable request?</P>

      <P>I may be a duffer to a certain extent, but I have argued that point in this House in my own way on all these Bills that have been introduced since this House was established in 1922.  We have inserted in these Bills these mysterious words, which are only understandable to certain types of lawyers.  Every section of the Bill should be drafted in such a manner that every railwayman with an average education would understand what his rights were under the terms of the Bill, without having to go down to the Law Library, employing junior and senior counsel to get a reference to all these prehistoric Acts mentioned in the Bill&mdash;Acts passed in the British Parliament, as well as in this House since it was established.  Ordinary railwaymen who are plain citizens of this country should not be put to all this trouble and expense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No previous Acts are mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should prescribe for the workers in the same plain, understandable language as he is doing for the directors of the company. I am making that simple request; I hope I am not making it too late and that he will, before the next stage of the Bill, carry it out.  I am making the request to him, on behalf of a large body of organised railwaymen who do not want to be put to the trouble and expense of looking up the Acts of the British and Irish Parliaments <Col N="2385" /> in regard to the meaning of words of this kind.  I do not wish to delay the discussion in connection with this, but there is certainly a very serious difference between the amendment moved by the Minister and the amendment down in the name of Deputy M. O'Sullivan.  We could not under any circumstances agree to the Minister's amendment, so long as he insists upon including the words which have caused so many railwaymen such a lot of expense and which have cost some of them the loss of their jobs without any compensation.</P>
      <P>Surely the experience of the past is something to guide the Minister in his desire&mdash;and I assume it is a sincere desire&mdash;to see that no railwayman or transport worker will lose his employment after the coming into operation of this Bill, without some sound reason. He mentions the possibility of the cutting off of petrol or coal.  We are not arguing against his point of view in a matter of that kind.  I suppose that, if the services of the transport company had to be shut down indefinitely, for reasons of that kind, the House would have to meet specially to deal with the situation.  It would be a much bigger issue.  It would not be an issue affecting the rights of transport workers to compensation, but one affecting the whole community, and we would have a more serious matter to face than the issues now being discussed in connection with this amendment.</P>
      <P>The railway trade unions have, and have had, at their disposal in connection with the meaning of this section, the advice of the most important lawyers in the land; and it is the opinion of those senior lawyers&mdash;I assume that their opinion is as good as that of the legal advisers behind the Minister&mdash;that it is desirable that a section should be inserted in this Bill making it clear that the existing officers and servants of the two companies concerned should be transferred in legal form.  That was done under the Railways Act, 1924, where it is definitely laid down in the Third Schedule:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Every existing officer and servant shall, as from the date of amalgamation <Col N="2386" /> or absorption, become an officer or servant of the amalgamated company.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That provision was considered necessary in the 1924 Act, and it should be equally necessary in this Act and, in any case, there should be no doubt left in the mind of anybody as to what the legal position is or is to be.  I appeal to the Minister to realise that there is no big principle or issue involved.  I appeal to him to reconsider the point, especially in connection with the amendment moved by Deputy M. O'Sullivan.  The Minister has answered the point put to him by Deputy M. O'Sullivan concerning the closing down of branch lines.  Is he legally advised that branch lines cannot be closed down as the law stands, or as the Bill stands?  Can a branch line be closed down in normal times without a Ministerial Order?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said also that the onus of proof was on the company, whenever an application is brought before the arbitrator for compensation. Is the Minister not aware that it is difficult for the applicant, in a case of that kind, to answer the company's case, unless he is able to get hold of the necessary company documents for that purpose?  There is a further amendment dealing with that and perhaps the Minister will give that sympathetic consideration.  It has been found, as a result of experience in dealing with certain cases, that the applicant, when appearing before the arbitrator, failed to prove his case, simply because he had no authority to compel the company to produce documents that were essential for that purpose.  That is a very important point and, although it is not exactly contained in this amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If there is going to be no redundancy in normal times, except amongst the executive officers of the company, there is no use in having a lengthy argument as to whether these words should be retained in the Bill or cut out.</P>

      <P>For the information of the Deputy and for the information of his legal advisers, I wish to point out that Section 7 (2) of this Bill incorporates and makes part of this Bill Part V of the Railway Clauses Act, 1863.  Section 49 of that Act is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;All clerks, officers, and servants who at the time of amalgamation are in the employment of the dissolved company shall thereupon become clerks, officers or servants, as the case may be, of the amalgamated company, with the same rights and subject to the same obligations and incidents in respect of such employment as they would have had or been subject to as the clerks, officers or servants of the dissolved company...&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Of the Railways Clauses Act, 1863.  The Deputy said that the Railways Act of 1924 provided that existing officers and servants should be transferred and become officers and servants of the amalgamated company.  That was necessary because only officers and servants with more than five years' service were deemed to be existing officers and servants under that Act.  The Railways Act of 1924 did not provide for the transfer in that manner of officers and servants of less than five years' service.  It was necessary to make that special provision there. <Col N="2388" /> Under this Bill we provide for the transfer to the new company of all employees of the existing companies irrespective of length of service.</P>

      <P>I want to make another appeal to the Minister not to retain this term &ldquo;other economic causes&rdquo;.  The Minister has already given us an indication of how difficult it is to classify this particular term.  I would suggest that in his own amendment and in a similar amendment that we have down here he has a sufficient range of defences outside that term to ensure that the company's interests will be protected.  It is obvious that every member of the staff will feel so long as that phrase remains that there is an invitation to the company to use it arbitrarily in certain circumstances against members of the staff.  I cannot for the life of me see why the Minister is clinging so rigidly to that particular phrase.  To quote one instance <Col N="2389" /> he gave, he still has the phrase, a decrease in traffic which is a phrase&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A decrease in traffic is a decrease in the amount of business available to the company which is an entirely different thing from a decrease of the company's ability to take the traffic there.  We are providing for compensation for disemployment resulting from the amalgamation, not compensation for disemployment resulting from economic causes.  I cannot get a better phrase than that.  I did not say that it would be impossible to define it. What I said was that if it were defined, it would affect the company and not the worker.  I want to remind the House that this is not the 1924 Act and we are not amalgamating 26 railway companies here.  The redundancy arising from amalgamation in the case of this Bill will be insignificant in comparison with that which arose under the 1924 Act.</P>

      <P>To add at the end of sub-section (3) the words &ldquo;subject to and with the right of appeal to the High Court on any question of law.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Davin referred to this point before.  We had numerous cases arising under the previous Acts in which decisions were given on questions of fact which were against the interests of the men.  It is not quite clear in this case who the standing arbitrator is to be.  He is to be appointed by the President of the High Court.  He might be a junior barrister and certain decisions might be given on the facts, in the earlier cases, which might be bad law.  Cases of that kind did occur and we suggest that the men's interests should not be prejudiced and that, in test cases particularly, they should have a right of appeal on questions of law as distinguished from questions of fact.</P>

      <P>From the point of view of the workers, this is a most unwise proposal.  It is desirable that arbitration should be final.  If you give a right of appeal to the High Court, you open up a vista of litigation, with High Court costs being imposed on applicants who have been before the arbitrator. You cannot have a right of appeal on one side only.  Deputy Davin has already spoken of the cost of arbitration. If you give a right of appeal to the High Court, you will be adding to the cost and that right will, probably, be exercised as often by the company as by the workers.</P>

      <P>The proposal which is being put forward is, as the Minister knows, intended to enable test cases to be decided which may involve a large number of workers.  The Minister knows that such cases came before the arbitrators in the past and it was agreed that they involved a large number of persons.  If a test case is <Col N="2393" /> brought and is decided, that is the end of it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Davin's proposition amounts to this: We provide in the Bill that workers are entitled to compensation.  If it is held that a worker does not come within the provision, he can appeal to the arbitrator. The arbitrator decides against the worker.  I am then to legislate in his favour.  The undertaking I gave related to a Bill with a time-clause in it.

      <P>One of the root objections I have to the Bill is that the Minister appears as the overriding authority in so many sections and that he has the right to decide whether or not certain acts may be done or whether or not certain conditions are fulfilled.  In these cases, the people affected by the arbitration, either the company or the employees, or both, should, if they apply to the Chief Justice, be allowed to have arbitration, and it should not rest with the Minister to give his permission for an arbitrator to be appointed.  The Minister might decide in favour of the company when an employee might desire to have arbitration and, in that way, unfair discrimination would result against the employee.  If the proposed amendment were accepted, the persons concerned could apply to the Chief Justice and obtain arbitration.</P>

Sub-section (3) says: that if there is any dispute such dispute shall &ldquo;on the application of the company or such person be referred to the standing arbitrator....&rdquo;</P>

I can assure the Deputy that in normal, economic conditions, his wish will be realised, but I think that it would be completely impracticable to impose this ten years' condition on the company, because circumstances might arise under which it is quite conceivable that there might have to be a modification of the present arrangements with the trade union concerned, in order to secure some point which the trade union would regard as important, and if we were to impose such a condition as is suggested by the Deputy in this amendment, the company could not even enter into an arrangement with the trade union with a view to doing what the Deputy suggests here, within that period.

    </Speaker>
    <P>(5) Every superannuation scheme or amending superannuation scheme prepared and confirmed under this section shall contain provisions enabling the elected representatives of the employees contributing under such <Col N="2404" /> scheme to share equally with the representatives of the company in the management of the scheme and any superannuation fund to be established under such scheme.</P>
    <P>Since the members of the staff will be compelled to pay their contributions to this fund, it is obvious that they will have a serious interest in its administration. We have experience of funds of this character which have benefited by joint administration.  The staffs are anxious that the system of joint administration, which has been in operation for a long time, should be continued.  I do not see why the Minister should have any serious objection to that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a very serious objection to making this a legal obligation, and that is what arises here If a scheme is submitted to me for confirmation, and the trade unions, or any other parties, wish to make representations concerning it, their representations will be considered.  I am strongly opposed to making it a legal obligation that there shall be joint management of any such schemes. Reference may be made to the fact that we provided in the 1933 Act for such joint management.  I want to remind Deputies that the 1933 Act provided for a superannuation scheme which would be based upon the principle of equal contributions by the company and the workers.  The scheme which is being devised by the management of the Great Southern Railways Company, and which, presumably, will be the scheme that will be presented for confirmation under this Bill, does not embody the principle of equal contributions.  The contributions by the company will be very many times the contributions by the employees.  In fact, the cash contributions of the employees will be relatively nominal.  For all practical purpose, the benefits which will accrue under the scheme to the workers will take the form of an extension of ordinary remuneration.  I do not think it is necessary that we should make it a legal condition that there should be joint committees of management. I do not want to appear at the <Col N="2405" /> moment to be offering an opinion on that issue which would make it impossible for me to consider fairly any representations that may subsequently be made, but I certainly will resist strongly the attempt to get a decision on that issue now by making it a legal obligation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that the opinion just expressed by the Minister is not to be taken as a decision.  I deeply regret it because, so far as I know, every superannuation fund worthy of the name is based upon equal representation from the companies on the one side and the employees on the other.  I happen to be a member of a superannuation fund which has a membership of 48,000.  I believe it is one of the biggest funds of its kind in the world.  Its surplus funds at the present time amount to £20,000,000. All these superannuation funds, so far as I know, have statutory effect.  The statute provides for their administration, solvency and so forth. Of course, naturally, I am referring to funds that have the backing of British Acts.  We have had no funds of that kind established in this State or through the agency of any of the Railway or Transport Acts since the State was established. It is imperative, in my opinion, that there should be equal representation from the company's side and the employees' side if there is to be justice in the administration of a fund of this kind.  Cases come before the different superannuation fund committees where there is difference of opinion as to whether, for instance, contributing members should be retired on disability pension.  There is one medical view put forward by the management side and another view put forward on behalf of the contributing members. The decision of a medical arbitrator is finally taken.  If all the facts surrounding the circumstances of peculiar types of cases are to be fairly decided, I think the Minister will agree that the representatives of the contributing members can give useful information which might never be brought out if they had not representation on the management of the fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this Bill you will be asked to give <Col N="2406" /> statutory authority for the framing of a fund which has been recently brought into operation in the Great Southern Railways.  I refuse to acknowledge that particular scheme as a superannuation scheme.  I can only describe it, as I have described it in a previous discussion, as an insurance scheme which, strange to say, can be terminated by the action of the company's side without consultation of any kind with the contributing members.</P>
    <P>The Minister made some point&mdash;I do not think it is a very serious point&mdash; that the contributing members, that is; the employees who will come under this particular scheme will not be paying a sum equal to that payable by the management side.  That may be so, so far as certain aspects of the scheme are concerned, but that should not be used as an argument to deprive the members of the staff, who will be compelled as a condition of service to join this fund, of representation.  This scheme came into operation without previous consultation with anyone except persons described as rank and file members of the Great Southern Railways Company staff.  When these selected members of the rank and file staff appeared before the present chairman and when one of them mentioned about consulting the trades unions representing the organised railway workers, he was told that he, the chairman, did not want to hear anything regarding the opinion of the trades unions or the leaders of the organised railway workers in a matter of this kind.  I hope he will change his mind on that matter.  I think he has heard some people recently&mdash;I have good authority for stating this&mdash;who helped him to change his mind, for very good reasons given.</P>
    <P>I know, for instance, that the chairman of the company on a recent occasion met the representatives of what is known as the Old Dublin South-Eastern Friendly Society.  As a result of his decision, given without consultation, to wind up that particular society, there was a meeting of those concerned&mdash;800 or so&mdash;and there was a strong objection taken to the chairman's decision to compel them to wind up the society.  Eventually, the chairman was good enough to meet the management committee of that <Col N="2407" /> society.  I have this from a man who was present, who is an old railway friend of mine.  It was proved to the satisfaction of the chairman that if he insisted upon retaining the conditions contained in that particular document, which was brought into operation on the 1st August, in a very hurried way, that a large number of members of the Old Dublin South-Eastern Friendly Society would actually lose as much as 7/6 per week and some of them would lose 5/6 per week.  After hearing the deputation, the chairman admitted that he was glad he had met them, that they had given him information of which he had not been previously put in possession&mdash;for what reason I do not know&mdash;and he promised, as a result of what he had heard, to after the figures contained in the scheme and to make other alterations which, at any rate, would not worsen the existing conditions of the members of that society.  What I have stated cannot be challenged, I am sure.  I mention it so that it may help to impress upon the Minister the necessity for consultation with the employees or with the elected representatives of the contributing members or existing workers in the particular society.</P>
    <P>I would regard it as a most undesirable thing that the chairman of the company or the management of the company would refuse to admit the right of the contributing members to a share in the management of this fund.  Cases can arise, and have arisen in the past in most of these funds, where only one side of the case is stated.  I can cite for the Minister a matter that was brought under my notice in the last couple of weeks. Prior to the coming into operation of the present management, whenever a member of the staff&mdash;it is the clerical staff I am speaking of now&mdash;was certified to be suffering from T.B. or nervous breakdown, every conceivable consideration and assistance was given to enable such person to recover and to resume duty.  Now there is a new order brought into operation whereby, at the end of 26 weeks, a person who was certified by the medical officer of the <Col N="2408" /> company to be suffering from T.B. or nervous breakdown must get out of the service.  That is a thing that does not exist in any other railway company or in respect of any contributing member to any other superannuation fund that I know of.</P>
    <P>About ten years ago a colleague of mine had to leave off work owing to failing eyesight.  He was regarded as a serious case.  He was sent to an eye specialist and an operation was performed. After a year and three months, during which period he received his full salary from the company, he resumed work and, in the last few months, retired with full pension at the age of 65.  I appeal to the Minister to use his influence with the management of the company to ensure that in future, at any rate, they will try to do for the members of the staff of the new company what is being done for the members of the staffs of other companies in similar cases.  I do not know why this change was made.  I think it must have been made on bad advice, without a desire to do anything unfair to the staff concerned.</P>
    <P>If there were joint consultation before schemes of this kind were framed and before serious decisions of this kind were arrived at&mdash;and such consultation would be possible if there were joint representation on the management of the fund&mdash;I think such decisions would not be taken.  They would not be taken in a light-hearted way and they would not be taken without consideration of the serious consequences to the individuals concerned. I am sure there is no desire on the part of the present chairman of the Great Southern Railways Company to worsen the conditions of the contributing members to the superannuation funds.  I accept the statement from the Minister that it is his desire and the desire of his nominee on the board to improve the conditions.</P>
    <P>If all the facts of peculiar cases are to be taken into consideration, and if there is to be justice and fair play in the decisions given, the point of view of contributing members to funds of this kind will have to be taken into consideration.  The only way to do that is to hear the point of view of <Col N="2409" /> the other person.  I have been long enough connected with railways and associated with colleagues from other railways to know that if you want to get at the management with regard to particular types of cases, it is often difficult to get to the man at the top. I was for a number of years a member of the advisory committee of the London and North Western Railway Superannuation Fund, which subsequently became the L.M.S., and I have experience of cases of that kind. If you want to have goodwill and fair decisions in exceptional types of cases the method by which they can be dealt with is by having the collective wisdom of representatives of the management and of contributing members. Our intervention on this Bill, as well as the amendments that were put down, was solely for the purpose of making it a better Bill.  The desire is to make it possible on 1st January, 1945, to have the best of goodwill established on the date on which will come into operation the biggest transport scheme ever submitted in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>On reading the Bill it strikes me that what the Minister put into various sub-sections would lead everybody to believe that this scheme would be a success.  We must take notice of what the Minister said, that the contributions of the company will be three or four times greater than the employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case I do not think Deputy Davin can argue that there should be equal representation of employees and employers.  Of course the contributions which amount to more than five times those of employees will be contributed by the public.  If the Minister would agree to give representation on the basis of contributions, possibly that might meet Deputy Davin's wishes, as there would be representation of employees. I take it that the Minister has something like that in mind, although that does not appear to be so from the wording of the section.  I cannot imagine the company's representatives <Col N="2410" /> adjudicating on any matter that comes before them without having the advice of some of the employees.  While the representation might not be equal I suggest that there should be some representation on behalf of the employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the House that we should not decide this issue now.  As I understand, Deputy Davin and his colleagues wish to provide that there will be a joint committee which will ensure equal representation between the management and the employees of the company.  As I understand, the company contend that a joint committee of management of that nature is a device associated with funds based on equal contributions, and would not be appropriate to this scheme.  I am asking the House to reject the amendment to avoid a decision on that issue.  I am assuming that that issue will arise on representations made under amendment No. 86, which is being incorporated in the Bill. Deputies will understand the difficulty of discussing the matter at this stage without appearing to prejudice the decision that will be then given.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In the discussion on the Second Reading it became clear that it was necessary to amend the definition of existing superannuation fund to include existing schemes which were established by the dissolved company and certain other schemes.  These funds are continued by sub-section (2) of this section and are subject to amendments which will be moved which will provide that the company may cease to contribute to the Railway Clearing System Superannuation Fund.  I assume that Deputies will want to discuss this question and the position of the company in relation to the Railway Clearing <Col N="2412" /> System Superannuation Fund.  It might be done most effectively on amendments Nos. 92 or 97.  The effect of this amendment is to make it clear that the definition of existing superannuation funds is not merely confined to funds of the dissolved companies but to funds established by companies which were absorbed in the Great Southern Railways in 1924.</P>

      <P>(a) the company shall submit to the Minister within one month after the establishment date the scheme relating to such fund;</P>
      <P>(b) the Minister may refer the scheme back to the company for reconsideration and fresh submission or by order confirm the scheme either without modification or with such modifications (whether by way of addition, omission or variation) as the Minister thinks proper;</P>

      <P>(d) the scheme shall, if not so confirmed within three months after the establishment date, cease to be in force but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.</P>
      <P>This amendment requires the company to submit for confirmation as a new scheme the scheme which was devised and brought into operation this year. The effect, therefore, is to bring the scheme within the definition of a new scheme and make operative the previous amendment which entitles all parties to make representations prior to the confirmation of the scheme.</P>

We are dealing with that situation by this amendment which requires that any scheme brought into operation in 1944 will be submitted for confirmation in the same manner as a new scheme would have to be submitted for confirmation, and it therefore makes operative the provision which entitles all parties to be heard by the Minister in connection with the scheme before he confirms it.</P>

      <P>This scheme which the Minister has in mind was published for the first time some time about the middle of June and all the employees were obliged, at very short notice and without getting reasonable time to consult legal advice, to indicate their willingness to participate in it.  I am glad the Minister has brought in the amendment, so that the scheme will have to conform to the conditions in operation at the time it was issued, so far as confirmation is concerned. I am personally very glad to hear that this scheme which came into operation on August 1st is being made retrospective in some cases I know of <Col N="2414" /> to 1st March last, but I appeal to the Minister to use his good offices with the chairman to make it retrospective to an earlier date.</P>

      <P>The Minister has this function, that he can use his good offices, if he so desires, for the purpose of seeing that justice is meted out to all those entitled to consideration under the terms of the scheme.  This peculiar position will arise, that a man who retires next week will get 37/6 per week under the scheme, because it is in operation at the end of next week so far as he is concerned, while a man in a similar position on the same section of the system will get 19/10 per week.  I wonder why 19/10 was fixed for a man with 46 years' service with the company in the City of Dublin.  I inquired whether the 2d. deduction was to cover postage on his weekly amount.</P>

However, when the Minister does come to consider it and to give his decision, might I appeal to him to try to have it made retrospective to a date earlier than 1st March of this year?  It would not be unreasonable, if he desires to <Col N="2415" /> cover very exceptional cases, that it should come into operation as from the date the chairman was appointed by the Minister, 24th February, 1942, if the funds available for the scheme can bear such a strain.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 93:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of sub-section (4) the following words:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Provided, however, that notwithstanding that the dissolved railway company was not an assenting contributing body to the reorganisation which came into operation upon the first day of July, 1941, of the Railway Clearing System Superannuation Fund Corporation all persons who were officers or servants of the dissolved railway company and who were and are members of the Railway Clearing System Superannuation Fund and all female clerical employees <Col N="2416" /> of the dissolved railway company shall be entitled to and shall receive the same benefits, rights and privileges as they would have been or might have become entitled to if the dissolved railway company had become and been an assenting contributing body and had fulfilled all the legal and customary requirements of an assenting contributing body to the said reorganisation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister will recall that on a previous occasion I gave, as well as I possibly could, the history of this fund.  It has been in operation for roughly 70 years.  It was originally confined to the British Railway Clearing House, but it extended to the Irish Railway Clearing House and we have been contributing to it for a period of roughly 60 years.  As a matter of interest, arising out of discussion of a previous amendment, the fund is managed by a joint committee of management, composed of six representatives of the staff and six representatives of the various companies.</P>
    <P>The funds of this corporation have undoubtedly been very wisely invested, but it has not been found possible to give to the staffs the form of pensions they desired, particularly in later years, and an agitation has been going on for some considerable time for an improvement in the pensions.  The low pensions derivable from the fund were based on low rates of contributions and, of course, very low scales of salaries.  That position was improved in 1919, and in later years it was found possible to reorganise the fund so that, in July, 1941, a new scheme of benefits came into operation. All the companies in Ireland, including the Irish Railway Clearing House assented to the increased contributions necessary to obtain the new benefits, with the exception of the Great Southern Railways.  They have been dissenters for the past two years.</P>
    <P>Arising out of that position, the Minister in the last Dáil did undertake to ensure that, notwithstanding that dissent of the company, none of the people concerned, to the number of roughly 1,400, would lose in any way whatever and the matter was also <Col N="2417" /> referred to in a statement by the chairman previously.  The position at present is that these 1,400 people, until we get some assurance on this amendment, have no guarantee that they will get the benefits which their colleagues in the city on other railways have been enjoying since 1941.  The Minister has not put down an amendment and I take it that, in view of his assurance, he has left it to us to put forward a suitable amendment.  It is because of that that we have tabled this in such a careful manner as to leave the Minister no option, shall I say, but to accede to it&mdash;at least we hope so.</P>
    <P>So far as the fund is concerned, there may be objections, of course, from the point of view of the company to assenting to go into that fund on the ground that its headquarters are outside this country.  I indicated on the last occasion that there were means by which the money to the credit of the staffs here could be taken over here, but only if a certain condition had been fulfilled and that is, that the committee of management of that fund would be satisfied that in the new fund to be set up benefits would be given to the staffs not less favourable than those in the reorganised scheme of 1941.  As I understand the position, the company would appear to favour the setting up of a new fund and, very possibly, steps will be taken in constitutional form to satisfy the management committee of the Clearing House Fund that they are setting up that type of fund.  That, of course, is a matter of detail.</P>
    <P>What we are aiming at here is to ensure that the people concerned, roughly numbering 1,400, will be given the guarantee of the Minister and this House that this superannuation fund to be set up will have the sanction of the Minister and the backing of this House and will guarantee to the members benefits no less than those operating under the revised scheme of 1941, and that that should include the lady clerks of the Great Southern Railways, because in the revision that took place the lady clerks of that company were admitted to the fund and were allowed to back-date their membership, provided <Col N="2418" /> their age did not exceed 50, on certain favourable terms.  Therefore, we are including the lady clerks&mdash;they are a comparatively small number by the way&mdash;because if the revision took place in 1941, the lady clerks would automatically have been included, and we suggest that that should be done.  I feel that there will not be any objection on the part of the Minister to acknowledge that principle&mdash; that the section of the staff to which I have referred and who are covered in this particular fund will have his guarantee and the guarantee of the House along the lines I have suggested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan is aware that I am proposing to move a later amendment, amendment No. 97, which will provide that, notwithstanding anything contained in this section, the company may, if it so thinks fit, at any time cease to contribute to the Railway Clearing System Superannuation Fund.  I think Deputy Doyle has an amendment on the Paper with a completely opposite effect.  I am of the opinion that it is desirable that the company should withdraw from the Railway Clearing System Superannuation Fund.  I want to make it clear that that view is subject to what I have already said, that arrangements are made to secure for the clerical staff of the company benefits as good as those which they would have received if the company had been an assenting member in respect of the recent increase in contributions.  I understand that the position is that the company can withdraw from the fund, but unless there is a joint approach by the company and its employees and the consent of the management committee there is a prospect that the company may lose the contributions paid by it into the fund.  The employees are entitled on such withdrawal to get their contributions back; the company is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assume it will be practicable to get a joint approach to the management committee and the assent of the committee to the withdrawal of the company from the fund on satisfactory terms.  Deputy O'Sullivan tells me <Col N="2419" /> that the management committee will require to be satisfied that arrangements have been made to ensure that the employees of the company will get equally satisfactory benefits.  If and when new arrangements are made and a new scheme devised, it will have to be submitted, under the terms of the Bill, for confirmation, and it will be my duty to ensure that the undertaking I gave will be implemented.  I think the scheme will be such as to ensure that the employees of the company will not have lost by reason of the change.  I would resist entirely the suggestion of Deputy Doyle which is, I understand, that the company must remain a contributing member of the fund.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Eamonn O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That amendment is out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I need not refer to it.  In fact, I am not sure that it is desirable that the company should remain a member of the English Railway Clearing House.  It is by reason of membership of the English Railway Clearing House that it can participate in the superannuation fund.  It seems to me that that is an anachronism arising out of the period of union and that the membership of an Irish railway company in that British Railway Clearing House is no longer necessary or desirable.  The withdrawal from membership of the English Railway Clearing House will disqualify the company from being a member of the superannuation fund, in any event. That view, although I think it should be expressed, does not affect the position, because the main issue that arises here is the steps to be taken to ensure the introduction of a new scheme that will obtain for the clerical staff of the company benefits as satisfactory as they would get from the Railway Clearing System Superannuation Fund if the company had been an assenting member in the sense described in the amendment.  I do not want to go into that at any length.  I understand that steps are being taken to get a joint approach to the management committee of the fund and, if that approach is successful, I understand <Col N="2420" /> that a scheme will be submitted to me for confirmation under the Bill.  I can undertake that, at that stage, I will not merely consider any representations which may be made by interested parties, but be personally concerned to ensure that the undertaking I gave on the Second Reading will be fully carried out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Discussion on the last occasion arose out of the effect on the clerical staff of the refusal of the company to assent to the change of contributions. I stated that I had inquired and had been informed that it was the intention of the company to ensure that none of the clerical staff would lose by reason of that refusal of assent.  I assume that the scheme which will be prepared for submission will contain a provision to cover that aspect of the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is undesirable that we should accept the amendment now in view of the situation developing. One of two things can happen. Either there will be no withdrawal from the fund, in which case the intention of the company to ensure that the staff will get the same benefits as if it had been an assenting member will have to be implemented in some way, or else there will be withdrawal <Col N="2421" /> from the fund and the establishment of a new fund.  That new fund will have to be submitted for confirmation and at that stage any representations which interested parties want to make can be considered.  Furthermore, any undertaking that I have given will be implemented.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily so.  It is improbable the company will assent, but if they remain members of the Railway Clearing System Superannuation Fund there will have to be an arrangement to make up to the employees through some other means the difference between the benefits they will get and the benefits they would have got.  It is far more likely there will be a withdrawal from the fund and a new scheme, because otherwise difficulties will arise, including the difficulty in relation to new entrants.  I understand that one of the rules is that all the clerical staff must be covered by the fund, and the company <Col N="2423" /> is contemplating an arrangement only in relation to the existing staff, with a different position for the new entrants. A more satisfactory arrangement would be a withdrawal from the fund and the establishment of a new fund. The alternatives will be the existing position, with a supplemental allowance paid to the clerical staff on retirement, or a new scheme, the probability being a new scheme.</P>

Contributions have been paid into the fund and the staff are entitled to certain benefits.  Some time ago there was a proposal to increase these contributions and to get new benefits. The company did not assent to the proposed increased contribution and the position remains as if the proposal was not made.  We are faced with two points.  What is going to be the position of the clerical staff if the company continues its membership of the fund; in other words, by what steps are the staffs to get the benefits which they would have got if the company assented to the new proposals?  And again, what steps will be taken to secure equal benefits for the staff following a withdrawal from the fund?</P>

      <P>The point raised by Deputy Davin is is an interesting one. The Minister says that these people will be in the same position as if they still continued in this fund.  We will achieve that by continuing them, if we can, or else by an alternative scheme.  It is intended to give them the same benefit terms.  There is no question of there being a lack of reserve funds.  Surely, it ought to be possible to deal with a limited number of men immediately?</P>

In the final paragraph of the sub-section it is provided, however, that save as aforesaid no person shall be entitled to become a member of any existing superannuation fund of a dissolved company who was not so entitled immediately before the establishment date.  The Great Southern Railways Company superannuation schemes and the Dublin United Transport Company's schemes are existing schemes, and this amendment is necessary because, otherwise, new entrants would not be entitled to become members.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Railway Clearing House is a body established to deal with the clearing business of the British railways.  The fund was established under the auspices of the British Railway Clearing house, and membership was confined to companies that were members of the House.  The Irish railway companies became members of the British Railway Clearing House at a time when this country and <Col N="2429" /> Great Britain were the same legal unit.  There is no reason whatever why the Great Southern Railways Company or Córas Iompair Éireann should remain a member of the British Clearing House.  It has no business to do there, and would in fact have no association with that House except through the superannuation fund.  The discussions that may take place there relate to English transport problems. The clearing between the Irish railways and the English railways is done through the Irish Railway Clearing House, of which the British companies operating to this country are members.</P>
      <P>The general practice appears to have been in favour of the establishment of company funds for clerical staff.  In fact all the big British systems have withdrawn from the Clearing System Superannuation Fund already.  I think at the present time the biggest company in the fund is the Great Southern Railways Company, and the decision of that company to establish their own superannuation fund is in accordance with the action taken already by all the big British companies. I think membership of the House is itself undesirable.  It could be regarded as an anachronism, a survival of the time when this country was the same political unit as Great Britain, and I think the retention of membership, particularly for the purpose of maintaining association with this fund, is in itself undesirable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the main Act of 1936 was nominally, at all events, to make the tenants the owners of their cottages by vesting those cottages in them; but in order to indicate the extent to which the Act failed to achieve that purpose, it is only necessary to refer to the fact that, out of approximately 62,500 tenants of labourers' cottages, approximately 14½ per cent. had applied by September, 1943&mdash;the last date for which the figures are available to me&mdash;to have their cottages vested in them. An examination of such statistical information as is available, as to the sources from which the applications emanated, indicates that a large number of them came from certain counties where there were unusual circumstances. In the case of a considerable number of counties, no applications were made and in other cases the percentage was negligible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the present Bill is to amend five sections of the Labourers Act, 1936, so as to make the Act a more beneficial one from the point of view of the tenants and to encourage them to become the owners of their cottages, on terms which will not impose on them the heavy burden imposed by the Act of 1936.  Sections 1 and 2 of this Bill relate to the title and the citation, together with the definitions.  Here it is only necessary to mention that the definitions set out in Section 2 have the same meaning as in the parent Act of 1936.  Section 3 is important, inasmuch as it gives a precise meaning to the rather vague expression &ldquo;terminable annuity&rdquo; referred to in the 1936 Act.  In theory, under that Act, each local authority was free to fix the annuities at any percentage of the rent which those local authorities so decided; but in practice the schemes which the local authorities were required to submit to the Minister for sanction were sanctioned only if they provided for an <Col N="2432" /> annuity of 75 per cent. of the existing rent.  The local authority might, therefore, have desired to make the terminable annuity 50 per cent. of the existing rent.  In theory, it was possible for them to do that, but they had to submit their purchase schemes to the Minister, who would not sanction them unless they provided for an annuity of 75 per cent. of the existing rent.  Section 3, therefore, proposes to fix, the annuity at not more than 50 per cent. of the present rent.  That means that a local authority may secure the sanction of the Minister to fixing the annuity at less than 50 per cent., but neither the local authority nor the Minister, if this Bill is passed, can fix the annuity at more than 50 per cent.  In other words, the purpose of the section is to enable tenants to purchase their existing cottages by paying 50 per cent. of the present rents as a terminable annuity over a period, which is specified in a later section, instead of being required to pay 75 per cent. of the existing rent under the parent Act of 1936.  Under the Act, there was a liability on the tenants who had their cottages vested in them to keep them in repair on certain conditions and subject to certain penalties.  That liability is not interfered with in any way in the present amending Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 6 is also very important.  Its purpose is to reckon the payment period for the purpose of the terminable annuities as a term of 50 years from the date on which the cottage was first erected and occupied.  Therefore, if a cottage were erected 40 years, the annuity being payable over a period of 50 years, it would be payable for a further period of ten years; so that, so far as the amending Bill is concerned, the position of the tenant will be, briefly, that he will be required to pay not more than 50 per cent. of his existing rent as a terminable annuity and to pay that rent for a period of 50 years from the date upon which the cottage was erected. If the rent had already been paid for a period of 40 years, the tenant would be liable to continue the payment for a further period of ten years, when absolute ownership of the cottage would descend to him.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2433" /> It is not proposed in the Bill to interfere with the payment period for post-1922 cottages, and the repayment period in that case remains the same as in the parent Act, namely, 35 years.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of this Bill relates to the ownership of the cottages and the purposes for which they may be used. Section 17 of the Act of 1936 provided, in relation to a vesting order, that it should operate to vest the cottage to which it related in the occupier thereof, so that it may be used only (a) during his lifetime, for his own accommodation and the accommodation of his family and (b) after his death, for the purpose of the accommodation of a person who was his widow, child or other relative of the purchaser and who was resident in such cottage at such death.  Section 6 of this Bill proposes to delete from paragraph (b) the words &ldquo;and was resident in such cottage at such death&rdquo; so as to secure that the lawful successors of an occupier-purchaser may be enabled to succeed him as a tenant, even though not actually residing in the cottage with him at the time of death.  Even this amendment, if carried, gives no absolute right of succession to the relative of the deceased purchaser.  The section merely removes a barrier which precluded succession in certain circumstances under the main Bill.  The real purpose of the amending section is to ensure that if a man who owns a cottage dies, his son or daughter may not be debarred from entering into possession of the cottage and using it merely because he or she did not happen to reside in it at the time of the death of the owner.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill provides that where the local authority, now the county council, desires to secure possession of the cottage by means of court proceedings, they shall give to the tenant not less than six weeks' notice of the intention to proceed against him.  Under the parent Act, the local authority is entitled to proceed against the tenant on giving the tenant one week's notice where the claim for possession is grounded on the failure of the tenant to pay his annuities on the appointed gale day. In any other instance, they would be <Col N="2434" /> required to give six weeks' notice.  The purpose of the section is to compel the local authority to conform to a uniform practice, namely, to give six weeks' notice to the tenant in all cases where the local authority desires to secure possession for any breach of agreement between the tenant and the county council.</P>
    <P>The last section is the only other one which calls for any comment.  The object here is to delete the provision in the parent Act, which provides that interest charges shall be levied on all arrears of rent outstanding at the time of the purchase of the cottage. It does not seem fair that interest charges at the rate set out in the parent Act should be made an unescapable burden for a tenant who desires to purchase.  It may be, according to the circumstances of the case, that some interest should be levied but the purpose of the section is to leave it optional to the local authority not to levy interest charges at the maximum rates set out in the parent Act, but to leave the matter over for discussion in the light of the circumstances obtaining in a particular county or a particular case.</P>
    <P>That, I think, is an explanation of the various sections of this rather brief amending Bill.  Its object, as I said at the outset, is to endeavour to make tenants owners of their cottages on terms which will not impose upon them an insupportable burden.  We believe that the ownership of cottages by tenants not only ensures stability for our rural population, by anchoring them to the land in which they have an interest in the form of a house, but is calculated to imbue them with that spirit of independence which comes from ownership in such circumstances. Everybody realises that in the long run the home is the sheet-anchor on which economic defence in adversity rests.  If you can ensure the tenants of labourers' cottages an interest in their homesteads, you root them in the land; not only do you root them in the land but you give them a source of permanence there.  You give them a defence against the temporary economic blizzards which unfortunately blow across their abodes from time to time. <Col N="2435" /> I recommend the Bill to the House as one which is calculated to raise the standard of life of the agricultural community as represented by the tenants of labourers' cottages, as a measure which will give them an anchorage on the land and as a measure which will enable them to become owners of their cottages on terms with which it will be possible for them to comply.  I think if the State can, through legislation of this character, achieve a situation in which you anchor the rural population on the land, give them stability in the form of a permanent home, and endow them with a sense of independence, then legislation of this character seems to me to redound to the country's progress.</P>

      <P>I should think that no Deputy will dissent from the view that this measure, dealing as it does with the question of the housing of rural labourers, deals with one of the most worthy sections of the population. The history of the fight carried on in this country for the housing of agricultural labourers goes back many years.  It goes back to the rather feeble attempts that were made in the British House of Commons many years ago to deal with this question which were followed by the more comprehensive schemes that were later introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labourers Act of 1906 represented I think a very big step forward and since the establishment of an Irish Government various measures have been passed for the purpose of providing further means of relief in that direction for the rural population.  No effort that this or any succeeding Dáil could make to establish in reasonably comfortable circumstances the rural labourers of this country could be considered too great.  I speak in support <Col N="2436" /> of the Bill as one who has never been an enthusiast on this question of cottage purchase.  I thought in the past&mdash;and I have still some reservations in regard to the matter&mdash;that this proposal to acquire ownership of cottages under a purchase scheme was of very problematical advantage but I do recognise that there has been in this country, and that there is at present, the very strong desire for ownership that has been referred to in such appropriate terms by Deputy Norton at the close of his statement.</P>
    <P>I feel that this Bill is an attempt to make some reasonable gesture towards assisting the rural labourer to obtain ownership of his home on terms that will not impose a heavy burden upon him.  The Minister must know that the Act of 1936 is a dead letter in this country, that it has never had any life or vigour since it was passed into law. It was the result of a long agitation, a genuine agitation by the rural labourers of this country for the ownership of their cottages and a not so-genuine or sincere agitation by others in support of that scheme.  I should like to distinguish between the honest efforts of the labourers of the country who are seeking a purchase scheme and the much less honest advocacy of other people who were seeking something else which, it seems to me, was not calculated to win for the rural labourers the benefits that they deserved or that they indeed expected.  I instance as an example of the accuracy of the statement I have made that the Act of 1936 is a dead letter in the condition of things obtaining in my own constituency of West Cork.  I happened to be a member of the now non-existent board of health for that area and as a member of the county council still I keep actively in touch with what has been happening in connection with the operations of the 1936 Act.  There are roughly 1,400 rural cottages in the West Cork health area and up to date roughly about 70 applications for purchase have been under consideration. That is a clear and unmistakable indication as to what the rural labourer thinks of the Act of 1936.</P>
    <P>As I am on that matter, I want to <Col N="2437" /> mention certain developments which occurred in connection with the preparation of the schemes falling under that Act.  The Minister knows that, in the course of preparation of a scheme, steps have to be taken to secure the registration of title to the plots. Faced with the legal obligation of securing title to the plots attached to labourers' cottages in West Cork, the local authority pointed out at the time that there was no demand for the purchase of labourers' cottages there and that it seemed to them that this registration of title and all the legal formalities it involved represented an expenditure of very doubtful value. But we were up against legal obligations and we had to proceed to secure registration of the title attached to the labourers' cottages in West Cork. That had a most astonishing sequel. The proceedings were conducted on behalf of the local authority by the solicitors who had acted for the county council and the health authority in the past.  We now find that, although the number of applications for purchase in West Cork represented but an infinitesimal fraction of the tenants, we are faced with a bill of roughly. £12,000 arising out of the registration process, which was entirely superfluous and unnecessary in view of the absence of any demand for purchase. However, that matter is under consideration in another quarter.  It would have been much cheaper to build a number of cottages and present them to labourers free of cost than to resort to the procedure laid down in the 1936 Act at the extraordinary expense I have mentioned and with very little value accruing either to the tenants or the people.</P>
    <P>The Act of 1936 provides that, where a tenant desires to purchase, the payments should represent roughly half the rent.  In many of the schemes the cottages are held at a rent of 1/- a week, plus rates.  The reduction in the case of houses built under such schemes is about 4d. a week and the tenant would have to bear responsibility for repairs during the years that his annuity would be payable.  That was a burden that the rural labourer could not possibly undertake, and it is <Col N="2438" /> one of the reasons why this Act has been a dead letter and why the scheme under it has been ignored since the legislation was passed.  It is true that the Act specified that the tenant should get the cottage in a satisfactory state of repair before purchase, but to those experienced in local administration it is well known that many of the old schemes of labourers' cottages were very imperfectly carried out.  There was very faulty construction and supervision was not sufficiently careful in many cases.  The houses were built in an unsatisfactory manner and local authorities received a legacy which necessitated a drain on their resources in the form of maintenance and repair. It is likely that that expenditure will have to be increased in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>In support of the claim I have made that the tenants of labourers' cottages have no interest in the 1936 Act, I have a table here showing the position in the different counties.  The figures are very illuminating and constitute an irrefutable argument for further examination of this matter and for some improvement of the terms on which the cottages should be offered under any purchase scheme to the tenants.  In Carlow, there were 1,400 cottages occupied on the 31/3/43 and, on 30/9/43, there were 28 vested.  On the same dates, there were 1,248 occupied in Cavan and 918 vested.</P>

      <P>The present state of affairs testifies to the commonsense of the tenants of the cottages.  In Cork West, there were 1,420 cottages and not one vested.  In the other counties the figures were: Donegal, 1,934 and 140 vested; Dublin, 3,285 and none vested; Galway, 1,314 and none vested; Kerry, 2,148 and 48 vested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall have something to say about the applications later on.

In that connection, I should like to recall that hardly anywhere was the agitation in favour of purchase more insistent or more widespread than in County Limerick.  In Longford you had 1,161 cottages, and not a single one vested: in Louth, 1,595 cottages and only 469 vested: in Mayo, 522 cottages, and not a single one vested: in Meath, 3,965 cottages, and only 327 vested; in Monaghan, 632 cottages, and not a single one vested; in Offaly, 1,931 cottages, and not a single one vested; in Roscommon, 982 cottages, and 190 vested.  In Sligo there were 897 <Col N="2440" /> cottages, and not a single one vested. In Tipperary (North Riding) there were 2,027 cottages, and only 390 vested.  In Tipperary (South Riding) there were 2,562 cottages occupied, and not a single one vested.  Exactly the same applies to Waterford, to some extent, to Westmeath, and also to Wexford and Wicklow.  In the case of Wexford, 3,548 cottages were concerned, and none were vested, and in the case of Wicklow, there were 2,548 cottages, of which three were vested.</P>

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the Minister will have an opportunity of replying later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pointing out that that was the position in 1936.  And my point is that, since we are now in the year 1944, if that is an indication of the trend of existing legislation that was alleged to have been passed for the benefit of these people, then I do not understand what it means.  I understand that the difficulty in regard to this matter is that the terms offered to the tenants are not in any way attractive, and that the reduction in the rent, afforded under the scheme&mdash;the uniform scheme under the 1936 Act&mdash;is a very small one; yet, all the time there is the fear of the mounting cost of repairs, and the problem arising for many of these people is that, if they were to accept the present proposals, their last state would be worse than the first.  It would be interesting if some particulars were to be given as to the amount of money that would be involved in repairs, in view of the fact that this is a very vital consideration in connection with a scheme of this kind where there are, roughly, 62,018 cottages concerned, and where the average annual cost of repairs in the 1937-43 period amounted to £128,295.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, on the 31st March, 1943, the arrears outstanding in regard to 19,630 <Col N="2441" /> cottages, amounted to £53,313.  In other words, about 16 per cent. of those occupied, and the payments amounted, roughly, to something like £2 14s. Od week.  The cost of repairs varied in different counties.  For instance, in Kerry, it amounted to £10,080, in Waterford to £4,035, in Clare to £3,305, and so on for the different counties.  Now, this question of repairs is inseparable from the whole question, and it would seem to me that if the provisions of this Bill are to be given effect to, from the point of view of conferring benefits on the tenants, an opportunity will have to be given to them of getting a substantial reduction in their existing rents, and they should also have the opportunity of purchasing on terms which will differentiate to a considerable extent between the cottages built for a very long time and those that have been erected under more recent schemes. That, of course, is a very important consideration.  I feel that the whole question is one that we shall have to go into, unless we are content to let the situation remain in its present unsatisfactory condition.  I feel that the Government will have to do something to deal with this whole matter in a comprehensive way, and that Deputies should be given an opportunity to discuss some of these proposals in such a way as will enable them to make up. their minds on a question of this kind.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, any purchase scheme would suit a tenant of a labourer's cottage here, in some circumstances. It would suit a tenant who was holding a small shop or who was an artisan carrying on in his own workshop.  Such a purchase scheme would suit a purchaser living, let us say, in the suburbs of the City of Cork, rather than labourers in the typically rural areas from which the bulk of the purchasers come.  But this is not designed to deal with people in a position of that kind. By reason of their more fortunate circumstances they are not typical of the average cottage tenant that one finds in the rural areas.</P>
    <P>The fact is that, if the 1936 Act had been generally availed of by the labourers of the country, you certainly would have within ten or 15 years a <Col N="2442" /> new and big problem again to house the labourers of the country because they could not possibly undertake to keep their cottages in a reasonably good state of repair, and at the same time pay the annuity which the Act provided of three-quarters of their existing rent.  I know that of my own knowledge.  The Minister and his advisers in the Department have had an opportunity of reviewing the operations of this measure.  I think they will find that the results are utterly disappointing so far as any considerable progress in the purchase of cottages would indicate.  This Bill proposes to revise two or three of the main sections of the 1936 Act in accordance with the needs of rural labourers.  The measure is one that ought to be entertained by the House and one that ought to commend itself to anybody who desires to face the facts of the situation, and seriously thinks that the labourers of the country should be encouraged to purchase their cottages in order, as Deputy Norton said, that they may become more firmly rooted in the land and owners of what either themselves or those who went before them fought for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>After all, this debate may last a considerable time.  I shall have an opportunity of intervening only once, and, consequently, I would like to hear more arguments in support of the Bill before I put the Government attitude on it to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is fair.  The reason why I made the suggestion was that this is a fairly important Bill which affects the lives of very humble people.  All of us feel the responsibility we have with regard to the poorer sections of the community.  We should consider every case made on their behalf fairly and thoroughly, o that we may be in a position to act with full knowledge in any steps that we may take to protect them.  So far, the House is in this position that two very experienced, able and eloquent <Col N="2443" /> Deputies have made, what I am inclined to say at this stage, is a convincing case for the amendment of the 1936 Act.  One thing that has always puzzled me with regard to the operations of that Act, particularly in my own constituency, is that, while the demand for it was consistently and vigorously made by very energetic cottiers' associations in the Leix end of the constituency, not a single tenant has purchased his cottage. That is the position we find six or eight years after the passing of the Act.  By way of interruption, the Minister indicated that there was another side to that picture.  I was anxious that the House would have the benefit of hearing that side of the case put to it before definitely committing itself.  On the information before me at this stage, I have to say that not a single tenant has been vested in either Leix or Offaly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That, as I tried to point out in the course of Deputy Murphy's speech, is no index to the number of applications to purchase which have been made.  Failure to vest has been due almost invariably to the difficulty of getting clear title.  The number of cottages which have been vested is about 2,900; the number of purchase applications is 9,456, and the difficulty of conveying ownership, in the case of the balance of 6,000, has been due mainly to the difficulty of proving title.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand why title difficulties should arise in a peculiar way in certain counties and not in other counties.  Take the County Cavan to which the Minister has referred.  In that county there has been a high percentage of vesting.  In two other counties which have been mentioned not a single cottage has been vested because, as we have been told, of the difficulties of proving title. The administration cannot be congratulated if, over a period of seven years, vesting has been held up completely because of difficulties in regard to title.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy would allow me to point out this fact to him that there are, roughly, 60,000 <Col N="2444" /> cottages.  No less than 40,000 of these were built prior to 1922.  The great majority were built prior to 1914.  If the Deputy remembers the circumstances under which farmers gave land for cottages in that period he will appreciate why it is that we have this difficulty in regard to title.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There should not be any more difficulty with regard to title in the case of labourers' cottages than, say, in regard to any small holding in the country.  After all, the land on which a cottage was built was sold to a public Department operating under Government authority.  There should not be the same difficulty there as there would be, say, in regard to the transfer or sale of a small holding where the transfer might have taken place on the death-bed word of a dying man without as much as a scrap of paper recording the transfer.  At any rate, we have this position, that the vesting of cottages has been held up for a considerable number of years, due to the difficulty of proving title. We now have this Bill before us.  It, at least, is evidence that there is dissatisfaction with the 1936 Act.  Some of the ablest and most experienced Deputies that we have in the House on matters of this kind have consistently held that any form of purchase by the bulk of labourers of their cottages is bad business, due to the fact that the cost of maintenance and repairs is so high when compared to cottage rents. We had that Act which gave them at least the opportunity to purchase.  I will not know until the Minister has spoken what the general response to that piece of legislation was.  Speaking for the part of the country that I am most closely in touch with, the response was not very enthusiastic.  This Bill proposes to amend that Act and to improve it in certain respects from the cottiers' point of view.  I regard the proposals in it as being entirely reasonable.  I think they are modest proposals.  I do not know what the Minister's view of the Bill is, but to say the least of it it is anything but revolutionary.  If we argue this on the basis as to whether a very large percentage of the tenants are going to avail of the opportunities presented to <Col N="2445" /> them to purchase, I think one can say that the difference between this Bill and the 1936 Act is not going to be very great.  I use that as an argument to show that, in my opinion, this Bill is an excessively reasonable Bill, that the demands contained in it are not very great.  With regard to the section of the Bill providing that the relative must be resident at the time of death, I do not think that was fair and just. I do not think it was very well considered. A tenant may die and his son may be living-in as a groom in a neighbouring place.  It is rather harsh to say that if he had been living with the father at the time of death he could succeed in title but, because his occupation carried with it residence, he is debarred.  I think the suggestion made here is a reasonable one in that respect. When we are talking in terms of pennies and living in an atmosphere of spending millions, I do not think it is worth anybody's while losing his wool about the difference between 8d. and 6d. a week on a tenant or the difference between a rent reduced by 25 per cent. and a rent reduced by 50 per cent., considering that the period of the annuity still remains a matter to be settled.  I do not think that, seriously speaking, it is a time for arguing about that.</P>
      <P>In the course of his statement Deputy Norton suggested that in the case of the very old cottages the annuity should terminate at the end of 50 years.  That would be a perfectly sound contention and one that would not be disputed by many people if it were a case of the same family being resident in the cottage during that period or the greater part of that period, but what occurred to my mind is the situation where such a cottage was given to somebody, say, last week, that person might become the owner within ten years, if, say, 40 years had expired.</P>

      <P>Then I think there is a certain amount of loading of the dice in favour of those who have got tenancies of old cottages quite recently.  I think some of the terms that we are arguing about here might be equated by a flattering over so as to benefit the people who have come into new cottages rather than new tenants of old cottages.  On the whole, I do not think there is anything unreasonable in the amendments before us.  Undoubtedly there must be some fault in the parent Act, seeing that there was such a demand for it, and that no matter what figures may be produced with regard to applicants, the response was in no way in keeping with the demand.  On present information, I certainly would be definitely of opinion that if we can do anything to improve the parent Act, such as adopting the proposals we have before us, those proposals should be regarded as reasonable and modest and in the best interest of a great number of tenants. After all, that is a consideration that should weight heavily on one side of the scales as against so many pennies a week on the other side of the scales.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether the Minister has made any contribution to the debate as yet.  This Bill, of course, was brought up before and was, I think, thrown out.  I do not know whether it got a Second Reading or not.  This is a very difficult problem. Of course, broadly speaking, we are all anxious that the cottages should become the property of the tenants and that the terms should be made as reasonable as possible.  One of the proposals is that the tenants should get a 50 per cent. reduction just as the farmers had their annuities halved. On that point alone I should like to be clear.  I should like the Minister to make some statement on that.  Undoubtedly, the annuities have been halved but the amount that formerly went across now goes into the Exchequer. In regard to the loans on the cottages, especially the loans outstanding, what would be the position in the event of this Bill becoming law and the rents of the cottages being reduced by 50 per cent. as against a reduction of 25 per cent. as stipulated <Col N="2447" /> in the 1936 Act?  What would be the position of the public authorities regarding the repayment of the loans outstanding?  Am I to understand that those repayments would have to be continued on the same basis although the revenue derived from the cottages would be reduced by 25 per cent.?</P>

      <P>As I have said, I had the figures prepared, but I did not expect that this Bill would come up to-day.  I, as a member of a public body, must recognise the fact that, if <Col N="2448" /> this Bill is passed, it is the ratepayers of the country who are going to put up the money; it is not coming out of the national Exchequer, and, from that point of view, we have got to be very careful as well as reasonable. Deputy Norton has stated, in introducing the Bill, that it is because of the terms of the last Bill that so few people are purchasing the cottages.  I do not agree with that <i>in toto</i> for this reason: A fair percentage of the tenants of these cottages, who, after all, are as wise and as astute as other sections of the people, have compared their present position as tenants of the cottages with what their position would be as owners of the cottages.  If they were owners of the cottages they would have to incur the cost of repairs, as Deputy Norton has pointed out.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
      <P>Debate adjourned until Tuesday next, 3rd October.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 100:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 44, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) Upon the coming into operation of this Act and notwithstanding anything in this Act contained all agreements and arrangements containing provisions regulating the rates of pay, hours of duty and other conditions of service of the employees of a dissolved company and made between a trade union or trade unions representative of such employees of the one part and such dissolved company of the other part shall continue to apply to the said employees and company respectively unless and until the same or any of them shall be varied or altered as provided for by the next following sub-section of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) The rates of pay, hours of duty and other conditions of service of employees of the company shall be regulated in accordance with agreements made or to be made from time <Col N="2449" /> to time between the trade unions representative of such employees of the one part and the company of the other part.</P>
    <P>(3) The original or a counterpart, or a copy, certified in such manner as the Minister shall direct to be a true copy, of every such agreement as is mentioned in this section shall be deposited with the Minister within one month after the passing of this Act or the making of such agreement whichever shall be the later; provided that the Minister may extend the time for depositing such agreement upon such grounds as he may deem to be reasonable.</P>
    <P>(4) Any agreement containing provisions for regulating the rates of pay, hours of duty or other conditions of service of employees of the company and made between a trade union or trade unions representative of such employees of the one part and the company of the other part pursuant to this section shall be applicable to and enforceable in respect of all the employees in the group or grade of employment embraced in any such agreement.</P>
    <P>This amendment was framed with the intention of ensuring that existing agreements will be continued with the new company, unless altered by subsequent agreements between the company and a tribunal representing the men.  I cannot see why there should be any objection to this amendment from any part of the House.  A continuance of existing arrangements would be beneficial to all parties.  Sub-sections (2) and (3) propose to incorporate in the Bill a provision already in Section 55 of the Railways Act, 1924, and to make it applicable to all employees of the new company.  The Minister seems to give effect to that idea in another way by an amendment to Section 54, which would mean legislation by reference as, in order to ascertain the legal position, trade union representatives would have to refer to three Acts of Parliament, the Railways Act, 1924, the Railways Act, 1933, and the Transport Act, 1944, when it becomes an Act.  As it is suggested that that is a rather cumbersome <Col N="2450" /> method it is desirable that it should be simplified.  This amendment would cover road and rail services.  These two sub-sections would effect the same purpose as the Minister's procedure which entails reference to three separate enactments.  It is now very difficult to get copies of these Acts.  It is considered desirable that we should have incorporated in new legislation this important provision.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (4) lays down procedure which, from the point of equity and common sense, has won universal support.  If it were incorporated in the Bill it would not be possible for employers to make agreements with particular unions or to distinguish between men doing similar work. Trade unions are jealous of that position and are anxious to protect themselves from any possible inroad on rights that they have been exercising. I do not see why the Minister should have any objection to the proposal. Acceptance of it would ensure that men in the same grade would not be dealt with differently.  That would lead to endless friction and chaos.  Under the Constitution workers are supposed to have a right of association.  That ought to apply to trade union associations. We have already had warnings of what could happen if there was any differentiation in working conditions. This proposal would make for harmonious working as men could make selections from their trade unions and if grievances arose there could be no differentiation between people working in the same grade.  I spoke here on a previous occasion on this principle, and I consider that precautions should now be taken in advance because the question is a very important one.  The men are very keen about it and the representatives of the unions who are conversant with conditions in the railway service support my contention.</P>

      <P>With regard to sub-section (1) of the amendment that position is already secured by Section 7, which incorporated the Railway Clauses Act.  It provides for continuance of agreements with the dissolved company.  It is not necessary to provide again for the same thing here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 4.  With regard to sub-section (2) I agree with the necessity for having such a position, and I made provision for it in amendment No. 112.  It applies to this company the provision of the Railways Act of 1924 in respect of railways and the 1933 Act in respect of road services. With regard to sub-section (3) I think that an alteration is necessary and I have provided for it in amendment No. 198.  There is provision in the existing law for lodging agreements in relation to railways.  The amendment I propose, No. 198, makes the same provision for road transport employees.</P>
      <P>With regard to sub-section (4), I am in disagreement with it.  If a union is not representative of all the employees, it is not representative of all the employees, and whatever union is representative of the remaining employees should be entitled to negotiate its own agreements.  No doubt this proposal arises out of the present position of the railway company where there are many cases of different unions catering for the same classes of employees, but I do not think it would be fair to provide that agreements made with one union should apply also to employees who are members of another union.  If the other employees prefer to belong to another union, I think they should be entitled to negotiate their agreements through their own representatives.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister contend, as would be possible by his argument, that there should be two sets of agreements, that separate agreements should be negotiated between members of one union and the company as against agreements under which men in the same grades, but belonging to a different union, operate?  If I am working as a passenger or goods guard, as a porter or in any other capacity and there is a man working beside me on the same type of work and with the same turns of duty, can we have two different sets of conditions?  Is that what the Minister visualises?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not visualising that.  Here are two employees of the <Col N="2452" /> railway company, A and B.  A is a member of the National Union of Railwaymen, and B of the Irish Railwaymen's Union.  I assume that B decided to join that union because he preferred to have his agreements with the company negotiated through that union rather than through the National Union of Railwaymen, and it would be unfair to make it law that if the National Union of Railwaymen negotiates an agreement, it is to apply with equal force to the member of the other union.  It is only in respect of the members of the National Union of Railwaymen that the National Union of Railwaymen's representatives should be entitled to speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to now, when negotiations were carried out on conditions of service and wages as between a union and the railway company, they were carried out on the basis of a man's service to the company and not on the basis of his membership of a particular union.  That was not considered a matter of vital importance to the railway company, so far as I know.  According to the Minister's suggestion, and his latest statement seems to bear it out, the company would have regard to the making of separate sets of conditions because men belonged to different unions.  The employers should be concerned only with the service given by an employee. His membership of a union is a matter for the man himself, and, so long as he gives faithful service and gives no cause for complaint, he is entitled to have the best conditions negotiated for him by a union or many unions. To give one set of conditions to a passenger guard who belongs to one union and a different set to a passenger guard who is a member of another union is impossible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so sure that it is wise for us to butt in.  The Deputy no doubt knows that the Railway Wages Board is at present open only to certain unions and that other unions, perhaps small but nevertheless independent and catering for some hundreds of employees, are not admitted to the negotiating machinery at all.  I do not regard as a desirable <Col N="2453" /> situation that there should be this multiplicity of unions, but, so long as it is there, I do not see why we should butt in and say that the services of the second union are not required.</P>
      <P>If there are employees of the company who want to be members of that other union, it is presumably because they prefer to have their conditions of employment and other matters negotiated through that other union.  They may be wise and they may be unwise. The Deputy no doubt disagrees with the views of these particular members of the company's staff, but I do not think it is fair to propose that we should, by legislation, make it practically impossible for this other union to continue in existence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not arguing the Minister's point and the Minister is obviously not arguing mine.  I am not worrying about what union a man belong to, and if members of certain unions have not got access to the Railway Wages Board, I am prepared to say that they should get such agreements as are negotiated there, whether they belong to the unions represented there or not.  All I seek is that there should not be two sets of agreements. If the Minister will disabuse his mind of certain ideas and concentrate on the main factor, he will agree that a railway company, a transport company or any other employer will find it very difficult to carry on and will find that he is storing up trouble for himself if he has to work on two sets of agreements. I am merely asking by this amendment that the conditions applying to operatives in a particular trade, irrespective of what unions they belong to, should be uniform.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy there, but I think that result should be secured by negotiation and not by legislation.  The effect of the proposal, as I see it, is that if the National Union of Railwaymen make an agreement covering any particular section of the conciliation grades, it will apply to all the members of that grade.  That is making it obvious that the other union, the Irish Railwaymen's Union, which is a rival of the National Union of Railwaymen, has no <Col N="2454" /> good reason for existence at all.  The Deputy is entitled to hold that view, but I doubt if he is entitled to endeavour to give point to it by his proposal here.</P>

      <P>If I have any objection to the administration of the chairman of the Great Southern Railways, it is because he has taken that dangerous line as head of a large concern in a previous case.  I have good reason for suspecting that up to a certain time it is the line which he proposed to take in dealing with the Great Southern Railways workers.  It is not the business of any employer, especially an employer who is the nominee of a democratic Government, to dictate to the workers in the industry of which he is in charge what union they should belong to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but the person concerned, if I am correctly advised, made an agreement with a union which had a minority of workers in his employment, under which only those workers who were members of a particular union were to get the benefits of the improved conditions, and in that backhand, tricky way, when he could not do it any other way, did his best to compel all the men working in that concern to join the particular union he liked best.  I think that is a very undesirable development in these so-called democratic days.  I read with interest that very important and informative document published by the Vocational Commission.  I was amused to find from its historical review of industrial organisations in Italy that that was the policy carried out in the early days of the Mussolini régime in order to compel workers to join trade unions that were under the thumb of the Fascist Party at the period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy put the Irish Transport Union in that class?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly not.  I am making this case; there is no other case except that of the tramway company to quote.  The Minister knows perfectly well that to-day there are four unions, Irish and cross-Channel unions <Col N="2456" /> or amalgamated unions, catering for the dockers employed in the port of Dublin.  The representatives of these unions meet the representatives of what is known as the cross-Channel Association which represents the employing companies and they hammer out an agreement or alter agreements from time to time.  The result of these negotiations is that every man working as a docker in the port of Dublin gets the benefit of these agreements, including those who may not be members of any union.  Is it the policy of the Minister that, if the National Union of Railwaymen, for instance, negotiates an agreement with the Great Southern Railways under this new scheme when it comes into operation, for particular grades or only a percentage of those grades, the benefit of the improved conditions will only apply to members of the National Union of Railwaymen in the railway transport service and not to non-unionists or employees who are members of other unions?  Is that what the Minister is aiming at?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  What the Deputy is aiming at is to bring about a situation in which, in the event of such an agreement being negotiated, further negotiations will be unnecessary.  Is not that so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I do not support that point of view.  I say that when an application for alternation in the existing conditions of service is made by a union or a number of unions, a conference should be held with the representatives of these unions, as it was in the past with satisfactory results.  Is it not true that there is only one case on record since 1922 where a railway strike has occurred?  Is it not true that the decisions of the Irish Railway Wages Board have been accepted by the companies concerned and by the representatives of all unions representing railway workers, and that the only strike which ever took place since the Railway Wages Board came into existence was an unofficial strike by a very small group in the Inchicore works?</P>

      <P>I cannot recollect that at the moment.  Personally, I am in favour of reducing the number of unions catering for railway workers. For a long period of years I have been a believer in industrial unionism so far as railway workers are concerned.  I could point to resolutions which I moved at conferences of my own organisation nearly 30 years ago.  Railway and transport workers and every other section of workers have the right to free association under the Constitution and I say that it is not the business of any employer, whether he is the chairman of a railway company, as in this case, or any other concern, to interfere with that constitutional right and to adopt such tactics as will compel workers to change their allegiance and go into the union he likes best.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>If I am wrong I am sorry, but I think that the reasons given by the Minister for disagreeing with sub-section (4) of the proposed amendment were supporting the attitude previously taken up by the Chairman of the Dublin United Transport Company in his dealings with the employees of that concern.  He made an agreement with a certain union after he had previously consulted the head of an amalgamated union and put the same proposal to him.  He made an agreement with an Irish union and he issued instructions that that agreement should be made applicable only to members of that union.  The Minister knows well, and it is a regrettable thing to have to put on record, that, rather than agree to change their allegiance from one union to another, men had to suffer dismissal from that concern and that they applied to his Department and are working there.  I hope such an undesirable state of affairs will not arise between the manager of the railways company and its employees.  If I misunderstood the Minister's reasons for opposing sub-section (4) of the amendment, I am sorry.  In any case, it is no harm that we should put these views on record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be misunderstood.  I should like to say <Col N="2458" /> that, no matter how it was produced, the elimination of inter-union rivalry in the Dublin United Transport Company was, in my opinion, a very beneficial move from the point of view of the employees and of the citizens.  I do not want anything to be deduced from that remark in relation to the railway company.  The railway position is entirely different.  It is not merely that there is a large number of different grades of workers but, taking the shops into account, there is a large number of unions.  I should say that, in respect of every class of worker in the shops, there are probably two or three unions, and all agreements are a result of contact with joint committees of one kind or another.  That may or may not be a desirable situation.  I am sure that on that issue my views and the views of the trade union movement as a whole would be more or less uniform.  But the situation which is sought to be created by the amendment is not one which I think we should try to achieve by legislation.  If there is to be an alteration in the direction of strengthening the bigger unions, and that is what I take it is aimed at, it must be done by other means than putting in a section of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister surely would not defend the making of an agreement between the management of the company or any other company which would have the effect of compelling men to leave the service because they would not join a union which the head of the company likes them to join.  Surely that is not defensible in the light of the Constitution. Surely it is a most undesirable step.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to hear Deputy Davin say so.  The other day I read of a strike taking place somewhere because the trade union catering for the majority of the workers insisted that the balance of the workers should transfer to that union or cease to be employed because they were members of another union.  If I am to get that principle accepted, it must be accepted not merely by the employers but also by the trade union executive, that a worker can belong to any union he <Col N="2459" /> likes and no one can object.  That principle is not accepted by the trade union movement and, taking the long view, I am not sure that it is wise that it should be.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister will find that it is extravagant to say that demarcation lines between unions are frequent.  I think they are very infrequent as a matter of fact.  We have definite reasons for what we fear.  We have the evidence quoted by Deputy Davin.  Consciously or unconsciously, you are placing a weapon in the hands of the new chairman who is being vested with dictatorial powers which we have reason to fear in view of his expressed desires.  As late as 1944 this gentleman made a differentiation by selecting one particular group of men from a particular union for more favourable treatment than that given to members of another union, although they were in the same grade.  We have a definite fear that you are giving him a weapon which he seems inclined to use in order to discriminate.  I am anxious to see industrial harmony and peace.  I spent my life trying to bring it about.  But certainly that state of affairs will not be promoted by the methods in the section.  We should not favour any union.  The company should respect the agreements with each particular group and not have regard to what union a man belongs to. That is a very simple proposition, and I think it is a fair proposition and, if the employer has no malice against one or the other, there should be no objection from the employer, and I do not think there should be from the Minister either.</P>

      <P>The intimate details of these matters are much better known to the Deputies who have spoken than to me; they have more knowledge of them than I can claim.  But there is a dilemma and I do not know how it is going to be resolved.  A very definite difficulty may arise.  If this fourth sub-section of Deputy Keyes' new section is not accepted, there is a fairly clear position arising out of a judicial decision and that is, that unless a union is a party to an agreement, it can claim that its members are not bound by that agreement. There is a decision to that effect. There is also a phrase used by the judge in a declaration given in court. There is this phrase, which may not have complete legal effect, but which indicates a legal point of view, that a company, such as the old Great Southern Railways, is entitled on any question of the alteration of wages and conditions to have all the unions representative of the workers before it.</P>

    <P>There is apparently a position which can easily be reached in which a company can refuse to negotiate an agreement unless everyone came in, and there is apparently no way of forcing in unions.  It appears to be accepted that the new company considers it has the power to negotiate with a particular union.  They may insist on all unions coming in, and they may use that power to stop-up an advance, if they can get some union to be recalcitrant.  On the other hand, the company appears to be entitled to negotiate with a particular union and make an arrangement and say that <Col N="2461" /> those terms and conditions shall affect only the members of that union.</P>
    <P>If that is the position, there is a definite power given to the chairman to work in favour of one union and against others, and I do not think that is desirable.  There seems to be a peculiar position in which the company seems to be in a stronger position.  It may refuse to negotiate unless every union is in, or it may negotiate with one union and confine the new agreement to the members of that union.</P>

      <P>Is it not a fact that the management of the company, with the consent of the chairman, entered into negotiations early this year for an improvement in the conditions of the road transport workers with unions that represent only a small minority of the employees of that section, and were on the eve of getting the Minister's sanction, while at the same time the same management were threatening the railway workers with the suspension of an agreement and a return to the four days per week?</P>

      <P>Is the amendment, which is in the names of three members of the Labour Party, intended to avoid preference being given to any particular union?  There is no use in hiding the facts.  We know there is a war going on in this city.  Unfortunately, there is rivalry between unions.  There is no use in beating about the bush. This war has been going on for years between these unions and possibly there is a suspicion that this company will favour a particular union and make agreements with that union to the detriment of the members of another union.  On the other hand, an agreement may be made between the company and the representatives of a particular union, and it is sought in this amendment that that agreement will apply to every man of that particular group.</P>

If, on the other hand, there is a suspicion that the management will have some secret agreement with the members of another union and possibly give them better terms for the purpose of inducing other members to join that particular union, I can foresee a danger and this rivalry will continue to exist.  Unfortunately, we have too many unions in this country, and it would be much more simple if we had only the one union dealing with matters of this kind.</P>
      <P>There is no great harm in the Minister accepting this amendment.  I do not see that it ties the hands of the management of the company.  If the employees of a particular group and the company can come to an agreement with regard to rates of wages and hours and conditions, I cannot see why they should not be allowed to do so and let the arrangements be carried out in accordance with the agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 101:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of Section 44, to add the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3)  No such association, club, institution, fund, trust or convenience as is mentioned in this section shall contain any provision relating to the rates of pay or the conditions of employment applicable to employees of the company and nothing contained in this section shall enable any such association, club, institution, fund, trust or convenience as aforesaid to be recognised or countenanced as an excepted body within the meaning of Section 6 of the Trade Union Act, 1941, as amended by Section 2 of the Trade Union Act, 1942.</P>
      <P>There is a genuine doubt in the minds of some of us as to the purpose of the section as it stands, and the amendment has been put down in order to make it certain that no club or association established under this section will be used as an excepted body under the Trade Union Act, 1942.  I would be obliged if the Minister would give us some information of the purpose for which the clubs or institutions will be established and whether there is a limit to the amount of money which may be set aside for their maintenance. He might further say whether they will be used in any way to cut across the activities of trade unions now catering for the workers who will be employed in Córas Iompar Éireann as from 1st January, 1945.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Dublin United Transport Company has made arrangements to assist in the provision of a social centre for its workers and employees, a club room where there would be ordinary club recreations.  The company may also occasionally contribute to choral societies, dramatic societies or football clubs organised amongst its employees. Unless there is some such section as this in the Bill, this new company would not be able to use its funds to make contributions of that kind.  That is why it is necessary to have a section empowering them to do so.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy there is no intention to recognise any such body as an excepted body under the Trade Union Act, 1942.  That Act permits of wage negotiations being carried on by an excepted body, which is defined in the Act.  I do not think we should try to amend that Act by the provisions in this Bill.  I can give the Deputy any assurance he wants that there is no intention to recognise any such body as an excepted body or to create a situation in which the negotiations with the company will be carried on by any body but licensed trade unions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very necessary that it should be given, and very necessary that the Minister should use the power he has under this Bill to curb the activities of at least one of those clubs, which has become a blackmail on innocent, simple, impoverished railwaymen. <Col N="2467" /> I got a strong complaint that a couple of gentlemen described as public relations officers have been pestering some underpaid railwaymen and tramway employees to subscribe a sum of £500 to present to the chairman of the company his portrait in oils, and to entertain him at a big banquet at the same time.  I am sure the chairman has no interest in pestering people to present him with his portrait in oils and that he personally has nothing to do with the matter.  A few people known as public relations officers attached to these services apparently regard this as part of their duties, and as something which would ingratiate them with the higher officials of the companies, and have been organising a committee to try to secure the necessary £500 for the portrait in oils.</P>
      <P>I am told that people have said they had neither time to spend on the committee nor money to subscribe, and they have been told that the chairman would be very annoyed if he thought a proposition of this kind was received so coldly by them.  I am sure the chairman has not the slightest interest in this project and would not lend his name for the purpose of disseminating the dark hints thrown out by folk who are apparently acting on his behalf, although not with his knowledge, and apparently using his powerful position in the transport undertakings for the purpose of endeavouring to coerce these people into subscribing for a presentation of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this company has public relations officers with time to spare, I suggest they should go down to Aston's Quay. on a wet day and have a look at the unfortunate passengers, blue with the cold and soaked with the rain, struggling to get a bus for a distant part of the country.  They could employ their talents and energies better in providing proper housing accommodation for these passengers and would be doing a very much better service for the travelling public than canvassing for the presentation of a portrait in oils to the chairman.  I am sure the Minister has no sympathy with what may be appropriately described as a racket of this <Col N="2468" /> kind, and I am sure the chairman has very little use for the fulsome activities of these people.</P>
    <P>I was told the other day that some of these public relations officers wanted someone to speak at the banquet and, when some of the speakers demurred, saying they were not of the calibre for speaking at public functions on such a grandiose scale, they were told it did not matter whether they knew how to speak or not, as the speeches would be dressed up for them and they would only have to get them over to the lads assembled. Utilising public relations officers in transport undertakings for a purpose of that kind, when we have a rather dilapidated transport system, and a hopelessly chaotic system in some respects, seems to be a complete misuse of their functions.</P>
    <P>There has been a very genuine fear that an effort might be made to utilise these clubs as a kind of house unions. I am glad to have the Minister's assurance that as far as he is concerned, he will not stand for that.  I would suggest to the Minister that he might find occasion to have a talk with the chairman of the company so as to make sure that so far as the chairman is concerned&mdash;the other directors do not matter because they are there only to provide embroidery for the chairman at the meetings of the board&mdash;he will have nothing whatever to do with the utilisation of these clubs for purposes other than those for which they might properly be used, namely, to provide recreation and to provide social activities for members who can elect freely to take part in them or, as freely, remain outside them without incurring the displeasure of anybody associated with the railway industry.</P>

      <P>Sub-section (1) says that all appointments to any office or situation in the clerical grade of the service shall be made by means of open competitive examination in accordance with regulations made by the company. Does that cover clerical, administrative and executive grades because I have a particular reason for raising this point?  I know that suggestions have been made in recent times, apparently emanating from those anxious to look after university graduates, that a small number of persons who have university degrees should be brought into the service of the company&mdash;the same thing <Col N="2470" /> has been suggested for the Dublin Corporation&mdash;for appointment to executive posts.  I have good reason to believe that a small number at any rate of such posts are being reserved for candidates of that character.  In, fact I know some of the names of young men who were interviewed by the chairman at the request of a university professor for the purpose of finding out whether they were suitable, as apprentices if you like, for some of the higher administrative posts.  That is the kind of scheme that brought the British railways into chaos and bankruptcy at a particular period.  If my advice is worth anything in a matter of this kind to the Minister or to the chairman, I would say that, if he wants the railway transport scheme to be a success, he will put into the higher administrative posts men who have knowledge and experience over long years of the service and he will not bring, at this particular period, into such posts under the name of apprentices, persons who have no knowledge or experience of the working of the industry.</P>

Some of the persons now occupying highly-paid and responsible positions came in as a result of open competitive examination.  They are now in the ranks of the highest executive officers.  I want that policy to be retained as against this proposal of somebody who knows nothing about the working of the railway or the transport undertaking to put in superior apprentices.</P>

For this transport undertaking, a very laudable practice is set down in sub-section (1) of Section 45, although there is a certain saving aspect about the provision for entry by open competitive examination <Col N="2473" /> to the clerical grade.  What grades will be covered by the section?  It seems to me that, while encouraging the continuance of the desirable practice of promoting people in the service into higher positions, it is desirable we should curb any tendency on the part of a director or wealthy shareholder to pass a dud second cousin or third cousin into the service.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cosgrave and I, in whose names this amendment is down, are anxious to see the Minister insist on making this advisory committee a body in some degree representative of important agricultural and industrial interests. We want the people to feel that those interests will have representation on a committee which will be instructing and advising the Minister and that this committee will study national transport problems.  We want to secure that, when representations are made to the Minister for the introduction of new services or the variation of existing services, it will not be optional with him to refer, or not to refer, the matter to the advisory committee. We do not want the committee to be purely ornamental.  We feel that this committee should study national transport problems and make themselves <i>au fait</i> with the economic conditions in different parts of the country and with developments in other countries.  We want to secure that, if the Minister at any time has a request made to him for introduction of a new method of transport or for the extension or variation of existing methods, he will refer it to the committee, which will have been studying transport matters behind the scenes and that, at all times, before he makes an order of this sort, he will have sought the advice of this committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This question will, no doubt, arise on other sections of the Bill also.  I am completely opposed to the Deputy's idea.  The intention is that this will be an advisory committee and that it will be consulted if there is an element of doubt as to whether action should be taken and if it is <Col N="2476" /> necessary to hold an inquiry involving consultation with the interests concerned&mdash;the company and any other parties who may wish to make representations. If I were to receive an application under this section which, I thought, should, beyond question, be granted without further inquiry, I should proceed to make the order.  If I felt that the matter was one concerning which there should be an examination of the facts and that an opportunity should be given to each party to make representations, I should refer it to the advisory committee.  I want to make clear that this is to be an advisory committee and not a sort of permanent inquiry tribunal into the conduct of transport affairs.  It is not intended to be anything else but advisory to the Minister.  It is not intended to be an authority independent of the Minister, and it would be wrong to put it on any other basis.  The intention is that, where it is necessary to consult with trading interests or persons concerned with a particular locality or to ascertain the transport position or prospects of an area in relation to the views of the company concerning the adequacy of the facilities, or other matters, the committee will be consulted.  There will, no doubt, be many frivolous applications&mdash;some so frivolous that there will be no difficulty concerning them and no necessity to hold a public inquiry in relation to them.  In saying that, I am speaking with experience of the operation of the 1924 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The functions which the Minister is given in this Bill in relation to the matters on which the advisory committee may be consulted were given under the 1924 Act to the tribunal, but in actual practice many questions were settled without reference to the tribunal&mdash;matters which, in fact, would not be brought to the tribunal because of the expenses that would be involved so far as the individuals were concerned. It is because of that that many matters, that were intended to be dealt with in that way, were dealt with departmentally, in practice.  That has induced me to establish as law what the practice has been, and the idea is to bring the law into accordance with <Col N="2477" /> practical experience.  This is intended to be a committee to inquire into the circumstances of applications, where there is a doubt as to whether they should be granted or not.  They may not be granted, although I think that if recommended by the committee they will be, but if there are cases where the Minister has no doubt that there is no case for an inquiry, and where the matter could be handled, let us say, by an ordinary inquiry over the telephone, I think there should be no need for this elaborate machinery of inquiry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if you substitute the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for &ldquo;may&rdquo; the Minister need not accept the recommendation. It has been suggested here over and over again that we are appointing a dictator chairman, but I want to say that the real dictator, so far as this measure is concerned, is the Minister himself.  He is the man who holds unlimited power.</P>

      <P>The chairman has been described as the dictator, but the Minister can remove the chairman, and the Minister is the real dictator, even in matters of consultation such as this, which we are asking the Minister to refer to this advisory committee.  It may be that individuals in a remote part of the country may feel that they should have an extension of existing services.  They may feel that they are not being properly served to the extent to which the economy of their part of the country demands, and the Minister, without consultation with anybody, may decide that they should not have that service.</P>

      <P>To delete sub-section (1) and substitute the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) Except so far as authorised by an Order of the Minister, the parties to any agreement or arrangement, between the company and any other transport undertaking, for the allocation or routing of traffic or for the pooling of receipts or for differential rates on traffic passing by sea to or from the State shall not&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a point with regard to Section 115 which does not apply to the company.  Section 47 does.  If the company has to take over all agreements made by the dissolved companies, which is the situation, why should it not be bound in Section 115 to report these agreements?  As the section was originally drafted, it was that it should not be lawful for the company to vary any agreement unless it was authorised by an Order of the Minister.  Now a change is being authorised by an Order of the Minister, and the parties cannot vary it.  I take that to mean that this applies to agreements previously entered into by the Dublin Transport Company, the Great Southern Railways Company and outside bodies, and that all parties to the agreement must concur in the variation or recision.  Without that agreement, the Ministerial Order is no good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the position to be that the parties to the agreement would have themselves to agree to the amendment of the agreement or to the termination of it.  We are not proposing that the Minister will have power to insist on such amendment or its abandonment. If the parties make such an agreement they may apply to the Minister for sanction to the new arrangement. He may give or refuse sanction after consultation, if he so desires it, with the advisory committee.  I gather <Col N="2484" /> that Deputy Coburn has some objection to the reference to the advisory committee. I am not clear as to that point, but sub-section (2) is merely intended to provide machinery by which application for the Minister's sanction may be made.  I can see some grounds for the Deputy's objection, that an application should be possible only from one or other of the parties to the agreement, and that there should not be a situation in which a party who is not concerned in the agreement might apply for its variation without relation to the interests of the parties who made the agreement.  Section 115 relates to new agreements and requires the tabling of new agreements within 14 days after they are entered into.  I take it that Deputy McGilligan's point is why that obligation does not attach to this company?</P>

      <P>There is a matter upon which I should like more information. I think it would be more cogent on Section 115.  Since an endeavour has been made now to get the terminology of the two sections into some sort of consistency, why is there this insistence on the word &ldquo;arrangement&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;agreement&rdquo;?  I understand from one of the railway companies that there are matters that they call &ldquo;agreements&rdquo;.  These would be of a general nature and open to all traders of a particular type or all people going by a particular route, but &ldquo;arrangements&rdquo; may cover some greater number of matters.  For instance, I understand that very often they enter into what is called an arrangement with a person with regard to the routing or the freighting of a particular parcel.  Is the Minister going to get records of all these arrangements?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <P>My principal reason for proposing this amendment is that both the Dublin Corporation and the Corporation of Dún Laoghaire will be affected by the cesser of wayleaves on and after a certain date and provision is made in the Bill for the appointment of an arbitrator. That being the case, I think it is undesirable that the Minister should have the sole right to appoint and arbitrator. Under sub-section (4) of Section 41 it is provided that the Chief Justice, whenever so requested by the Minister, shall appoint a person to be the arbitrator, but under this section the Minister himself is going to decide who shall be the arbitrator.  If it is desirable to have the Chief Justice in the earlier section, I do not see why he should be omitted from this section but, in any event, there is a general impression that the present Minister is favourable to the transport company and the Corporation of Dublin and the Corporation of Dún Laoghaire and the taxpayers or ratepayers in both cases would naturally feel a certain amount of grievance if an arbitrator <Col N="2487" /> were not appointed on an impartial basis.

If the Dáil is of opinion that it is more desirable that the arbitrator should be appointed by the Chief Justice than by the Minister, I am prepared to amend the Bill accordingly.</P>
      <P>I think we would have to insert a sub-section like sub-section (4) of Section 41, which would require the Chief Justice to appoint an arbitrator whenever requested to do so.  I would, however, resist the Deputy's second amendment which would enable the Chief Justice to determine the remuneration of the arbitrator.

      <P>I beg the Minister's pardon.  What I was going to say was that that Act recognised that there was a right to continue payment of wayleaves, although the roads were being used by omnibuses.  Sub-section (4) of this section says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) In fixing the compensation payable to any road authority under this section the arbitrator shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case and may have regard, so far as he considers equitable, to the extent to which the roadways of that road authority have ceased to be used or will cease to be used for the purpose of tramways.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That appears to show that the wayleaves might be considered by the arbitrator as to be paid solely for the use of trams.  In point of fact, I think they are mainly paid as a monopoly right, and that that monopoly right still exists in the new transport company, whether trams or buses are running.  Dublin Corporation receives £14,920 per annum for wayleaves.  It also receives them for the maintenance of the tracks and 18 inches at each side of these tracks.  It also receives them under certain agreements and contracts for the right to use the existing tram standards for public lighting purposes.  All these functions are a benefit to the corporation and a benefit to the citizens of Dublin.  Taking the full amount received for wayleaves it represents 2d. in the £ on the rates. The corporation feel that under this <Col N="2490" /> Bill they might be deprived&mdash;to a certain extent they will be&mdash;of a payment which is their just due.  On behalf of the corporation I wish to register a protest on that account.  One cannot say what the arbitrator is going to do, but this sub-section seems to indicate that the basis of the arbitration may be the existing tramlines and not the whole transport services of the company. The corporation would be glad of an explanation from the Minister on this question generally.  The corporation feel that they ought to be paid a capital sum&mdash;if not an annual sum&mdash;for wayleaves which will bring in the amount they now receive.</P>

      <P>This question of wayleaves originated when opposition was offered at the time by the Dublin Corporation to a Private Bill promoted by Dublin Tramways Companies for the electrification of tramways in Dublin. The agreement made at the time provided for a variation of the amount according to the mileage of tracks in use.  It was not until 1925 that there was any special recognition of that.  It arose again by the opposition of Dublin Corporation to a Private Bill promoted by Dublin Tramways Company to empower them to run omnibuses. Omnibuses were then coming into use, and they were being operated in Dublin by a number of private individuals. In fact, anybody at the time could operate omnibus services in Dublin except the tramways company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to get power to run omnibus services the company promoted a Private Bill which the Dublin Corporation opposed.  Arising out of the negotiations that took place between the company and the corporation, and in an effort to secure the withdrawal of corporation opposition to the Bill, the company agreed to insert a clause in the Bill providing for a continuation of payment of wayleaves to the corporation at the amount paid that year for an indefinite period, &ldquo;unless and until provision to the contrary is made by the Oireachtas&rdquo;.  I think the insertion of these words by the Private Bill Committee is a clear indication that they did not contemplate that the arrangement was a permanent one.  No other explanation could be given for <Col N="2491" /> the insertion of these words, which were not necessary to the completion of the agreement, but as an indication of doubt in the mind of the committee of the wisdom of imposing this obligation on the tramways company indefinitely.</P>
    <P>I do not think it would be seriously contended that we should recognise a situation which might involve the Dublin Corporation continuing to draw wayleaves from the Dublin United Transport Company or the new company which will absorb it, in perpetuity, long after the tramways out of which the obligation arose had ceased to exist.  I think I could make a case for a reduction of the wayleaves in proportion to the mileage of tram tracks and for their disappearance with the disappearance of the trams. I am not proposing to do so.  I propose to terminate this situation in a way which is fair to the corporation, by the payment of a capital sum which will be determined by the arbitrator with these terms of reference.  He shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case, and may have regard, as far as he considers equitable, to the extent to which the roadway has ceased to be used for the purposes of tramways.  The situation is that if the tramways company had not sought by Private Bill in 1925 to run omnibuses the old agreement would operate, and wayleaves would contract with the contraction of the tramways.</P>
    <P>Whatever the origin of the opposition offered by the corporation in 1925 to that Bill, it resulted in this agreement, and secured that continuation of the payment of wayleaves at the amount paid in that year.  Having regard to the clear indication of the mind of the committee which considered the Bill, and the general circumstances, <Col N="2492" /> it is desirable that we should get rid of wayleave payments now in a way that is not unfair to the company and by which the new company capitalises the liability.  That is what the proposal amounts to.  I certainly resist the suggestion that anything here is unfair to the corporation. I could make a convincing case that the obligation to pay wayleaves should disappear at some period, or with the trams, without any payment of compensation at all.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not think that there was a recognition of monopoly right rather than paying for use of tram tracks?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the tramways company were not given any monopoly to run buses.  That Act empowered the tramways company to run buses.  They were not given a monopoly at that time.</P>
