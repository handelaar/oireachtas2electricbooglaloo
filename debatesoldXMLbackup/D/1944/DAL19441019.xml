      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he is aware that large quantities of coal are accumulating at Rossmore and Wolfhill Collieries and that this coal is exposed to the weather and deteriorating; that persons who are in grave want of coal for fuel for industry or private consumption are unable to get any of this coal because of the failure or refusal of his Department to issue licences; that because of the great accumulations of coal at both collieries hundreds of miners have been laid off; and if he will state what steps he proposes to take to remedy this grave situation at once.</P>

      <P>As indicated in my recent reply to a similar question, I cannot understand why any accumulation of stocks should have taken place at these mines, having regard to the extent to which coal purchase permits have been issued by my Department.  The suggestion in the Deputy's question that the difficulties experienced in disposing of their output by these collieries are attributable to the non-issue of permits on an adequate scale is refuted by the most recent information <Col N="349" /> received from the Mines Management, which is to the effect that orders had been received for all large and sized coal on offer at both the Wolfhill and Rossmore mines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that under the Emergency Powers Order a workman injured by accident is entitled to be paid a supplementary allowance if he is in receipt of compensation fixed by way of an order of the court or of an agreement recorded by the court under the Workmen's Compensation Act; that he is not so entitled to any supplementary payment if his compensation is payable under a voluntary agreement; that in a very considerable number of cases compensation, in the first instance, is payable on foot of such voluntary agreements; that the considerable number of workmen in the latter category are, therefore, precluded from claiming a supplementary allowance; whether he is further aware that in case a weekly payment made on foot of an unrecorded agreement is redeemed the workman is liable to suffer loss to the extent of several hundreds of pounds because of the non-inclusion in the redemption value of the weekly amount of the supplementary payment, and whether he will consider amending <Col N="354" /> the Order so as to make it applicable to cases where compensation is payable under voluntary agreements in the same way as it applies to cases in which the compensation is fixed, in the first instance, by court order or recorded agreement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the position is as stated by the Deputy. Section 53 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1934, provides that &ldquo;any person interested in any weekly payment agreement, variation agreement, retention agreement, computation agreement, by way of compromise may send such agreement to the county registrar with an application to have the same registered in the register&rdquo;, and the county registrar, if satisfied that the agreement is in order, is obliged to register such agreement. An agreement when registered becomes binding under the Act, and any payments to which the workmen would be entitled under the agreement are subject to the provisions of the Act and to any amendments made thereto by way of Emergency Powers Order or amending legislation.  Accordingly, I am not satisfied that there is any necessity to amend the Emergency Powers No. 274 Order, 1943, as suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The circular letter referred to dealt with the operation of the County Management Act, 1940.  Its purpose was to remove misconceptions on certain matters arising out of the administration of the Act with a view to securing the fullest collaboration possible between the elected representatives and the managers in the discharge of <Col N="355" /> their respective functions.  Each of the four county boroughs in which there are city managers had a City Management Act applicable to its own area long before 1940 and in that respect the position is different from the counties. However, if copies of the circular are desired by the elected representatives of any of the county borough areas it would be a matter rather for the city councils concerned in exercise of powers under their respective Acts, to require that its distribution is made by their respective staffs.</P>

      <P>The continuance in insurance of the persons referred to in the question is already provided for by existing legislation.

      <P>If he has been 104 weeks in insurance and has 104 contributions to his credit, an insured person ceasing employment or ceasing to be liable to compulsory insurance for any reason (including retirement) is entitled to become a voluntary contributor for National Health and Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Insurance, paying the full joint contribution himself.  If he had been an &ldquo;excepted person&rdquo; i.e., liable only to insurance under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts and cessation of employment is due to incapacity for work owing to disease or disablement, he cannot become a voluntary contributor until he proves that he has recovered from the incapacity, but he remains an insured person under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts as explained in the previous paragraph.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton has probably in mind the case of the excepted person: that is, the person excepted from the provisions of the National Health Insurance Acts, but who is compulsorily insurable under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts.  This class of employee is usually retired at age 65, if he has not retired before that age on the ground of ill-health.  If the employee is retired on the ground of ill-health, the procedure as to the extended free year, as explained already, applies.  If he ceases to be employed, that is, on retirement, or ceases to be liable to insurance on account of his remuneration exceeding £250 per annum, in the case of a non-manual worker, it is open to him to continue his insurance until attaining the age of 70, by becoming a voluntary contributor for both health and pensions insurance, and paying the combined contribution.  He cannot insure as a voluntary contributor for pensions insurance only.  Every excepted person is informed of his right so to continue his insurance by becoming a voluntary contributor, or, in the case of the person retired on the ground of ill-health, of his right to continue his insurance, by the procedure of furnishing to the Department the necessary evidence of incapacity. If Deputy Norton has in mind the cases of persons who are unable to prove incapacity under the Act, I should be glad to hear from him of such cases and will have the matter investigated.</P>

      <P>The answer is in the negative.  It would be quite impossible to consider any such proposal.  The mileage of roads maintained by local authorities represents approximately 16 miles per 1,000 of the population.  If <Col N="360" /> the maintenance of cul-de-sac and other roads which are not maintained by local authorities were to be so maintained, the present mileage of roads maintained out of public funds would be increased to such an extent that the cost of upkeep would impose an excessive and unfair burden on the general body of ratepayers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree with the statement that the wheat crop in the Dingle peninsula was almost a complete failure. Reports indicate that the wheat crop in the peninsula was, on the whole, satisfactory as regards quality and yield.  I am aware, however, that in part of the peninsula some failures of winter-sown wheat occurred.  Those failures were mainly due to unfavourable weather and soil conditions at the time of sowing the seed.</P>
      <P>In connection with the seed distribution scheme, a suitable allocation of winter seed wheat has been provided for the Dingle peninsula, and this seed will be available for distribution at an early date.  It is the intention also to distribute supplies of spring wheats in the peninsula.  It should be understood that these seed supplies are intended to provide a change of seed for the purpose of maintaining quality and that the quantities available would not permit of general distribution of seed in any area.  Farmers requiring supplies of seed wheat should, therefore, place their orders in good time through the usual trade channels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>For the selection of persons to attend the two courses already held (in 1941 and in 1943/44) the qualifications prescribed were a good general education and an excellent knowledge of Irish.  Though not prescribed as essential, the following were referred to as desirable qualifications: a knowledge of singing or music; special interest in drama or in Irish dancing and games; experience of social work.</P>
      <P>The age limits prescribed for admission to courses were from 21 to 30, with an extension to 35 in cases of applicants with satisfactory teaching experience.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he will state the names, qualifications and experience of those who conduct the course for the Teastas Timthire Gaedhilge, the number of courses already held, the number of students attending each course, and the percentage of successes at each examination for the Teastas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Two courses have been held, the first from March to September, 1941, and the second from October, 1943, to June, 1944.  The former was attended by 19 students, of whom 18 secured the Teastas Timthire Gaedhilge.  The second was attended by 22 students, of whom 21 secured the Teastas Timthire Gaedhilge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The instructors who conducted these courses were chosen for the purpose because they had already shown by their work that they possessed in a high degree the special qualifications which the students attending the courses should acquire in order to become successful Irish teachers and organisers.  The courses were in charge of Dr. P. E. Ó Súilleabháin, Department's inspector, who has made a special study of language teaching methods and has had considerable experience in the organising of Irish drama, feiseanna and other Gaelic activities.  The principal assistant instructor was Aindreas Ó Muimhneacháin, who had been professor of Irish and history and geography in <Col N="367" /> Coláiste Caoimhín, and who had successful experience as an organiser of Irish under vocational education schemes.</P>
    <P>Assistance was also given at the courses by instructors who were specialists in certain subjects, viz., Gearóid Ó Lochlainn and Proinnsias Mac Diarmada for Irish drama; Donnchadh Ó Braoin and Pilib Ó Laoghaire for Irish music and choral singing; C. Ní Ruairc for physical training, and M. Barry for drawing. Diarmuid Ó Drisceoil was also employed as an assistant instructor at the second course; he had nine years' experience as a teacher in Coláiste na Rinne, and he has been a very successful organiser and teacher of Irish classes under County Waterford Vocational Education Committee.</P>
    <P>In addition to the two courses mentioned, a series of three short summer courses were conducted in the years 1942, 1943 and 1944 for existing teachers of Irish employed under vocational education schemes.  An examination for the award of the Teastas Timthire Gaedhilge was held at the conclusion of the 1944 course, at which 41 part-time teachers competed and 14 were successful.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether, in view of the fact that Circular No. 23/43, issued by his Department to vocational education committees adds a full year to the period hitherto required to qualify as a teacher for vocational schools, his Department consulted the universities or gave notice of any kind of so important an alteration in the qualifications of vocational teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>As the wording of this question might, unintentionally, suggest that the circular mentioned, and the consequence attributed to it, apply to all vocational teachers, I wish to make it clear that this circular applies only to teachers of Irish and does not affect university graduates who become teachers of other subjects such as commerce, science, etc., in vocational <Col N="368" /> schools.  It is right to point out also that prior to the issue of the circular mentioned a university degree was not accepted as a full qualification for the position of teacher of Irish in vocational schools.</P>
      <P>The reasons which led to the decision to require the Teastas Timthire Gaedhilge as the qualification for teachers of Irish in these schools were explained in my reply to a question asked here by the Deputy on the 3rd instant.  It had not been the practice to consult the universities regarding the position of Irish teachers in vocational schools, as these positions had originally been filled mainly by persons whose qualification was the Teastas Mhuinteora Gaedhilge, or a Teastas from one of the Irish colleges, and the introduction of the recent change did not involve any new departure in this respect.</P>
      <P>It was not possible to give longer notice of the recent decision, as it was a matter of urgency to ensure that only the best qualified persons were appointed to such vacancies as might occur for Irish teachers on the staffs of vocational educational committees. Regarding the complaint that the decision adds a year to the period required by a university graduate to qualify for the position of Irish teacher, I wish to mention that the position of university graduates in relation to the Teastas Timthire Gaedhilge is at present under discussion between a representative of the National University and my Department, and while I cannot at present make any promise regarding the result of this discussion, I hope that a satisfactory arrangement may be reached.</P>

      <P>The Land Commission are not responsible for the repair or maintenance of the River Maine embankments in the townlands of Callinafercy East and West, Milltown, County Kerry.  On the sale of the Leeson Marshall Estate under the Irish Land Act, 1903, a fund, administered by local trustees, was established to assist the tenant purchasers in the maintenance of the embankments. It has been represented to the Land Commission that these works are at present in bad condition, that flooding is occurring as a result and that the cost of the repairs necessary would be beyond the resources of the fund or of the occupiers of the lands affected.  The Land Commission, who have already given very considerable assistance in this case, are having inquiries made with a view to determining what further action, if any, they can take in the matter.</P>

      <P>The Land Commission are not responsible for the repair or maintenance of the embankments at Castlemaine, Callinafercy, or Gurrane, Killorglin.  Applications which have been received for assistance towards the repair of the River Maine embankments in the townlands of Callinafercy East and West, and in the townland of Annagh, adjoining Castlemaine, are at present under investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The lands of Gurrane are on the Ventry Estate and there is a maintenance fund, administered by local <Col N="376" /> trustees, to assist the tenant-purchasers in the maintenance of the embankments in this, and other townlands on the estate.  Following representations in 1943 that repairs were required, beyond the resources of the fund and outside the skill and experience of the trustees, the Land Commission offered to make available by way of free grant the sum necessary to close breaches which had occurred at Gurrane West and Ballymacprior, and to effect general repairs to works in these and other townlands, subject to the condition that the occupiers of the lands to benefit should co-operate by providing a certain amount of labour, cartage or materials free of charge. The tenants were not prepared to co-operate and, in consequence, the work was not undertaken.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill do now pass.  During the course of discussion in Committee Deputy Mulcahy asked me to explain in greater detail the procedure adopted by the company to effect a redemption for cash of the subsidiary stocks of the Great Southern Railways enumerated in Section 132 of the Bill.  I explained to the House that Section 14 and the Third Schedule of the Bill provided for the substitution of 3 per cent. guaranteed redeemable stock for so much of the Great Southern Railways subsidiary stocks as continued to be held by stockholders before January 1st, 1945. Section 132 of the Bill deems the company always to have had power to redeem the subsidiary stocks in cash by agreement with the holders.  I informed the House that the company had made an agreement with the majority of the holders of stock for redemption for cash at par, and with the minority for the substitution on the basis of £ for £ of 3 per cent. Government guaranteed debentures. In the case of 4 per cent. guaranteed redeemable stock (1947) an offer was cash, £102, with the alternative of the stock being carried over as the liability of the new company until redeemed in 1947, similar to the mortgage debentures of the Dublin United Transport Company, also redeemable in that year which are to be carried over.  The total of the subsidiary stocks of the Great Southern Railways named in Section 132 of the Bill amount to £976,961 nominal.  The total amount agreed to be redeemed for cash is £924,657 and the amount for substituted Government guaranteed debentures £15,104.  The amount of redeemable debentures (1947) to be carried over as a contract liability is £37,200.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="381" /> There was also a long standing loan repayable to the London, Midland and Scottish Railway Company, amounting to £100,000 which it has been agreed to repay in cash.  The nominal total of stock and loans agreed to be redeemed for cash is £1,024,657.  The balance sheet of the company on 31st December last showed that the depreciation and renewal fund stood at £850,000.  In the other businesses fund depreciation then stood at £651,101, the Contingency fund stood at £218,591 and General Reserves, £235,022, making a total of £1,954,714.  On the other side of the account cash at bankers was £754,801 and investments, £476,768.  The balance to the debit of capital account was £1,114,232.  That represents the extent to which the funds held against various reserve and capital accounts have been debited to capital.  Cash at bankers amounted to £754,801 and investments to £476,768.  Portion of the investments have been sold, and, with the cash at bankers, have been used to pay off these loans and capital bearing interest at 4 per cent. per annum, or more.  In the case of the amounts redeemed to the London, Midland and Scottish Company, the rate of interest worked out at 4.97 per cent. on £313,800 and in the present year the interest charge would have been higher.  The interest payable was determined by the earnings of the North Wall extension line.  The position, therefore, of the company was that, as no money could be expended upon repairs and renewals, owing to the difficulty of obtaining materials, and as the money held against these various accounts could only be invested at 3 per cent., it was regarded as sound business to pay off capital bearing interest at a rate higher than 3 per cent., because, with the Government guaranteed debentures, it will be an easy matter to re-borrow the money, if and when required, at 3 per cent.  The saving in interest to the company by reason of the utilisation of these funds to redeem the substituted debenture stocks in cash is approximately £30,000 a year.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are glad to get the additional information even now, but nothing we have heard in the <Col N="382" /> general discussion reduces in any way our opposition.  The whole episode of the passing of this Bill through the House will be regarded later on as a very queer chapter in both the railway and political history of the county, and I do not think the Bill could have gone through as it has gone through but for the fact that the political and economic intelligence of the country was completely exhausted as a result of the circumstances under which the people exist.  The Bill, in my opinion, will be a serious blow to our agricultural industry, on the one hand, and to the working population, particularly in the City of Dublin, on the other.  A huge amount of capital debt is to be wiped out within the next few years, as was done in the case of the Dublin United Transport Company, against the opinion expressed in the Report of the Transport Inquiry of 1939 and against the very direct warning to the Government that that capital should not have been paid off within that time.</P>
      <P>The fact is that it is possible only because of the extraordinary circumstances of the present emergency, when people's conception of the burdens they were bearing was completely distorted and when emergency conditions made it utterly impossible for them to understand what they ought to be paying for any particular class of goods or any particular class of services.  &ldquo;We are of opinion that the company should not be empowered to charge such fares as may be necessary to earn a net revenue sufficiently large to enable this proposal to be carried out&rdquo;&mdash; that is what the tribunal said with regard to the proposed paying back of about £1,100,000 of capital debt of the Dublin United Transport Company within ten years.  It has been paid off in a lesser period, and only because the people could not understand, in the general circumstances of the emergency, what they ought to pay for transport in the City of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They have been paying these unnecessarily high rates at a time when the Government was taxing the people in every possible way and distributing additional relief by way of cash or vouchers to help the very people who were being mulcted in transport <Col N="383" /> charges to provide food and clothing for their families.  In Dublin, 50 per cent. of the capital debt at that time has been paid off in that way and now, under the new proposals for the transport system as a whole, it is proposed, in extraordinary times, that something near 75 per cent. of £13,000,000 odd is to be paid back, or paid off, between now and 1960, a very large part of that being capital which has been brought to life simply by the operation of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated during the discussion here that the principle was that transport charges should be what the traffic would bear.  In 1795, Richard Griffith, a member of the Royal Irish Academy at that time, in a pamphlet headed: &ldquo;Thoughts and facts relating to the increase of agriculture, manufactures and commerce in the country&rdquo;, drew attention to the fact that some years before, in 1759,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the market of our capital was left open and unprotected to the farmers on the western coast of England, who supplied Dublin with corn at a less expense of carriage by sea, than the Irish farmers beyond ten miles around the city could supply it by land....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Irish House of Commons at that time</P>
    <P>&ldquo;brought forward a Bill granting bounties on the inland and coast carriage of corn to Dublin; and as those bounties were calculated to pay the whole expense of such carriage, the Irish farmer thereby obtained an advantage over every foreign competitor.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At that time, because of the inadequacy of transport, the Irish farmer had to be subsidised in order to be able to compete with the farmer on the western side of Great Britain because it was cheaper to bring corn grown in the west of Great Britain to Dublin by sea than to bring it from ten miles outside Dublin into Dublin. He was dealing with the matter because he wanted to make the point that had the bounties &mdash; and between 1759 and 1794, £1,600,000 was paid out in bounties in order to bring Irish <Col N="384" /> grown corn into the City of Dublin &mdash; been applied in a judicious and systematic encouragement of inland navigation, there would have been an immense increase in agriculture, manufactures and commerce.</P>
    <P>I believe this Bill will drive the Irish farmer back into a position somewhat analogous to his position in 1759 when he had to get a bounty to bring his produce into the City of Dublin at a saleable price which would enable him to compete with outside producers. Every other country in the world is organising and systematising its transport system to give cheap and efficient transport.  We are organising our transport system to-day in a single monopoly, under a single man, but we are asking it to carry an amount of dead capital which has been brought to life and which will put a crushing burden both on agriculture &mdash; and, of course, every other form of transport which has to go through the country; I am mentioning the direction in which we are most vulnerable and in which we are likely to be most affected, that is, agricultural production, on which much of our economy is based &mdash; and on workers in the city.  It is only possible because of the distorted condition with regard to charges of the mind of our people.  The transport charge for bringing a ton of turf to Dublin at present is 37/6 because of the conditions under which we exist.  When the turf scheme was started, it was 6/- per ton.  The fact that we are forced, in present circumstances, to suffer these types of charges has had such an effect on our people's minds that there has not been the discussion, particularly by Deputies on the benches behind the Government, which this measure demands there should be.</P>
    <P>It is largely because of the general effect which this Bill will have on the economy of the country that we oppose it.  But we are also opposed to what is being done in this Bill, that is, that the owners of capital that was practically dead are to be made the owners of the new company of £13,000,000, to be extended later on to a possible limit of £20,000,000, The owners of common stock of the railway company are to <Col N="385" /> be made the owners of that company and the report into the stock exchange transactions with regard to railway stocks shows that 21 per cent., or approximately one-fifth of the common stock, changed hands between 3rd January, 1943, and, I think, 21st November, 1943.  It is to the owners then of stock that was practically dead, and one-fifth of which has changed hands in the circumstances of 1943, that we are handling over the ownership of this company and giving them an absolute and complete monopoly over all the public transport of the country.  Then, when we are reduced to putting the complete direction and control of this company into the hands of one man, because he is that particular man, we are putting ourselves in an extraordinary position. However, as I say, the whole business of the passing of this Bill will be looked upon as a queer chapter in both railway and political history.  Here, on the Fifth Stage, we are still as opposed to it as we were when it first saw the light.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The terms of this Bill demonstrate in a very convincing way how far the present Minister for Industry and Commerce has travelled and how circuitous his route has been since he told the House in 1931 that Fianna Fáil stood for a nationalised railway undertaking and a municipalised transport system.  In 1931, the Minister believed in the nationalisation of transport, in the national ownership and control of the railway services of the country.  After making an attempt at legislation in 1932 and 1933 and in 1944, and with evidence over the past 13 years of the incompetent and inefficient way in which the railway undertaking has been run, the Minister comes to the House again in 1944 with a most audacious Bill designed to buttress up the existing incompetently and inefficiently administered railway service, but on this occasion designed also to ensure that the stockholders of this company are to get from the State in the future a guarantee of the repayment of £16,000,000 debenture stock, and a guarantee, during the unredeemed currency of that stock, of <Col N="386" /> interest at the rate of 3 per cent. per annum.</P>
      <P>I regard transport, and I think the nation generally regards transport, as a very vital national service, as something which links up our whole national life, as something vital to the maintenance of our present complex industrial, agricultural and commercial life, and as something which, in a progressive State, must be administered on the basis of maximum efficiency. Here in this country we have a long history of inefficient and effete transport administration, an administration which has given us a costly and inefficient transport system, and which has given us railway stocks which have been described by the Minister in terms almost of transport junk.  From time to time over the past 20 years this House has been called upon to try to make good the ravages of incompetent railway administration.  From time to time we have been told by various Ministers that the step then about to be taken would surely put the railways on a firm basis.  After a few years, we saw these prophecies falsified.  We saw the railways stagger on to greater and still greater inefficiency, and we saw the service to the community, so far as these railways companies are concerned, repeatedly deteriorating.</P>
      <P>Here again we are making another effort to buttress up the same type of inefficiency.  It is true that on this occasion we have found, apparently, a transport administrator who, at all events, has thrilled the Minister and the Government by his transport capabilities. On his character, or on his transport abilities I do not desire to make the slightest reflection whatever. But I do want to make this observation, that, if the Minister imagines that he will create a situation in which a very incompetently administered transport service, financed as this undertaking has been in the past and as it is financed to-day, will in a short space of time become an efficient servant of the people by providing a cheap and efficient transport service, then I think the Minister is pinning his faith to a hope which I doubt is capable of realisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I came across an incident the other <Col N="387" /> day which I think typifies the type of railway management we have had in the past and shows, too, that we have not, even at this stage, got away from the mentality of the past so far as transport administration is concerned. I came across the other day the case of a man of 65½ years of age who was first employed as a bus driver on the old Clondalkin bus service in 1917.  In 1925, his services were taken over by the Irish Omnibus Company.  In 1927 the Irish Omnibus Company was absorbed by the Great Southern Railways, and he served the Great Southern Railways until July last.  Having given a service of approximately 27 years to transport in this country, that man has been told by the Great Southern Railways that his services are no longer required as he has now reached the age of 65.  When he inquired what compensation, gratuity or pension he would get from the railway company, he was told that the board had decided to make him an <i>ex gratia</i> grant of £5 in appreciation of his services. Five pounds grant to a man who had given 27 years in the transport service &mdash; an appreciation at the rate probably of 1d. per week for that service over that period of 27 years.  The railway company is simply casting that man out.  He has no income; he has £5 which he has received from the railway company and for the rest of his life he must go to the employment exchange, convince the authorities there that he cannot get work again as a bus-driver or in a bus undertaking, and try to subsist on whatever pittance he can get in that way.  It would be difficult to discover a greater indictment of the type of muddled mentality that exists in this benighted railway administration.</P>
    <P>When one adverts to the circumstances of that case, one realises how inhuman this railway company can be to an employee.  On the other hand, how generous are the community going to be to the same railway company by guaranteeing the stockholders interest at the rate of 3 per cent. per annum, whether the company makes a profit or not, and guaranteeing the repayment in full of £16,000,000 of debenture <Col N="388" /> stock.  It is outrageous to regard the company's debenture assets as worth the £9,000,000 referred to.  These debenture assets have been hopelessly written up.  They have been written up largely because of the fact that it was known, whether by intelligent anticipation or by the exercise of telepathic science, that the Government would throw in a guarantee of 3 per cent. per annum during the currency of these debenture stocks.  Whatever the position may be in that respect, the naked truth is that the community will guarantee this interest at the rate of 3 per cent. per annum whether the railway company makes a profit or not.</P>
    <P>It may well be that the Minister, with the power he can exercise under this Bill, will be able to compel the railway company so to order its business that it will be able to earn an income capable of paying the dividends. If that is so, the company is only going to pay the dividends by mulcting the trading community and the travelling public in charges which will be outrageously excessive.  The community, therefore, are put in this position, that if they want to pay the shareholders this 3 per cent. per annum on the £16,000,000 worth of debenture stock, and if they want to pay the common stockholders 6 per cent. on £4,000,000 worth of common stock, they can only do so by subjecting themselves to very high transport charges.  If they do not want to pay high transport charges, they can annually subject themselves to taxation, so as to enable the company and the shareholders to get income in the form of direct or indirect taxation, which, because of public protest, they cannot get in the form of higher transport charges.</P>
    <P>When the Government went to the extent of pledging the State's credit at £16,000,000 for debenture stock, plus a guarantee of 3 per cent. per annum for dividends, I think the State ought to have gone where the Minister contemplated in 1931 they would have gone, namely, to the extent of taking over on fair terms the assets, whatever they may be, of the Dublin United Transport Company and the assets of the <Col N="389" /> Great Southern Railways and make the transport undertaking of this country a nationalised undertaking, owned by the whole community and operated in the name of the whole community &mdash; owned and operated, not for the purpose of paying dividends to those with money to invest in a transport undertaking, but in order to give the public the cheapest and most efficient service it is possible, in our circumstances, to provide for them.</P>
    <P>I object to a vital service such as transport being utilised as a medium to pay dividends to investors.  The public depend to too great an extent on the transport service for their complex methods of life to permit that service to be made the plaything of investors.  I should have thought from his utterances in 1931 that the Minister would long since have broken with the concept of a transport system based upon transport for the public only if the public are willing to pay the investors' ransom.  We are providing a transport system, guaranteeing out of the pockets of the travelling public dividends to those who invest in the undertaking.  I think an enlightened undertaking would have recognised, as is the case in respect of light and water and national roads, that these services, transport included, are so vital to the community that profit-taking could not be permitted and that it is desirable in the public interest that there should be a nationalised, non-profitmaking transport system.</P>
    <P>However, the Minister has now reached the stage when he is satisfied to abandon the 1931 declaration and the Government are perfectly satisfied, as were other administrations here, to permit the transport system to be operated as a privately capitalised, profitmaking monopoly.  That is unfair to the travelling public.</P>
    <P>Whatever the fate of this legislation may be, and whatever may be the ultimate fate of the Great Southern Railways, public opinion, progressive as it is in matters of this kind, will, I venture to suggest to the Minister, shortly reach the stage when it will insist that there should be no profits made at the expense of the travelling public and that transport ought to be <Col N="390" /> provided for the whole community on the cheapest possible basis consistent with the maintenance of the most efficient services.  In that way you can best serve the interests of the travelling public and the trading community and I venture to say that these interests will be better served by the operation of a nationally-owned and controlled transport undertaking than they could possibly be served by the creation of what will be established under this Bill, namely, a private, profitmaking undertaking which puts the claims of its investors far and away above the claims of the travelling and the trading public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose the motion that this Bill do now pass on three grounds. I oppose it, first of all, because I regard this Bill as the speculator's Magna Charta in Ireland; secondly, because I believe that the transport of the country could be very much better provided for along the lines adumbrated by me on the Second Stage of the Transport (No. 1) Bill; and, thirdly, because this Bill contains in it the proviso that there should be upon the Government a contingent liability to pay the interest on the debentures and the principal, if the necessity should arise, in the event of the railway company being unable to pay it.</P>
      <P>Let us examine these three grounds. Shortly before the last dissolution a resolution was passed by this House setting up a tribunal to inquire into a situation which was agreed upon all sides of the House to constitute a scandal.  I remember saying on that occasion that whatever scandal had taken place at least the people might take consolation in the fact that all Parties in Dáil Eireann were resolved to have the matter exhaustively investigated and appropriate steps taken to remedy any evil which might have developed.  The House parted in that atmosphere, that, whatever individuals might have done, the Legislature was determined to do its utmost to prevent the exploitation of poor and simple people by the less scrupulous elements of the community.  The tribunal having heard such evidence as they had access to, made their report.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt of that. The Bill, as it at present stands in amended form, can be passed or can be rejected.  If you pass the Bill, you set up in this country a Magna Charta for speculators.  If you reject the Bill, you frustrate the purpose of those who bought shares for £9 from simple, poor citizens of this State, and sold them for £55.  There are more important things in the life of a country than making engines run, and motor cars travel, and lorries carry merchandise. The reputation of a country to have no part in corrupt financial transactions of that kind is infinitely more important than any detail of transport. I say that this Bill permits that which should never have been permitted in this country, and that is the exploitation of inside knowledge.  If only for that reason alone I would vote against this Bill.  I would vote against this Bill to make it manifest for all <Col N="394" /> time that any group of citizens of this country who sought to take advantage of information that they had of the intention of the legislature, which was not available to all, to enrich themselves at the expense of the more defenceless sections of the community, would find on all sides of this House a resolute determination to frustrate their efforts at whatever cost.

      <P>The Minister must consider himself the champion of certain seedy interests.  He need not imagine that he or his friends can intimidate me from saying what I believe to be true about this whole scabrous transaction. I shall continue to deal with it in public as long as I have the voice to protest against such dealings and nothing the Minister or his associates can say will deter me for a single hour. No threat, no combination of powerful moneyed interests, to operate a form of blackmail of public men lest we should refer to their depredations, will stop me from talking as long as my voice can be used to hold up the gentlemen responsible for that kind of business in the public life of this country.  They need not imagine that, by getting the Minister to take their side or making him their champion, any combination of wealth or threats will silence criticism of what has gone on.  That is the first ground on which I ask the House to reject this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second ground on which I ask the House to reject this Bill is this. What we are in effect doing, if we pass this Bill, is giving to a private company, which has virtually no assets&mdash; the permanent way of the railway company <Col N="398" /> and its existing railway stock are more of a liability than an asset &mdash; the very substantial asset of a transport monopoly in this country.  I want to ask this House why we should give to the shareholders of Córas Iompair Éireann a monopoly in transport in this country, any more than we would give to Clery's a monopoly of the distributive trade in O'Connell Street or the City of Dublin.  The only argument for any justification of this is that the railway company has gone bankrupt and that if we do not aid it, it will close down altogether.</P>
    <P>Why should we give to this company a monopoly of the transport of Ireland? What particular virtue resides in the shareholders of the Great Southern Railways and the Dublin United Transport Company that they should become the repository of that?  And if, for some incomprehensible reason, we do decide to present them with all these assets of considerable value, why do we go on doing so, and furthermore, capitalise the asset we give them, saying we will step in to guarantee the dividend on it and guarantee the principal?  I am sure Deputy Loughman would be very grateful if we would confer a monopoly on him in his particular business in Clonmel, and I would be very grateful to Dáil Éireann if it would confer a monopoly on me of the distributive trade in Ballaghaderreen &mdash; never mind the whole country &mdash;and then say also that it will guarantee the payment of a regular dividend on the shares.  Whether the fellow works early or late or goes to bed and stays in bed all the time, we are to say: &ldquo;Never worry; on the 31st December every year you will get the dividend you expected to get, because the State will pay it, if you do not choose to operate your enterprise in such a way as to produce it itself.&rdquo;  Surely that is daft?</P>
    <P>We could perfectly honourably, perfectly equitably and perfectly legally, have gone to the Great Southern Railways, when this transport legislation was in contemplation, and said that we were going to take over the whole railway, assets, liabilities and everything else, and appoint an arbitrator, not to deprive the shareholders of the Great <Col N="399" /> Southern Railways of anything they have had but to give them full value for everything we took over from them.  We could perfectly easily have created and issued stock, just as we do when taking over land from the landlord and, instead of giving them land bonds, we could give them railway bonds.  We could have gone to the Dublin United Transport Company and said that, as at a given date, we were taking over the whole company and that arbitrators would determine the full value of the property.  There would be no question of compensation or of penalisation, but we would say: &ldquo;We want you to get the full value of what we are taking over.&rdquo;  We could have given them transport bonds in the same way.</P>
    <P>Then we could have set up a body like the Electricity Supply Board and handed over the whole transport of the country to them.  We could have given the board instructions to coordinate transport, to make known their road requirements to the Government, so that the Government could take requisite measures to provide adequate roads for the type of transport that may be required in this country for 25 or 30 years to come.  We could have instructed them, either to levy freights on the merchandise and passengers carried, large enough to provide an annual contribution to the Exchequer, or we could have told them to levy freights at a level which would just defray the expenses of the transport board.  Or we could have gone further and, if we deemed it expedient, in order to assist agriculture by exports or something of that kind, we might have said to that transport company: &ldquo;Exempt all feeding stuffs and live stock from any charge for freight at all and the Government will give you a lump sum annually, to defray whatever expenses you may have been put to in carrying these things.&rdquo;  That would amount to an indirect subsidy to the agricultural industry.  All these alternatives would have been open to us, had we established a corporation primarily designed to serve the community, an independent transport board on the lines of the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="400" /> Deputy Norton made reference to Mr. Reynolds.  I want to be associated with him in saying that nothing I say here is to be interpreted as an attack on Mr. Reynolds.  On the contrary, if Deputies will refer to the speech I made on the Second Reading Stage of Transport Bill (No. 1), they will find that I suggested to the Minister then that, probably, Mr. Reynolds should be one of the first three members of the transport board, were it set up. I am not qualified to judge the merit of his work.  Certain it is, I think, that most people will agree that he threw himself with energy and zeal into the job he undertook, and that he undertook the job which he now has at a time when it did not look too attractive a proposition to anybody.  But I want to demur to this proposition, which was one made at one stage by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in this House, that consequent on his taking over and on the new arrangement, whereby he had a coercive voice on the board of the railway company, superior management resulted in the accumulation of funds which permitted the payment of 3 per cent. dividend on the ordinary stock. That is just hooey.  The process by which 3 per cent. was collected for the ordinary stockholders was by raising the freight charges steeply.  There was no longer any opposition, as there was no petrol for the lorries.  We had to pay the freight charges or leave our goods at the railhead.  When petrol becomes available again and when individual citizens and firms are in a position to operate their own lorries and motor cars, a different situation will obtain.  In the absence of private cars and lorries, freight rates have risen in some cases, I believe, by 100 per cent.  In other cases, they have risen by a percentage so dramatic as to induce the Secretary of the Department of Finance, a member of the board of the sugar company, to protest publicly &mdash; and that despite the fact that the Minister for Industry and Commerce deemed it his duty to get up here and say that that member of the board of the sugar company did not understand what he was talking about. That is an old saw.  We have heard that &ldquo;crack&rdquo; not infrequently across <Col N="401" /> the floor of this House.  But if the citizens of this State had to choose between the perspicacity of that member of the sugar board and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who would have any doubt as to where their preference would lie?  It was as a result of increases in freight charges, typified by that incident, that 3 per cent. was raised for the ordinary stockholders of the railway company, who included the speculators &mdash; the boys who got the wink, wherever they got it.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the last reason why I ask the House to reject this Bill. Most well brought-up men and women in this House received at some stage of their adolescence this precept from their parents: never go bail for a man in the bank.  If somebody comes and asks you to bail him in the bank, make up how much you can afford to lose and give him a present of that but never go bail in the bank.  What does Section 18 of this Bill mean?  Are we not all going bail in the bank?  But, with commendable prudence, we are going bail in the bank not with our own money but with our neighbour's money.  Do not Deputies remember Charles Lamb's essay on the two classes of men &mdash; the men who borrow and the men who lend?  He describes the man who lends as a dreary, mean, gloomy creature who is always sidling up to you and saying: &ldquo;Are you going to pay anything on the debt you owe me?&rdquo;  Then, he describes the man who borrows as a hearty, genial, optimistic chap whom it is a pleasure to meet, who is always glad to see you, who claps you on the back and tells you not to worry, that his ship will be coming in any time now and that if you care to lend him another five pounds he will put it on the bill.  He is never gloomy or worried but always hale and hearty.  He is always prepared, if pressed, to send the letter that a famous debtor sent when he received a communication from one of his legion of creditors to the effect that that creditor wanted to be paid forthwith.  The debtor took up his pen and wrote in reply: &ldquo;Dear Sir &mdash; I have received your impertinent communication.  Please take notice that if I receive any more of those insolent demands, I will not even put you <Col N="402" /> in the lottery of creditors which I conduct each one of whom is eligible for an instalment.&rdquo;  That is what the railway company is in a position to say to us.  In five or ten years, petrol will be available and private cars and lorries will be on the roads.  This company proceeds to increase its freight rates. Protests are heard from all sides. Eventually, the commercial community, in their own defence, are driven to using their own lorries rather than pay the freight charges demanded by the railway company.  Private individuals buy their own cars.  Neighbours combine to drive up to Dublin rather than go in the train because railway fares will be so high.  Then, a representative of the railway company comes to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and says: &ldquo;You can do one of two things: either persuade the Minister for Finance to take such steps as will render it uneconomic for the private lorry owner and car owner to use their vehicles in competition with us or go to the Minister for Finance and tell him that your transport scheme has broken down, that the railway company cannot earn the interest on its debenture stock and that the Minister for Finance must introduce a Supplementary Estimate in Dáil Eireann to repay the Central Fund for the cash disbursed to make up the dividends on the debenture stock which the railway company is unable to pay.&rdquo;  Observe the alternatives open to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He can go to the Minister for Finance and say: &ldquo;Put an extra tax on the tyres, petrol and horsepower of the private motor car and lorry.  That will mean more revenue for you and permit of your reducing taxation in another direction.&rdquo; That is a pleasant thing to do in Dáil Eireann.  Or the Minister for Industry and Commerce can say to the Minister for Finance: &ldquo;Get up in Dáil Eireann and make an <i>apologia pro vita mea</i>, tell them that I was a damn fool, that all my gaudy promises about Transport Bill No. 2 were not worth the paper and ink with which they were written, that the railway company cannot pay and ask the Dáil to find the money to make up the debenture interest. Faeed with these two alternatives, what do Deputies think the <Col N="403" /> House will do?  Does not every Deputy know that, by hook or by crook, the Minister will create a situation in which the Transport Company will have such an advantage over the private lorry and private car that they will be virtually driven off the road except in so far as the wealthy citizen can operate a Rolls Royce or a Daimler.  That is what this provision means.</P>
    <P>Mind you, when the Minister comes to that, it is not going to be done in an overt, open way.  It will probably be done by giving Córas Iompair Eireann concessions which will constitute an additional burden on ordinary users of the road, and which will place the railway company in a very much more advantageous position.  The cost of the concession will be levied on the ordinary taxpayers of whom the ordinary car owner and lorry owner constitute a very large part.  That will all come about as a result of Deputies in this House forgetting the precept given them by their parents: &ldquo;Never bail a man in the bank.&rdquo;  You are bailing a man in the bank to-day, and he will come back in five years and demand either that you should take up his bill or that you should create in him an artificial ability to raise the money requisite to pay the commitments into which he has entered. Now we are letting ourselves in for all that when an infinitely preferable method is there available to us &mdash; to constitute a transport board, as ultimately we shall have to do.  That is as certain as we are in this House. Sooner or later a transport board will have to be set up.  Because we cannot face that now we are creating all these complications and difficulties for ourselves.  For what?  I admit that it is sometimes a mistake to model oneself too closely on one's neighbours, but I think it is a useful thing to look abroad, to judge by the mistakes of others and to learn from their successes. In the City of Greater London we had a situation closely analogous to that which arose here &mdash; a vast number of rival traction companies all operating for profit, and the superior rights of the travelling public were asserted, with the limited right of <Col N="404" /> these individual companies to earn a profit.  The London Passenger Transport Board was set up with certain very limited rights to pay dividends but with the primary duty of serving the public in London.  Why could we not do that here?</P>
    <P>Bear this in mind: You are constituting a company.  Its real tangible asset is its monopoly, but it has got miles and miles of railway line.  I may be right, or I may be wrong, but I believe the future of transport in this country lies on the roads.  I believe that any far-seeing transport man must plan to put the whole transport of the country on the roads in 25 or 30 years' time.  How can any company undertake that task effectively &mdash; because to do it effectively two things must be done.  Firstly, years before transport goes over to the roads, a proper system of roads must be provided; and secondly, somebody must take the decision of abandoning the existing railways.  Now, if you propose to abandon the existing permanent way, it would be very hard to get the shareholders to agree to that proposal, but yet, taking the longer view, the view of the community and of the State, that might be, and probably is, the right thing to do, gradually.  I do not mean that any sane man would contemplate doing it the day after tomorrow, but that he should make up his mind that over the next 20 or 25 years they will be abandoned, and that all the traffic of the country will be carried over the roads.  Can Córas Iompair Éireann or a transport board best take that decision?  Surely a transport board which was not primarily concerned with the redemption of debentures, the accumulation of profits or the payment of dividends, whose sole concern was to provide for the country the most efficient system of transport that our resources would permit, could better undertake that job than Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>
    <P>Suppose that the Electricity Supply Board were at present being run by a profit-making corporation, and suppose Deputies knew well that in certain areas it was in the interests of the community that the Electricity Supply Board should take a risk by going into <Col N="405" /> a town where there was not such a demand at present for electricity that would justify the expenditure on the poles and wires required to go into that town.  Has not each one of us in the case of our own town gone to the Electricity Supply Board and made the case that if this were a purely business proposition, one could not in conscience go and recommend the Electricity Supply Board to connect up the town but that, bearing in mind the social benefit that such extension as you were suggesting would confer, you felt entitled as a responsible man to urge the board to take the risk of some years' loss, partly in anticipation of getting an economic demand in the long run but mainly on the consideration that as a semi-public body they had a certain duty to the community and that even though this extension never paid dividends, it was a legitimate charge on the whole of the electricity system of the State?  How can you make that case to Córas Iompair Eireann unless you are prepared to go the next step and say to them: &ldquo;If this involves you in such a loss that 3 per cent. will not be available for the debenture stock, Dáil Eireann will provide it&rdquo;?  Can you conceive the Minister telling us that the transport legislation which he had put through this House has failed in its purpose and that the railway company cannot produce the dividend?  The railway company will produce dividends every year of its existence.  It will produce them but who will pay them?  The people who use the transport system. And who are the people who are going to use the transport system?</P>
    <P>The vast bulk of the use to which our transport system is going to be put is bringing in the raw materials of industry and carrying to the ports of embarkation the surplus agricultural produce which we consign to the markets of the world.  We have taxed these raw materials with customs duties. We have restricted imports.  We have placed on the farmers who are trying to produce the only exports which will ultimately pay for the essential imports which we must have after the war, many imposts.  Is this House, with its eyes wide open, going to place on their backs a new additional impost, <Col N="406" /> not designed to assist the Exchequer, not designed to finance some desirable new social service to alleviate the conditions of the poor, not designed to make life easier for some other sections of the community, but designed to give his pound of flesh to the gentleman who bought the poor man's shares at £9 each, shares which to-day are value for £55?  This Transport Bill is going to be a cause of infinite trouble to our country.  We have a clear and reasonable alternative if we choose to adopt it.  We still can adopt it to-day. I have no doubt the Leader of the Opposition will provide the House with the opportunity of going on record as to whether it wants this Bill or not. If he does not do so, then perhaps the Leader of the Labour Party will; but if both should fail at least one voice will be raised for a Division in this House, and I do not doubt that I shall get the requisite half-dozen to stand up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking on this Bill in its earlier stages I said that I was afraid that the fare-paying section of the public and the freightpaying section of the community in general, would be asked in future to pay an unduly high cost for transport in this country.  That, I think, is the kernel of this whole Bill.  Here and there in the Bill there are aspects that are perhaps good and that will perhaps turn out all right but, generally speaking, I fear that the community in general are going to pay to this company, which has been put in a position of absolute monopoly, too high a price for the privilege of carrying their goods and carrying themselves as passengers.  I might speak on the Bill for over an hour and not say any more in essence than that.  I am very much afraid that we have not adequate safeguards to protect us. Now, the Minister will have to turn around and devise other things in the future as a means of that protection, but I am afraid that we are going to pay dearly for our transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I want to refer especially to Section 52 of this Bill.  Section 52 is that portion of the Bill which deals <Col N="407" /> with the payment of wayleaves made by the tramway company in the past, and the present transport company, to the Dublin Corporation and the Dun Laoghaire Borough Corporation &mdash; a payment which, I maintain, is a monopoly payment and which, I think, the Minister has tried to make out as being, very largely, a payment for the usage of trams on the roadways of those two bodies.  Now, in Section 52 there is sub-section (4), and that sub-section, which is the kernel of the whole matter, states that the arbitrator &mdash; who has to go into this question of what sum is to be paid to those two local authorities &mdash; shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case.  Now, that is mandatory.  The sub-section says that: &ldquo;he shall have regard to all the circumstances&rdquo;.  Every circumstance which has any bearing on this question of the wayleaves is to be considered by the arbitrator, and I must emphasise the words &ldquo;all the circumstances&rdquo;. In other words, every circumstance that may exist must come under that phrase &ldquo;all the circumstances&rdquo;; but then, in the second part of that sub-section (4), it says that the arbitrator &ldquo;may have regard, so far as he considers equitable, to the extent to which the roadways of that road authority have ceased to be used or will cease to be used for the purpose of tramways&rdquo;.  I submit to the Minister and to this House that if the first part of the sub-section, which is mandatory, and under which the arbitrator has to consider all the circumstances, has any meaning, then it renders the second part of the sub-section, which is permissive, as either tautological &mdash; and, therefore, may be struck out &mdash; or as being suggestive to the arbitrator that one of the chief things for the arbitrator to consider is the extent to which roadways have ceased to be used for trams.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to go back over the whole ground, as we had a long discussion on it on the Committee Stage, but I suggest that the second part of sub-section (4), when viewed in that manner, has a sinister meaning.  It can only mean one of two things.  It can only have the meaning that it is <Col N="408" /> tautology or that it is suggesting to the arbitrator that one of the chief things of which he must take account is the question of the extent to which the roadways have ceased to be used for trams.  If that is the procedure, then why did not the Bill suggest to the arbitrator that he might also have regard to the extent to which buses had been increased or to which lines of buses had been extended over portions of the roadways where buses never ran before?  Why pick on the cessation of trams and leave out the increase of buses?  I would ask the Minister, when he sends this Bill to the Seanad, to strike out that portion of sub-section (4).  Now, in connection with that sub-section, the Minister, when we were discussing this matter on the Committee Stage, made a rather significant statement.  I am quoting from the Dáil reports.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In so far as there is an allocation out of the Road Fund to local authorities, in proportion to the amount contributed in the local authorities' areas, the corporation will still continue to receive a certain sum in respect of the amount paid by the company in road tax.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, that really means that the Minister was saying: &ldquo;Oh, in so far as there is a payment out of the Road Fund, you people will get an increase in tax for the amount got on the roads; the trams will go off, but you will be recompensed by the increased taxation on the buses.&rdquo;  That, on the face of it, appears to be quite fair, but unfortunately it has no relation to the facts, and I should like, in this connection, to give some figures as to the amounts contributed in motor taxation from the City of Dublin and the amounts received from the Road Fund grant by Dublin City.  In the year ended 31st March, 1931, the amount contributed in motor taxation from the City of Dublin was £256,848, and the amount received from the Road Fund grant by Dublin City was £38,383.  In 1932, the amount contributed in motor taxation from the City of Dublin was £282,003, and the amount received by the corporation from the Road Fund grant was £72,440.  In 1933 the amount contributed in motor taxation from <Col N="409" /> the City of Dublin &mdash; they did slightly better in that year &mdash; was £265,631, and they got from the Road Fund grant £117,835, but that included a special grant of £51,000.  In 1934 the amount contributed from the City of Dublin was £261,044, and the amount they received was £50,000.  In 1935 the amount contributed in motor taxation was £272,145, and the corporation got £50,000.  In 1936, the amount contributed in motor taxation was £279,338, and the amount received from the Road Fund grant was £51,032.  In 1937 the figures, respectively were £306,019, and £49,278.  In 1938 they raised from motor taxation £309,254, and the corporation received £51,000.  In 1939 the amount raised was £326,403, and the corporation received £51,000.  In 1940 they raised £321,538, and the corporation received £51,000.  That is the last year for which I have figures.  By quoting those figures I hope to correct the misapprehension under which the Minister appears to be labouring: that there is any direct relationship between the number of vehicles registered in Dublin and the amount received from the Road Fund by the Dublin Corporation.  That fact completely blows through the roof the idea that, by virtue of more buses being put on the road, the Dublin Corporation benefits by a penny.  I wish to clear away that impression for fear the arbitrator, or anybody else, would have the idea that the corporation and, as a consequence the citizens of Dublin might benefit.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I am not surprised that there should be a certain amount of confusion in the Minister's mind on this question, because the whole subject of payments out of the Road Fund to the local authorities is one of absolute confusion.  No local authority knows what it is going to get and it does not know why it gets it.  I hope at a later stage to raise this question in greater detail.  I want Deputies to be clear in their minds on this: that local authorities affected by this question of wayleaves will not benefit one penny by the extra buses that may be put on the roads.  In conclusion, I would ask the Minister to strike out the offending portion of sub-section <Col N="410" /> (4), Section 52, if not in the interests of justice, which I believe to be on the side of the corporation in this matter, then at least in the interests of accuracy.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon appeared to be rather worried lest the other Opposition Parties would fail in their duty to call a division on this Stage of the Bill.  I do not think the Deputy need have any fears about that.  So far as we of the Farmers' Party are concerned, we have opposed the Bill at every stage mainly on the ground that it constitutes a menace, and a permanent menace, to agriculture, which is the primary industry of the country. It is a menace to the development and expansion of that industry and to its very existence.  It constitutes that menace by reason of the extraordinary and unjustifiable monopoly which this new company is being given, not only in regard to passenger traffic but also in regard to merchandise traffic.  Whatever justification there might be for a monopoly in regard to passenger traffic, there is none whatever for the monopoly which is being given to this new company for the carriage of goods by road.  This Bill seeks not only to perpetuate but to extend the restrictions placed by the 1933 Act upon the operation of licensed hauliers on the roads, thereby making it impossible for real competition to grow up in the conveyance of merchandise on the roads except in so far as competition is provided by the private lorry owner. I do not agree that the competition provided by the private lorry owner is sufficient to check the injustices which may be inflicted upon the agricultural community by this monopolist company. When we consider the type of organisation which is being set up to control transport, when we consider the manner in which this new company is being financed and the generosity with which the former railway company is being rewarded, we cannot escape the conviction that an excessive burden must and will be placed upon the general community in order to provide the finances necessary to implement this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The terms offered in the Bill to the railway company are far too generous, <Col N="411" /> having regard to the value of the assets which they hold at the present time. In particular, they are far too generous to those who became the holders of railway shares only a short time ago and purchased them at a very low price.  There is no justification whatever for asking the general community to come in now and reward those people so excessively.  On every occasion, when public property is acquired by the State, almost invariably machinery is set up to fix the amount of compensation to be awarded to private individuals.  When land is acquired for building or other purposes we usually have a tribunal set up or an arbitrator appointed to award the amount of compensation to be paid, but in this case the compensation is fixed by statute and on a scale which is so generous that there can be no possibility whatever of dissatisfaction on the part of the existing railway stockholders.  There can, however, be grave reason for dissatisfaction on the part of those who will have to foot the bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill makes provision for capital to the extent of more than £6,000,000, over and above what is required to compensate the existing transport companies. That means that £6,000,000 is being provided for the new company to play with.  That, in itself, constitutes a menace for those who have to depend on transport.  There will be the inevitable temptation for this new transport company to invest a large portion of this £6,000,000 in bringing the existing railway system up to date, a system which, in the course of a few years, may be found to be unnecessary and have to be scrapped.  We cannot, having regard to the sparse population of this country, maintain two thoroughly up-to-date and efficient transport systems: a railway system and a road system extending into every part of the country.</P>
    <P>One of them must go, and it is inevitable, sooner or later, that the railway system will go.  When this new company have invested the larger part of this £6,000,000 in modernising the railway system, they will be compelled to hang on to that system and to tie <Col N="412" /> the country to two systems of transport, although the traffic offering is not sufficient to justify their existence. Thus there will inevitably be placed upon the travelling community, upon the farmers, upon the consumers and every section of the community dependent upon the transport of merchandise, an excessive and everincreasing burden.  The Minister may say that there will always be the competition of the private car and the private lorry to protect the rights of the citizens.  Does anyone think for one moment that the Minister will stand by and allow the private car or the private lorry to force this new transport company into bankruptcy?  Is it not inevitable that immediately the private car and private lorry operate to the detriment of the new company, restrictions will be placed upon the private car, that even greater restrictions will be placed upon the private lorry, and, probably, still further restrictions will be placed upon the existing inadequate number of licensed hauliers.  All these restrictions will operate to prevent the expansion and development of our main industry.  It is the duty of every Deputy to make it clear that we do not stand for the agricultural industry and every productive industry in this country being put into a straitjacket, into a stranglegrip, in order to make profits for a chosen few, the few who will own this transport system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I think sufficient discussion has taken place concerning this Bill since it was first introduced and I do not intend to delay the House.  I cannot attempt to prophesy what effect the Bill will have when enacted either on the general economic position or on goods and passenger transport, but I certainly hope that the enactment of the measure and the setting up of the new transport company will result in a cheap and efficient transport system. I have a certain amount of confidence that when the new chairman secures control that that will be the position. There are certain portions of the Bill to which I take objection.  One is the right of the Minister to fix charges, even though they are the maximum charges.  No impartial body now <Col N="413" /> remains to which transport users may resort in order to ascertain the equity or otherwise of the passenger and freight charges fixed by the company. While the Minister has argued, with a good deal of truth, that the Railway Tribunal had ceased to function or, in actual fact, never functioned effectively as a body which could fix these charges, owing to the expense devolving upon the ordinary individuals or traders in securing adequate representation by counsel to meet the array of counsel which the company could afford to brief, nevertheless; I believe some independent and impartial body or tribunal should be available to which the public could resort for the purpose of ascertaining the equity or otherwise of the charges imposed by the company.  No such tribunal is provided for in the Bill and, that being so, it devolves upon the Minister for Industry and Commerce for the time being to fix &mdash; in the event of a dispute &mdash; a reasonable or a fair charge.</P>
      <P>I wish to impress upon the Minister the desirability of informing the new company, or the chairman, when he is appointed, of the essential needs of the country so far as transport is concerned. The first is that transport should be cheap and efficient and that the rates should not be higher than the passengers or goods are able to bear. As far as I can learn, the sugar company were allowed reduced freights for their products and for the transport of beet, and, I presume, of beet pulp to and from the factories, with the result that the railway company lost considerably on the transaction.  It is feasible that the company should lose on certain commodities and make up the loss on others.  Of course, it will be argued then that one class of goods, or one section of the community should not pay for the transport of other goods or other sections of the community. I understand that the rates which the company charges in regard to sugar beet and sugar products have now been increased with the result, apparently, that they are in excess of what the goods are able to bear or in excess of what would allow the sugar company a reasonable margin of profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the particular matters <Col N="414" /> about which I have some fears, and I should like the Minister to say what directions he proposes to give the chairman or that, when he is laying the appointment of the chairman on the Table of the House, he would give some indication to the House of the instructions which the chairman has been given in respect to these matters. It may be that for a time nothing will arise, but that after a period, when revision of transport charges or of conditions of transport is required, a certain amount of dispute may ensue and that the public must depend on the Minister, as guardian of their rights, to ensure that they get a fair deal.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to allow the company, so far as is possible, to operate freely without Ministerial control or interference, at the same time, bringing to bear on the company and on the chairman the fact that transport charges in this country have been high and that the general tendency is to have them higher than the goods and passengers are able to bear.  In the event of a transition from tramways to buses, while the actual charges may not be increased, by routeing and by distances, the same result may be secured by the company.  Many people have experience recently of the increased fares on buses over and above what were previously charged for the same journeys by the tramways.  In some cases, the total charge was the same but for intermediate stages the buses were charging a halfpenny more than the tramways.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say that I have been greatly pleased and heartened by the announcement from the Opposition Front Bench that they are going to continue their opposition to this Bill to the end?  With an unbroken record of 20 years, during which they were never right on any question of major importance, it is good to know they are still against us.  It proves that we are right on this occasion, and it makes it all the more probable that the Bill is a good one.  I was also glad to learn that the Farmers' Party, through its spokesman Deputy Cogan &mdash; I use the word &ldquo;spokesman&rdquo; as distinct from &ldquo;leader,&rdquo; as the strong, silent leader <Col N="415" /> is so strong and silent that he has not spoken at all &mdash; has informed us that they are also going to oppose the Bill to the end.</P>
      <P>It has been obvious in the discussions that we have had on the Bill that most of them had not read it and that those who had did not understand it.  I do not think that made any difference. Deputy Cogan announced that their opposition to the Bill was because they regarded it as a menace to agriculture, proving that they did not understand it, and apparently did not understand either the interests of the agricultural industry.  Deputy Mulcahy was right in saying that this Bill was the central feature of a queer chapter in the political history of this country.  I thought the main feature of that chapter was so queer that the Deputy would have had the good sense not to refer to it.  Undoubtedly it has had a chequered career and many incidents will be remembered when the details of the Bill are forgotten, but I do not think they will be remembered to the credit of the Fine Gael Party and of Deputy Dillon and Deputy Cogan who also spoke this afternoon.</P>
      <P>I am not going to transgress the bounds of order in this debate except to refer briefly to Deputy Dillon's observations arising out of the report of the tribunal of inquiry into certain transactions in railway stocks. Allegations were made regarding transactions in railway stocks, and because the allegations were made, a tribunal was set up, a tribunal composed of three eminent judges, which has reported that there was no foundation for these allegations.  The tribunal reported that not merely was there no evidence of a direct kind that there was any improper use or disclosure of information concerning the Government's proposals for the reorganisation of transport, but that the weight of circumstantial evidence showed that there was in fact no such improper use or disclosure.  Deputy Dillon says the tribunal's report is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether he implies that the eminent judges who composed the tribunal deliberately <Col N="416" /> produced a report contrary to the facts or whether he is seeking to imply that the facts were not available to them, his speech is, I think, more than contemptible in all the circumstances. Deputy Dillon was a witness before that tribunal.  He was one of the fathers of the allegation which led to its establishment and, on that account, he was brought before it as a witness.  As a witness he was asked to give evidence on oath and, on oath, he declared that he had not got one single item of fact to justify his allegations; but now that the tribunal has reported, now that the eminent judges have had all the facts and, on the basis of all the facts, given a verdict, Deputy Dillon, in the privileged circle of this House, says that the tribunal was squared, that the tribunal was misled, or was wrong, and that he is not going to accept its report.  I cannot hope to follow all the labyrinthine ways of Deputy Dillon's mind to find the cause of the bad smell that always emanates when he speaks, but I think all those Deputies who have any rules of decency by which to conduct public affairs and their part in public affairs will join me in expressing contempt for the speech delivered this afternoon by Deputy Dillon.</P>
    <P>I cannot follow the argument of Deputy Mulcahy that this Bill, when enacted and put into force, will operate to the detriment of the agricultural community or to the workers of Dublin. Certainly neither he nor those who joined with him in opposition to the Bill were able to convince the agricultural community or the workers of Dublin that the Bill was contrary to their interests.  We are setting our hand now to the task of reorganising the transport system.  We cannot complete that reorganisation until more normal conditions have arisen, but we can bring into being the framework of that organisation.  We can give it directing force; we can give it powers, and we can give it the means to avail of the material resources which will not become available until the war is over.  Our aim in doing that is to ensure that we will have better transport services after the war than we had before it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="417" /> Deputy Mulcahy says that we are going to impose on that new transport organisation a burden of dead capital. The primary purpose of this Bill is to reduce the capital charges which transport has had to bear in the past. In my introductory speech I demonstrated how, by a comparatively smooth operation, affecting only the subsidiary stocks of the Great Southern Railways a saving of £30,000 per year in capital charges has already been effected, and the establishment of the new company on the basis contemplated in the Bill will mean further substantial savings immediately operative in the capital charges which transport services have had to meet in the past.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that by the amalgamation and the new capital structure which the Bill contemplates, there is going to be a substantial diminution in the amount of revenue from transport which must be allocated to the payment of interest and dividends.  There is going to be an accession of new revenue, there is going to be created the possibility of considerable economies which would not otherwise have been possible.  We are ensuring that of the revenue which comes from the sale of transport services of one kind or another, a higher proportion will in future be available for the improvement of the services, for a reduction of the charges at which the services are provided and for the improvement of the conditions of workers employed in the operation of the services.  Deputy Norton chose to ignore that aspect.  He chose to ignore that under the scheme associated with this Bill, or implemented by it, £175,000 additional every year is going to be allocated in priority to debenture interest for the purpose of the superannuation arrangements now being brought into force.  He told us a distressing story about a worker, employed in transport for a number of years, retiring without provision being made for his old age when no longer capable of being employed.  One of the purposes of this Bill is to end that.</P>
    <P>One of its purposes is to ensure that workers employed in transport in future will have reasonable economic security in old age.  Deputies who <Col N="418" /> vote against this Bill are voting against that economic security for transport workers.  Clearly, the new system of superannuation which has been brought into force, and which is associated with this Bill, cannot be operated at all until we can contemplate that the new transport organisation is going to be a greater financial success than the old Great Southern Railways Company.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton objects to paying dividends and interest on capital and apparently contemplates a position in which the State can get money for nothing, although there is no means of doing so, except by taxation, and we could not impose taxation for this purpose. He will not face up to the fact that it is the success of the new transport company that makes it possible for us to guarantee, not merely security for workers in their employment, not merely economic protection in old age, but reasonable conditions of employment in the interval.  There is no security for workers employed in transport if transport has to be subsidised by the Exchequer, if the organisation providing the transport services is not paying its way, and I submit that nobody knows that better than the transport workers of the country who have always realised that their security and future prosperity depended upon the prosperity of the organisation which employed them.  That applied not merely to transport workers but to workers in any occupation.  Workers employed by a firm which is making losses rarely feel secure in their employment, and the transport workers of this country have every reason to support the Government in its effort to put transport upon a paying basis, because that is the primary purpose of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon said he is opposed to the scheme of the Bill.  He wants a new system standing upon three legs: State purchase of transport facilities; control by an organisation similar to the Electricity Supply Board; and subsidised transport services.  I am against all three.  If there are three things which we should try to avoid in the reorganisation of transport services, they are State purchase of the existing transport organisation, control <Col N="419" /> by an organisation similar to the Electricity Supply Board and subsidies. I am against the State purchase of transport services because if we follow that suggestion, we will put transport in the forefront of Party politics.  It is because, if the State acquires the transport organisations of the country, the recruitment or promotion of every railway porter will be a matter about which political Parties and political clubs will concern themselves, because the extension of transport facilities or an improvement of transport charges in any area are things which will make and unmake Deputies, that I am against the inauguration of a system of State ownership of transport services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Norton is one of those people who refuse to recognise the fact that there have been many changes affecting transport since 1931.  I am not going to refuse to recognise the fact that such changes have taken place &mdash; technical changes which have fundamentally altered the transport problem of the country and should alter our approach to that problem for the purpose of finding a solution.  I am in favour of State control and we are providing here for State control to the extent necessary, that is, State control sufficient to ensure that the public interest will predominate, that adequate services will be provided and that they will be provided at charges which can be regulated by a public authority.  We have discussed the merits of that form of control, complete State ownership, before.  I am merely reiterating now my objection to the three basic elements of the system of transport which Deputy Dillon prefers to the system in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am against control of this or any other organisation by what is called the Electricity Supply Board system. I am quite certain that if we were now, for the first time, establishing the Electricity Supply Board, with our experience, we would not repeat the type of organisation which the Electricity <Col N="420" /> Supply Act of 1927 provided for.  I am quite certain that in that view I would be joined by every member of the Electricity Supply Board.  But we have not changed the system and are not proposing to change the system now, because, despite its defects, it has worked well enough there.  It would not work at all in transport.  I think that any system of control which involves the direction of policy being in the hands of executive officers would be fundamentally wrong for public transport services.</P>
    <P>I am against subsidies, and I want vehemently to oppose this idea that we must reorganise our transport services in circumstances in which we must contemplate the provision of subsidies for these services.  If we are to approach the problem of the post-war period with this slovenly idea in our mind, that all our economic difficulties can be overcome by some system of State subsidies, then already this nation is doomed to disaster in that period.  We must try to make the economic machinery at our disposal work under its own power.  The Farmers' Party, I know, has spread the idea that every economic problem, every production problem, every distribution problem, can be met in some way by a subsidy from State funds.  That idea must be killed, or this nation must look forward to a continuing period of economic decline.  We must reverse the mentality which produces that idea.  We must get our people to understand that nothing is ever settled until it is settled right and no economic problem is solved until the necessity for State assistance or State subsidy has been finally removed.  I think that either in relation to transport or agriculture a policy based upon subsidy is fundamentally unsound and will ultimately be proved to be unsound.</P>
    <P>I contemplate that we can build up here a transport organisation which, having regard to the peculiar geographical formation of our country and the rather unusual distribution of population and industry, will be as efficient as any other country has, and I believe that we can make that transport organisation work without State subsidy.  I am against subsidies for transport.  I believe subsidies mean <Col N="421" /> dear transport, dear to the community as a whole.  I believe they mean inefficient transport, and I believe they would mean nothing but a repetition of the old incompetent method of providing transport services and allowing unnecessary waste to appear at every phase.  If we make it clear that we are not going to subsidise, that transport must be sold at a cost which will cover all the charges associated therewith, we will force those providing the services to eliminate waste and to ensure that, right throughout the whole of their organisation, there will be complete efficiency and good management.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>But you create a monopoly which can draw and drag its own amount of subsidy from the users of the services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been so much talk about monopoly in connection with transport that I am quite convinced that Deputies who have used the word have not yet begun to understand the nature of our transport problem. Public transport services were always provided by monopoly.  At any rate, since the first day the railway was built, public transport has been provided on a monopoly basis.  The problem that has arisen for us is that that monopoly is now over.  So long as railways had a monopoly of transport services, so long as there was no competition for the transportation of goods or passengers on a large scale, inefficient methods could continue nevertheless to yield profits, and a transport problem such as we are now facing did not exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was when that monopoly was broken by the mass-produced private motor car and commercial goods vehicle and it became possible for the individual trader to provide his own transport over long distances without recourse to the public services at all that our problem arose.  Our problem is one of re-creating the monopoly to such an extent as we consider necessary in order to ensure that the traffics which can only move over the public services can be carried at a profit and to give these public services sufficient business to enable them to carry on. That is our problem, and the purpose <Col N="422" /> of this Bill is to endeavour to ensure that, to the extent necessary, the monopoly will be re-created.  There is no possibility of maintaining public transport services on any other basis than a monopoly of one kind or another.  We can no longer have the complete monopoly which existed before the first world war because nobody will contemplate the complete elimination of the private motor car or private lorry, but we can create a monopoly of public transport services, and it is only on the basis of such a monopoly that we can direct to these services sufficient business to enable them to continue in operation and to continue in operation on the basis of decent conditions of employment for its workers.  The purpose of this Bill is to create a monopoly.  I am defending that as sound policy, and I want to make it clear that anything which seeks to undermine the monopoly of public transport services which we are aiming to establish will operate to prevent the success of this scheme.</P>
    <P>Deputies, however, who have spoken about the charges for transport which the Great Southern Railways now makes effective or which this new company may impose are, I think, allowing themselves to be misled by present conditions.  In present circumstances, with the restrictions imposed by the shortage of supplies on road transport, the railway company is able to make charges effective for the transportation of goods or passengers which might not be effective in normal circumstances. We are legislating here, however, for the post-war period, for circumstances in which the present restrictions upon road travel will be removed.  In such circumstances, the charges for traffic which the railway company will be able to impose will be determined, very largely automatically, by circumstances. In fact, I contemplate that the maximum charges which will be prescribed by Order will not, in the normal course, be the effective charges at all.  Railway charges are determined by a variety of circumstances.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy appeared to find fault with the principle of charging what the traffic will bear.  I am not saying that that is a good principle. <Col N="423" /> I am saying that that is the principle upon which public transport providers have operated at all time and it appears, if one considers the matter logically, the only principle upon which they can operate.  If the charges are too high, the goods will not travel. They will be diverted to private lorries, in modern circumstances.  They must endeavour to ensure that their charges are so regulated that they will attract to themselves the maximum volume of business and, at the same time, earn sufficient revenue to cover the cost of providing the services.  That is the principle upon which the railway company must operate.  The only limitation that we put upon them is that in any circumstances they must not exceed the maximum charges laid down and, in all circumstances, they must provide service to one individual on precisely the same terms as it is available to another.  In other words, that there is no undue discrimination between one and another.  The power of the railway company to make its charges effective will be the measure of its success in giving effect to the idea behind the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave referred to the absence of any public tribunal to which the public could appeal in relation to services.  The Railway Tribunal established under the 1924 Act was not set up primarily to determine charges on the basis of equity, and the Deputy must understand the fundamental difference there was between the 1924 scheme and this Bill on that account. The Railway Tribunal was instructed to determine a series of charges for merchandise which would produce the standard revenue for which the 1924 Act provided.  The question of equity did come in determining the rates for one class of traffic as against another. But the primary purpose of the Railway Tribunal in fixing rates was to make it possible for the company to earn the standard revenue which had been previously determined by it.  In effect, the company could never earn its standard revenue.  It was never able to make the standard charges effective and, eventually, the tribunal reported that no system of charges they could devise would enable the <Col N="424" /> company to earn the standard rate. Even at the present time, with the wartime increases in rates, which were sanctioned by Order in the middle of last year, in no case is any rate in operation higher than the standard charges determined by the Railway Tribunal in 1929.  In the majority of cases the charges are still substantially below these standard charges.  That is true for beet.  The existing standard charge for the transportation of beet is some 40 or 50 per cent. below the charge determined by the Railway Tribunal in 1929.</P>

      <P>In no case did they lose willingly.  I am not so sure that they lost much more in the previous year, but I would not contradict the Deputy in that.  The position was, however, that the company were pressing me for support in their efforts to secure an increase in the charges and the sugar company were pressing me for support in their endeavours to prevent an increase in the charges.  I had to decide eventually that the charges must cover the cost of providing the services and that is why the increase became operative in the present year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon, who, of course, spoke about the statement made at the annual meeting of the sugar company, obviously completely misunderstood the statement, and even the official position of the gentleman who made it. He did not speak as a member of the board.  He made a statement which appeared to be supported by the figures given by the chairman of the company at that meeting which was obviously based upon a complete misunderstanding of the position.  The fact is that the charge for transporting beet has gone up since the beginning of the war by a very much smaller <Col N="425" /> percentage than the cost of beet itself. If one takes the total cost of the beet delivered to a factory, the proportion of that cost represented by charges for transport is a much smaller proportion of the whole than it was before the war started.</P>

May I say that it would be my intention to allow this company to proceed, in normal circumstances, with the minimum Ministerial interference?  That cannot be the situation at the present time.  I have been charged by the Government with certain obligations under Emergency Powers Orders to ensure that the limited transport facilities which can be provided now are utilised for the transportation of the traffics which are of the greatest public importance.  I have got certain obligations to restrict the use of fuels to essential purposes and, in other respects, I have duties which require a degree of interference with the day-to-day management of the transport services which would not exist in ordinary times at all.  But I contemplate in ordinary times that it will be an unusual matter for the Minister or the Government to interfere in any way with the administration of the company.  They will, in fact, have little power to interfere with the administration <Col N="426" /> of the company, but in so far as it is necessary to ensure that the general policy of the board, is in accordance with the views of the Government, that can usually be done by verbal representations.</P>
      <P>I should imagine that the relationship between the Department of Industry and Commerce and this company will not be any more intimate than it is with any of the other organisations established under statute and carrying out commercial functions of one kind or another.  I think we must contemplate that Córas Iompair Eireann will be independent of political control or political supervision in all matters of its management and that it is only on that basis we can hope to see it develop with the efficiency and success that we believe to be possible.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 8.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved to report progress last night, I had been pointing out the desirability of including in the Bill the new section provided for in this amendment.  The object of this new section is to ensure that county councils will have a certain amount of initiation.  It does not seek to interfere with the powers of the commissioners, but seeks to give a new power to the local authorities which they would not possess under the Bill as it now stands.  This power of initiation of drainage schemes will lead to a more active local interest in the whole administration of this Bill.  In this amendment, we seek to give the county councils power to bring new drainage schemes before the attention of the central drainage authority, and if the central drainage authority or the commissioners turn down those schemes we have provision here for an appeal to an impartial tribunal.  I do not propose to express any opinion as to whether the appeal tribunal proposed is the best that could possibly be devised, but on principle I think the local authorities should have some body to which to appeal.  There is a definite danger that, if all power is left in the hands of the commissioners, certain areas or districts may not get the attention to which they are entitled. <Col N="429" /> It may be argued that this power in the hands of the county councils might obstruct and interfere with the central drainage authority in the administration of the Act, but I think the provision here that a tribunal will be set up to decide between the central body and the local authority ought to be adequate protection to ensure that justice would be done as between the two.  I cannot imagine any properly constituted appeal board not deciding a case entirely on its merits.  I do not think the Central Drainage Board would have anything to fear from an appeal to such an impartial body as that.  Therefore, in order to preserve some authority in the hands of the local bodies, I think the Parliamentary Secretary ought to accept this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It seeks to give to the county councils the right to petition. Suppose you give them that right, what will be the result?  Will it not mean that every county council in the country will proceed to send on petitions in respect of every drainage district in their area, and even after those have been received by the drainage authority will it not ultimately boil down to those men being called upon to decide which of the schemes will be taken first?  I cannot see what purpose can be served by giving this power to local authorities.  It is not, in fact, a power of initiation because you cannot disturb the right that is <Col N="430" /> proposed for the drainage authority here.  You cannot interfere with it, because, if you do, then you have no drainage authority at all.  It is because I can see that the effects of this amendment would be exactly the same as the effects which would accrue from the acceptance of the previous amendment that I must resist it.  To my mind it certainly does not make for any improvement but rather for a considerable worsening in the provisions that are already here.</P>

      <P>That is an extraordinary statement by the Parliamentary Secretary, when we take into consideration the fact that it is the intention of Fianna Fáil to fight all elections on purely political grounds, and that they have apparently a majority of the electorate.  The Parliamentary Secretary says that he cannot give a council that is likely to be a Fianna Fáil body the right to demand that something be done, that he does not trust them with any power of initiation at all, and that it must be left exclusively either to the central body or somebody else to decide when a request for a drainage scheme may be made in an area.  I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us if he is satisfied that he cannot depend upon either the wisdom or the judgment of the local authorities upon that particular matter?</P>

      <P>As I understand Deputy Cogan's amendment, it differs very much from Deputy Hughes's amendment, and from the arguments in which Deputy Hughes clothed his amendment last night.  I gathered from Deputy Hughes's amendment last night that his desire was to leave the initiation of schemes in the hands of the local authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the amendment which the Deputy moved last night and where he talked about taking the power to initiate schemes out of the hands of the local authorities. The difference between this amendment and Deputy Hughes's amendment is, in my opinion, that, whereas Deputy Hughes appeared to claim that the initiation should be in the hands of the local authority, Deputy Cogan does not make that claim, and all he wants is that the local authority should have the right to agitate for the introduction of a drainage scheme.  Anybody who agitates and gets the Board of Public Works to move rapidly is a public benefactor.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is too close to its activities to be able to measure the tempo of its progress but, looking at its activities objectively &mdash; and not offensively &mdash; a lot of us have some doubts that anybody in the Department will suffer from lightness in the head because of the speed at which schemes are brought to maturity.  It may be that the machinery is not of a kind to promote that happening but, at all events, a lot of us have long experience of the Board of Works and know that things do not happen in a hurry and that no lightning storms occur when it comes to getting a decision to do a thing or from then on to the actual completion of the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is because I hope that this Bill will accelerate the methods of the Board of Works that I support its general principles.  However, Deputy Cogan wants to give a local authority the power to say to the commissioners: &ldquo;We want you to carry out a drainage scheme in our area,&rdquo; so that they can bring the claims of that area to the notice of the commissioners and so that the commissioners will not feel that, because they have decided, for instance, to initiate drainage in Connemara, the local authority in Carlow or Wexford may be entitled to say that Carlow or Wexford exist as well <Col N="432" /> as Connemara and that their drainage should be looked after.  Deputy Cogan's amendment merely gives the county councils the right to agitate for a scheme, and I cannot see why the Parliamentary Secretary would not concede to the local authority that right.  But that is entirely different from putting the local authority in the position where it initiates the movement for a drainage scheme.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Cogan's amendment is carried, we will have a situation in which the commissioners in any case will decide where they are going to have a drainage scheme.  Up to the moment, they are the only body that can do it, but Deputy Cogan says that we should let in the county council and let them say to the commissioners that there should be a drainage scheme here, there or somewhere else.  That seems to be the purpose of the amendment. I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary has shown any substantial reasons why a county council cannot agitate to have a drainage scheme carried out.  I think they already have that power.  Whether there is, in fact, an inherent right in them to do so or not is another matter.  I think a county council can, at any time, meet and pass a resolution instructing the county manager to write to the Parliamentary Secretary to tell the commissioners to come and drain such-and-such a river.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>And if the Parliamentary Secretary does not do that, the county council can write to the local Deputies and get them to ask the Parliamentary Secretary in the Dáil why he has not drained a certain river.  The Parliamentary Secretary is then put on his defence and so are the Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making the point that the local authority ought to have the right to kick up a row, but I do not want the county council to go asleep and, because it goes asleep, that there will be no drainage scheme started in its area.  That is the difference I want <Col N="433" /> to insist that the job of drainage will be done and let the Commissioners do it and, in case they are a bit slow, to let the county council agitate to have it done.  But let us not put the responsibility for starting the scheme on the local authority as, if we do, in many cases it may never start.  All kinds of objections arise and everybody knows what they are like at county council meetings.  Someone wants to put in a sewerage scheme or a water scheme in a town and immediately there are deputations from outside the town, coming in and saying, &ldquo;Please, do not do this, as it makes the area charge higher on us and we will get no water or sewerage.&rdquo;  I do not want that type of see-saw at county council meetings. I want the Commissioners to come in and get after the job of drainage, but I have not heard from the Parliamentary Secretary what case there is for preventing a county council from agitating for a scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not dream of stopping them from agitating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I would imagine.  If the Parliamentary Secretary meets the case made by Deputy Cogan by saying they can agitate from 1st January to 31st December, I think that is an answer; but if that is the answer, it is not the answer that the Parliamentary Secretary gave when he likened this amendment to that proposed by Deputy Hughes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that Deputy Norton is at a bit of a disadvantage, in that he does not seem to have read either my amendment or Deputy Hughes's very carefully.  As far as my knowledge of Deputy Hughes's amendment goes, it would put an obligation on the central authority to initiate the drainage scheme and would make it a binding obligation, which any person could take into court and enforce on the Commissioners.  My amendment seeks to give the county council power, first of all, to bring a scheme to the notice of the Commissioners and, in the event of the Commissioners turning down the application, power to appeal to an outside impartial tribunal, <Col N="434" /> which would decide between the county council and the Commissioners of Public Works.  I think that is a simple, straightforward proposal.  It gives the county council more power, maybe, than the power to agitate: it gives them the power to bring their case against the Commissioners to the tribunal and have it decided on its merits.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Norton persists in grossly and deliberately misrepresenting what I said, that is a different matter.  I did not in any place or at any time advocate that we should preserve the right to initiate schemes to the local authority, but I said that, once you take away that right, the drainage authority should then be representative of the people interested in drainage.  In other words, instead of vesting the power to initiate national drainage in the commissioners, it should be vested in an authority drawn from people interested in national drainage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>On this amendment, the Parliamentary Secretary pointed out that it would have more or less the same effect as my amendment.  So far as my amendment is concerned, I say that, although it imposed a duty on the commissioners, yet if the Parliamentary Secretary reads the first two lines of the section, he will see:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="435" />&ldquo;Whenever the commissioners are of opinion that the execution of arterial drainage works is expedient in respect of any catchment area...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So it still is left to their discretion, although putting a greater responsibility on them.  While that discretion was there in favour of the group of individuals feeling that they had a grievance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyway, we will leave it so.  We dealt with it last night. There is no necessity for this amendment at all in regard to the local authorities' right to agitate and come together to pass a resolution and send it up to the commissioners, pressing them to have their problem examined.</P>

      <P>That is the difficulty. It goes further.  I have no objection to the amendment, except that, to a great extent, it is impracticable.  You may have requests coming from all over the country, putting responsibility on the commissioners to do works immediately that it would not be humanly possible to have done in a short period. I must honestly admit that that is the snag about the amendment.  Otherwise, it might be desirable to have that amendment in.  Whether the amendment is in or out will not prevent the local authority from passing a resolution drawing the attention of the commissioners <Col N="436" /> to the fact that they have a problem and are anxiously awaiting a solution of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  With regard to the point made by Deputy Hughes, that the business of the drainage board might be cluttered up with successful demands for local drainage works, arising out of appeals to the appeal board, I do not think that that would arise.  If the appeal board were a body with a sense of responsibility and with full knowledge of the administration of the Act, I do not think that they would insist on the drainage board doing anything impossible.  The drainage board would be represented at the appeal tribunal and, if it was impossible to carry out the work within a reasonable period, the appeal tribunal would have to consider that.  I am sure the appeal tribunal would be fair both to the county council and the Commissioners of Works.  The appeal tribunal suggested here is really one which Deputy Hughes has put forward in a later amendment.  Deputy Hughes should have some confidence in the tribunal he is proposing, and he should be satisfied that the board will have a sense of responsibility and will not obstruct the operation of the Act.</P>

      <P>The Drainage Commission estimated that an arterial drainage <Col N="437" /> scheme for the whole country would cost, roughly, £7,000,000.  They suggested that, in order to grapple with this problem, certain things should be done.  One of these things was the setting up of a drainage authority.  When you proceed to set up that drainage authority, you must attach to it technical men who will advise, prepare, survey and block out the work to be done.  Is it not obvious that the first two matters referred to in this amendment mean nothing if they are not read in conjunction with No. 3?  When read in conjunction with No. 3, you discover that you are to have an appeal from the drainage authority which is set up, with its technical advisers, to an appeal board as to the wisdom or otherwise of selecting any scheme, or group of schemes, from a total of, roughly, £7,000,000 worth of work.  Can the mover of this amendment show me how this appeal board which is to decide between the local authority and the drainage authority is to secure the <Col N="438" /> technical advice on which it will make up its mind as to which authority is right?  I entirely approve of encouraging local authorities to make demands in regard to this matter.  I expect to receive from them demands for explanations as to why the drainage authority will not do this or that. I expect that letters will be sent to Deputies and that questions will be raised in this House regarding suggested schemes.  There can be criticism of the Board of Works and the drainage authority on any Estimates or Supplementary Estimates that come up.  That, of course, will be influenced by the rate of progress the drainage authority will be able to make.  I have no desire, even if I had the power, to curb that kind of criticism but, when an amendment such as this is proposed, it is an entirely different matter and I must insist on resisting it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1) (b), line 30, after the word &ldquo;papers&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;including the provincial papers circulating in the district to which such drainage scheme relates&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to ensure that schemes prepared by the commissioners, which must be sent to the county council and must be published in a short review and in one or more newspapers as the commissioners consider appropriate, shall also be published in papers, including the provincial papers circulating in the districts to which the particular drainage scheme relates.  It could happen that the commissioners might prepare a scheme for, let us say, Donegal, publish the details in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and, let us say, in the <i>Cork Examiner</i>, and then expect the people concerned to know about the details of the scheme through looking it up in the columns of <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> or the <i>Cork Examiner.</i> Now, I am sure that that is not contemplated, but I suggest that it could happen, and that the details of such a scheme could be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> or in a Dublin City newspaper and not be published in a newspaper with a circulation in the area concerned.  All that this amendment seeks is to have the scheme published in a newspaper circulating in the area in which the scheme will operate.</P>

      <P>So far as the Parliamentary Secretary or his Department is concerned, they can look up Thom's Directory, and, if necessary, they can publish the scheme in every one of the 56 newspapers that are published in this country, and there is nothing in this amendment to prevent that.  On the other hand, however, if a drainage scheme refers to, let us say, Kerry, and there is one paper published in Kerry, this amendment seeks to establish that the scheme should be published in the Kerry paper, so that the people there will be put in the position of knowing what it is all about.  That is all that this amendment asks for, and if the commissioners at present cannot accept the burden of the responsibility of publishing the scheme in the local paper, then, through this amendment, they would have to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

If it is the usual practice, then what is the objection to this amendment?  The only logical conclusion to be drawn from the Parliamentary Secretary's argument is that if it is undesirable to publish the <Col N="442" /> scheme at any time, you are giving the commissioners an opportunity of getting out of publishing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>After all, will they not publish the scheme in the papers circulating in the area concerned &mdash; the area where there is a scheme?

      <P>Surely, the people interested in those schemes should be given an opportunity of examining them?  The only way I can think of giving them an opportunity of examining these schemes in detail is to publish them in the newspaper or newspapers circulating in the county concerned, or in the three counties, as the case may be.  There is another way of ensuring that the people will be able to see those schemes and examine them for themselves.  It is mentioned here that they will be exhibited at the county council offices, but, after all, very few people will see them there, because very few of the people concerned would have an opportunity of calling to the county council offices, and I am quite sure that it is the desire of those in charge of the drainage scheme that an opportunity should be given to the people concerned of seeing the scheme and examining it for themselves.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (2), (b), at the end of line 45, to add the following words: &ldquo;shall receive and consider any representations or observations pertaining to such drainage scheme that may be submitted, and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment, as the Parliamentary Secretary can see, is to ensure that the local authority will consider submissions that are made by individuals relating to any particular omission that may be made in a drainage scheme, and that they will consider it themselves and pass recommendations on to the commissioners. I think it is desirable that we should make the local authority take an interest in the scheme, and that, if they feel that there is an omission that should be included in the scheme, they would send notification of that fact to the commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, the Deputy would not consider making it obligatory on the local authority to send on these recommendations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, the local authority is responsible for maintenance, and, according to Section 48, <Col N="445" /> I think that, taking all factors into account, the local authority, definitely, has an interest there, since they will have to pay, through the rates, for maintenance in the future.  Surely we are not going to leave it to the engineer who has surveyed the job to decide whether such a scheme should go through or not.  Why not give an opportunity to a practical farmer from the district, who might happen to be a member of the local authority, the opportunity of expressing his opinion on it, which he would be quite capable of doing?  I think it is only right and proper that the local authority should consider whatever representations are made.  If, after looking at a published scheme, an individual feels that he has a grievance and makes representations to the local authority, his submissions may go by default simply because the secretary to the local authority did not bring the matter before it.  My object in moving this amendment is to ensure that such representations will be brought to the notice of the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The only people on whom we can place responsibility for receiving and considering representations are the members of the drainage authority. It would not be possible to place that responsibility also on the local authority.  It is only natural, of course, that individuals concerned might feel that if they made their complaints to the local authority and if the latter decided to make approaches to the drainage authority they would have more effect than if the individuals had approached the drainage authority directly.  The local authority is free at any time to consider representations. I repeat that the only people on whom we can place legal responsibility for receiving and considering representations are the drainage authority, and I do not think the Deputy should press his amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>It might very well happen that if an individual did write to the local authority the secretary might never bring the communication before it.  What I am seeking to ensure is <Col N="446" /> that when individuals make representations to the local authority they must be placed before it for consideration. Suppose, under the Bill as it stands, the secretary to the local authority fails to bring a complaint before that body, what redress has the individual concerned?  We ought to put in a provision to meet a situation of that kind, and make the secretary of the local authority recognise that in this section we are proposing to use the local authority for the purpose of facilitating individuals who feel that they have a grievance through an omission of one kind or another in the scheme.  In that way we will be making certain that grievances will be brought to the notice of the local authority.  That is not putting an obligation on it to accept whatever recommendations are made to it.  The local authority can consider them on their merits, and throw them out if they like.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is provided in the section that an individual can inspect the scheme.

In this instance I take the local authority to be the county manager.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Both Deputy Allen and Deputy Hughes have had experience of local authorities.  Surely they are not serious in suggesting that, in putting forward proposals for drainage, we should proceed to lay down regulations as to how local authorities should treat the people whom they represent?</P>

There has been a good deal of talk here about technicians, but on this drainage problem the practical farmers who are members of local authorities are quite capable of expressing constructive views on it.  I think it is right and proper that this obligation should be put on the secretary to the local authority to bring complaints from individuals before the notice of that body.</P>

      <P>What I cannot understand is why those who are responsible for bringing forward these proposals should be accused of robbing the local authorities of their rights, and of not giving them the recognition that they deserve.  I have also been accused of showing mistrust in local authorities. As one who has had some contact with local authorities, I have not the slightest doubt that if an individual ratepayer raises some question with the local authority, either directly or through his local county councillor, the matter will be brought before that body.  I have enough confidence in our county councils to think that that will happen.  The idea of providing that a county council should do so-and-so, and shall consider each representation that is sent to it, is certainly going much further than I would be prepared to go.  It does not mean anything. <Col N="448" /> It is of no importance, and it seems to me to be a very foolish provision to attempt to insert.</P>

      <P>Surely the Parliamentary Secretary can visualise a case where a watercourse or a source of power may be interfered with.  The owner or owners may feel that they should have the right to put forward their case to the local authority when this scheme is being considered by them.  We are only asking to have this provision inserted in order to ensure that if such persons or group of persons make any representations of that kind, they will get a fair hearing by the local authority, and that their representations will be sent forward, with the council's observations, to the drainage authority.  We are merely asking the Parliamentary Secretary to ensure that that will be done, and that no omission can occur, through any mischance, on the part of the county manager or his officials.  It is merely a safeguard to ensure that these people will get a fair hearing.</P>

      <P>It is all right to talk about safeguards, but think of the safeguards that are already in the Bill. The scheme is prepared.  The scheme is published and advertised.  The people whose rights are being interfered with are notified.  They are told the place at which they can see the scheme and make whatever observations they like upon it direct to the drainage authority.  The local authority or local authorities, as the case may be, have the scheme in their office.  They have three months in which to make their representations. The individual concerned can inspect the scheme, and he has a month in which to do it.  He can make his representations.  The local authority have three months to do it, and they can make their representations to the drainage authority.  It is the duty of the drainage authority on receiving these representations to consider them. I do not see what other safeguards you require.  If we were to accept an amendment of this kind, is it suggested that, in the case of some local authority refusing or failing, or some individual of that local authority failing, <Col N="449" /> the drainage authority would have to take proceedings against that local authority before it could proceed with the work for which preparations had been made?  If you think of the provisions and safeguards that are already in the Bill and discuss the amendment in relation to those safeguards, I think you could not possibly even ask for the insertion of these words.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Where a county council of a <Col N="450" /> drainage district receives representations from an occupier or occupiers of land in such district regarding the omission of any drain or drains or portion of any drain or drains from the prepared scheme as published by the Commissioners and where such council is of opinion that such drain or drains or portion thereof should be included, and having submitted such proposal or proposals to the Commissioners and the Commissioners having rejected such proposal or proposals, an appeal shall lie by the occupier or occupiers or county council from the decision of the Commissioners to the Appeal Board provided for in Section 19 of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The House will understand that, the Commissioners having prepared a scheme, this section can only operate if there is portion of a catchment area omitted.  A stream may be omitted because the Commissioners might feel that it was not necessary to have it opened.  The individual or group of individuals in that particular district might feel that hardship was involved and that it was quite possible that later on another part of this Bill might be operated against them to compel them to open up that stream.  In that case, as the Bill stands at present, the decision rests absolutely with the particular engineer or engineers who are in charge and there can be no further investigation.  I suppose the Parliamentary Secretary would have implicit confidence in the engineering staff of his Department and would feel that they could do no wrong, that they could make no mistakes, but it is quite possible that if we do not make some provision for appeal in such a case, hardship could be inflicted on a group of individuals and that later on the Commissioners might compel them to open up a stream which should rightly be the responsibility of the drainage authority.  I feel it is desirable to give the individual an opportunity of appealing in a case where he feels injustice has been done.  In all legislation it is not merely desirable but absolutely essential that the individual's interest should be safeguarded and that he should have the right to <Col N="451" /> appeal to an appeal board or to a court of justice or to some other body.  The appeal that I favour is set out in the amendment.</P>

      <P>I must resist the amendment for the reasons I have already advanced in regard to amendment No. 8. Complaint will, I am sure, continue to be made as to the manner in which this problem will be tackled and as to the rate of progress that will be made.  In the discussion that took place on the Second Reading of this Bill and in the discussions that took place in this House as to the inactivity of the Board of Works under the 1925 Act, the thing that strikes me as extraordinary is the criticism as to the rate of progress that was made and the criticism of that portion of the recommendations of the Drainage Commission where they refer to the amount of money that a drainage authority would be likely to expend in one year, and the time that it would take to give complete effect to the drainage problems of this country.  When that report is referred to on Second Reading and when extracts are read from it, one hears all kinds of criticism from Deputies who say: &ldquo;If you proceed to spend money at the rate of £250,000 per annum and if the estimated amount necessary for the drainage of the country is, roughly, £7,000,000, it is not difficult to estimate the time which will elapse before this drainage problem is fully dealt with.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who advance these complaints, and that type of criticism, are people who, when you bring forward proposals of this nature, will try to hedge them round with conditions that will make the work of this authority <Col N="452" /> ten times more difficult, and more involved, than it would otherwise have been.  In spite of what has been alleged I am not making the case that a drainage authority is not likely to commit errors of judgment or that the work of technical men will not be found at fault, but the grounds on which I am going to resist this and every other amendment along the same lines, are that there must be some final court, no matter what you are dealing with. There must be finality.  If we are going to provide the court of appeal suggested, not only in this but in other amendments, not only will the time of the drainage authority that is to be set up be frittered away but also the time of technical people coming forward to give evidence.  I stated on another amendment that this drainage authority must have technical advice. It must have on it people skilled in a technical sense and if an appeal board is set up of the type suggested in the amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;from whom will the drainage authority get technical assistance in order to come to decisions?  I am entitled to claim that if there is to be a drainage authority, which will have the assistance of trained experts in their work, seeing that there must be finality, they should be in a position to weigh the pros and cons of objections brought forward by individuals and local bodies.  If in some cases their judgment is not perfect and errors are made, so too might errors of judgment result from the deliberations of the proposed appeals tribunal. In fact, there would be much more liability to have decisions that would err from such an appeal board than from a drainage authority which would have the assistance of the skilled people I referred to.  I could enumerate dozens of frivolous things on which there might be appeals. When I replied to the criticisms on the Second Reading by pointing out the length of time that appeals were likely to take, it was not my opinion nor that of the Commissioners of Public Works I was expressing.  It was the opinion of the Drainage Commission with regard to the time it <Col N="453" /> would take to give effect to recommendations. When I think of the criticism offered as a result of repeating that opinion and relate it to the proposals here!  If we are to have an appeals tribunal it will further clog the machine and hamper the progress that we want when the drainage problem is tackled.  I could speak for hours if I wanted to produce arguments showing why this appeal tribunal could not be tolerated by anyone who has a hope of progress being made in dealing with this problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary has considerably exaggerated the delay that is likely to arise from the hearing of an appeal, if it was decided to set up a tribunal.  A staff of engineers will have to be recruited to carry out the drainage work implied by this Bill.  I do not know if we have any drainage experts. At all events, a number of new men will be recruited to carry out various drainage schemes and it is quite inevitable that these new men, because of lack of technical experience in drainage, are likely to make mistakes. It is quite conceivable in some schemes that drains or portions of drains referred to in the amendment might be on different schemes, and their omission might have an important bearing on local life in certain districts. If local people are deeply concerned about having schemes under-taken, and if engineers take up the attitude that some drains should not be included, the people should have some right of appeal other than to the technical engineers who prepared the schemes.  There is nothing at all unreasonable in the request to have such an authority set up.  Difficulties might not arise frequently, but if there are complaints there should be some authority other than the engineers who prepared schemes to hear complaints. If drainage schemes are to be carried out, and if they are to win the confidence of the people, it is only just and reasonable that there should be something in the nature of an appeal board, where misunderstandings arise between engineers, local authorities and local people.  An appeal tribunal was recommended by the commission, <Col N="454" /> and it seems to me that a just case has been made for establishing such a tribunal.  The Parliamentary Secretary says that on the Second Reading he replied to the case made then for the establishment of such a tribunal. I cannot agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that its establishment would lead to a great deal of delay in the operation of drainage schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely we do not desire to pass legislation which aims at setting up an absolute autocracy, which nobody will have the right to challenge and with no provision made for an appeal from its decision.  No plea of expedition justifies interference with justice.  If there is any possibility of injustice being done, and if commissioners with overriding power can simply ignore the small man's interests, we should make ample provision to secure that justice is done in every case.</P>
      <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary has missed the real point.  I have for some time been interested in the type of legislation passed by men with long experience of legislating in another country.  The legislation passed by the British House of Commons always contains safeguards of this kind.  They are essential safeguards, which may only in very rare cases be operated.  I want to say this to the Parliamentary Secretary: I do not believe that there will be very many appeals in actual practice, but the insertion of such a safeguard would have a psychological effect, in that the commissioners would be conscious all the time that an individual had the right of appeal and it would act as a very effective means of ensuring their doing their job properly.  It is absolutely essential, because the very fact that such machinery was available would induce the commissioners to make sure that no injustice was done and to carry out works, if the appeal board decided they ought to be carried out.  In such cases, the appeal board, I believe, would very rarely operate, but do not insert this safeguard and I say definitely that injustice is bound to happen from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has <Col N="455" /> agreed that the skilled technicians of his Department are human and can make errors.  I am not reflecting in any way on their ability.  I have every confidence in their ability to do the type of job they have been trained to do, that is, to get rid of surplus water and to carry out drainage schemes; but we, as legislators, have a responsibility to protect the individual's rights and liberties, particularly bearing in mind the background of the Bill, Section 48, in which we introduce for the first time in legislation compulsory powers in relation to the carrying out of certain works by individuals, even on their own farms.</P>
    <P>Can the Parliamentary Secretary say why he has not attempted to implement the recommendations of the Drainage Commission set up by his Government with regard to this appeal board?  I do not want to discuss this point in detail, because it appears later in an amendment of mine, but I want to say again to the Parliamentary Secretary that I disagree with him in his suggestion that such a provision would hamper the work of the commissioners. There will be very few cases of appeal, but the fact that machinery for appeal is provided will ensure that the commissioners will do their work efficiently and effectively, and safeguard the interests and rights of individuals.</P>

      <P>This amendment and several others raise the biggest issue that confronts us in regard to legislation at present, that is, the issue as between the democratic rights of the people and the demands of bureaucracy, of officialdom.  It is quite reasonable to say that the official machine will act more expeditiously if there is no outside interference with it, but the arguments put forward by the Parliamentary Secretary were put forward in other countries in favour of the abolition of democratic institutions. They were put forward in favour of the County Management Act.  We have seen the results of dictatorship in other countries and it is our duty now to insist that there shall be some safeguard for the individual citizen. <Col N="456" /> Remember that this Bill deals with the rights and interests of very humble and obscure citizens, of people living in the heart of the country in the most backward districts.  These people are entitled to some protection.  They are entitled to be in a position to appeal against the decision of unknown officials who come down from the city, make their decisions, and disappear again.  The plain people in the bogs and the mountains who have rights which may be trampled upon in the expeditious carrying out of these drainage schemes ought to have some safeguard, and this amendment, I think, offers a reasonable safeguard. No plea of expedition should stand against the rights of the citizens.</P>

If a farmer finds that there is an omission from a scheme which would leave his land unimproved, or which would be detrimental to his property, surely he should have the right to appeal.  That is all the amendment asks.</P>

      <P>I have some little experience, as I am sure most Deputies have, of the difficulties many farmers experience in having drainage carried out.  If their neighbours refuse to open drains, the position as things stand at present is that it is very difficult to compel them to do so.  I do not want to interfere, and I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary does not want to interfere, with the democratic rights of the people, but he does not want to see the position clogged up and to see it made difficult to have drainage work carried out.  The danger I see in the amendment is that there will be a tendency on the part of most land owners to force the authority to <Col N="457" /> have all drainage carried out.  If I am a land owner, I will endeavour to extend the scheme to my holding to avoid doing it myself.  That tendency will be very great and I foresee a large number of appeals on that basis.  It will be just as difficult as at present for a man to get on with drainage, if we have hampering amendments of this type.  The position is that the people do not feel equal to compelling a man to open drains on his land which he should have been compelled to open in the past.  Under this, as I say, he will be compelled to open up the drains and he will utilise this appeal to hamper the whole position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hughes's amendment proposes to give the right to a county council to make representations to an appeal board if the Drainage Commission refuse to drain a few extra perches of somebody's land which they may not take into a drainage area That is what this appeal board provided for in this amendment amounts to.  I wonder will this appeal board, when set up according to Deputy Hughes's amendment, be any more democratic than the Drainage Commissioners. Has he any reason to believe that it will be more democratic? According to this amendment, one member of the appeal board will be a <Col N="458" /> nominee of the Drainage Commissioners A second member will be a judge of the High Court.  The third might be considered by Deputy Hughes to be democratic, as he is to be nominated by the General Council of County Councils.  Actually the majority of the proposed appeal board will not be elected by anybody.  Both of them will be officials.  One, we will assume, will be an official of the Office of Public Works and the other an official of this House or of the courts &mdash; a judge of the High Court.  Nobody can say that either of these, whoever they may be, if the amendment is carried, would be very democratic from Deputy Hughes's or Deputy Cogan's point of view.</P>
      <P>I listened this evening, on another Bill which was before the House, to a Deputy sitting on the opposite benches talking about a tribunal which was set up recently composed of three judges, and he certainly had nothing but the most absolute contempt for their findings. I wonder if Deputy Hughes, before the Bill goes through, will want a supreme appeal board to which there can be an appeal from the one he proposes. I think the whole thing is ridiculous, because you will get just as good results in the end from the Drainage Board as from a dozen or 40 appeal boards.  There must be finality somewhere and you might as well have finality in the beginning as after endless delays and expense with no further result.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to go into the question of an appeal board which Deputy Allen went into extensively. I will only say that when we come to the question later on as to whether the appeal board should be set up or not, I hope Deputy Allen, being the democrat he is, will help us to make a real democratic job of it and set up a board of which everyone will approve.  I was interested in Deputy Harris's statement that, if we accepted the amendment, the commission would practically have a wholetime job considering trivial requests from various owners of land here and there.  The amendment does not ask anything of the kind.  We would all agree with the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="459" /> that if every owner of land or of a drain was to be empowered to go to the appeal board it would make the work of the Drainage Commission extremely difficult.  Deputy Hughes does not suggest any such thing.  He suggests that where an occupier of land thinks he has a grievance in connection with a proposed scheme he should bring his complaint, not to the Minister or to the Drainage Board, but to the local county council where he can get it considered without any hindrance to the Minister or the officials of the Office of Public Works.  We may take it for granted that before a county council considers it at all they will send an engineer to make an inspection and see if it is worth while considering it.  I think Deputy Allen will agree that county councils will not back up every foolish scheme that anybody suggests. We must expect them to be reasonable bodies, particularly now when they are governed by a county manager. We do not suggest that the county council will accept the suggestion and put it to the office of Public Works with such force that, if it is rejected, they will ask for an appeal.</P>
      <P>If this Bill is to be pleasing to everybody we ought to make it as hide-bound as we can so that the difficulties of the commission will be as few as possible and the objections of the people whom the drainage will ultimately benefit will be as few as possible.</P>
      <P>What I am particularly interested in is that it is possible that the engineers drawing up a scheme of drainage will leave out an essential drain or water-course. Is it unreasonable for an owner of land to suggest to the county council that a certain water-course or drain is essential to the scheme which would not be a success without it? That is all the more necessary when we come to consider Section 48.  If a particular water-course which was essential to the scheme was not included, the occupier of the land could be compelled under the provisions of Section 48 to do the work on that particular drain or water-course, and that might be an impossible undertaking for small farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="460" /> I can envisage that particular thing happening in connection with my land or somebody else's land.  If a drainage scheme was being considered and a certain water course which local people might consider essential to the scheme was left out, it would be impossible for these people with their resources to maintain it in a proper manner.  A subsequent section of the Bill makes it obligatory on them to do that work. This is not a trivial matter and I think the Parliamentary Secretary ought to consider accepting the amendment, if not in its present form, in a form which would be acceptable to him.  There should be an appeal.  It is not suggested that the occupier of the land should appeal directly to the appeal board, but that the county council, having considered his grievance, should have some say in the matter.  One of the difficulties I saw under this Bill was that there was not a sufficiently close link provided between the engineers of the Office of Public Works and the engineers of the county councils.  Until we have that close link, to my mind, there will be always difficulty in connection with a drainage scheme.  I support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say to Deputy Allen that there is nothing original in my idea; in fact, it is not my idea to have an appeal board. Deputy Allen probably read the report of the Drainage Commission.  That Commission recommended an appeal board.  No plea of expedition saves us from our responsibility in protecting individuals' rights and liberties and we must ensure above all things that justice is done.  Obviously because this appeal board is a little bit inconvenient to the Board of Works it is cast out.  Even if it is inconvenient to the Board of Works, I submit that there is a responsibility on us to ensure that no injustice will be done in any circumstances to any individual or group of individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The mere fact of the appeal board being there will have a good effect, in my opinion.  It will make people do their work in a manner that will not be questioned because they will be conscious all the time that an appeal <Col N="461" /> board is in existence.  I venture to prophesy that if this appeal board is established &mdash; if this amendment is agreed to &mdash; it will be a rare thing to find an appeal to that board.  The individual has to satisfy the county council and the county council must be satisfied that there is some merit in the case.  The county council has to accept responsibility for the maintenance of a particular stream.  If the council decide that the stream should be done by the drainage authority rather than the individual, they will incur a charge for maintenance.</P>
    <P>Taking all the factors into account, and considering the responsibility that is on us to protect, above all, individuals' rights, some sort of safeguard must be put in.  Here we are not putting in a safeguard, but we are creating an absolute autocracy, and that is what I object to.</P>
    <P>If anyone goes to the trouble of studying past legislation he will realise the point I have in mind.  Take the Diseases of Animals Act, where you provide a valuer to value animals that are destroyed in the interests of the health of the cattle population.  That valuer values stock and there is a right of appeal, but it is rarely used.  At the same time the valuer is conscious of the fact that the individual has the right of appeal and, therefore, he makes sure his work is efficiently done. If you were to remove that right, that man would walk in with a completely different mentality.  He would approach the farmer like an autocrat, knowing he could treat him as he liked and assess whatever value he liked. The safeguard that is suggested is vital if we are to protect individuals' interests.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Hughes has explained, this appeal board was recommended very strongly by the Drainage Commission.  The Parliamentary Secretary is at a loss to know what they could do if the appeal board was set up.  The commission recommended that an appeal board be set up to settle any disputes which might be referred to it by the Minister for Finance.  I suggest that a dispute might arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="462" /> The Parliamentary Secretary is perturbed that if he accepts this amendment he will bring something into the Bill which will make for delay.  As I understand him, the policy of the Board of Works will be to expend a certain limited sum over a long period of years.  This is a long-term policy and he mentioned a figure of £250,000 as in or about the figure which it is proposed to expend annually on drainage works.  There cannot be any question of delay if that is the policy of the Board of Works.</P>
    <P>I do not know in what order of priority they will take up drainage works in the country, or where they will begin, but it is quite obvious that if, in the first year, they spend £250,000, and so on in subsequent years, the Board of Works and the county councils will have ample opportunity for the discussion of schemes. If I am correct in interpreting that to be the policy of the Board of Works, then there is no substance in the Parliamentary Secretary's contention that the insertion of this amendment will make for delay.  I ask him in all seriousness to consider this amendment favourably.  Surely the county councils, who have to foot the bill in relation to maintenance, ought to have some rights in this matter.  The Board of Works endeavour to force a scheme down their throats, but they are to be given no right even to voice their grievances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Coogan is not right in assuming that it is the policy of the Board of Works to spend any specified amount on this problem of drainage.  He would be right if he said that the Parliamentary Secretary gave a quotation from the report of the Drainage Commission in which they said, after an examination of the problem, that £250,000 was about the largest figure that such an organisation as they recommended would be able to expend annually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Harris hit the nail on the head as to what was likely to occur if this amendment were accepted.  I have just asked some of the officials of the Board of Works what was the number of miles of main rivers and arteries that were dealt with on the Brosna, <Col N="463" /> the survey in respect of which is completed. Roughly, the number of miles is in the neighbourhood of 600.  It is all very well to stand up here and say the Drainage Commission recommended an appeal board.  An appeal board looked very good to me.  It is all very well for Deputies to say individuals' rights must be protected, but it is the duty of those charged with taking this Bill through the House to follow up each amendment and see what effect it is likely to have.  The idea of an appeal board seemed all right to me.</P>

      <P>The county surveyor will advise the county council.  Most of us have been members of county councils. Some farmer in my area writes to me and tells me that the scheme as published and exhibited in the courthouse does not include a certain drain that serves some land of his and some land of some neighbour.  How many such requests would come as a result of the acceptance of this amendment?  How <Col N="464" /> many such requests would come to the local authorities that are functioning in the area of the Brosna, where we have dealt with 600 miles of river? How many little streams and arteries? Hundreds and hundreds of these in a particular district would be left out of the scheme as ultimately prepared.  No matter how complete or how elaborate the scheme, there would still be hundreds of little streams that in the opinion of farmers, should have been included.  They will send in their protest to the local authority.  Is it seriously suggested that the county surveyor will rush out and will apply himself to this matter, knowing that it is not one which concerns him very vitally?  Will he not be likely to say: &ldquo;Well, there is an appeal board there. Those people are objecting.  Why should I say that it is not necessary that this piece of river or stream be included?  I will let it go before the appeal board&rdquo;?  If I were county surveyor, that is what I would do. Why should I take on myself, as county surveyor, responsibility to tell two or three farmers in the county in which I was working that they would not get the opportunity, however remote, to succeed by going before the appeal board?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have invited the House and I am inviting Deputies to follow up the implications attaching to the acceptance of an amendment like this.  I say that that procedure is entirely unworkable. If we were not making provision for meeting the case of people who had reason to complain because of injury which resulted from the carrying out of a drainage scheme by the Board of Works.  I could understand this House insisting upon the right to appoint some qualified person to determine the extent to which damage was done and to assess the amount of compensation <Col N="465" /> to which those people were entitled.  But those speakers who appear to be so kindly disposed to the recommendation of the Drainage Commission which said that an appeal board should be set up must remember that that commission also suggested that the occupiers of land benefiting under a scheme should pay 70 per cent. of the value of the improvement that would result to the land from the carrying out of the work.  We are not accepting that recommendation either. We are relieving those farmers of the payment of that 70 per cent., and we are accepting that as a responsibility of the taxpayer.  I have been asked to show reasons why the Commission made such a recommendation as this.  After having decided that the owner of the land which had benefited as a result of the carrying out of a drainage scheme would have to pay 70 per cent. of the improvement, I could understand a member of the commission saying: &ldquo;Well, in those circumstances, in order to make the fall a little bit easy perhaps it would be better to give them an appeal board&rdquo;.  I am not suggesting that, even if this Bill were to contain an acceptance of the recommendation of the Commission in relation to the payment by the beneficiaries, the idea of an appeal board would be accepted, but, when we have dropped the recommendation that they should contribute to the extent of 70 per cent. of the improvement to their land, surely that is a further reason why the suggestion about the appeal board should not be urged.</P>
      <P>If I could see that this appeal board was a practical proposition, that it could possibly serve a useful purpose, and that it would not unduly clog the machine, I would not have anything at all to say against it.  But this amendment and every other amendment which has been put down here must be examined by us, first of all, to see if there is any real necessity for them, and secondly, to see what effect their acceptance would have upon what is the desire of every member of this House who has any association with rural Ireland or who knows anything about the enormity of this problem of drainage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="466" /> If there are people here in this House who would try to force me by all types of argument and all types of accusation to accept amendments which would result in slowing down the progress that we should all like to make in relation to this problem, then I must resist those amendments so long as I am satisfied that no real injustice can result to anybody as a result of my taking that course.</P>
    <P>Section 48 has been mentioned, but there is really no occasion to drag Section 48 into this discussion at all. When we were having our Second Reading debate here, I was suspicious of Section 48.  Although I was very anxious to accept the recommendation of the Drainage Commission, when I saw Section 48 I did not like it. Because I did not like it, I drew the particular attention of the House to it, in the hope that I would get from members of the House some suitable amendments which would enable us to accept the whole principle underlying the recommendations in the Commission's report without doing any injustice to any individual farmer.  We have now put down Government amendments, and we can deal with them as they come along.  When the House has disposed of them, we will have a new Section 48, and we will then have machinery by which none of the possible injustices to which Deputy Hughes and other speakers have referred can arise.  There is provision there for having the matters in dispute between the drainage authority and the individual concerned referred to an arbitrator.  As I have said, if it were a question of our doing some injury to a farmer or group of farmers, without making proper provision to ensure that a man technically qualified to assess the amount of the damage would be there to protect those men and their interests, I could understand the protestations that have come up here as to what this drainage authority might do.</P>
    <P>There must be finality somewhere. The appeals board that is suggested here &mdash; even as Deputy Allen has said, one member to be appointed by the Commissioners of Public Works, one to <Col N="467" /> be a judge of the High Court and one to be nominated by the General Council of County Councils &mdash; does not contain an expert.  How will they get information as to the condition or the size of a drain down on the Brosna? How will they get information as to a stream on the Glyde or the Dee, the Blackwater or the Erne?  Where will they get the technical assistance and advice?  Deputy Roddy has said we are, because of our circumstances, not well supplied with technical men to deal with this drainage problem.  If the drainage authority provided for here has not got that technical knowledge to which Deputy Roddy referred, how will this appeal board get that knowledge?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Where will it get the special technical knowledge that is not available to the drainage authority? No matter from what angle you examine this amendment, you can see that it is not practicable.  If a farmer goes to a county council to advocate his case, surely men from all parts of the county do not know his district and do not know about that field or this river.  The county council may be asked to make some comment and will not want to deprive the man of the right to go before the appeal tribunal and they will say: &ldquo;Why should we vote against this man, who is a neighbour of ours?  We will let him have his appeal and have a show-down with the tribunal.&rdquo;  As a result, in the Brosna area, in which 600 miles of river are dealt with, in that one area I am positive, if this amendment is accepted, we will have hundreds of appeal cases.  The time and energies of the drainage authority, the appeal board and of all the officials, engineers and architects associated with these authorities will be frittered away uselessly in dealing with an alleged hardship that I contend could scarcely ever arise.</P>

      <P>He gives that as a reason why we should not put in the necessary safeguards.  That is all the more reason why we should have safeguards &mdash; that our technical advisers are lacking in the necessary experience and knowledge to deal with these matters.  It is all the more reason why we should provide the machinery necessary to ensure that the individuals interested are safeguarded.  The Parliamentary Secretary says it is unworkable. I say it is not unworkable, but that from the Commissioner's point of view, an appeal board is inconvenient and from the bureaucrat's point of view any inconvenience must be wiped out of the way.  That is the reason why we are not prepared to implement this as it stands.  That is the reason why the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister for Finance are not prepared to implement the recommendations made by the Drainage Commission set up by the Government to examine this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary pointed out that we were not implementing the recommendations of the Commission in regard to beneficiaries having up to 70 per cent. of the improved value and that that was another reason why we could not have an appeal board.  Arbitration on this particular matter we are arguing about arises only where there is no drainage done in a district, where the Commissioners decide that a particular drain is not an arterial drain and ought to be omitted.  That particular man does not get his stream done.  At the same time, he is asked, through his rates, to pay the maintenance of the remaining part of the catchment area in which the work is carried out, so the very argument the Parliamentary Secretary advances is an argument against himself.  Here you are imposing on the individual a full charge, through the county-at-large charge for maintenance of the remaining portion of the works, while his particular area is omitted from the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="469" /> The Parliamentary Secretary admits that mistakes can arise, that even experts in the Department are only human and can make mistakes and that it is quite possible that streams which are not arterial streams could be omitted.  At the same time, on a plea of expedition, he simply throws safeguards to the winds, so far as the individual is concerned.  I submit to the House that it is our responsibility here, regardless of the inconvenience to the drainage authority, to safeguard the individual and, particularly, the small farmer down the country, who has no finance or ability to defend himself.</P>
    <P>I submit, furthermore, that if safeguards of this sort are put in, it will ensure very careful and close examination by the commissioners, to see that no scheme, where it could be argued that such a stream is an arterial drain, will be left out.  The mere fact that they are going to do their work with great care and anxiety, to ensure that there will be no possibility of an appeal on it or of sustaining the case on appeal, will mean that there will rarely be an appeal.  For that reason, if the Parliamentary Secretary is not prepared to meet us, we will be reluctantly forced to press the matter.  I do not wish to occupy the House unduly by pressing for a division, but we will be forced to divide the House on this matter.  I might ask one categorical question of the Parliamentary Secretary.  Where is the safeguard, so far as the individual is concerned, that will ensure that justice is done?  If he can show me that the individual's rights are safeguarded, I am prepared to withdraw the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to point out <Col N="470" /> the danger which lies in the line of argument which the Parliamentary Secretary has advanced.  He says this amendment would cause considerable inconvenience and would delay the work of the central drainage board. He could use the very same arguments against having this House here at all to consider this Bill.  A Bill of this kind could be drafted by the Department and enacted as an Emergency Powers Order, without any of the delay which we have been experiencing to-day in debating this point. Surely nobody will suggest, however, that legislation by the permanent officials of the State is desirable in the national interest?  Yet that is what he is definitely leading up to, if we are not to have some check, some safeguard, to protect the interests of the ordinary people in connection with the administration of this Bill.  Why should we have any safeguards at all, such as are provided by democratic institutions as this?</P>
      <P>Deputy Allen went further and said there must be finality somewhere, and that it is better to have finality at the beginning.  That is an extraordinary argument.  It is like suggesting that the Civic Guard who arrests a man on a serious charge should have power to decide the case and commit him to prison or execute him.  The finality in a matter of this kind, where there is a dispute between a democratically elected local body and the central power, should lie with an impartial, disinterested body, which would hear the arguments of both sides and decide the case on its merits.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1) (a), line 57, page 5, before the word &ldquo;any&rdquo; to insert the following words &ldquo;such land proposed to be drained or improved as a result of such drainage scheme or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary may be able to give me information as to whether the word &ldquo;easement&rdquo; at the bottom of page 5 covers the proposal in my amendment.  I want to make sure that the people who benefit will be notified.  The section sets out the people who must be served with notice: &ldquo;Every person named in such drainage scheme as a reputed proprietor, owner or rated or other occupier of any land proposed to be compulsorily acquired or substantially interfered with or of any easement&rdquo;, etc.</P>

      <P>I submit that the word &ldquo;easement&rdquo; compels the Department to serve notice, because when you do anything to a drain which improves a farm, you are bestowing an easement on the occupier.  I do not know exactly what is the legal meaning of &ldquo;easement&rdquo;. If it is the intention of the commissioners not to notify people other than those mentioned in the section whose land has been compulsorily acquired or interfered with, I submit that that is not sufficient, and that, having used the word &ldquo;easement&rdquo;, the obligation devolves upon you of notifying everybody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I understand the term easement, it means, for instance, that where an engineer comes to a bend in a river, he can make a straight cut through, so as to effect an easement.  The Deputy's contention could not be carried to the point that it would be necessary to serve notice in cases where the work merely consisted of skimming the sides of the bank of the river, because you were in a sense creating an easement for the water.  There will be hundreds of farms where the land will be relieved of flooding but where you will not even touch the land to that extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that the word &ldquo;easement&rdquo; will oblige you to inform every individual affected, because the moment you touch a stream to clean it, without coming to the bend at all, from the farmer's point of view that is an easement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would accept this amendment, the object of which is to include the Minister for Local Government amongst other Ministers who may be consulted in this matter.  The necessity for the amendment is perhaps greater than would appear from the wording.  As I pointed out before, one of the defects of this Bill is that there is no opportunity to establish a link between local bodies and the board.  No provision is made in that respect.  For instance, in Section 5 it is not made obligatory on the board to accept the recommendations of the local council. At no other point in the Bill do I see any opportunity of establishing a link between the board and the local council. They have even gone so far as to ignore the head of the Local Government Department, the Minister for Local Government, who would be the Minister in closest contact with local bodies.  I move that he be included in <Col N="475" /> the list of Ministers who shall be consulted in regard to drainage.</P>

      <P>Other Ministers are also left out, but if it could conceivably arise that their interests will be affected in any case, we must have consultation with them, and the fact that they are not specifically mentioned does not rule that out.  The reason that the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Agriculture are specifically mentioned is that we shall probably be interfering with canals and waterways in the one case and with fisheries in the other case.  The fact that these Ministers are mentioned and that other Ministers are omitted does not mean that we shall be relieved of the necessity of consulting other Ministers if it should happen in any case that the activities of these Ministers' Departments will be affected in any way by the carrying out of any particular work.</P>

    <P>This is, again, on the principle of preserving the power and authority of the people.  I cannot understand why a bureaucratic body should be vested with the control and authority we propose to give them here.  Again, why should the Minister exercise such autocratic power?  What particular qualifications has the Minister, or the Parliamentary Secretary for that matter, to decide and O.K. a scheme?  The Parliamentary Secretary, a moment ago, asked what did the local authority know about drainage?  Why, my goodness, many of the people on the local bodies know a great deal about drainage.  I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary knows something about drainage, but you might find a man in such a position who might not know anything about it, and who is to advise him?</P>

      <P>Well, I think that Deputy Allen is almost always here. Sometimes he may answer to the crack of the whip but he turns up all the same.  I think, however, that this whole conception is too bureaucratic and autocratic, and that is why I put down this amendment.  I am not saying that it is the ideal thing, but having failed ignominiously in getting the Parliamentary Secretary to ensure in a democratic way that the rights of the <Col N="477" /> people would be preserved and that the rights of the people charged with this scheme of national drainage would not be vested in the Civil Service, I am asking that such a scheme should be submitted to both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure he would not regard as sensible the idea that a scheme, before being sanctioned, should be submitted to both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Again, I say that the best way and, apparently, the only way of denouncing a scheme, if it is found to be unsatisfactory &mdash; if the engineers who designed it, in the opinion of those who know best, have not included rivers which should be included &mdash; would be on the occasion of the annual Estimate brought forward in this House.  I think that that is the best safeguard that this House could reasonably ask for.  I could not at all undertake that we should go any further.</P>

      <P>The attitude of the Parliamentary Secretary on Second Reading was that he vigorously opposed any suggestion that this power should be vested in a body of the people concerned in this matter, and that he believed in a bureaucratic institution to carry out national drainage in this country.  Having failed to convince him that we should have democratic control, I was forced to put down this amendment, that the scheme should be submitted to this House before being undertaken.  The Minister can put down whether he has any qualifications or not.  Where does he get the advice as to whether a scheme is good or bad?  Has he not to follow slavishly what the engineers <Col N="478" /> and experts of the Board of Works recommend? We are providing no other machinery for him, but there are some practical and useful men in this country who know something about drainage.</P>

      <P>I will draw the Parliamentary Secretary's attention and the attention of the House &mdash; and I have done so already &mdash; to the Report of the Vocational Organisation Commission, which was recently published.  Some of its members were particularly interested in Fianna Fáil, but they vigorously condemned this type of bureaucratic legislation, and yet here we are pursuing that very type of legislation and are handing this whole matter over to a bureaucratic body.  If we are to continue that policy, we will create in the end an intolerable position in this country.  I hope we all disapprove of the totalitarian idea but, mind you, we are creating such a totalitarian position here, where the bureaucrats are being given absolute control, and we will have no say at all in the matter.</P>

In following that line of argument, the Deputy was completely refuting the statement of the Parliamentary Secretary when he said that all those matters could be debated by the House when the Estimate for the Department is under consideration.  Now, either the Parliamentary Secretary or Deputy Allen must be wrong, and they should try to settle this question between them.  If we can debate this question thoroughly on the Estimate for the Department, then we will have the same kind of discussion of detail that we could have if we were to debate it when the scheme is put into operation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Section, I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider the operation of paragraph (c) of sub-section (2) which, in my opinion, will have the effect of penalising the action taken in previous years by progressive local authorities.  In those years they operated drainage schemes, and in doing so incurred heavy capital liability in many cases. They are to be penalised now as against the county councils that simply sat back and did nothing, so far as drainage is concerned.  In counties where no drainage work has been done the cost of schemes carried out in the future will become a national charge, but in the case of those county councils that initiated and carried through drainage schemes the charge relating to them is to remain a local one under this Bill.  In my opinion, that is a tax on progress, and I am hoping that the Parliamentary Secretary will see it in that light: that he will look into the matter and see what can be done to remedy that situation. In regard to future drainage schemes, the State is taking over full responsibility for the cost.  Therefore, I submit that a certain amount of injustice is being done to the county councils which in the past were progressive and energetic in attending to <Col N="481" /> drainage work.  I do not know what sum would be involved if the Parliamentary Secretary were to concede the point I am making, but I would ask him to look into it and favourably examine it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must admit that the State is going a very long way in accepting responsibility for the constructional costs of all drainage works in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>But it would be going too far, I think, to ask the State and the taxpayer to shoulder, in addition to that burden, responsibility for meeting outstanding charges relating to drainage works.  There would be no use in my saying that I would give favourable consideration to the Deputy's suggestion because I do not think it would be reasonable to ask the taxpayer to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary admits that there is something in the point that I have advanced.  I see, of course, his point that the sum required to tackle national drainage is going to be very considerable.  I do not know what sum would be required to relieve the local rates from this charge that I speak of, but, under the Bill as it stands, the Parliamentary Secretary is putting progressive people in the position that they are going to have to continue to bear their present burdens.  It is logical, surely, to argue that if people who were not prepared to do their job in the past are not to be taxed in respect of new schemes, that the people who were progressive in the past should be relieved of their present burdens.  I can see that the Parliamentary Secretary's difficulty is a financial one.  I wonder if he could tell me what amount is involved in this particular matter that I am urging?</P>

The Deputy has spoken of injustices.  Take counties where hospitals were erected before the Hospitals Trust Fund was set up, or people who, by reason of their hard work and industry, have deprived themselves of the receipt of the old age pension, or people who earned such incomes that they are taxable, you have in all these cases, if you like to call them such, certain kinds of injustices.</P>
